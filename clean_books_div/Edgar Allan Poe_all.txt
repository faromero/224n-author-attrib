the complete poetical works of <name> <name> poe by <name> h. <unk> preface .
in placing before the public this collection of <name> poe 's poetical works , it is requisite to point out in what respects it differs from , and is superior to , the numerous collections which have preceded it .
until recently , all editions , whether american or english , of <unk> poems have been <unk> ' <unk> of the first <unk> collection , published at new york in 1850 .
in 1874 i began drawing attention to the fact that unknown and <unk> poetry by <name> poe was in existence .
most , if not all , of the specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted by different editors and publishers , but the present is the first occasion on which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf .
besides the poems thus alluded to , this volume <name> be found to contain many additional pieces and extra stanzas , nowhere else published or included in poe 's works .
such verses have been gathered from printed or manuscript sources during a research extending over many years .
in addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume , attention should , also , be <unk> on behalf of the notes , which <name> be found to contain much matter , interesting both from biographical and <unk> points of view .

during the last few years every incident in the life of <name> poe has been subjected to microscopic investigation .
the result has not been altogether satisfactory .
on the one hand , envy and prejudice have magnified every blemish of his character into crime , whilst on the other , blind admiration would <unk> him as far " too good for human nature 's daily food . "
let us endeavor to judge him impartially , granting that he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality , but that he was tempted sorely , treated badly , and suffered deeply .
the poet 's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining some of the <unk> of his character .
his father , <name> poe , was of <unk> extraction .
educated for the bar , he elected to abandon it for the stage .
in one of his tours through the chief towns of the united states he met and married a young actress , <name> <name> , member of an english family distinguished for its musical talents .
as an actress , <name> poe acquired some reputation , but became even better known for her domestic virtues .
in those days the united states afforded little scope for dramatic energy , so it is not surprising to find that when her husband died , after a few years of married life , the young widow had a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones , <name> <name> , <name> , and <name> .
before her premature death , in december , 1811 , the poet 's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the <name> of her neighbors .
<name> , the second child of <name> and <name> poe , was born at boston , in the united states , on the 19th of <name> , 1809 .
upon his mother's death at richmond , <name> , <name> was adopted by a wealthy scotch merchant , <name> <name> .
mr. <name> , who had married an american <name> and settled in <name> , was childless .
he therefore took naturally to the brilliant and beautiful little boy , treated him as his son , and made him take his own <unk> .
<name> <name> , as he was now styled , after some elementary tuition in richmond , was taken to england by his adopted parents , and , in <unk> , placed at the manor house school , <unk> .
under the rev .
dr. <unk> , the future poet spent a <unk> of his life neither <unk> nor , apparently , <unk> .
dr. <unk> , who is himself so quaintly portrayed in poe 's tale of <unk> <name> ' , described " <name> <name> , " by which name only he knew the lad , as " a quick and clever boy , " who " would have been a very good boy had he not been spoilt by his parents , " meaning , of course , the <unk> .
they " allowed him an extravagant amount of <unk> , which enabled him to get into all manner of mischief .
still i liked the boy , " added the tutor , " but , poor fellow , his parents spoiled him . "
poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story of <unk> <name> ' .
probably there is the usual amount of poetic exaggeration in these reminiscences , but they are almost the only record we have of that portion of his career and , therefore , apart from their literary merits , are on that account deeply interesting .
the description of the sleepy old london suburb , as it was in those days , is remarkably accurate , but the <unk> which the story of <unk> <name> ' went through before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the author 's details to deviate widely from their original correctness .
his schoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an " old , irregular , and <unk> " dwelling , and so it remained until its destruction a few years ago .
the <unk> ' <name> <name> , referring to those bygone happy days spent in the english academy , says , " the teeming <name> of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it .
the morning 's awakening , the nightly summons to bed ; the <unk> , the recitations , the periodical <unk> and <unk> , the playground , with its <unk> , its <unk> , its intrigues  these , by a mental sorcery long forgotten , were made to involve a wilderness of sensation , a world of <name> incident , a universe of varied emotion , of excitement the most passionate and <unk> , 'oh , <name> bon <unk> , que ce <unk> de fer !
' "  from this world of boyish imagination poe was called to his adopted parents ' home in the united states .
he returned to <name> in 1821 , and was speedily placed in an academy in richmond , <name> , in which city the <unk> continued to reside .
already well grounded in the elementary processes of education , not without reputation on account of his european residence , handsome , proud , and regarded as the heir of a wealthy man , poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by his fellow pupils .
he speedily made himself a prominent position in the school , not only by his classical attainments , but by his athletic feats  accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads .
" in the simple school athletics of those days , when a gymnasium had not been heard of , he was <unk> <unk> ' , " is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil , colonel t. l. <name> .
poe he remembers as " a swift runner , a wonderful <unk> , and , what was more rare , a boxer , with some slight training ... .
he would allow the strongest boy in the school to strike him with full force in the chest .
he taught me the secret , and i imitated him , after my measure .
it was to <unk> the lungs to the uttermost , and at the moment of receiving the blow to <unk> the air .
it looked surprising , and was , indeed , a little rough ; but with a good <unk> , and some resolution , it was not difficult to stand it .
for swimming he was noted , being in many of his athletic <unk> surprisingly like <name> in his youth . "
in one of his feats poe only came off second best .
" a challenge to a foot race , " says colonel <name> , " had been passed between the two classical schools of the city ; we selected poe as our champion .
the race came off one bright may morning at sunrise , in the capitol square .
historical truth compels me to add that on this occasion our school was beaten , and we had to pay up our small bets .
poe ran well , but his competitor was a long-legged , <unk> fellow , who would have <unk> <unk> without the help of the golden apples . "
" in our latin exercises in school , " continues the colonel , " poe was among the first  not first without dispute .
we had competitors who fairly disputed the palm , especially one , nat <name> , afterwards known as one of the <unk> scholars in <name> , and distinguished also as a profound lawyer .
if <name> was less brilliant than poe , he was far more studious ; for even then the germs of <unk> were developing in the nascent poet , and even then no inconsiderable portion of his time was given to <unk> .
but if i put <name> as a <unk> on a level with poe , i do him full justice . "
" poe , " says the colonel , " was very fond of the odes of <name> , and repeated them so often in my hearing that i learned by sound the words of many before i understood their meaning .
in the <unk> rhythm of the <unk> and <unk> , his ear , as yet <unk> in more complicated harmonies , took special delight .
two odes , in particular , have been humming in my ear all my life since , set to the tune of his recitation : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pater , et <unk> , ' and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> ,  ' etc .
" i remember that poe was also a very fine french scholar .
yet , with all his <unk> , he was not the master spirit nor even the favorite of the school .
i assign , from my recollection , this place to <name> .
poe , as i recall my impressions now , was <unk> , capricious , inclined to be imperious , and , though of generous impulses , not steadily kind , nor even amiable ; and so what he would exact was refused to him .
i add another thing which had its influence , i am sure .
at the time of which i speak , richmond was one of the most aristocratic cities on this side of the atlantic ... . a school is , of its nature , democratic ; but still boys <name> unconsciously bear about the odor of their fathers ' notions , good or bad .
of <name> poe , " who had then resumed his parental <unk> , " it was known that his parents had been players , and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is bestowed upon an adopted son .
all this had the effect of making the boys decline his leadership ; and , on looking back on it since , i fancy it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had . "
this last paragraph of colonel <name> 's recollections cast a suggestive light upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad 's early life and tended to blight his prospective hopes .
although mixing with members of the best families of the province , and naturally endowed with hereditary and native pride ,  <unk> by the indulgence of wealth and the consciousness of intellectual superiority ,  <name> poe was made to feel that his parentage was obscure , and that he himself was dependent upon the <name> and <name> of an alien by blood .
for many lads these things would have had but little meaning , but to one of poe 's proud temperament it must have been a source of constant torment , and all allusions to it gall and <unk> .
and mr. <name> was not the man to <unk> poe from such <unk> fancies : as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented boy , and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase , but at other times he treated him with <unk> , and made him feel the bitterness of his position .
still poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that virginian academy , and several still living have favored us with reminiscences of him .
his feats in swimming to which colonel <name> has alluded , are quite a feature of his youthful career .
colonel mayo records one daring performance in <unk> which is thoroughly characteristic of the lad .
one day in <unk> , when standing on the banks of the <name> river , poe dared his comrade into jumping in , in order to swim to a certain point with him .
after floundering about in the nearly frozen stream for some time , they reached the piles upon which mayo 's bridge was then supported , and there attempted to rest and try to gain the shore by climbing up the log <unk> to the bridge .
upon reaching the bridge , however , they were dismayed to find that its plank flooring <unk> the <unk> by several feet , and that it was impossible to ascend it .
nothing remained for them but to let go their slippery hold and swim back to the shore .
poe reached the bank in an exhausted and benumbed condition , whilst mayo was rescued by a boat just as he was <unk> .
on getting ashore poe was seized with a violent attack of vomiting , and both lads were ill for several weeks .
alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own , the poet remarked , " any <unk> in the falls ' in my days would have swum the hellespont , and thought nothing of the matter .
i swam from <unk> wharf to warwick ( six miles ) , in a hot <name> sun , against one of the strongest tides ever known in the river .
it would have been a feat comparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water .
i would not think much , " poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him , " of attempting to swim the british channel from dover to calais . "
colonel mayo , who had tried to accompany him in this performance , had to stop on the way , and says that poe , when he reached the goal , emerged from the water with neck , face , and back blistered .
the facts of this feat , which was undertaken for a wager , having been questioned , poe , ever <unk> of contradiction , obtained and published the <unk> of several gentlemen who had witnessed it .
they also certified that poe did not seem at all fatigued , and that he walked back to richmond immediately after the performance .
the poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been slight in figure and person , but to have been well made , active , <unk> , and graceful .
despite the fact that he was thus noted among his <unk> and indulged at home , he does not appear to have been in sympathy with his surroundings .
already <unk> with the " hate of hate , the scorn of scorn , " he appears to have made foes both among those who envied him and those whom , in the pride of <unk> , he treated with pugnacious contempt .
beneath the haughty exterior , however , was a warm and passionate heart , which only needed circumstance to call forth an almost <unk> intensity of affection .
a <unk> instance of this is thus related by mrs. <unk> : " while at the academy in richmond , he one day accompanied a schoolmate to his home , where he saw , for the first time , mrs. <name> <unk> , the mother of his young friend .
this <name> , on entering the room , took his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome , which so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him of the power of speech , and for a time almost of consciousness itself .
he returned home in a dream , with but one thought , one <name> in life  to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the desolate world so beautiful to him , and filled his lonely heart with the oppression of a new <name> .
this <name> afterwards became the confidant of all his boyish sorrows , and hers was the one <unk> influence that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and passionate youth . "
when <name> was unhappy at home , which , says his aunt , mrs. <unk> , " was very often the case , he went to mrs. <unk> for sympathy , for consolation , and for advice . "
unfortunately , the sad fortune which so frequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship .
the <name> was overwhelmed by a terrible calamity , and at the period when her guiding voice was most requisite , she fell a prey to mental <unk> .
she died , and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery , but her poor boyish admirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in her vaulted home , so he would leave the house at night and visit her tomb .
when the nights were drear , " when the autumnal rains fell , and the winds wailed mournfully over the graves , he lingered longest , and came away most regretfully . "
the memory of this <name> , of this " one idolatrous and purely ideal love " of his boyhood , was cherished to the last .
the name of <name> frequently <unk> in his youthful verses , " the <unk> , " now first included in his poetical works , refers to her ; and to her he inscribed the classic and exquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning " <name> , thy beauty is to me . "
another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he was already a poet .
among his <unk> he appears to have acquired some little reputation as a writer of <unk> verses ; but of his poetry , of that which , as he declared , had been with him " not a purpose , but a passion , " he probably preserved the secret , especially as we know that at his <unk> home <unk> was a forbidden thing .
as early as 1821 he appears to have essayed various pieces , and some of these were ultimately included in his first volume .
with poe poetry was a personal matter  a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart found an outlet .
with feelings such as were his , it came to pass , as a matter of course , that the youthful poet fell in love .
his first affair of the heart is , doubtless , <unk> portrayed in what he says of his boyish ideal , <name> .
this passion , he remarks , " if passion it can properly be called , was of the most thoroughly romantic , shadowy , and imaginative character .
it was born of the hour , and of the youthful necessity to love .
it had no peculiar regard to the person , or to the character , or to the <unk> affection ... any maiden , not immediately and positively repulsive , " he <unk> would have suited the occasion of frequent and <unk> intercourse with such an imaginative and poetic youth .
" the result , " he <unk> , " was not merely natural , or merely probable ; it was as inevitable as <name> itself . "
between the lines may be read the history of his own love .
" the <unk> of his dreams  the <name> aphrodite that sprang in full and <unk> loveliness from the bright foam upon the <unk> ocean of his thoughts , " was a little girl , <name> <unk> , who lived with her father in a house opposite to the <unk> in richmond .
the young people met again and again , and the <name> , who has only recently passed away , recalled <name> as " a beautiful boy , " passionately fond of music , enthusiastic and impulsive , but with prejudices already strongly developed .
a certain amount of <unk> took place between the young people , and poe , with his usual passionate energy , ere he left home for the university had persuaded his fair <unk> to engage herself to him .
poe left home for the university of <name> , <unk> , in the beginning of <unk> lie wrote frequently to miss <unk> , but her father did not approve of the affair , and , so the story runs , intercepted the correspondence , until it ceased .
at seventeen , <name> became the bride of a mr. <name> , and it was not until some time afterwards that poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had failed to <unk> any response from the object of his youthful affection .
poe 's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his course at the richmond academy .
he became noted at <unk> both for his athletic feats and his <unk> successes .
he entered as a student on february <unk> , and remained till the close of the second session in december of that year .
" he entered the schools of ancient and modern languages , attending the lectures on latin , greek , french , spanish , and italian .
i was a member of the last three classes , " says mr. <name> <unk> , the recently deceased librarian , " and can testify that he was tolerably regular in his attendance , and a successful student , having obtained distinction at the final examination in latin and french , and this was at that time the highest honor a student could obtain .
the present regulations in regard to degrees had not then been adopted .
under existing regulations , he would have graduated in the two languages above-named , and have been entitled to <unk> . "
these statements of poe 's <unk> are confirmed by dr. <name> , chairman of the faculty , who remarks that the poet was a great favorite with his <unk> , and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with which he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy , his translations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy .
several of poe 's classmates at <unk> have testified to his " <name> qualities " and other good endowments , but they remember that his " disposition was rather retiring , and that he had few intimate associates . "
mr. <name> boiling , one of his <unk> who has favored us with reminiscences of him , says : " i was <unk> ' , with him , but that is about all .
my impression was , and is , that no one could say that he <unk> ' him .
he wore a melancholy face always , and even his smile  for i do not ever remember to have seen him laugh  seemed to be forced .
when he engaged sometimes with others in athletic exercises , in which , so far as high or long jumping , i believe he excelled all the rest , poe , with the same ever sad face , appeared to participate in what was amusement to the others more as a task than sport . "
poe had no little talent for drawing , and mr. <name> <name> states that the walls of his college rooms were covered with his <unk> sketches , whilst mr. boiling mentions , in connection with the poet 's artistic facility , some interesting incidents .
the two young men had purchased copies of a <unk> edition of <name> 's poems , and upon visiting poe a few days after this purchase , mr. <unk> found him engaged in copying one of the engravings with <unk> upon his dormitory ceiling .
he continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time until he had filled all the space in his room with <unk> figures which , it is remembered by those who saw them , were highly ornamental and well executed .
as mr. <unk> talked with his associate , poe would continue to <unk> away with his pencil , as if writing , and when his visitor <unk> remonstrated with him on his want of politeness , he replied that he had been all attention , and proved that he had by suitable comment , assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was trying 'to divide his mind , ' to <name> on a conversation and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time .
mr. <unk> , in his interesting reminiscences of the poet , says : " as librarian i had frequent official intercourse with poe , but it was at or near the close of the session before i met him in the social circle .
after spending an evening together at a private house he invited me , on our return , into his room .
it was a cold night in december , and his fire having gone pretty nearly out , by the aid of some tallow candles , and the fragments of a small table which he broke up for the purpose , he soon <unk> it , and by its comfortable blaze i spent a very pleasant hour with him .
on this occasion he spoke with regret of the large amount of money he had wasted , and of the debts he had contracted during the session .
if my memory be not at fault , he estimated his indebtedness at $ 2,000 and , though they were gaming debts , he was <name> and emphatic in the declaration that he was bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity . "
this appears to have been poe 's last night at the university .
he left it never to return , yet , short as was his sojourn there , he left behind him such honorable memories that his <unk> <unk> ' is now only too proud to <unk> his name among her most respected sons .
poe 's adopted father , however , did not regard his <unk> 's ' <unk> career with equal pleasure : whatever view he may have entertained of the lad 's <unk> successes , he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which , like too many of his classmates , he had incurred .
a violent altercation took place between mr. <name> and the youth , and poe hastily quitted the shelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone .
taking with him such poems as he had ready , poe made his way to boston , and there looked up some of his mother 's old theatrical friends .
whether he thought of adopting the stage as a profession , or whether he thought of getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his own upon the stage ,  that dream of all young authors ,  is now unknown .
he appears to have wandered about for some time , and by some means or the other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed " for private circulation only . "
this was towards the end of 1827 , when he was nearing nineteen .
doubtless poe expected to dispose of his volume by subscription among his friends , but copies did not go off , and ultimately the book was suppressed , and the remainder of the edition , for " reasons of a private nature , " destroyed .
what happened to the young poet , and how he contrived to exist for the next year or so , is a mystery still <unk> .
it has always been believed that he found his way to europe and met with some curious adventures there , and poe himself certainly alleged that such was the case .
<name> of <unk> stories have been invented to account for this chasm in the poet 's life , and most of them <unk> fabulous .
in a recent biography of poe an attempt had been made to prove that he enlisted in the army under an assumed name , and served for about eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner , receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of mr. <name> .
this account is plausible , but <name> need further explanation of its many <unk> of dates , and <unk> of the different documents cited in proof of it , before the public can receive it as fact .
so many fables have been published about poe , and even many fictitious documents quoted , that it <unk> the <unk> to be wary in accepting any new statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated .
on the 28th february , 1829 , mrs. <name> died , and with her death the final thread that had bound poe to her husband was broken .
the adopted son arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had given the <name> residence its only claim upon the poet 's heart .
a kind of truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased <name> , but , for the future , poe found that home was home no longer .
again the young man turned to poetry , not only as a solace but as a means of earning a livelihood .
again he printed a little volume of poems , which included his longest piece , " <name> aaraaf , " and several others now deemed classic .
the book was a great advance upon his previous collection , but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal profit for its author .
feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he saw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a livelihood , poe expressed a wish to enter the army .
after no little difficulty a <unk> was obtained for him at the west point military academy , a military school in many respects equal to the best in europe for the education of officers for the army .
at the time poe entered the academy it possessed anything but an attractive character , the discipline having been of the most severe character , and the accommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads .
the poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his usual enthusiasm , and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the place with unusual steadiness .
he entered the institution on the 1st july , 1830 , and by the following march had been expelled for determined disobedience .
whatever view may be taken of poe 's conduct upon this occasion , it must be seen that the expulsion from west point was of his own seeking .
<unk> pictures have been drawn of his eccentric behavior at the academy , but the fact remains that he wilfully , or at any rate purposely , flung away his <unk> .
it is surmised with plausibility that the second marriage of mr. <name> , and his expressed intention of withdrawing his help and of not <unk> or <unk> this adopted son any of his property , was the <unk> of <unk> action .
believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession so expensive as was a military life , he determined to relinquish it and return to his long cherished attempt to become an author .
expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter , and discarded by his former protector , the unfortunate and penniless young man yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by means of a volume of poetry .
if it be true , as alleged , that several of his brother cadets aided his efforts by <unk> for his little work , there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest venture .
whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid , it is certain that in a short time after leaving the military academy poe was reduced to sad straits .
he disappeared for nearly two years from public notice , and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily explained .
in 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of a <unk> award offered by a newspaper for the best story .
the prize was unanimously <unk> to poe by the <unk> , and mr. kennedy , an author of some little repute , having become interested by the young man 's evident genius , generously assisted him towards obtaining a livelihood by literary labor .
through his new <unk> introduction to the proprietor of the <unk> literary messenger ' , a <unk> magazine published at irregular intervals , poe became first a paid <unk> , and eventually the editor of the publication , which ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable periodicals of the day .
this success was entirely due to the brilliancy and power of poe 's own contributions to the magazine .
in march , 1834 , mr. <name> died , and if our poet had maintained any hopes of further assistance from him , all doubt was settled by the <name> , by which the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and her three sons .
poe was not named .
on the 6th may , 1836 , poe , who now had nothing but his pen to trust to , married his cousin , <name> <unk> , a child of only fourteen , and with her mother as housekeeper , started a home of his own .
in the meantime his various writings in the <unk> ' began to attract attention and to extend his reputation into literary circles , but beyond his editorial salary of about $ 520 brought him no pecuniary reward .
in <name> , 1837 , for reasons never thoroughly explained , poe severed his connection with the <unk> ' , and moved with all his household goods from richmond to new york .
southern friends state that poe was desirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer , or of being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors procured .
in new york his earnings seem to have been small and irregular , his most important work having been a <unk> from the <unk> ' in book form of his <unk> romance entitled <unk> <name> <unk> ' .
the truthful air of " the narrative , " as well as its other merits , excited public curiosity both in england and <name> ; but <unk> <unk> does not appear to have been proportionate to its success , nor did he receive anything from the numerous european editions the work rapidly passed through .
in 1838 poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his new york home and remove with his wife and aunt ( her mother ) to philadelphia .
the quaker city was at that time quite a <unk> for magazine projects , and among the many new periodicals poe was enabled to earn some kind of a living .
to <name> 's <unk> 's magazine ' for 1837 he had contributed a few articles , but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the <unk> .
poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own , and it was probably with a view to such an <unk> that one of his conditions for accepting the <unk> of the <unk> 's <unk> was that his name should appear upon the title-page .
poe worked hard at the <unk> 's ' for some time , contributing to its columns much of his best work ; ultimately , however , he came to <unk> with its proprietor , <name> , who disposed of the magazine to a mr. <name> , a rival publisher .
at this period poe collected into two volumes , and got them published as <unk> of the grotesque and <unk> ' , twenty-five of his stories , but he never received any <unk> , save a few copies of the volumes , for the work .
for some time the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own , but all his efforts failed owing to his want of capital .
the purchaser of <name> 's magazine , having amalgamated it with another , issued the two under the title of <unk> 's magazine ' .
poe became a <unk> to the new venture , and in november of the year 1840 consented to assume the post of editor .
under poe 's management , assisted by the liberality of mr. <name> , <unk> 's magazine ' became a grand success .
to its pages poe contributed some of his finest and most popular tales , and attracted to the publication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors .
the public was not slow in showing its appreciation of <unk> ' put before it , and , so its directors <unk> , in less than two years the circulation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies .
a great deal of this success was due to poe 's weird and wonderful stories ; still more , perhaps , to his <unk> <unk> and his startling theories <unk> <unk> .
as regards the tales now issued in <unk> 's ' , attention may especially be drawn to the <unk> " murders in the rue morgue , " the first of a series  ' " une <unk> de <unk> , " ' as <unk> styles them  illustrative of an <unk> phase of poe 's peculiar mind .
this <unk> ' of tales , of which the later two were " the <unk> letter " and " the mystery of <name> <unk> , " was <unk> written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles of life by identifying another person 's mind by our own .
by trying to follow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing , poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive , as it were , at that person 's conclusions , indeed , penetrate the innermost <unk> of his <name> and read his most secret thoughts .
whilst the public was still pondering over the startling proposition , and enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs , poe still further increased his popularity and <name> attention to his works by putting forward the attractive but less dangerous <unk> that " human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve . "
this <unk> assertion was made in connection with what the public deemed a challenge , and poe was <unk> with <unk> more or less abstruse , demanding solution .
in the correspondence which ensued in <unk> 's magazine ' and other publications , poe was universally acknowledged to have proved his case , so far as his own personal ability to <unk> such mysteries was concerned .
although he had never offered to undertake such a task , he triumphantly solved every <unk> sent to him , with one exception , and that exception he proved conclusively was only an imposture , for which no solution was possible .
the outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the fascinating story of " the gold bug , " a story in which the discovery of hidden treasure is brought about by the <unk> of an intricate cipher .
the year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of poe 's checkered career .
on every side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light , chief editor of a powerful magazine , admired , feared , and envied , with a reputation already spreading rapidly in europe as well as in his native continent , the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness .
but dark <unk> were gnawing his heart .
his pecuniary position was still embarrassing .
his writings , which were the result of slow and careful labor , were poorly paid , and his <unk> as joint editor of <unk> 's ' was small .
he was not permitted to have undivided control , and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered <unk> , whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes , and caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted  to that drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life .
<name> poe 's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made towards the end of his career .
its truth has never been <unk> , and in its most important points it has been thoroughly <unk> .
to a correspondent he writes in <name> 1848 : " you say , 'can you hint to me what was " that terrible evil " which caused the " irregularities " so profoundly lamented ? '
yes , i can do more than hint .
this evil was the greatest which can befall a man .
six years ago , a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before , ruptured a <unk> in singing .
her life was despaired of .
i took leave of her forever , and underwent all the agonies of her death .
she recovered partially , and i again hoped .
at the end of a year , the vessel broke again .
i went through precisely the same scene ... . then again  again  and even once again at varying intervals .
each time i felt all the agonies of her death  and at each accession of the disorder i loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity .
but i am <unk> sensitive  nervous in a very unusual degree .
i became insane , with long intervals of horrible sanity .
during these fits of absolute unconsciousness , i drank  god only knows how often or how much .
as a matter of course , my enemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity .
i had , indeed , nearly abandoned all <name> of a permanent cure , when i found one in the death of my wife .
this i can and do endure as becomes a man .
it was the horrible <unk> oscillation between <name> and despair which i could not longer have endured , without total loss of reason . "
the poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home , superintended by his <unk> guardian , his wife 's mother  his own aunt , mrs. <unk> , the <name> whom he so gratefully addressed in after years in the well-known sonnet , as " more than mother unto me . "
but a change came o'er the spirit of his dream !
his <unk> from <unk> 's ' , owing to we know not what causes , took place , and his fragile schemes of happiness faded as fast as the sunset .
his means melted away , and he became <unk> by mental trouble and <unk> to earn more .
the terrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were reduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from mr. a .
b. <name> 's reminiscences .
referring to the poet 's residence in spring gardens , philadelphia , this writer says : " it was during their stay there that mrs. poe , while singing one evening , ruptured a <unk> , and after that she suffered a hundred deaths .
she could not bear the slightest exposure , and needed the utmost care ; and all those conveniences as to apartment and surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were almost matters of life and death to her .
and yet the room where she lay for weeks , hardly able to breathe , except as she was fanned , was a little narrow place , with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that her head almost touched it .
but no one dared to speak , mr. poe was so sensitive and irritable ; <unk> as steel and flint , ' said one who knew him in those days .
and he would not allow a word about the danger of her dying : the mention of it drove him wild . "
is it to be wondered at , should it not indeed be forgiven him , if , impelled by the anxieties and privations at home , the unfortunate poet , driven to the brink of madness , plunged still deeper into the slough of <unk> ?
unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved wife , the distracted man " would steal out of the house at night , and go off and wander about the street for hours , proud , <unk> , despairing , not knowing which way to turn , or what to do , while mrs. <unk> would endure the anxiety at home as long as she could , and then start off in search of him . "
during his calmer moments poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with his literary labors .
he continued to contribute to <unk> 's magazine , ' the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his life , and also to some other leading publications of philadelphia and new york .
a suggestion having been made to him by n. p. <name> , of the latter city , he determined to once more wander back to it , as he found it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was .
accordingly , about the middle of 1845 , poe removed to new york , and shortly afterwards was engaged by <name> and his partner <name> as <unk> on the <unk> mirror ' .
he was , says <name> , " employed by us for several months as critic and <unk> ... .
he resided with his wife and mother at fordham , a few miles out of town , but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to press .
with the highest admiration for his genius , and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
with his pale , beautiful , and intellectual face , as a reminder of what genius was in him , it was impossible , of course , not to treat him always with deferential <unk> ... . with a prospect of taking the lead in another periodical , he at last voluntarily gave up his employment with us . "
a few weeks before poe relinquished his laborious and <unk> work on the <unk> mirror ' , his marvellous poem of " the <name> " was published .
the effect was magical .
never before , nor , indeed , ever since , has a single short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm .
it did more to render its author famous than all his other writings put together .
it made him the literary lion of the season ; called into existence innumerable <unk> ; was translated into various languages , and , indeed , created quite a literature of its own .
poe was naturally delighted with the success his poem had attained , and from time to time read it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions .
nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of <name> only , and wrote his essay entitled the " philosophy of composition , " to prove that it was merely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set rules .
although our poet 's reputation was now well established , he found it still a difficult matter to live by his pen .
even when in good health , he wrote slowly and with fastidious care , and when his work was done had great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it .
since his death it has been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get either his most admired poems or tales published .
poe left the <unk> mirror ' in order to take part in the <unk> journal ' , wherein he <unk> from time to time nearly the whole of his prose and poetry .
ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical , but , having no funds to <name> it on , after a few months of <unk> labor he had to relinquish it .
exhausted in body and mind , the unfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a quaint little cottage at fordham , outside new york .
here after a time the unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need , not even having wherewith to purchase the necessities of life .
at this dire moment , some friendly hand , much to the indignation and dismay of poe himself , made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family .
the appeal had the desired effect .
old friends and new came to the rescue , and , thanks to them , and especially to mrs. shew , the " <name> <name> " of poe 's later poems , his wife 's dying moments were soothed , and the poet 's own immediate wants provided for .
in <name> , 1846 , <name> poe died ; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an <unk> stupor , and , indeed , it may be truly said that never again did his mental faculties appear to regain their former power .
for another year or so poe lived quietly at fordham , guarded by the watchful care of mrs. <unk> ,  writing little , but thinking out his philosophical prose poem of " eureka , " which he deemed the crowning work of his life .
his life was as <unk> and regular as his means were small .
gradually , however , as intercourse with fellow <unk> <unk> his dormant energies , he began to meditate a fresh start in the world .
his old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a magazine of his own , for the enunciation of his own views on literature , now absorbed all his thoughts .
in order to get the necessary funds for establishing his publication on a solid footing , he determined to give a series of lectures in various parts of the states .
his <unk> into public life only involved him in a series of misfortunes .
at one time he was engaged to be married to mrs. <unk> , a widow <name> of considerable intellectual and literary attainments ; but , after several incidents of a highly romantic character , the match was broken off .
in 1849 poe <unk> the south , and , amid the scenes and friends of his early life , passed some not altogether <unk> time .
at richmond , <name> , he again met his first love , <name> , now a wealthy widow , and , after a short renewed acquaintance , was once more engaged to marry her .
but misfortune continued to dog his steps .
a publishing affair recalled him to new york .
he left richmond by boat for baltimore , at which city he arrived on the 3d october , and handed his trunk to a <name> to <name> to the train for philadelphia .
what now happened has never been clearly explained .
previous to starting on his journey , poe had complained of <unk> ,  of <unk> and of exhaustion ,  and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of these symptoms had tempted him to drink , or to resort to some of those <unk> he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life .
whatever the cause of his delay , the consequences were fatal .
whilst in a state of temporary mania or insensibility , he fell into the hands of a band of ruffians , who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices or victims .
what followed is given on undoubted authority .
his captors carried the unfortunate poet into an <unk> den , where they drugged him with whisky .
it was election day for a member of congress , and poe with other victims , was dragged from <unk> station to station , and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand .
incredible as it may appear , the superintending officials of those days registered the proffered vote , quite regardless of the condition of the person <unk> a <unk> .
the election over , the dying poet was left in the streets to perish , but , being found ere life was extinct , he was carried to the washington university hospital , where he expired on the 7th of october , 1849 , in the <unk> year of his age .
<name> poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather , general poe , in the presence of a few friends and relatives .
on the 17th november , 1875 , his remains were removed from their first resting-place and , in the presence of a large number of people , were placed under a marble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers .
his <unk> body has recently been placed by his side .
the story of that " fitful fever " which constituted the life of <name> poe leaves upon the reader 's mind the conviction that he was , indeed , truly <unk> by that : " unhappy master , whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "

* * * * * preface .
these trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the " rounds of the press . "
i am naturally anxious that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it , if it circulate at all .
in defence of my own taste , nevertheless , it is incumbent upon me to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public , or very creditable to myself .
events not to be controlled have prevented me from making , at any time , any serious effort in what , under happier circumstances , would have been the field of my choice .
with me poetry has been not a purpose , but a passion ; and the passions should be held in reverence : they must not  they can not at <name> be excited , with an eye to the paltry compensations , or the more paltry <unk> , of mankind .

* * * * * the <name> .
once upon a midnight dreary , while i pondered , weak and weary , over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten <name>  while i nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , as of some one gently rapping  rapping at my chamber door .
" 't is some visitor , " i muttered , " tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more . "
ah , distinctly i remember , it was in the bleak december , and each separate dying <unk> wrought its ghost upon the floor .
eagerly i wished the morrow ;  vainly i had sought to borrow from my books <unk> of sorrow  sorrow for the lost <name>  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name>  nameless here for evermore .
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ; so that now , to still the beating of my heart , i stood repeating " 't is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door ;  this it is and nothing more . "
presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer , " sir , " said i , " or madam , truly your forgiveness i implore ; but the fact is i was napping , and so gently you came rapping , and so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door , that i scarce was sure i heard you "  here i opened wide the door :  darkness there and nothing more .
deep into that darkness peering , long i stood there wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before ; but the silence was unbroken , and the darkness gave no token , and the only word there spoken was the whispered word , " <name> ! "
this i whispered , and an <name> murmured back the word , " <name> ! "
merely this and nothing more .
back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning , soon i heard again a tapping , somewhat louder than before .
" surely , " said i , " surely that is something at my window lattice ; let me see , then , what <unk> is , and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment , and this mystery explore ;  't is the wind and nothing more . "
open here i flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter , in there stepped a stately <name> of the saintly days of yore ; not the least obeisance made he : not an instant stopped or stayed he ; but , with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door  perched , and sat , and nothing more .
then this <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling , by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only that one word , as if his soul in that one word he did <unk> .
nothing further then he uttered  not a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered , " other friends have flown before  on the morrow he <name> leave me , as my hopes have flown before . "
then the bird said , " nevermore . "
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken , " doubtless , " said i , " what it utters is its only stock and store , caught from some unhappy master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> the melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "
but the <name> still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling , straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door ; then , upon the <name> sinking , i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy , thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking " nevermore . "
this i sat engaged in guessing , but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom 's core ; this and more i sat <unk> , with my head at ease reclining on the cushion 's <name> lining that the <unk> <unk> o'er , but whose <name> <name> lining with the <unk> <unk> o'er , she shall press , ah , nevermore !
then , methought , the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censer swung by <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the tufted floor .
" wretch , " i cried , " thy god hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee respite  respite <unk> <unk> from thy memories of <name> !
<unk> , oh <unk> this kind <unk> , and forget this lost <name> ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !  whether <unk> sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , desolate yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror haunted  tell me truly , i implore  is there  is there balm in <unk> ?  tell me  tell me , i implore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if , within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" be that word our sign of parting , bird or fiend ! "
i shrieked , <unk>  " get thee back into the tempest and the night 's <unk> shore !
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken !
leave my loneliness unbroken !  quit the bust above my door !
take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming , and the <unk> o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !

the skies they were ashen and sober ; the leaves they were <unk> and sere  the leaves they were withering and sere ; it was night in the lonesome october of my most immemorial year ; it was hard by the dim lake of <unk> , in the <name> mid region of weir  it was down by the dank tarn of <unk> , in the <unk> woodland of weir .
here once , through an alley <unk> .
of cypress , i roamed with my soul  of cypress , with psyche , my soul .
these were days when my heart was volcanic as the <unk> rivers that roll  as the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down <unk> in the ultimate climes of the pole  that groan as they roll down mount <unk> in the realms of the <unk> pole .
our talk had been serious and sober , but our thoughts they were <unk> and sere  our memories were treacherous and sere  for we knew not the month was october , and we marked not the night of the year  ( ah , night of all nights in the year ! )
we noted not the dim lake of <unk>  ( though once we had journeyed down here )  remembered not the dank tarn of <unk> , nor the <unk> woodland of weir .
and now as the night was <unk> and <unk> pointed to morn  as the <unk> hinted of morn  at the end of our path a <unk> and nebulous lustre was born , out of which a miraculous crescent arose with a duplicate horn  <unk> 's <unk> crescent distinct with its duplicate horn .
and i said  " she is warmer than <name> : she rolls through an ether of sighs  she revels in a region of sighs : she has seen that the tears are not dry on these cheeks , where the worm never dies , and has come past the stars of the lion to point us the path to the skies  to the <unk> peace of the skies  come up , in despite of the lion , to shine on us with her bright eyes  come up through the lair of the lion , with love in her luminous eyes . "
but psyche , uplifting her finger , said  " sadly this <name> i mistrust  her pallor i strangely mistrust :  oh , hasten !  oh , let us not linger !
oh , fly !  let us fly !  for we must . "
in terror she spoke , letting sink her wings till they trailed in the dust  in agony sobbed , letting sink her plumes till they trailed in the dust  till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
i replied  " this is nothing but dreaming : let us on by this tremulous light !
let us bathe in this crystalline light !
its <unk> splendor is beaming with <name> and in beauty to-night :  see !  it flickers up the sky through the night !
ah , we safely may trust to its gleaming , and be sure it <name> lead us aright  we safely may trust to a gleaming that can not but guide us aright , since it flickers up to heaven through the night . "
thus i pacified psyche and kissed her , and tempted her out of her gloom  and conquered her scruples and gloom ; and we passed to the end of a vista , but were stopped by the door of a tomb  by the door of a <unk> tomb ; and i said  " what is written , sweet sister , on the door of this <unk> tomb ? "
she replied  " <unk>  <unk>  't is the vault of thy lost <unk> ! "
then my heart it grew ashen and sober as the leaves that were <unk> and sere  as the leaves that were withering and sere ; and i cried  " it was surely october on this very night of last year that i journeyed  i journeyed down here  that i brought a dread burden down here !
on this night of all nights in the year , ah , what demon has tempted me here ?
well i know , now , this dim lake of <unk>  this <name> mid region of weir  well i know , now , this dank tarn of <unk> ,  this <unk> woodland of weir . "

i saw thee once  once only  years ago : i must not say how many  but not many .
it was a july midnight ; and from out a <unk> moon , that , like thine own soul , soaring , sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven , there fell a <unk> veil of light , with <unk> , and <unk> and slumber , upon the <unk> 'd faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden , where no wind dared to stir , unless on tiptoe  fell on the <unk> 'd faces of these roses that gave out , in return for the <unk> , their odorous souls in an ecstatic death  fell on the <unk> 'd faces of these roses that smiled and died in this <unk> , enchanted by thee , and by the poetry of thy presence .
clad all in white , upon a <name> bank i saw thee <unk> ; while the moon fell on the <unk> 'd faces of the roses , and on thine own , <unk> 'd  alas , in sorrow !
was it not fate , that , on this july midnight  was it not fate ( whose name is also sorrow ) , that bade me pause before that <unk> , to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses ?
no footstep stirred : the hated world all slept , save only thee and me  ( o heaven !  o god !
how my heart beats in <unk> those two words ! )
 save only thee and me .
i paused  i looked  and in an instant all things disappeared .
( ah , bear in mind this garden was enchanted ! )
the <name> lustre of the moon went out : the mossy banks and the meandering paths , the happy flowers and the <unk> trees , were seen no more : the very roses ' odors died in the arms of the adoring airs .
all  all expired save thee  save less than thou : save only the divine light in thine eyes  save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes .
i saw but them  they were the world to me .
i saw but them  saw only them for hours  saw only them until the moon went down .
what wild <unk> seemed to lie unwritten upon those crystalline , celestial spheres !
how dark a woe !
yet how sublime a <name> !
how silently serene a sea of pride !
how daring an ambition !
yet how deep  how <unk> a capacity for love !
but now , at length , dear <name> sank from sight , into a western couch of <unk> ; and thou , a ghost , amid the <unk> trees didst glide away .
only thine eyes <unk> they would not go  they never yet have gone .
lighting my lonely pathway home that night , they have not left me ( as my hopes have ) since .
they follow me  they lead me through the years .
they are my ministers  yet i their slave .
their office is to <unk> and <unk>  my duty , to be saved by their bright light , and purified in their electric fire , and sanctified in their elysian fire .
they fill my soul with beauty ( which is <name> ) , and are far up in heaven  the stars i kneel to in the sad , silent watches of my night ; while even in the meridian glare of day i see them still  two sweetly <unk> <unk> , <unk> by the sun !

i was a child and she was a child , in this kingdom by the sea : but we loved with a love that was more than love  i and my <name> <name> ; with a love that the winged <unk> of heaven coveted her and me .
and this was the reason that , long ago , in this kingdom by the sea , a wind blew out of a cloud , chilling my beautiful <name> <name> ; so that her <unk> kinsmen came and bore her away from me , to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea .
the angels , not half so happy in heaven , went <unk> her and me  yes !  that was the reason ( as all men know , in this kingdom by the sea ) that the wind came out of the cloud by night , chilling and killing my <name> <name> .
but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we  of many far wiser than we  and neither the angels in heaven above , nor the demons down under the sea , can ever <unk> my soul from the soul of the beautiful <name> <name> .
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful <name> <name> ; and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes of the beautiful <name> <name> ; and so , all the <unk> , i lie down by the side of my darling , my darling , my life and my bride , in her sepulchre there by the sea  in her tomb by the side of the sea .

for her this rhyme is penned , whose luminous eyes , brightly expressive as the twins of <name> , shall find her own sweet name , that , nestling lies upon the <name> , <unk> from every reader .
search narrowly the lines !  they hold a treasure divine  a <unk>  an amulet that must be worn at heart .
search well the measure  the words  the syllables !
do not forget the <unk> point , or you may lose your labor !
and yet there is in this no <unk> knot which one might not undo without a sabre , if one could merely comprehend the plot .
<unk> upon the leaf where now are peering eyes <unk> soul , there lie <unk> three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing of poets by poets  as the name is a poet 's , too .
its letters , although naturally lying like the knight <unk>  <unk> <unk>  still form a <unk> for truth  cease trying !
you <name> not read the riddle , though you do the best you can do .

" seldom we find , " says <name> <name> dunce , " half an idea in the profoundest sonnet .
through all the flimsy things we see at once as easily as through a naples bonnet  trash of all trash !  how can a <name> <name> it ?
yet heavier far than your <unk> stuff  <unk> nonsense that the faintest puff <unk> into <unk> the while you con it . "
and , <unk> , <name> is right enough .
the general <unk> are <unk> bubbles  <unk> and so transparent  but this is , now  you may depend upon it  stable , opaque , immortal  all by dint of the dear names that lie concealed <unk> n't .

* * * * * to my mother .
because i feel that , in the heavens above , the angels , whispering to one another , can find , among their burning terms of love , none so devotional as that of " mother , " therefore by that dear name i long have called you  you who are more than mother unto me , and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you , in setting my <name> 's spirit free .
my mother  my own mother , who died early , was but the mother of myself ; but you are mother to the one i loved so dearly , and thus are dearer than the mother i knew by that infinity with which my wife was dearer to my soul than its <unk> .

* * * * * for <name> .
thank heaven !
the crisis  the danger is past , and the lingering illness is over at last  and the fever called " living " is conquered at last .
sadly , i know , i am shorn of my strength , and no muscle i move as i lie at full length  but no matter !  i feel i am better at length .
and i rest so composedly , now in my bed , that any beholder might fancy me dead  might start at beholding me thinking me dead .
the moaning and groaning , the sighing and sobbing , are quieted now , with that horrible throbbing at heart :  ah , that horrible , horrible throbbing !
the sickness  the nausea  the pitiless pain  have ceased , with the fever that maddened my <name>  with the fever called " living " that burned in my <name> .
and oh !
of all tortures that torture the worst has abated  the terrible torture of thirst , for the <unk> river of passion <unk> :  i have drank of a water that <unk> all thirst :  of a water that flows , with a <unk> sound , from a spring but a very few feet under ground  from a cavern not very far down under ground .
and ah !
let it never be foolishly said that my room it is gloomy and narrow my bed  for man never slept in a different bed ; and , to sleep , you must slumber in just such a bed .
my <unk> spirit here blandly <unk> , forgetting , or never <unk> its roses  its old agitations of <unk> and roses : for now , while so quietly lying , it fancies a <unk> odor about it , of pansies  a <name> odor , commingled with pansies  with rue and the beautiful puritan pansies .
and so it lies happily , bathing in many a dream of the truth and the beauty of <name>  drowned in a bath of the tresses of <name> .
she tenderly kissed me , she fondly caressed , and then i fell gently to sleep on her breast  deeply to sleep from the heaven of her breast .
when the light was extinguished , she covered me warm , and she prayed to the angels to keep me from harm  to the <name> of the angels to shield me from harm .
and i lie so composedly , now in my bed ( knowing her love ) that you fancy me dead  and i rest so contentedly , now in my bed , ( with her love at my breast ) that you fancy me dead  that you shudder to look at me .
thinking me dead .
but my heart it is brighter than all of the many stars in the sky , for it sparkles with <name>  it glows with the light of the love of my <name>  with the thought of the light of the eyes of my <name> .
1849 .
* * * * * to f  beloved !
amid the <name> woes that crowd around my earthly path  ( drear path , alas !
where grows not even one lonely rose )  my soul at least a solace hath in dreams of thee , and therein knows an <name> of bland repose .
and thus thy memory is to me like some enchanted far-off isle in some tumultuous sea  some ocean throbbing far and free with storm  but where meanwhile <unk> skies continually just o'er that one bright inland smile .
1845 .
* * * * * to <name> s. osgood .
thou wouldst be loved ?  then let thy heart from its present pathway part not ; being everything which now thou <name> , be nothing which thou <name> not .
so with the world thy gentle ways , thy <name> , thy more than beauty , shall be an endless theme of praise .
and love a simple duty .
1845 .
* * * * * eldorado .
gaily <unk> , a gallant knight , in <name> and in shadow , had journeyed long , singing a song , in search of eldorado .
but he grew old  this knight so bold  and o'er his heart a shadow fell as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado .
and , as his strength failed him at length , he met a pilgrim shadow  " shadow , " said he , " where can it be  this land of eldorado ? "
" over the mountains of the moon , down the valley of the shadow , ride , boldly ride , " the shade replied , " if you seek for eldorado ! "

* * * * * eulalie .
i dwelt alone in a world of moan , and my soul was a stagnant tide , till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride  till the <unk> young eulalie became my smiling bride .
ah , less  less bright the stars of the night than the eyes of the radiant girl !
and never a <unk> that the vapor can make with the <unk> of purple and <name> , can vie with the modest eulalie 's most <unk> curl  can compare with the <unk> eulalie 's most humble and careless curl .
now doubt  now pain come never again , for her soul gives me sigh for sigh , and all day long shines , bright and strong , <unk> within the sky , while ever to her dear eulalie <unk> her matron eye  while ever to her young eulalie <unk> her <name> eye .

* * * * * a dream within a dream .

and , in parting from you now , thus much let me <unk>  you are not wrong , who deem that my days have been a dream : yet if <name> has flown away in a night , or in a day , in a vision or in none , is it therefore the less gone ?
all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream .
i stand amid the roar of a <unk> shore , and i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand  how few !
yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while i weep  while i weep !
o god !
can i not grasp them with a tighter clasp ?
o god !
can i not save one from the pitiless wave ?
is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream ?

* * * * * to <name> <name> ( shew ) .
not long ago , the writer of these lines , in the mad pride of <unk> , maintained " the power of words "  denied that ever a thought arose within the human <name> beyond the utterance of the human tongue : and now , as if in mockery of that boast , two words  two foreign soft <unk>  italian tones , made only to be murmured by angels dreaming in the moonlit " dew that hangs like chains of <name> on hermon hill , "  have stirred from out the abysses of his heart , <unk> thoughts that are the souls of thought , richer , far wilder , far <unk> visions than even the seraph harper , <unk> , ( who has " the sweetest voice of all god 's creatures , " ) could <name> to utter .
and i !
my spells are broken .
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand .
with thy dear name as text , though hidden by thee , i can not write  i can not speak or think  alas , i can not feel ; for 't is not feeling , this standing motionless upon the golden threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams , gazing , entranced , <unk> the gorgeous vista , and thrilling as i see , upon the right , upon the left , and all the way along , amid <unk> <unk> , far away to where the prospect terminates  thee only !
* * * * * the city in the sea .
lo !
death has reared himself a throne in a strange city lying alone far down within the dim west , where the good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest .
there shrines and palaces and towers ( <unk> towers and tremble not ! )
resemble nothing that is ours .
around , by lifting winds forgot , resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie .
no rays from the holy heaven come down on the long <unk> of that town ; but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently  gleams up the pinnacles far and free  up domes  up spires  up kingly halls  up <unk>  up <unk> walls  up shadowy long-forgotten bowers of sculptured <name> and stone flowers  up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathed <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the <name> , and the vine .
resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie .
so blend the turrets and shadows there that all seem pendulous in air , while from a proud tower in the town death looks <unk> down .
there open <unk> and gaping graves yawn level with the luminous waves ; but not the riches there that lie in each idol 's <name> eye  not the <unk> dead tempt the waters from their bed ; for no ripples curl , alas !
along that wilderness of glass  no <unk> tell that winds may be upon some far-off happier sea  no <unk> hint that winds have been on seas less hideously serene .
but lo , a stir is in the air !
the wave  there is a movement there !
as if the towers had thrust aside , in slightly sinking , the dull tide  as if their tops had feebly given a void within the filmy heaven .
the waves have now a redder glow  the hours are breathing faint and low  and when , amid no earthly moans , down , down that town shall settle hence , hell , rising from a thousand thrones , shall do it reverence .

* * * * * the sleeper at midnight , in the month of <name> , i stand beneath the mystic moon .
an <unk> vapor , dewy , dim , <unk> from out her golden rim , and , softly dripping , drop by drop , upon the quiet mountain top , steals drowsily and musically into the universal valley .
the <name> nods upon the grave ; the <name> <unk> upon the wave ; wrapping the fog about its breast , the ruin <unk> into rest ; looking like <unk> , see !
the lake a conscious slumber seems to take , and would not , for the world , awake .
all beauty sleeps !  and lo !
where lies ( her casement open to the skies ) <name> , with her destinies !
oh , <name> bright !
can it be right  this window open to the night !
the wanton airs , from the <unk> , laughingly through the <unk>  the <unk> airs , a wizard rout , flit through thy chamber in and out , and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully  so fearfully  above the closed and fringed lid 'neath which thy <unk> soul lies hid , that , o'er the floor and down the wall , like ghosts the shadows rise and fall !
oh , <name> dear , hast thou no fear ?
why and what <name> thou dreaming here ?
sure thou <name> come o'er far-off seas , a wonder to these garden trees !
strange is thy pallor !
strange thy dress !
strange , above all , thy length of <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> !
the <name> sleeps !
oh , may her sleep which is enduring , so be deep !
heaven have her in its sacred keep !
this chamber changed for one more holy , this bed for one more melancholy , i pray to god that she may lie for ever with unopened eye , while the dim sheeted ghosts go by !
my love , she sleeps !
oh , may her sleep , as it is lasting , so be deep ; soft may the worms about her creep !
far in the forest , dim and old , for her may some tall vault unfold  some vault that oft hath flung its black and winged panels fluttering back , triumphant , o'er the crested <unk> , of her grand family funerals  some sepulchre , remote , alone , against whose portal she hath thrown , in childhood many an idle stone  some tomb from out whose sounding door she ne'er shall force an <name> more , thrilling to think , poor child of sin !
it was the dead who groaned within .

* * * * * bridal ballad .
the ring is on my hand , and the wreath is on my brow ; <unk> and jewels grand are all at my command .
and i am happy now .
and my lord he loves me well ; but , when first he breathed his vow , i felt my bosom swell  for the words rang as a knell , and the voice seemed his who fell in the battle down the <name> , and who is happy now .
but he spoke to reassure me , and he kissed my pallid brow , while a reverie came o'er me , and to the churchyard bore me , and i sighed to him before me , thinking him dead <unk> , " oh , i am happy now ! "
and thus the words were spoken , and thus the <unk> vow , and , though my <name> be broken , and , though my heart be broken , behold the golden keys that proves me happy now !
would to god i could awaken for i dream i know not how , and my soul is sorely shaken lest an evil step be taken ,  lest the dead who is forsaken may not be happy now .

the <name> " the <name> " was first published on the 29th <name> , 1845 , in the new york <unk> mirror '  a paper its author was then assistant editor of .
it was <unk> by the following words , understood to have been written by n. p. <name> : " we are permitted to copy ( in advance of publication ) from the second number of the 'american review ' , the following remarkable poem by <name> poe .
in our opinion , it is the most effective single example of <unk> poetry ' ever published in this country , and <unk> in english poetry for subtle <name> , masterly ingenuity of versification , and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and <unk> . '
it is one of those <unk> bred in a book ' which we feed on .
it <name> stick to the memory of everybody who reads it . "
in the february number of the 'american review ' the poem was published as by " <unk> , " and it was introduced by the following note , evidently suggested if not written by poe himself .
[ " the following lines from a correspondent  besides the deep , quaint strain of the sentiment , and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive , as was doubtless intended by the author  appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique <unk> which has for some time met our eye .
the resources of english rhythm for varieties of <name> , measure , and sound , producing corresponding diversities of effect , have been thoroughly studied , much more perceived , by very few poets in the language .
while the classic tongues , especially the greek , possess , by power of accent , several advantages for versification over our own , chiefly through greater abundance of <unk> feet , we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme .
<unk> is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us .
it <name> be seen that much of the <name> of 'the <name> ' arises from <unk> and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places .
in regard to its measure , it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second , they might properly be placed merely in short lines , producing a not uncommon form : but the presence in all the others of one line  mostly the second in the verse " ( stanza ? )
 " which flows continuously , with only an <unk> pause in the middle , like that before the short line in the <unk> <unk> , while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part beside , gives the versification an entirely different effect .
we could wish the capacities of our <name> language in <unk> were better understood . "

the bells the <unk> history of " the bells " is curious .
the subject , and some lines of the original version , having been suggested by the <unk> friend , mrs. shew , poe , when he wrote out the first draft of the poem , headed it , " the bells .
by mrs. m. a .
shew . "
this draft , now the <unk> property , consists of only seventeen lines , and reads thus : i .
the bells !  ah the bells !
the little silver bells !
how <unk> a <name> there floats from their throats  from their <name> little throats  from the silver , tinkling throats of the bells , bells , bells  of the bells !
ii .
the bells !  ah , the bells !
the heavy iron bells !
how horrible a <unk> there floats from their throats  from their <unk> throats  from their melancholy throats how i shudder at the notes of the bells , bells , bells  of the bells !
in the autumn of 1848 poe added another line to this poem , and sent it to the editor of the <unk> magazine ' .
it was not published .
so , in the following february , the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered <unk> .
three months having elapsed without publication , another revision of the poem , similar to the current version , was sent , and in the following october was published in the <unk> magazine ' .

being reprinted immediately in the <unk> journal ' , it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor , n. p. <name> , appended , and was ascribed to him .
when first published , it contained the following additional stanza which poe subsequently , at the suggestion of mrs. <unk> wisely suppressed : said we then  the two , then  " ah , can it have been that the <unk> <unk>  the pitiful , the merciful <unk>  to bar up our path and to ban it from the secret that lies in these <unk>  had drawn up the spectre of a planet from the <unk> of <unk> souls  this <unk> <unk> planet from the hell of the <unk> souls ?

wanderers in that happy valley , through two luminous windows , saw spirits moving musically , to a <unk> 's <unk> law , bound about a throne where , sitting ( <unk> ! )
in state his <name> well <unk> , the ruler of the realm was seen .
and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing , and sparkling evermore , a troop of echoes , whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
but evil things , in robes of sorrow , assailed the monarch 's high estate .
( ah , let us mourn !  for never morrow shall <name> upon him desolate ! )
and round about his home the <name> that blushed and bloomed , is but a <unk> story of the old time entombed .
and travellers , now , within that valley , through the <unk> windows see vast forms , that move fantastically to a discordant <name> , while , like a ghastly rapid river , through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laugh  but smile no more .
1838 .
* * * * * the conqueror worm .
lo !
't is a <name> night within the lonesome latter years !
an <name> throng , <unk> , <unk> in veils , and drowned in tears , sit in a theatre , to see a play of hopes and fears , while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres .
<unk> , in the form of god on high , mutter and mumble low , and hither and thither fly  mere <unk> they , who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro , flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo !
that motley drama  oh , be sure it shall not be forgot !
with its phantom chased for evermore , by a crowd that seize it not , through a circle that ever <unk> in to the self-same spot , and much of madness , and more of sin , and horror the soul of the plot .
but see , amid the mimic rout a crawling shape intrude !
a blood-red thing that <unk> from out the <unk> solitude !
it <unk> !  it <unk> !  with mortal pangs the <unk> become its food , and the angels sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued .
out  out are the lights  out all !
and , over each quivering form , the curtain , a funeral pall , comes down with the rush of a storm , and the angels , all pallid and <name> , uprising , <unk> , affirm that the play is the tragedy , " man , " and its hero the conqueror worm .
1838 * * * * * silence .
there are some qualities  some <unk> things , that have a double life , which thus is made a type of that twin entity which springs from matter and light , evinced in solid and shade .
there is a twofold silence  sea and shore  body and soul .
one dwells in lonely places , newly with grass <unk> ; some solemn graces , some human memories and tearful <name> , render him <unk> : his name 's " no more . "
he is the <unk> silence : dread him not !
no power hath he of evil in himself ; but should some urgent fate ( untimely lot ! )
bring thee to meet his shadow ( nameless <unk> , that <unk> the lone regions where hath trod no foot of man ) , commend thyself to god !
1840 * * * * * dreamland .
by a route obscure and lonely , haunted by ill angels only , where an <unk> , named night , on a black throne reigns upright , i have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim <unk>  from a wild weird clime that lieth , sublime , out of space  out of time .
bottomless <unk> and boundless floods , and chasms , and caves , and <unk> woods , with forms that no man can discover for the dews that drip all over ; mountains <unk> evermore into seas without a shore ; seas that restlessly aspire , surging , unto skies of fire ; lakes that <unk> <unk> their lone waters  lone and dead , their still waters  still and chilly with the snows of the lolling <name> .
by the lakes that thus <unk> their lone waters , lone and dead ,  their sad waters , sad and chilly with the snows of the lolling <name> ,  by the mountains  near the river murmuring lowly , murmuring ever ,  by the gray woods ,  by the swamp where the toad and the <unk> encamp ,  by the dismal <unk> and pools where dwell the <unk> ,  by each spot the most unholy  in each nook most melancholy ,  there the traveller meets aghast sheeted memories of the past  shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by  <unk> forms of friends long given , in agony , to the earth  and heaven .
for the heart whose woes are legion 't is a peaceful , soothing region  for the spirit that walks in shadow 't is  oh , 't is an eldorado !
but the traveller , travelling through it , may not  dare not openly view it ; never its mysteries are exposed to the weak human eye <unk> ; so wills its king , who hath forbid the uplifting of the fringed lid ; and thus the sad soul that here passes beholds it but through darkened glasses .
by a route obscure and lonely , haunted by ill angels only .
where an <unk> , named night , on a black throne reigns upright , i have wandered home but newly from this ultimate dim <unk> .
1844 * * * * * to <unk> .
fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers , thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take !
how many memories of what radiant hours at sight of thee and thine at once awake !
how many scenes of what departed bliss !
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes !
how many visions of a maiden that is no more  no more upon thy verdant slopes !
no more !  alas , that magical sad sound transforming all !
thy charms shall please no more  thy memory no more !  accursed ground henceforward i hold thy <unk> shore , o <unk> isle !
o purple <unk> !
" <unk> <unk> !
<unk> di <unk> ! "

methinks thou hast a singular way of showing thy happiness  what ails thee , cousin of mine ?
why didst thou sigh so deeply ?
cas .
did i sigh ?
i was not conscious of it .
it is a fashion , a silly  a most silly fashion i have when i am very happy .
did i sigh ?

thou didst .
thou <name> not well .
thou hast indulged too much of late , and i am vexed to see it .
late hours and wine , castiglione ,  these <name> ruin thee !
thou <name> already altered  thy looks are haggard  nothing so wears away the constitution as late hours and wine .

( musing ) .
nothing , fair cousin , nothing  not even deep sorrow  wears it away like evil hours and wine .
i <name> amend .
aless .
do it !
i would have thee drop thy riotous company , too  fellows low born ill suit the like of old di <unk> 's heir and <name> 's husband .
cas .
i <name> drop them .
aless .
thou wilt  thou must .
attend thou also more to thy dress and equipage  they are over plain for thy lofty rank and fashion  much depends upon appearances .
cas .
i 'll see to it .
aless .

di <unk> .
the same , my love .
we 'll have him at the wedding .
a man quite young in years , but gray in fame .
i have not seen him , but rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy <unk> in arts , and arms , and wealth , and high descent .
we 'll have him at the wedding .
aless .
i have heard much of this politian .
<name> , volatile and giddy  is he not , and little given to thinking ?
di <unk> .
far from it , love .
no branch , they say , of all philosophy so deep abstruse he has not mastered it .
learned as few are learned .
aless .
't is very strange !
i have known men have seen politian and sought his company .
they speak of him as of one who entered madly into life , drinking the cup of pleasure to the <unk> .
cas .
ridiculous !
now i have seen politian and know him well  nor learned nor mirthful he .
he is a dreamer , and shut out from common passions .
di <unk> .
children , we disagree .
let us go forth and taste the fragrant air of the garden .
did i dream , or did i hear politian was a melancholy man ?
( <unk> ) ii .
rome.  a <name> 's apartment , with a window open and looking into a garden .
lalage , in deep mourning , reading at a table on which lie some books and a <unk> .
in the background <name> ( a servant maid ) leans carelessly upon a chair .
lalage .
<name> !
is it thou ?
<name> ( <unk> ) .
yes , ma'am , i 'm here .
lal .
i did not know , <name> , you were in waiting .
sit down !  let not my presence trouble you  sit down !  for i am humble , most humble .

( aside ) .
't is time .
( <name> seats herself in a <unk> manner upon the chair , resting her elbows upon the back , and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look .
lalage continues to <unk> ) lal .
" it in another climate , so he said , bore a bright golden flower , but not i ' this soil ! "
( pauses  turns over some leaves and resumes . )
" no lingering winters there , nor snow , nor shower  but ocean ever to refresh mankind breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind " oh , beautiful !  most beautiful !  how like to what my fevered soul doth dream of heaven !
o happy land !
( pauses ) she died !  the maiden died !
o still more happy maiden who couldst die !
<name> !
( <name> returns no answer , and lalage presently resumes . )
again !  a similar tale told of a <unk> dame beyond the sea !
thus <unk> one <name> in the words of the play  " she died full young "  one <unk> answers him  " i think not so  her <unk> seemed to have years too many "  ah , luckless <name> !
<name> !
( still no answer . )
here 's a far sterner story  but like  oh , very like in its despair  of that egyptian <name> , winning so easily a thousand hearts  losing at length her own .
she died .
thus <unk> the history  and her maids <name> over her and keep  two gentle maids with gentle names  eiros and charmion !
rainbow and dove !  <name> !
<unk> .
( <unk> ) .
madam , what is it ?
lal .
wilt thou , my good <name> , be so kind as go down in the library and bring me the holy <unk> ?
<unk> .
pshaw !
( exit ) lal .
if there be balm for the wounded spirit in <unk> , it is there !
dew in the night time of my bitter trouble <name> there be found  " dew sweeter far than that which hangs like chains of <name> on hermon hill . "
( <unk> <name> , and throws a volume on the table . )
there , ma'am , 's the book .
( aside . )
indeed she is very troublesome .
lal .
( astonished ) .
what didst thou say , <name> ?
have i done aught to grieve thee or to vex thee ?  i am sorry .
for thou hast served me long and ever been trustworthy and respectful .
( resumes her reading . )
<unk> .
( aside . )
i ca n't believe she has any more jewels  no  no  she gave me all .
lal .
what didst thou say , <name> ?
now i <unk> me thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding .
how fares good <unk> ?  and when is it to be ?
can i do aught ?  is there no further aid thou <unk> , <name> ?
<unk> .
( aside . )
is there no further aid !
that 's meant for me .
i 'm sure , madam , you need not be always throwing those jewels in my teeth .
lal .
jewels !
<name> ,  now indeed , <name> , i thought not of the jewels .
<unk> .
oh , perhaps not !
but then i might have sworn it .
after all , there 's <unk> says the ring is only paste , for he 's sure the count castiglione never would have given a real <name> to such as you ; and at the best i 'm certain , madam , you can not have use for jewels now .
but i might have sworn it .
( exit ) ( lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table  after a short pause raises it . )
lal .
poor lalage !  and is it come to this ?
thy servant maid !  but courage !  't is but a viper whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul !
( taking up the mirror ) <name> !
here at least 's a friend  too much a friend in earlier days  a friend <name> not deceive thee .
fair mirror and true !
now tell me ( for thou canst ) a tale  a pretty tale  and heed thou not though it be rife with woe .
it answers me .
it speaks of sunken eyes , and wasted cheeks , and beauty long deceased  remembers me , of <name> departed  <name> , the seraph <name> , <unk> and entombed !  now , in a tone low , sad , and solemn , but most audible , whispers of early grave untimely yawning for ruined maid .
fair mirror and true !  thou <unk> not !
thou hast no end to gain  no heart to break  castiglione lied who said he loved   thou true  he false !  false !  false !
( while she speaks , a monk enters her apartment and approaches unobserved ) monk .
refuge thou hast , sweet daughter !
in heaven .
think of eternal things !
give up thy soul to penitence , and pray !
lal .
( arising hurriedly ) .
i cannot pray !  my soul is at war with god !
the frightful sounds of merriment below ; disturb my senses  go !
i can not pray  the sweet airs from the garden worry me !
thy presence grieves me  go !  thy <unk> raiment fills me with dread  thy <name> crucifix with horror and awe !
monk .
think of thy precious soul !
lal .
think of my early days !  think of my father and mother in heaven !
think of our quiet home , and the rivulet that ran before the door !
think of my little sisters !  think of them !
and think of me !  think of my trusting love and confidence  his vows  my ruin  think  think of my unspeakable misery !   begone !
yet stay !
yet stay !  what was it thou <unk> of prayer and penitence ?
didst thou not speak of <name> and vows before the throne ?
monk .
i did .
lal .
't is well .
there is a vow 'twere fitting should be made  a sacred vow , imperative and urgent , a solemn vow !
monk .
daughter , this zeal is well !
lal .
father , this zeal is anything but well !
hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing ?
a crucifix whereon to register this sacred vow ?
( he hands her his own . )
not that  oh !
no !  no !  no ( shuddering . )
not that !
not that !  i tell thee , holy man , thy <unk> and thy <name> cross affright me !
stand back !
i have a crucifix myself ,  i have a crucifix !
methinks 'twere fitting the deed  the vow  the symbol of the deed  and the deed 's register should tally , father !
( draws a <unk> dagger and raises it on high . )
behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine is written in heaven !
monk .
thy words are madness , daughter , and speak a purpose unholy  thy lips are livid  thine eyes are wild  tempt not the wrath divine !
pause ere too late !  oh , be not  be not rash !
swear not the oath  oh , swear it not !
lal .
't is sworn !

pol .
baldazzar , it doth grieve me to give thee cause for grief , my honored friend .
command me , sir !

command me , sir !
bal .
to the field then  to the field  to the senate or the field .
pol .
alas !
alas !

there is  what voice was that ?
bal .
i heard it not .
i heard not any voice except thine own , and the <name> of thine own .
pol .
then i but dreamed .
bal .
give not thy soul to dreams : the camp  the court <unk> thee  fame awaits thee  <name> calls  and her the <unk> thou wilt not hear in <unk> to imaginary sounds and phantom voices .
pol .
it is a phantom voice !
didst thou not hear it then ?
bal i heard it not .
pol .
thou <unk> it not !  baldazzar , speak no more to me , politian , of thy camps and courts .
oh !
i am sick , sick , sick , even unto death , of the hollow and <unk> vanities of the populous earth !

bal .
thou <unk> a fearful riddle i <name> not understand .
pol .
yet now as fate approaches , and the hours are breathing low , the sands of time are changed to golden grains , and dazzle me , baldazzar .
alas !
alas !
i cannot die , having within my heart so keen a relish for the beautiful as hath been kindled within it .
methinks the air is <unk> now than it was wont to be  <name> melodies are floating in the winds  a rarer loveliness <unk> the earth  and with a <unk> lustre the quiet moon <unk> in <unk>  hist !
hist !
thou canst not say thou <unk> not now , baldazzar ?
bal .

a <name> 's voice !  and sorrow in the tone !
baldazzar , it <unk> me like a spell !
again !  again !  how solemnly it falls into my heart of hearts !
that eloquent voice surely i never heard  yet it were well had i but heard it with its thrilling tones in earlier days !
bal .
i myself hear it now .
be still !  the voice , if i mistake not greatly , proceeds from <unk> lattice  which you may see very plainly through the window  it belongs , does it not ?
unto this palace of the duke .
the singer is undoubtedly beneath the roof of his excellency  and perhaps is even that <name> of whom he spoke as the betrothed of castiglione , his son and heir .
pol .
be still !  it comes again !
voice ( very faintly ) .
" and is thy heart so strong [ 1 ] as for to leave me thus , that have loved thee so long , in wealth and woe among ?
and is thy heart so strong as for to leave me thus ?
say nay !
say nay ! "
bal .
the song is english , and i oft have heard it in <name> england  never so plaintively  hist !

the hour is growing late  the duke awaits us ,  thy presence is expected in the hall below .

i know  i know it all , and still i speak of love .
look at me , brightest , and beautiful lalage !  turn here thine eyes !
thou <unk> me if i could speak of love , knowing what i know , and seeing what i have seen thou <unk> me that  and thus i answer thee  thus on my bended knee i answer thee .
( kneeling . )
sweet lalage , i love thee  love thee  love thee ; thro ' good and ill  thro ' weal and woe , i love thee .
not mother , with her first-born on her knee , thrills with <unk> love than i for thee .
not on god 's altar , in any time or clime , burned there a <unk> fire than <unk> now within my spirit for thee .
and do i love ?
( arising . )
even for thy woes i love thee  even for thy woes  thy beauty and thy woes .
lal .
alas , proud <name> , thou dost forget thyself , remembering me !
how , in thy father 's halls , among the maidens pure and <unk> of thy princely line , could the <unk> lalage abide ?
thy wife , and with a tainted memory  my seared and blighted name , how would it tally with the ancestral honors of thy house , and with thy <name> ?
pol .
speak not to me of <name> !
i hate  i <unk> the name ; i do abhor the unsatisfactory and ideal thing .
<name> thou not lalage , and i politian ?
do i not love  <name> thou not beautiful  what need we more ?
<name> !
<name> !
now speak not of it : by all i hold most sacred and most solemn  by all my wishes now  my fears hereafter  by all i scorn on earth and <name> in heaven  there is no deed i would more <name> in , than in thy cause to scoff at this same <name> and trample it under foot .
what matters it  what matters it , my fairest , and my best , that we go down <unk> and forgotten into the dust  so we descend together ?
descend together  and then  and then perchance  lal .
why dost thou pause , politian ?
pol .
and then perchance arise together , lalage , and roam the starry and quiet dwellings of the blest , and still  lal .
why dost thou pause , politian ?
pol .
and still together  together .

thou <unk> me , and in my heart of hearts i feel thou <unk> me truly .
pol .
o lalage !
( throwing himself upon his knee . )
and <unk> thou me ?
lal .
hist !
hush !
within the gloom of yonder trees methought a figure passed  a spectral figure , solemn , and slow , and noiseless  like the grim shadow conscience , solemn and noiseless .
( walks across and returns . )
i was mistaken  't was but a giant bough stirred by the autumn wind .
politian !
pol .
my lalage  my love !
why <name> thou moved ?
why dost thou turn so pale ?
not conscience self , far less a shadow which thou <unk> to it , should shake the firm spirit thus .
but the night wind is chilly  and these melancholy boughs throw over all things a gloom .
lal .
politian !
thou <unk> to me of love .
knowest thou the land with which all tongues are busy  a land new found  miraculously found by one of genoa  a thousand leagues within the golden west ?
a <name> land of flowers , and fruit , and <name> ,  and <name> lakes , and <unk> forests , and mountains , around whose towering summits the winds of heaven <unk> flow  which air to breathe is happiness now , and <name> be freedom hereafter in days that are to come ?
pol .
oh , wilt thou  wilt thou fly to that paradise  my lalage , wilt thou fly thither with me ?
there care shall be forgotten , and sorrow shall be no more , and eros be all .
and life shall then be mine , for i <name> live for thee , and in thine eyes  and thou shalt be no more a mourner  but the radiant joys shall wait upon thee , and the <name> <name> attend thee ever ; and i <name> kneel to thee and worship thee , and call thee my beloved , my own , my beautiful , my love , my wife , my all ;  oh , wilt thou  wilt thou , lalage , fly thither with me ?
lal .
a deed is to be done  castiglione lives !

and he shall die !

with what excessive fragrance the <unk> comes laden from yonder bowers !  a fairer day , or one more worthy italy , methinks no mortal eyes have seen !  what said the count ?
bal .
that he , castiglione , not being aware of any feud existing , or any cause of quarrel between your lordship and himself , can not accept the challenge .
pol .
it is most true  all this is very true .
when saw you , sir , when saw you now , baldazzar , in the frigid <unk> britain which we left so lately , a heaven so calm as this  so utterly free from the evil taint of clouds ?  and he did say ?

* * * * * note on politian 20 .
such portions of " politian " as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the <unk> literary messenger ' for december 1835 and <name> 1836 , being styled " scenes from politian ; an unpublished drama . "
these scenes were included , unaltered , in the 1845 collection of poems by poe .
the larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor , but it is not considered just to the poet 's memory to publish it .
the work is a hasty and <unk> production of its author 's earlier days of literary labor ; and , beyond the scenes already known , scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation .
as a specimen , however , of the parts unpublished , the following fragment from the first scene of act ii .
may be offered .
the duke , it should be <unk> , is uncle to <name> , and father of castiglione her betrothed .
duke .
why do you laugh ?
castiglione .
indeed .
i hardly know myself .
stay !
was it not on yesterday we were speaking of the <name> ?
of the <name> politian ?
yes !
it was yesterday .
<name> , you and i , you must remember !
we were walking in the garden .
duke .
perfectly .
i do remember it  what of it  what then ?
cas .
o nothing  nothing at all .
duke .
nothing at all !
it is most singular that you should laugh at nothing at all !
cas .
most singular  singular !
duke .
look <name> , castiglione , be so kind as tell me , sir , at once what 't is you mean .
what are you talking of ?
cas .
was it not so ?
we differed in opinion touching him .
duke .
him !  whom ?
cas .
why , sir , the <name> politian .
duke .
the <name> of leicester !
yes !  is it he you mean ?
we differed , indeed .
if i now recollect the words you used were that the <name> you knew was neither learned nor mirthful .
cas .
<name> !
<name> !  now did i ?
duke .
that did you , sir , and well i knew at the time you were wrong , it being not the character of the <name>  whom all the world allows to be a most hilarious man .
be not , my son , too positive again .
cas .
't is singular !
most singular !
i could not think it possible so little time could so much alter one !
to say the truth about an hour ago , as i was walking with the count san <unk> , all arm in arm , we met this very man the <name>  he , with his friend baldazzar , having just arrived in rome .
<name> !
<name> !
he is altered !
such an account he gave me of his journey !
'twould have made you die with laughter  such tales he told of his caprices and his <name> freaks along the road  such oddity  such humor  such wit  such whim  such flashes of wild merriment set off too in such full relief by the grave demeanor of his friend  who , to speak the truth was gravity itself  duke .
did i not tell you ?
cas .
you did  and yet 't is strange !
but true , as strange , how much i was mistaken !
i always thought the <name> a gloomy man .
duke .
so , so , you see !
be not too positive .
whom have we here ?
it can not be the <name> ?
cas .
the <name> !
oh no !
tis not the <name>  but yet it is  and leaning upon his friend baldazzar .
ah !
welcome , sir !
( enter politian and baldazzar . )
my lord , a second welcome let me give you to rome  his <name> the duke of <unk> .
father !
this is the <name> politian , <name> of leicester in great britain .
[ politian bows haughtily . ]
that , his friend baldazzar , duke of surrey .
the <name> has letters , so please you , for your <name> .
duke .
<name> !
<name> !
most welcome to rome and to our palace , <name> politian !
and you , most <name> duke !
i am glad to see you !
i knew your father well , my lord politian .
castiglione !
call your cousin hither , and let me make the <name> <name> acquainted with your betrothed .
you come , sir , at a time most <unk> .
the wedding  politian .
touching those letters , sir , your son made mention of  your son , is he not ?  touching those letters , sir , i wot not of them .
if such there be , my friend baldazzar here  baldazzar !
ah !  my friend baldazzar here <name> hand them to your <name> .
i would retire .
duke .
retire !  so soon ?
cas .
what ho !
<name> !
<name> !
his lordship 's chambers  show his lordship to them !
his lordship is unwell .
( enter <name> . )
<name> .
this way , my lord !
( exit , followed by politian . )
duke .
retire !
unwell !
bal .
so please you , sir .
i fear me 't is as you say  his lordship is unwell .
the damp air of the evening  the fatigue of a long journey  the  indeed i had better follow his lordship .
he must be unwell .
i <name> return anon .
duke .
return anon !
now this is very strange !
castiglione !
this way , my son , i wish to speak with thee .
you surely were mistaken in what you said of the <name> , mirthful , indeed !  which of us said politian was a melancholy man ?
( <unk> . )
* * * * * poems of youth * * * * * introduction to <unk>  1831 .
letter to mr. b  .
" west point , 1831 " dear b  ...
believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition  that small portion i thought it as well to include in the present book as to <unk> by itself .
i have therefore herein combined <unk> aaraaf ' and <unk> ' with other poems hitherto <unk> .
nor have i hesitated to insert from the <unk> poems , ' now omitted , whole lines , and even passages , to the end that being placed in a fairer light , and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded , they may have some chance of being seen by posterity .
" it has been said that a good <unk> on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself .
this , according to your idea and mine of poetry , i feel to be false  the less poetical the critic , the less just the <unk> , and the converse .
on this account , and because there are but few b   s in the world , i would be as much ashamed of the world's good opinion as proud of your own .
another than yourself might here observe , <unk> is in possession of the world 's good opinion , and yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets .
it appears then that the world judge correctly , why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment ? '
the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word <unk> ' or <unk> . '
the opinion is the world 's , truly , but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his , having bought it ; he did not write the book , but it is his ; they did not originate the opinion , but it is theirs .
a fool , for example , thinks shakespeare a great poet  yet the fool has never read shakespeare .
but the fool 's neighbor , who is a step higher on the andes of the mind , whose head ( that is to say , his more exalted thought ) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood , but whose feet ( by which i mean his every-day actions ) are sufficiently near to be discerned , and by means of which that superiority is ascertained , which but for them would never have been discovered  this neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poet  the fool believes him , and it is henceforward his opinion .
this <unk> own opinion has , in like manner , been adopted from one above him , and so , <unk> , to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit , beholding , face to face , the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle .
" you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer .
he is read , if at all , in preference to the combined and established wit of the world .
i say established ; for it is with literature as with law or empire  an established name is an estate in tenure , or a throne in possession .
besides , one might suppose that books , like their authors , improve by travel  their having crossed the sea is , with us , so great a distinction .
our <unk> abandon time for distance ; our very <unk> glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page , where the mystic characters which spell london , <name> , or genoa , are precisely so many letters of recommendation .
" i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism .
i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another .
i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a <unk> upon poetry .
therefore a bad poet would , i <name> , make a false <unk> , and his <unk> would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor ; but a poet , who is indeed a poet , could not , i think , fail of making a just <unk> ; whatever should be <unk> on the score of <unk> might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject ; in short , we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one 's own writings are the test , simply because we have more bad poets than good .
there are , of course , many objections to what i say : <name> is a great example of the contrary ; but his opinion with respect to the <unk> regained ' is by no means fairly ascertained .
by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe !
perhaps an <unk> word has descended to posterity .
but , in fact , the <unk> regained ' is little , if at all , inferior to the <unk> lost , ' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like <unk> , whatever they may say to the contrary , and reading those of <name> in their natural order , are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second .
" i dare say <name> preferred <unk> ' to either  if so  justly .
" as i am speaking of poetry , it <name> not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history  the heresy of what is called , very foolishly , the lake school .
some years ago i might have been induced , by an occasion like the present , to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine ; at present it would be a work of <unk> .
the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and <unk> , but being wise , have laughed at poetical theories so <unk> exemplified .
" aristotle , with singular assurance , has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings  but it required a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical .
he seems to think that the end of poetry is , or should be , instruction ; yet it is a <unk> that the end of our existence is happiness ; if so , the end of every separate part of our existence , everything connected with our existence , should be still happiness .
therefore the end of instruction should be happiness ; and happiness is another name for pleasure ;  therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure : yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse .
" to proceed : <unk> <unk> , he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow-men than he who <unk> , since utility is happiness , and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining .
" i see no reason , then , why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works , unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view ; in which case , sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment ; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal , since their writings are <unk> to be understood by the few , and it is the many who stand in need of salvation .
in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in <unk> , ' who labors <unk> , through three octavo volumes , to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls , while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand .
" against the <unk> which would make poetry a study  not a passion  it becomes the metaphysician to reason  but the poet to protest .
yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years ; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood ; the other a giant in intellect and learning .
the diffidence , then , with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel , from the bottom of my heart , that learning has little to do with the imagination  intellect with the passions  or age with poetry .
" <unk> , like straws , upon the surface flow ; he who would search for pearls must dive below , ' " are lines which have done much mischief .
as regards the greater truths , men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top ; truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought  not in the palpable palaces where she is found .
the ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well ; witness the light which bacon has thrown upon philosophy ; witness the principles of our divine <name>  that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may <unk> the wisdom of a man .
" we see an instance of coleridge 's liability to err , in his <unk> <unk> '  <unk> his literary life and opinions , but , in fact , a treatise 'de <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> ' .
he goes wrong by reason of his very profundity , and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a <name> .
he who regards it directly and intensely sees , it is true , the <name> , but it is the <name> without a <name>  while he who surveys it less <unk> is conscious of all for which the <name> is useful to us below  its brilliancy and its beauty .
" as to wordsworth , i have no <name> in him .
that he had in youth the feelings of a poet i believe  for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings  ( and delicacy is the poet 's own kingdom  his <unk> <unk> ' )  but they have the appearance of a better day recollected ; and glimpses , at best , are little evidence of present poetic fire ; we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier .
" he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of <unk> in his manhood .
with the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away .
his judgment consequently is too correct .
this may not be understood ,  but the old <unk> of germany would have understood it , who used to debate matters of importance to their state twice , once when drunk , and once when sober  sober that they might not be deficient in formality  drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor .
" the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry , speak very little in his favor : they are full of such assertions as this ( i have opened one of his volumes at random )  'of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done , and what was never done before ; '  indeed ?
then it follows that in doing what is <unk> to be done , or what 'has ' been done before , no genius can be evinced ; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act , pockets have been picked time immemorial , and barrington , the <unk> , in point of genius , would have thought hard of a comparison with <name> wordsworth , the poet .
" again , in estimating the merit of certain poems , whether they be <unk> 's or <unk> 's can surely be of little consequence , yet , in order to prove their <unk> , mr. w. has expended many pages in the controversy .
<unk> <unk> ? '
can great minds descend to such absurdity ?
but worse still : that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems , he triumphantly drags forward a passage , in his <unk> with which he expects the reader to sympathise .
it is the beginning of the epic poem <unk> . '
'the blue waves of <unk> roll in light ; the green hills are covered with day ; trees shake their <name> heads in the breeze . '
and this  this gorgeous , yet simple imagery , where all is alive and panting with immortality  this , <name> wordsworth , the author of <unk> <name> , ' has <unk> ' for his contempt .
we shall see what better he , in his own person , has to offer .
<unk> : " 'and now she 's at the pony 's tail , and now she 's at the pony 's head , on that side now , and now on this ; and , almost stifled with her bliss , a few sad tears does <name> shed ... . she <unk> the pony , where or when she knows not ... happy <name> <unk> !
oh , <name> , never mind the doctor ! '
" secondly : " 'the dew was falling fast , the  stars began to blink ; i heard a voice : it said ,  " drink , pretty creature , drink ! "
and , looking o'er the hedge , before me i espied a snow-white mountain lamb , with a maiden at its side .
no other sheep was near , the lamb was all alone , and by a slender cord was <unk> 'd to a stone . '
" now , we have no doubt this is all true : we <name> believe it , indeed we <name> , mr , w. is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite ?
i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart .
" but there are occasions , dear b   , there are occasions when even wordsworth is reasonable .
even <unk> , it is said , shall have an end , and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion .
here is an extract from his preface : " 'those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers , if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion ( impossible !  ) <name> , no doubt , have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ; ( <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! )
they <name> look round for poetry ( <name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
) , and <name> be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to assume that title . '
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
" yet , let not mr. w. despair ; he has given immortality to a wagon , and the <name> sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe , and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys .
" of coleridge , i can not speak but with reverence .
his towering intellect !
his gigantic power !
to use an author quoted by himself , <unk> <unk> <unk> que la <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> dans une <unk> <unk> de ce <unk> <unk> , mais non pas en ce <unk> <unk> ; ' and to employ his own language , he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others .
it is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics , and , like the <unk> , waste its perfume upon the night alone .
in reading that man 's poetry , i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano , conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater , of the fire and the light that are weltering below .
" what is poetry ?  poetry !
that <unk> idea , with as many <unk> as the <unk> <unk> !
'give me , ' i demanded of a scholar some time ago , 'give me a definition of poetry . '
<unk> ;  ' and he proceeded to his library , brought me a dr. <name> , and overwhelmed me with a definition .
shade of the immortal shakespeare !
i imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that <unk> <unk> <name> .
think of poetry , dear b   , think of poetry , and then think of dr. <name> <name> !
think of all that is airy and <unk> , and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy ; think of his huge bulk , the elephant !
and then  and then think of the <unk> '  the <unk> night 's dream '  <unk>  <unk>  and <unk> !
" a poem , in my opinion , is opposed to a work of science by having , for its immediate object , pleasure , not truth ; to romance , by having , for its object , an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure , being a poem only so far as this object is attained ; romance presenting perceptible images with definite , poetry with <unk> sensations , to which end music is an essential , since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite <name> .
music , when combined with a pleasurable idea , is poetry ; music , without the idea , is simply music ; the idea , without the music , is prose , from its very <unk> .
" what was meant by the <unk> against him who had no music in his soul ?
" to sum up this long <unk> , i have , dear b   , what you , no doubt , perceive , for the metaphysical poets as poets , the most sovereign contempt .
that they have followers proves nothing : " 'no indian <name> has to his palace more followers than a thief to the gallows . ' "

true daughter of old time thou <name> !
who <unk> all things with thy peering eyes .
why <unk> thou thus upon the poet 's heart , vulture , whose wings are dull realities how should he love thee ?
or how deem thee wise , who wouldst not leave him in his wandering to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies , albeit he soared with an undaunted wing !
hast thou not dragged <name> from her car ?
and driven the <unk> from the wood to seek a shelter in some happier <name> ?
hast thou not torn the <unk> from her flood , the <unk> from the green grass , and from me the summer dream beneath the <unk> tree ?

of molten stars their pavement , such as fall [ 16 ] thro ' the <unk> air , <unk> the pall of their own dissolution , while they die  adorning then the dwellings of the sky .
a dome , by linked light from heaven let down , sat gently on these columns as a crown  a window of one circular <name> , there , look 'd out above into the purple air and rays from god shot down that meteor chain and <unk> 'd all the beauty twice again , save when , between th ' <unk> and that ring , some eager spirit flapp 'd his dusky wing .
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen the dimness of this world : that <unk> green that nature loves the best for beauty 's grave <unk> 'd in each cornice , round each <unk>  and every sculptured cherub <unk> that from his marble dwelling peered out , seem 'd earthly in the shadow of his niche  <unk> statues in a world so <name> ?

oh , the wave [ 18 ] is now upon thee  but too late to save !
sound loves to revel in a summer night : witness the murmur of the gray twilight that stole upon the ear , in <unk> [ 19 ] , of many a wild <unk> long ago  that <unk> ever on the ear of him who , musing , <unk> on the distance dim , and sees the darkness coming as a cloud  is not its form  its voice  most palpable and loud ?
[ 20 ] but what is this ?  it cometh  and it brings a music with it  't is the rush of wings  a pause  and then a sweeping , falling strain , and <unk> is in her halls again .
from the wild energy of wanton haste her cheeks were flushing , and her lips apart ; the zone that clung around her gentle waist had burst beneath the heaving of her heart .
within the centre of that hall to breathe she <unk> 'd and panted , <unk> !
all beneath , the <name> light that kiss 'd her golden hair and long 'd to rest , yet could but <name> there !
young flowers were whispering in <name> [ 21 ] to happy flowers that night  and tree to tree ; fountains were gushing music as they fell in many a <unk> grove , or <unk> <name> ; yet silence came upon material things  fair flowers , bright waterfalls and <name> wings  and sound alone that from the spirit sprang bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang : " <unk> <unk> or <unk>  or tufted wild spray that keeps , from the dreamer , the <unk> away  [ 22 ] bright beings !

wherever thy image may be , no magic shall sever thy music from thee .
thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep  but the strains still arise which thy vigilance keep  the sound of the rain which leaps down to the flower , and dances again in the rhythm of the shower  the murmur that springs [ 24 ] from the growing of grass are the music of things  but are <unk> 'd , alas !

spirits in wing , and angels to the view , a thousand <unk> burst th ' <unk> thro ' , young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight  <unk> in all but " knowledge , " the keen light that fell , <unk> , thro ' thy bounds afar , o death !

may my weary spirit dwell  apart from heaven 's eternity  and yet how far from hell !
[ 26 ] what guilty spirit , in what shrubbery dim heard not the stirring summons of that hymn ?
but two : they fell : for heaven no <name> imparts to those who hear not for their beating hearts .
a <unk> and her <unk>  o !
where ( and ye may seek the wide skies over ) was love , the blind , near sober duty known ?
<unk> love hath fallen  'mid " tears of perfect moan . "
[ 27 ] he was a goodly spirit  he who fell : a wanderer by <unk> well  a <unk> on the lights that shine above  a dreamer in the <unk> by his love : what wonder ?
for each <name> is <unk> there , and looks so sweetly down on beauty 's hair  and they , and ev'ry mossy spring were holy to his <unk> heart and melancholy .
the night had found ( to him a night of wo ) upon a mountain crag , young <name>  <unk> it bends athwart the solemn sky , and <unk> on starry worlds that down beneath it lie .
here sate he with his love  his dark eye bent with eagle gaze along the firmament : now turn 'd it upon her  but ever then it trembled to the orb of earth again .
" <unk> , dearest , see !
how dim that <name> !
how lovely 't is to look so far away !
she seemed not thus upon that autumn <name> i left her gorgeous halls  nor mourned to leave , that <name>  that <name>  i should remember well  the <unk> dropped , in <unk> with a spell on th ' <unk> carving of a gilded hall wherein i sate , and on the <unk> wall  and on my eyelids  o , the heavy light !
how drowsily it weighed them into night !
on flowers , before , and mist , and love they ran with persian saadi in his <unk> : but o , that light !  i slumbered  death , the while , stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle so softly that no single silken hair awoke that slept  or knew that he was there .
" the last spot of earth 's orb i trod upon was a proud <name> called the parthenon ; [ 28 ] more beauty clung around her <unk> wall then even thy glowing bosom beats withal , [ 29 ] and when old time my wing did <unk> thence sprang i  as the eagle from his tower , and years i left behind me in an hour .
what time upon her airy bounds i <name> , one half the garden of her globe was flung <unk> as a chart unto my view  <unk> cities of the desert too !
<unk> , beauty crowded on me then , and half i wished to be again of men . "
" my <name> !
and why of them to be ?
a brighter <unk> is here for thee  and greener fields than in <name> world above , and woman 's loveliness  and passionate love . "
" but list , <unk> !
when the air so soft failed , as my <unk> spirit <unk> aloft , [ 30 ] perhaps my <name> grew dizzy  but the world i left so late was into chaos hurled , sprang from her station , on the winds apart , and rolled a flame , the fiery heaven athwart .
methought , my sweet one , then i ceased to soar , and fell  not swiftly as i rose before , but with a downward , tremulous motion <unk> light , brazen rays , this golden <name> unto !
nor long the measure of my falling hours , for nearest of all stars was thine to ours  dread <name> !
that came , amid a night of mirth , a red <unk> on the timid earth . "
" we came  and to thy earth  but not to us be given our <name> 's bidding to discuss : we came , my love ; around , above , below , <name> <unk> of the night we come and go , nor ask a reason save the <unk> she grants to us as granted by her god  but , <name> , than thine gray time <unk> never his <name> wing o'er fairer world !
dim was its little disk , and <name> eyes alone could see the phantom in the skies , when first <name> aaraaf knew her course to be headlong <unk> o'er the starry sea  but when its <name> swelled upon the sky , as glowing beauty 's bust beneath man 's eye , we paused before the heritage of men , and thy <name> trembled  as doth beauty then ! "
thus in discourse , the lovers <unk> away the night that waned and waned and brought no day .
they fell : for heaven to them no <name> imparts who hear not for the beating of their hearts .

kind solace in a dying hour !
such , father , is not ( now ) my theme  i <name> not madly deem that power of earth may <unk> me of the sin unearthly pride hath revelled in  i have no time to <unk> or dream : you call it <name>  that fire of fire !
it is but agony of <name> : if i can <name>  o god !
i can  its <unk> is <unk>  more divine  i would not call thee fool , old man , but such is not a gift of thine .
know thou the secret of a spirit bowed from its wild pride into shame o yearning heart !
i did inherit thy withering portion with the fame , the <unk> <name> which hath shone amid the jewels of my throne , halo of hell !
and with a pain not hell shall make me fear again  o craving heart , for the lost flowers and <name> of my summer hours !
the undying voice of that dead time , with its interminable chime , rings , in the spirit of a spell , upon thy emptiness  a knell .
i have not always been as now : the fevered <unk> on my brow i claimed and won <unk>  hath not the same fierce <unk> given rome to the cæsar  this to me ?
the heritage of a kingly mind , and a proud spirit which hath striven triumphantly with human kind .
on mountain soil i first <name> life : the mists of the <unk> have shed nightly their dews upon my head , and , i believe , the winged strife and tumult of the headlong air have nestled in my very hair .
so late from heaven  that dew  it fell ( 'mid dreams of an unholy night ) upon me with the touch of hell , while the red flashing of the light from clouds that <name> , like banners , o'er , appeared to my <unk> eye the pageantry of monarchy ; and the deep <unk> 's roar came hurriedly upon me , telling of human battle , where my voice , my own voice , silly child !  was swelling ( o !
how my spirit would rejoice , and leap within me at the cry ) the <unk> of victory !
the rain came down upon my head <unk>  and the heavy wind rendered me mad and deaf and blind .
it was but man , i thought , who shed laurels upon me : and the rush  the torrent of the chilly air gurgled within my ear the crush of empires  with the captive 's prayer  the hum of suitors  and the tone of flattery 'round a sovereign 's throne .
my passions , from that hapless hour , usurped a tyranny which men have deemed since i have reached to power , my innate nature  be it so : but , father , there lived one who , then , then  in my boyhood  when their fire burned with a still <unk> glow ( for passion must , with youth , expire ) e'en then who knew this iron heart in woman 's weakness had a part .
i have no words  alas !  to tell the loveliness of loving well !
nor would i now attempt to trace the more than beauty of a face whose <unk> , upon my mind , are  shadows on th ' unstable wind : thus i remember having dwelt some <name> of early <name> upon , with loitering eye , till i have felt the letters  with their meaning  melt to <unk>  with none .
o , she was worthy of all love !
love as in infancy was mine  't was such as <name> minds above might envy ; her young heart the shrine on which my every <name> and thought were incense  then a goodly gift , for they were childish and upright  pure  as her young example taught : why did i leave it , and , adrift , trust to the fire within , for light ?
we grew in age  and love  together  roaming the forest , and the wild ; my breast her shield in wintry weather  and , when the friendly <name> smiled .
and she would <name> the opening skies , i saw no heaven  but in her eyes .
young love 's first lesson is   the heart : for 'mid that <name> , and those smiles , when , from our little cares apart , and laughing at her girlish wiles , i 'd throw me on her throbbing breast , and pour my spirit out in tears  there was no need to speak the rest  no need to quiet any fears of her  who asked no reason why , but turned on me her quiet eye !
yet more than worthy of the love my spirit struggled with , and strove when , on the mountain peak , alone , ambition lent it a new tone  i had no being  but in thee : the world , and all it did contain in the earth  the air  the sea  its <name>  its little lot of pain that was new pleasure  the ideal , dim , vanities of dreams by night  and <unk> <unk> which were real  ( shadows  and a more shadowy light ! )
parted upon their <name> wings , and , so , confusedly , became thine image and  a name  a name !
two separate  yet most intimate things .
i was ambitious  have you known the passion , father ?
you have not : a <unk> , i marked a throne of half the world as all my own , and murmured at such lowly lot  but , just like any other dream , upon the vapor of the dew my own had past , did not the beam of beauty which did while it <unk> the minute  the hour  the day  oppress my mind with double loveliness .
we walked together on the crown of a high mountain which looked down afar from its proud natural towers of rock and forest , on the hills  the dwindled hills !
<unk> with bowers and shouting with a thousand <unk> .
i spoke to her of power and pride , but <unk>  in such guise that she might deem it nought beside the moment 's converse ; in her eyes i read , perhaps too carelessly  a mingled feeling with my own  the flush on her bright cheek , to me seemed to become a queenly throne too well that i should let it be light in the wilderness alone .
i wrapped myself in grandeur then , and donned a visionary crown  yet it was not that <unk> had thrown her mantle over me  but that , among the rabble  men , lion ambition is chained down  and <unk> to a keeper 's hand  not so in deserts where the grand  the wild  the terrible conspire with their own breath to fan his fire .
look 'round thee now on <unk> !  is she not <name> of earth ?
her pride above all cities ?
in her hand their destinies ?
in all beside of <name> which the world hath known stands she not nobly and alone ?
falling  her veriest <unk> shall form the pedestal of a throne  and who her sovereign ?
<unk>  he whom the astonished people saw striding o'er empires haughtily a <unk> outlaw !
o , human love !
thou spirit given , on earth , of all we <name> in heaven !
which <unk> into the soul like rain upon the <unk> plain , and , failing in thy power to bless , but <unk> the heart a wilderness !
idea !
which <unk> life around with music of so strange a sound and beauty of so wild a birth  farewell !
for i have won the earth .
when <name> , the eagle that towered , could see no <name> beyond him in the sky , his pinions were bent <unk>  and homeward turned his softened eye .
't was sunset : when the sun <name> part there comes a <unk> of heart to him who still would look upon the <name> of the summer sun .
that soul <name> hate the <unk> mist so often lovely , and <name> list to the sound of the coming darkness ( known to those whose spirits hearken ) as one who , in a dream of night , would fly , but cannot , from a danger nigh .
what tho ' the moon  tho ' the white moon shed all the splendor of her noon , her smile is chilly  and her beam , in that time of <unk> , <name> seem ( so like you gather in your breath ) a portrait taken after death .
and boyhood is a summer sun whose waning is the <unk> one  for all we live to know is known , and all we seek to keep hath flown  let life , then , as the <unk> , fall with the <unk> beauty  which is all .
i reached my home  my home no more  for all had flown who made it so .
i passed from out its mossy door , and , tho ' my tread was soft and low , a voice came from the threshold stone of one whom i had earlier known  o , i defy thee , hell , to show on beds of fire that burn below , an humbler heart  a deeper woe .
father , i firmly do believe  i know  for death who comes for me from regions of the blest afar , where there is nothing to deceive , hath left his iron gate ajar .
and rays of truth you can not see are flashing thro ' eternity   i do believe that eblis hath a snare in every human path  else how , when in the holy grove i wandered of the idol , love ,  who daily scents his snowy wings with incense of <unk> from the most <unk> things , whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven above with <unk> rays from heaven no <unk> may shun  no <unk> fly  the <unk> of his eagle eye  how was it that ambition crept , unseen , amid the revels there , till growing bold , he laughed and <unk> in the <unk> of love 's very hair !

ah , by no wind those clouds are driven that rustle through the unquiet heaven unceasingly , from morn till even , over the violets there that lie in myriad types of the human eye  over the lilies that wave and weep above a nameless grave !

yes , heaven is thine ; but this is a world of sweets and <unk> ; our flowers are merely  flowers , and the shadow of thy perfect bliss is the <name> of ours .

that blush , perhaps , was maiden shame  as such it well may pass  though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame in the breast of him , alas !

thy soul shall find itself alone 'mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone not one , of all the crowd , to pry into thine hour of secrecy .
be silent in that solitude which is not loneliness  for then the spirits of the dead who stood in life before thee are again in death around thee  and their <name> shall <unk> thee : be still .
the night  tho ' clear  shall frown  and the stars shall not look down from their high thrones in the heaven , with light like <name> to mortals given  but their red orbs , without beam , to thy weariness shall seem as a burning and a fever which would cling to thee forever .
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish  now are visions ne'er to vanish  from thy spirit shall they pass no more  like <unk> from the grass .

that holy dream  that holy dream , while all the world were <unk> , hath cheered me as a lovely beam , a lonely spirit guiding .

of late , eternal condor years so shake the very heaven on high with tumult as they thunder by , i have no time for idle cares though gazing on the unquiet sky .

* * * * * fairyland .
dim <unk>  and shadowy floods  and <unk> woods , whose forms we ca n't discover for the tears that drip all over huge moons there wax and <unk>  again  again  again  every moment of the night  forever changing places  and they put out the <unk> with the breath from their pale faces .
about twelve by the <unk> one more filmy than the rest ( a kind which , upon trial , they have found to be the best ) comes down  still down  and down with its centre on the crown of a mountain 's eminence , while its wide circumference in easy drapery falls over hamlets , over halls , wherever they may be  o'er the strange woods  o'er the sea  over spirits on the wing  over every drowsy thing  and buries them up quite in a labyrinth of light  and then , how deep !  o , deep !
is the passion of their sleep .
in the morning they arise , and their <unk> covering is soaring in the skies , with the tempests as they toss , like  almost any thing  or a yellow albatross .
they use that moon no more for the same end as before  <unk> a tent  which i think extravagant : its <unk> , however , into a shower <unk> , of which those butterflies , of earth , who seek the skies , and so come down again ( <unk> thing ! )
have brought a specimen upon their quivering wings .
1831 * * * * * the lake .
in spring of youth it was my lot to haunt of the wide world a spot the which i could not love the less  so lovely was the loneliness of a wild lake , with black rock bound , and the tall pines that towered around .
but when the night had thrown her pall upon the spot , as upon all , and the mystic wind went by murmuring in <name>  then  ah , then , i would awake to the terror of the lone lake .
yet that terror was not fright , but a tremulous delight  a feeling not the jewelled mine could teach or bribe me to define  nor love  although the love were thine .
death was in that poisonous wave , and in its gulf a fitting grave for him who thence could solace bring to his lone imagining  whose solitary soul could make an <name> of that dim lake .

i gazed awhile on her cold smile ; too cold  too cold for me  there passed , as a shroud , a fleecy cloud , and i turned away to thee , proud evening <name> , in thy <name> afar and dearer thy beam shall be ; for <name> to my heart is the proud part thou <unk> in heaven at night , and more i admire thy distant fire , than that colder , lowly light .

* * * * * imitation .
a dark <unk> tide of interminable pride  a mystery , and a dream , should my early life seem ; i say that dream was fraught with a wild and waking thought of beings that have been , which my spirit hath not seen , had i let them pass me by , with a dreaming eye !
let none of earth inherit that vision on my spirit ; those thoughts i would control , as a spell upon his soul : for that bright <name> at last and that light time have past , and my <unk> rest hath gone with a sigh as it passed on : i care not though it perish with a thought i then did <name> .

oh !
that my young life were a lasting dream !
my spirit not awakening , till the beam of an eternity should bring the morrow .
yes !
though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow , 'twere better than the cold reality of waking life , to him whose heart must be , and hath been still , upon the lovely earth , a chaos of deep passion , from his birth .
but should it be  that dream eternally continuing  as dreams have been to me in my young boyhood  should it thus be given , 'twere folly still to <name> for higher heaven .
for i have revelled when the sun was bright i ' the summer sky , in dreams of living light and loveliness ,  have left my very heart inclines of my imaginary apart [ 1 ] from mine own home , with beings that have been of mine own thought  what more could i have seen ?
't was once  and only once  and the wild hour from my remembrance shall not pass  some power or spell had bound me  't was the chilly wind came o'er me in the night , and left behind its image on my spirit  or the moon shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon too coldly  or the stars  <unk> it was that dream was that that <unk>  let it pass .
i have been happy , though in a dream .
i have been happy  and i love the theme : dreams !
in their vivid coloring of life as in that fleeting , shadowy , <name> strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye , more lovely things of paradise and love  and all my own !  than young <name> in his <unk> hour hath known .
[ footnote 1 : in climes of mine imagining apart ?  <name> . ]
* * * * * " in youth i have known one . "
how often we forget all time , when lone admiring nature 's universal throne ; her woods  her wilds  her mountains  the intense reply of hers to our intelligence !  i .
in youth i have known one with whom the earth in secret <unk> held  as he with it , in daylight , and in beauty , from his birth : whose <unk> , flickering torch of life was lit from the sun and stars , whence he had drawn forth a passionate light such for his spirit was fit  and yet that spirit knew  not in the hour of its own fervor  what had o'er it power .
ii .
perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought to a <unk> [ 1 ] by the <unk> that hangs o'er , but i <name> half believe that wild light fraught with more of sovereignty than ancient <name> hath ever told  or is it of a thought the <unk> essence , and no more that with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass as dew of the <unk> , o'er the summer grass ?
iii .
doth o'er us pass , when , as th ' expanding eye to the loved object  so the tear to the lid <name> start , which lately slept in apathy ?
and yet it need not be  ( that object ) hid from us in life  but common  which doth lie each hour before us  but then only bid with a strange sound , as of a <unk> broken t ' awake us  't is a symbol and a token  iv .
of what in other worlds shall be  and given in beauty by our god , to those alone who otherwise would fall from life and heaven drawn by their heart 's passion , and that tone , that high tone of the spirit which hath striven though not with <name>  with <unk>  whose throne with desperate energy 't hath beaten down ; wearing its own deep feeling as a crown .

how shall the burial rite be read ?

the <unk> for the loveliest dead , that ever died so young ?
ii .
her friends are gazing on her , and on her gaudy bier , and weep !  oh !
to dishonor dead beauty with a tear !
iii .
they loved her for her wealth  and they hated her for her pride  but she grew in feeble health , and they love her  that she died .
iv .
they tell me ( while they speak of her " costly <unk> 'd pall " ) that my voice is growing weak  that i should not sing at all  v. or that my tone should be <unk> 'd to such solemn song so mournfully  so mournfully , that the dead may feel no wrong .
<name> .
but she is gone above , with young <name> at her side , and i am drunk with love of the dead , who is my <unk>  vii .
of the dead  dead who lies all <unk> 'd there , with the death upon her eyes .
and the life upon her hair .
viii .
thus on the coffin loud and long i strike  the murmur sent through the gray chambers to my song , shall be the accompaniment .

on the " poems written in youth " little comment is needed .
this section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 ( which was subsequently suppressed ) , such poems from the first and second published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised <unk> , and a few others collected from various sources .
" <name> aaraaf " first appeared , with the sonnet " to silence " <unk> to it , in 1829 , and is , substantially , as originally issued .
in the edition for 1831 , however , this poem , its author 's longest , was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines , which have been omitted in all subsequent collections : <name> aaraaf .
mysterious <name> !
thou wert my dream all a long summer night  be now my theme !
by this clear stream , of thee <name> i write ; meantime from afar bathe me in light !
thy world has not the dross of ours , yet all the beauty  all the flowers that list our love or deck our bowers in dreamy gardens , where do lie dreamy maidens all the day ; while the silver winds of <unk> on <name> couches faint away .
little  oh !
little dwells in thee like unto what on earth we see : beauty 's eye is here the <unk> in the <unk> and <unk>  on the sweetest air doth float the most sad and solemn note  if with thee be broken hearts , <name> so peacefully departs , that its <name> still doth dwell , like the murmur in the shell .
thou !
thy truest type of grief is the gently falling leaf  thou !
thy framing is so holy sorrow is not melancholy .
* * * * * 31 .
the earliest version of " <unk> " was included in the suppressed volume of 1827 , but differs very considerably from the poem as now published .
the present draft , besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original , is more carefully <unk> , and , the lines being indented , presents a more pleasing appearance , to the eye at least .
* * * * * 32 .
" to <name> " first appeared in the 1831 volume , as did also " the valley of unrest " ( as " the valley <unk> " ) , " <unk> , " and one or two others of the youthful pieces .
the poem styled " romance " constituted the preface of the 1829 volume , but with the addition of the following lines : succeeding years , too wild for song , then rolled like tropic storms along , where , though the <unk> lights that fly dying along the troubled sky , lay bare , through vistas <unk> , the blackness of the general heaven , that very blackness yet doth fling light on the lightning 's silver wing .
for being an idle boy <name> syne , who read <unk> and drank wine , i early found <unk> rhymes were almost passionate sometimes  and by strange <unk> of <name> his pleasures always turned to pain  his <unk> to wild <name>  his wit to love  his wine to fire  and so , being young and <unk> in folly , i fell in love with melancholy .
and used to throw my earthly rest and quiet all away in jest  i could not love except where death was mingling his with beauty 's breath  or <unk> , time , and <name> , were stalking between her and me .
* * * * * but now my soul hath too much room  gone are the <name> and the gloom  the black hath mellow 'd into gray , and all the fires are fading away .
my draught of passion hath been deep  i <unk> 'd , and i now would sleep  and after drunkenness of soul succeeds the glories of the bowl  an idle longing night and day to dream my very life away .
but dreams  of those who dream as i , <unk> , are damned , and die : yet should i swear i mean alone , by notes so very shrilly blown , to break upon time 's monotone , while yet my <unk> <name> and grief are <unk> of the yellow leaf  why not an imp the <unk> hath , <name> shake his shadow in my path  and e'en the <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> my <unk> .
* * * * * doubtful poems .
* * * * * alone .
from childhood 's hour i have not been as others were  i have not seen as others saw  i could not bring my passions from a common spring  from the same source i have not taken my sorrow  i could not awaken my heart to <name> at the same tone  and all i loved  i loved alone  thou  in my childhood  in the <name> of a most <name> life  was drawn from every depth of good and ill the mystery which binds me still  from the torrent , or the fountain  from the red <name> of the mountain  from the sun that round me <unk> in its autumn tint of gold  from the lightning in the sky as it passed me flying by  from the thunder and the storm  and the cloud that took the form ( when the rest of heaven was blue ) of a demon in my view .

beneath the <unk> eaves , whose shadows fall before thy lowly cottage door  under the lilac 's tremulous leaves  within thy snowy clasped hand the purple flowers it bore .
last <name> in dreams , i saw thee stand , like queenly <unk> from <unk>  <unk> of the flowery wand , most <unk> <unk> !
ii .
and when i bade the dream upon thy spirit flee , thy <name> eyes to me upturned , did overflowing seem with the deep , untold delight of love 's serenity ; thy classic brow , like lilies white and pale as the imperial night upon her throne , with stars <unk> , <unk> my soul to thee !
iii .
ah !
ever i behold thy dreamy , passionate eyes , blue as the languid skies <name> with the sunset 's fringe of gold ; now strangely clear thine image grows , and olden memories are startled from their long repose like shadows on the silent snows when suddenly the <unk> blows where quiet moonlight lies .
iv .
like music heard in dreams , like strains of <unk> unknown , of birds for ever flown ,  audible as the voice of streams that murmur in some leafy <name> , i hear thy gentlest tone , and silence cometh with her spell like that which on my tongue doth dwell , when tremulous in dreams i tell my love to thee alone !
v. in every valley heard , floating from tree to tree , less beautiful to me , the music of the radiant bird , than artless accents such as thine whose echoes never flee !
ah !
how for thy sweet voice i pine :  for uttered in thy tones benign ( <unk> ! )
this rude name of mine doth seem a <name> !
* * * * * the village street .
in these rapid , restless shadows , once i walked at eventide , when a gentle , silent maiden , walked in beauty at my side .
she alone there walked beside me all in beauty , like a bride .
<unk> the moon was shining on the dewy meadows nigh ; on the silvery , silent rivers , on the mountains far and high ,  on the ocean 's <unk> waters , where the winds <unk> die .
slowly , silently we wandered from the open cottage door , underneath the elm 's long branches to the pavement bending o'er ; underneath the mossy <name> and the dying <unk> .
with the myriad stars in beauty all <unk> , the heavens were seen , radiant hopes were bright around me , like the light of stars serene ; like the mellow midnight splendor of the night 's <unk> <name> .
audibly the <unk> whispered peaceful , pleasant melodies , like the distant murmured music of unquiet , lovely seas ; while the winds were hushed in slumber in the fragrant flowers and trees .
wondrous and unwonted beauty still adorning all did seem , while i told my love in fables 'neath the willows by the stream ; would the heart have kept unspoken love that was its rarest dream !
instantly away we wandered in the shadowy twilight tide , she , the silent , scornful maiden , walking calmly at my side , with a step serene and stately , all in beauty , all in pride .
vacantly i walked beside her .
on the earth mine eyes were cast ; swift and keen there came unto me bitter memories of the past  on me , like the rain in autumn on the dead leaves , cold and fast .
underneath the elms we parted , by the lowly cottage door ; one brief word alone was uttered  never on our lips before ; and away i walked <unk> , broken-hearted evermore .
slowly , silently i loitered , homeward , in the night , alone ; sudden anguish bound my spirit , that my youth had never known ; wild unrest , like that which cometh when the night 's first dream hath flown .
now , to me the <unk> whisper mad , discordant melodies , and keen melodies like shadows haunt the moaning <name> trees , and the sycamores with laughter mock me in the nightly breeze .
sad and pale the autumn moonlight through the sighing foliage streams ; and each morning , midnight shadow , shadow of my sorrow seems ; strive , o heart , forget thine idol !
and , o soul , forget thy dreams !
* * * * * the forest reverie .
't is said that when the hands of men tamed this primeval wood , and hoary trees with groans of wo , like warriors by an unknown foe , were in their strength subdued , the virgin earth gave instant birth to springs that ne'er did flow  that in the sun did rivulets run , and all around rare flowers did blow  the wild rose pale perfumed the <name> , and the queenly <name> <unk> the <name> ( whom the sun and the dew and the winds did woo ) , with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew .
so when in tears the love of years is wasted like the snow , and the fine <unk> of its life by the rude wrong of instant strife are broken at a blow  within the heart do springs upstart of which it doth now know , and strange , sweet dreams , like silent streams that from new fountains overflow , with the earlier tide of rivers glide deep in the heart whose <name> has died  <unk> the fires its ashes hide ,  its ashes , whence <name> spring and grow sweet flowers , ere long ,  the rare and radiant flowers of song !
* * * * * notes .
of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of <name> poe , and not included among his known writings , the lines entitled " alone " have the chief claim to our notice .
<unk> ' copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in <unk> 's magazine ' for <name> 1875 ; but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming , he refrained from publishing it as requested .
the desired proofs have not yet been adduced , and there is , at present , nothing but internal evidence to guide us .
" alone " is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore <name> ( mrs .
<unk> ?
) , on march 17th , 1829 , and the <unk> ' given in <unk> 's ' is alleged to be of his handwriting .
if the <unk> be poe 's , it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us , and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and <unk> of the manuscript , both of which the <unk> of the poem <unk> to have been recently added .
the lines , however , if not by poe , are the most successful imitation of his early <unk> yet made public , and , in the opinion of one well qualified to speak , " are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them . "
whilst <name> poe was editor of the <unk> journal ' , some lines " to <unk> " appeared therein , and , like several of his known pieces , bore no signature .
they were at once ascribed to poe , and in order to satisfy <unk> , an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared , saying they were by " a. <unk> , <name> . "
two previous poems had appeared in the <unk> journal ' over the signature of " a. m. <unk> , " and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines " to <unk> . "
in order , doubtless , to give a show of variety , poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over <unk> de plume ' , and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of " a. m. <unk> , " it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of " the <name> . "
having been published without his usual elaborate revision , poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name .
the three pieces are included in the present collection , so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of " the <name> . "

" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> est . "
<unk> .
" la <unk> , " says <unk> , in those " <unk> <unk> " [ 1 ] which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling " moral tales , " as if in mockery of their spirit  " la <unk> est <name> <unk> des <unk> qui <unk> de <unk> : tous <name> <unk> <unk> des <unk> . "
he here <unk> the pleasure <unk> from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them .
no more than any other talent , is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise ; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude .
the idea which the <unk> has either failed to entertain clearly , or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point , is doubtless the very <unk> one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone .
the proposition in this form <name> be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses .
but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality , and perhaps only one , which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion .
i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery .
in truth , the man who would behold aright the <name> of god upon earth must in solitude behold that <name> .
to me at least the presence , not of human life only , but of life , in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless , is a stain upon the landscape , is at war with the genius of the scene .
i love , indeed , to regard the dark valleys , and the gray rocks , and the waters that silently smile , and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers , and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all ,  i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and <unk> whole  a whole whose form ( that of the sphere ) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all ; whose path is among associate planets ; whose meek <unk> is the moon ; whose <unk> sovereign is the sun ; whose life is eternity ; whose thought is that of a god ; whose enjoyment is knowledge ; whose destinies are lost in immensity ; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the <unk> which infest the <name> , a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material , much in the same manner as these <unk> must thus regard us .
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand , notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the <unk> , that space , and therefore that bulk , is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty .
the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution , without collision , of the greatest possible number of bodies .
the forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter ; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged .
nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god that space itself is infinite ; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it ; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle  indeed , as far as our judgments extend , the leading principle in the operations of deity , it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute , where we daily trace it , and not extending to those of the <name> .
as we find cycle within cycle without end , yet all revolving around one <unk> centre which is the <unk> , may we not <unk> suppose , in the same manner , life within life , the less within the greater , and all within the spirit divine ?
in short , we are madly erring through <unk> in believing man , in either his temporal or future destinies , to be of more moment in the universe than that vast " clod of the valley " which he <unk> and <unk> , and to which he denies a soul , for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation [ 2 ] .
these fancies , and such as these , have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests , by the rivers and the ocean , a tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic .
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and <unk> , and often solitary ; and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim deep valley , or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake , has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed <unk> what flippant frenchman [ 3 ] was it who said , in allusion to the well known work of <unk> , that  " la solitude est une <name> chose ; mais il <unk> <unk> pour vous dire que la solitude est une <name> chose "  ?
the <unk> can not be <unk> ; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist .
it was during one of my lonely <unk> , amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain , and sad rivers and melancholy <unk> writhing or sleeping within all , that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island .
i came upon them suddenly in the leafy <name> , and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub , that i might doze as i contemplated the scene .
i felt that thus only should i look upon it , such was the character of <unk> which it wore .
on all sides , save to the west where the sun was about sinking , arose the verdant walls of the forest .
the little river which turned sharply in its course , and was thus immediately lost to sight , seemed to have no exit from its prison , but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east ; while in the opposite quarter ( so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward ) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a <name> golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky .
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in , one small circular island , profusely <unk> , reposed upon the bosom of the stream .
so blended bank and shadow there , that each seemed pendulous in air  so <unk> was the glassy water , that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the <name> turf its <name> dominion began .
my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet , and i observed a <unk> difference in their aspects .
the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties .
it glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight , and fairly laughed with flowers .
the grass was short , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
the trees were lithe , mirthful , erect , bright , slender , and graceful , of eastern figure and foliage , with bark smooth , glossy , and <unk> .
there seemed a deep sense of life and <name> about all , and although no airs blew from out the heavens , yet everything had motion through the gentle <unk> to and fro of innumerable butterflies , that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings [ 4 ] .
the other or eastern end of the isle was <unk> in the blackest shade .
a sombre , yet beautiful and peaceful gloom , here pervaded all things .
the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude  <unk> themselves into sad , solemn , and spectral shapes , that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death .
the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress , and the heads of its blades <name> <unk> , and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks , low and narrow , and not very long , that had the aspect of graves , but were not , although over and all about them the rue and the <name> clambered .
the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water , and seemed to bury itself therein , <unk> the depths of the element with darkness .
i fancied that each shadow , as the sun descended lower and lower , separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth , and thus became absorbed by the stream , while other shadows issued momently from the trees , taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed .
this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it , and i lost myself forthwith in reverie .
" if ever island were enchanted , " said i to myself , " this is it .
this is the haunt of the few gentle <unk> who remain from the wreck of the race .
are these green tombs theirs ?  or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own ?
in dying , do they not rather waste away mournfully , rendering unto god little by little their existence , as these trees render up shadow after shadow , exhausting their substance unto dissolution ?
what the wasting tree is to the water that <unk> its shade , growing thus blacker by what it preys upon , may not the life of the <name> be to the death which <unk> it ? "
as i thus mused , with half-shut eyes , while the sun sank rapidly to rest , and <unk> currents <unk> round and round the island , bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the <unk> , flakes which , in their multiform positions upon the water , a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased ; while i thus mused , it appeared to me that the form of one of those very <unk> about whom i had been pondering , made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island .
she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe , and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar .
while within the influence of the lingering <unk> , her attitude seemed indicative of <name> , but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade .
slowly she glided along , and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light .
" the revolution which has just been made by the <name> , " continued i musingly , " is the cycle of the brief year of her life .
she has floated through her <name> and through her summer .
she is a year nearer unto death : for i did not fail to see that as she came into the shade , her shadow fell from her , and was swallowed up in the dark water , making its blackness more black . "
and again the boat appeared and the <name> , but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic <name> .
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom ( which deepened momently ) , and again her shadow fell from her into the <name> water , and became absorbed into its blackness .
and again and again she made the circuit of the island ( while the sun rushed down to his slumbers ) , and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person , while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct , and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade , which became <unk> in a shadow more black .
but at length , when the sun had utterly departed , the <name> , now the mere ghost of her former self , went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the <name> flood , and that she issued thence at all i can not say , for darkness fell over all things , and i beheld her magical figure no more .

'oinos . '
pardon , agathos , the weakness of a spirit <unk> with immortality !
'agathos . '
you have spoken nothing , my oinos , for which pardon is to be demanded .
not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition .
for wisdom , ask of the angels freely , that it may be given !
'oinos . '
but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of all things , and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all .
'agathos . '
ah , not in knowledge is happiness , but in the acquisition of knowledge !
in forever knowing , we are forever blessed ; but to know all , were the curse of a fiend .
'oinos . '
but does not the most high know all ?
'agathos ' .
that ( since he is the most happy ) must be still the one thing unknown even to him .
'oinos . '
but , since we grow hourly in knowledge , must not at last all things be known ?
'agathos . '
look down into the <unk> distances !  attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars , as we sweep slowly through them thus  and thus  and thus !
even the spiritual vision , is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe ?  the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity ?
'oinos ' .
i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream .
'agathos ' .
there are no dreams in aidenn  but it is here whispered that , of this infinity of matter , the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever <unk> within it  since to <unk> it would be to extinguish the soul 's self .
question me then , my oinos , freely and without fear .
come !
we <name> leave to the left the loud <name> of the <unk> , and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion , where , for pansies and violets , and <unk> , are the beds of the <unk> and <unk> suns .
'oinos ' .
and now , agathos , as we proceed , instruct me !  speak to me in the earth 's familiar tones !
i understand not what you hinted to me just now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality , we were accustomed to call creation .
do you mean to say that the creator is not god ?
'agathos ' .
i mean to say that the deity does not create .
'oinos ' .
explain !
'agathos ' .
in the beginning only , he created .
the seeming creatures which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only be considered as the <unk> or indirect , not as the direct or immediate results of the divine creative power .
'oinos . '
among men , my agathos , this idea would be considered <unk> in the extreme .
'agathos . '
among the angels , my oinos , it is seen to be simply true .
'oinos . '
i can comprehend you thus far  that certain operations of what we term nature , or the natural laws , <name> , under certain conditions , give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation .
shortly before the final overthrow of the earth , there were , i well remember , many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to <unk> the creation of <unk> .
'agathos . '
the cases of which you speak were , in fact , instances of the secondary creation , and of the only species of creation which has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the first law .
'oinos . '
are not the starry worlds that , from the abyss of <unk> , burst hourly forth into the heavens  are not these stars , agathos , the immediate handiwork of the king ?
'agathos . '
let me endeavor , my oinos , to lead you , step by step , to the <name> i intend .
you are well aware that , as no thought can perish , so no act is without infinite result .
we moved our hands , for example , when we were dwellers on the earth , and in so doing we gave vibration to the atmosphere which <unk> it .
this vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth 's air , which thenceforward , and forever , was actuated by the one movement of the hand .
this fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew .
they made the special effects , indeed , wrought in the fluid by special impulses , the subject of exact calculation  so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would <unk> the orb , and impress ( forever ) every atom of the atmosphere <unk> .
<unk> , they found no difficulty ; from a given effect , under given conditions , in determining the value of the original impulse .
now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless  and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of <unk> analysis  who saw , too , the facility of the <unk>  these men saw , at the same time , that this species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress  that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and <unk> , except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it .
but at this point our mathematicians paused .
'oinos . '
and why , agathos , should they have proceeded ?
'agathos . '
because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond .
it was <unk> from what they knew , that to a being of infinite understanding  one to whom the perfection of the <unk> analysis lay unfolded  there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air  and the ether through the air  to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time .
it is indeed <unk> that every such impulse given the air , must in the end impress every individual thing that exists within the universe ;   and the being of infinite understanding  the being whom we have imagined  might trace the remote undulations of the impulse  trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of all matter  upward and onward forever in their modifications of old forms  or , in other words , in their creation of new  until he found them reflected  <unk> at last  back from the throne of the <unk> .
and not only could such a being do this , but at any epoch , should a given result be afforded him  should one of these numberless comets , for example , be presented to his inspection  he could have no difficulty in determining , by the <unk> <unk> , to what original impulse it was due .
this power of <unk> in its absolute fulness and perfection  this faculty of referring at all epochs , all effects to all causes  is of course the prerogative of the deity alone  but in every variety of degree , short of the absolute perfection , is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the <name> <unk> .
'oinos ' .
but you speak merely of impulses upon the air .
'agathos ' .
in speaking of the air , i referred only to the earth : but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether  which , since it pervades , and alone pervades all space , is thus the great medium of creation .
'oinos ' .
then all motion , of whatever nature , creates ?
'agathos ' .
it must : but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought  and the source of all thought is  'oinos ' .
god .
'agathos ' .
i have spoken to you , oinos , as to a child , of the fair earth which lately perished  of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth .
'oinos ' .
you did .
'agathos ' .
and while i thus spoke , did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words ?
is not every word an impulse on the air ?
'oinos ' .
but why , agathos , do you weep  and why , oh , why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair <name>  which is the <unk> and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight ?
its brilliant flowers look like a <name> dream  but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart .
'agathos ' .
they are !  they are !  this wild <name>  it is now three centuries since , with clasped hands , and with streaming eyes , at the feet of my beloved  i spoke it  with a few passionate sentences  into birth .
its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all <unk> dreams , and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and <unk> of hearts !
* * * * * the colloquy of <unk> and <name> .
[ greek : <unk> <unk> ' ] these things are in the future .
sophocles  <unk> . '
<unk> . '
" born again ? "
<unk> . '
yes , fairest and best beloved <name> , " born again . "
these were the words upon whose <unk> meaning i had so long pondered , rejecting the explanations of the <unk> , until death itself resolved for me the secret .
<unk> . '
death !
<unk> . '
how strangely , sweet <name> , you <name> my words !
i observe , too , a <unk> in your step , a joyous <unk> in your eyes .
you are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal .
yes , it was of death i spoke .
and here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts , throwing a mildew upon all pleasures !
<unk> . '
ah , death , the spectre which sate at all feasts !
how often , <unk> , did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature !
how mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss , saying unto it , " thus far , and no farther ! "
that <name> mutual love , my own <unk> , which burned within our bosoms , how vainly did we flatter ourselves , feeling happy in its first <unk> that our happiness would strengthen with its strength !
alas , as it grew , so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever !
thus in time it became painful to love .
hate would have been <name> then .
<unk> ' .
speak not here of these griefs , dear <name>  mine , mine forever now !
<unk> ' .
but the memory of past sorrow , is it not present <name> ?
i have much to say yet of the things which have been .
above all , i burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow .
<unk> ' .
and when did the radiant <name> ask anything of her <unk> in vain ?
i <name> be minute in relating all , but at what point shall the weird narrative begin ?
<unk> ' .
at what point ?
<unk> ' .
you have said .
<unk> ' .
<unk> , i comprehend you .
in death we have both learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable .
i <name> not say , then , commence with the moment of life 's cessation  but commence with that sad , sad instant when , the fever having abandoned you , you sank into a breathless and motionless <unk> , and i pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love .
<unk> ' .
one word first , my <name> , in regard to man 's general condition at this epoch .
you <name> remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers  wise in fact , although not in the world 's esteem  had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term " improvement , " as applied to the progress of our civilization .
there were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous intellect , boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now , to our <unk> reason , so utterly obvious  principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control .
at long intervals some <unk> appeared , looking upon each advance in practical science as a <unk> in the true utility .
occasionally the poetic intellect  that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all  since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in <unk> to the imagination alone , and to the unaided reason bears no weight  occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic , and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge , and of its forbidden fruit , <unk> , a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul .
and these men  the poets  living and perishing amid the scorn of the " <unk> "  of rough <unk> , who <unk> to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned  these men , the poets , pondered <unk> , yet not <unk> , upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen  days when mirth was a word unknown , so solemnly <unk> was happiness  holy , <name> , and blissful days , blue rivers ran <unk> , between hills <unk> , into far forest solitudes , primeval , odorous , and unexplored .
yet these <name> exceptions from the general <unk> served but to strengthen it by opposition .
alas !
we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days .
the great " movement "  that was the cant term  went on : a diseased commotion , moral and physical .
<name>  the arts  arose supreme , and once <unk> , cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power .
man , because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of nature , fell into childish exultation at his acquired and <unk> dominion over her elements .
even while he stalked a god in his own fancy , an <unk> imbecility came over him .
as might be supposed from the origin of his disorder , he grew infected with system , and with abstraction .
he <unk> himself in <unk> .
among other odd ideas , that of universal equality gained ground ; and in the face of analogy and of god  in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in earth and heaven  wild attempts at an <unk> democracy were made .
yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil , knowledge .
man could not both know and succumb .
meantime huge smoking cities arose , innumerable .
green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces .
the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease .
and methinks , sweet <name> , even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the <unk> might have arrested us here .
but now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste , or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools .
for , in truth , it was at this crisis that taste alone  that faculty which , holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense , could never safely have been disregarded  it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to beauty , to nature , and to life .
but alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato !
alas for the [ greek : <unk> ] which he justly regarded as an <unk> education for the soul !
alas for him and for it !  since both were most desperately needed , when both were most entirely forgotten or despised [ 1 ] .
<unk> , a philosopher whom we both love , has said , how truly !  " que tout notre <unk> se <unk> à <unk> au sentiment ;  " and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural , had time permitted it , would have regained its old ascendency over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools .
but this thing was not to be .
prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge , the old age of the world <name> near .
this the mass of mankind saw not , or , living lustily although unhappily , affected not to see .
but , for myself , the earth 's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization .
i had imbibed a <unk> of our fate from comparison of <name> the simple and enduring , with <unk> the architect , with egypt the astrologer , with <name> , more crafty than either , the turbulent mother of all arts .
in the history of these regions i met with a <name> from the future .
the individual <unk> of the three latter were local diseases of the earth , and in their individual <unk> we had seen local remedies applied ; but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save in death .
that man , as a race , should not become extinct , i saw that he must be " born <unk> " and now it was , fairest and dearest , that we wrapped our spirits , daily , in dreams .
now it was that , in twilight , we discoursed of the days to come , when the <unk> surface of the earth , having undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular <unk> , should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the <unk> and the smiling waters of paradise , and be rendered at length a fit <unk> for man :  for man the <unk>  for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more  for the redeemed , <unk> , blissful , and now immortal , but still for the material , man .
<unk> ' .
well do i remember these conversations , dear <unk> ; but the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed , and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing .
men lived ; and died individually .
you yourself sickened , and passed into the grave ; and thither your constant <name> speedily followed you .
and though the century which has since elapsed , and whose conclusion brings up together once more , tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration , yet my <unk> , it was a century still .
<unk> ' .
say , rather , a point in the vague infinity .
unquestionably , it was in the earth 's <unk> that i died .
wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay , i succumbed to the fierce fever .
after some few days of pain , and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy , the manifestations of which you mistook for pain , while i longed but was impotent to <unk> you  after some days there came upon me , as you have said , a breathless and motionless <unk> ; and this was termed death by those who stood around me .
words are vague things .
my condition did not deprive me of <unk> .
it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him , who , having slumbered long and profoundly , lying motionless and fully prostrate in a <unk> noon , begins to steal slowly back into consciousness , through the mere sufficiency of his sleep , and without being awakened by external disturbances .
i breathed no longer .
the pulses were still .
the heart had ceased to beat .
volition had not departed , but was powerless .
the senses were unusually active , although <unk> so  assuming often each other 's functions at random .
the taste and the smell were inextricably confounded , and became one sentiment , abnormal and intense .
the <unk> with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last , affected me with sweet fancies of flowers  fantastic flowers , far more lovely than any of the old earth , but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us .
the <unk> , transparent and bloodless , offered no complete impediment to vision .
as volition was in abeyance , the balls could not roll in their sockets  but all objects within the range of the <unk> hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness ; the rays which fell upon the external retina , or into the corner of the eye , producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface .
yet , in the former instance , this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as sound  sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade  curved or angular in outline .
the hearing , at the same time , although excited in degree , was not irregular in action  estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision , not less than of sensibility .
touch had undergone a modification more peculiar .
its impressions were <unk> received , but pertinaciously retained , and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure .
thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids , at first only recognized through vision , at length , long after their removal , filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable .
i say with a sensual delight .
all my perceptions were purely sensual .
the materials furnished the passive <name> by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding .
of pain there was some little ; of pleasure there was much ; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all .
thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences , and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone ; but they were soft musical sounds and no more ; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth ; while large and constant tears which fell upon my face , telling the bystanders of a heart which broke , thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone .
and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders spoke reverently , in low whispers  you , sweet <name> , <unk> , with loud cries .
they attired me for the coffin  three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro .
as these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms ;  but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks , groans , and , other dismal expressions of terror , of horror , or of woe .
you alone , <unk> in a white robe , passed in all directions musically about .
the day waned ; and , as its light faded away , i became possessed by a vague uneasiness  an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear  low distant <unk> , solemn , at long but equal intervals , and commingling with melancholy dreams .
night arrived ; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort .
it oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight , and was palpable .
there was also a moaning sound , not unlike the distant <unk> of surf , but more continuous , which , beginning with the first twilight , had grown in strength with the darkness .
suddenly lights were brought into the rooms , and this <unk> became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound , but less dreary and less distinct .
the ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved ; and , issuing from the flame of each lamp ( for there were many ) , there flowed <unk> into my ears a strain of melodious monotone .
and when now , dear <name> , approaching the bed upon which i lay outstretched , you sat gently by my side , breathing odor from your sweet lips , and pressing them upon my brow , there arose tremulously within my bosom , and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth , a something akin to sentiment itself  a feeling that , half appreciating , half responded to your <name> love and sorrow ; but this feeling took no root in the <unk> heart , and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality , and faded quickly away , first into extreme quiescence , and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before .
and now , from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses , there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth , all perfect .
in its exercise i found a wild delight  yet a delight still physical , inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part .
motion in the animal frame had fully ceased .
no muscle quivered ; no nerve thrilled ; no artery throbbed .
but there seemed to have sprung up in the <name> that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct <name> .
let me term it a mental pendulous <unk> .
it was the moral embodiment of man 's abstract idea of time .
by the absolute <unk> of this movement  or of such as this  had the cycles of the <unk> orbs themselves been adjusted .
by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel , and of the watches of the attendants .
their <unk> came <unk> to my ears .
the slightest deviations from the true proportion  and these deviations were <unk>  affected me just as <unk> of abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense .
although no two of the <unk> in the chamber struck the individual seconds accurately together , yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones , and the respective momentary errors of each .
and this  this keen , perfect <unk> sentiment of duration  this sentiment existing ( as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist ) independently of any succession of events  this idea  this sixth sense , <unk> from the ashes of the rest , was the first obvious and certain step of the <unk> soul upon the threshold of the temporal eternity .
it was midnight ; and you still sat by my side .
all others had departed from the chamber of death .
they had deposited me in the coffin .
the lamps burned <unk> ; for this i knew by the <unk> of the monotonous strains .
but suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume .
finally they ceased .
the perfume in my nostrils died away .
forms affected my vision no longer .
the oppression of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom .
a dull shot like that of electricity pervaded my frame , and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact .
all of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity , and in the one abiding sentiment of duration .
the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly decay .
yet had not all of <unk> departed ; for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a <unk> intuition .
i appreciated the <unk> change now in operation upon the flesh , and , as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him , so , sweet <name> , i still dully felt that you sat by my side .
so , too , when the noon of the second day came , i was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side , which confined me within the coffin , which deposited me within the hearse , which bore me to the grave , which lowered me within it , which heaped heavily the mould upon me , and which thus left me , in blackness and corruption , to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm .
and here in the <unk> which has few secrets to disclose , there rolled away days and weeks and months ; and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew , and , without effort , took record of its flight  without effort and without object .
a year passed .
the consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct , and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped its position .
the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place .
the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body was now growing to be the body itself .
at length , as often happens to the sleeper ( by sleep and its world alone is death <unk> )  at length , as sometimes happened on earth to the deep <unk> , when some flitting light half startled him into awaking , yet left him half enveloped in dreams  so to me , in the strict embrace of the shadow , came that light which alone might have had power to startle  the light of enduring love .
men toiled at the grave in which i lay <unk> .
they <unk> the damp earth .
upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of <name> .
and now again all was void .
that nebulous light had been extinguished .
that feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence .
many <unk> had supervened .
dust had returned to dust .
the worm had food no more .
the sense of being had at length utterly departed , and there reigned in its stead  instead of all things , dominant and perpetual  the <unk> place and <unk> for that which was not  for that which had no form  for that which had no thought  for that which had no <unk>  for that which was <unk> , yet of which matter formed no portion  for all this nothingness , yet for all this immortality , the grave was still a home , and the <unk> hours , <unk> .

it is now ten earthly years since i underwent what you undergo  yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still .
you have now suffered all of pain , however , which you <name> suffer in aidenn .
<unk> ' .
in aidenn ?
<unk> ' .
in aidenn .
<unk> ' .
o god !  pity me , charmion !  i am <unk> with the majesty of all things  of the unknown now known  of the speculative future merged in the <name> and certain present .
<unk> ' .
grapple not now with such thoughts .
to-morrow we <name> speak of this .
your mind <unk> , and its agitation <name> find relief in the exercise of simple memories .
look not around , nor forward  but back .
i am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us .
tell me of it .
let us converse of familiar things , in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished .
<unk> ' .
most fearfully , fearfully !  this is indeed no dream .
<unk> ' .
dreams are no more .
was i much mourned , my eiros ?
<unk> ' .
mourned , charmion ?  oh , deeply .
to that last hour of all there <name> a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household .
<unk> ' .
and that last hour  speak of it .
remember that , beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself , i know nothing .
when , coming out from among mankind , i passed into night through the grave  at that period , if i remember aright , the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly <unk> .
but , indeed , i knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day .
<unk> ' .
the individual calamity was , as you say , entirely <unk> ; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers .
i need scarce tell you , my friend , that , even when you left us , men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth alone , but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin , speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame .
the very moderate density of these bodies had been well established .
they had been observed to pass among the satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets .
we had long regarded the wanderers as <unk> creations of inconceivable tenuity , and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe , even in the event of contact .
but contact was not in any degree dreaded ; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known .
that among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an <unk> idea .
but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind ; and , although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed , upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet , yet this announcement was generally received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust .
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated , and it was at once conceded by all observers that its path , at <unk> would bring it into very close proximity with the earth .
there were two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable .
i can not very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people .
for a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect , so long employed among worldly considerations , could not in any manner grasp .
but the truth of a <unk> important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid .
finally , all men saw that astronomical knowledge lies not , and they awaited the comet .
its approach was not at first seemingly rapid , nor was its appearance of very unusual character .
it was of a dull red , and had little perceptible train .
for seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter , and but a partial alteration in its color .
meantime , the ordinary affairs of men were discarded , and all interest absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in respect to the <unk> nature .
even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations .
the learned now gave their intellect  their soul  to no such points as the <unk> of fear , or to the sustenance of loved theory .
they sought  they panted for right views .
they groaned for perfected knowledge .
truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty , and the wise bowed down and adored .
that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise ; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd .
it was demonstrated that the density of the comet 's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas ; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon , and which served greatly to allay terror .
<unk> , with an earnestness <unk> , dwelt upon the biblical prophecies , and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known .
that the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire , was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction ; and that the comets were of no fiery nature ( as all men now knew ) was a truth which relieved all , in a great measure , from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold .
it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to <unk> and wars  errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet  were now altogether unknown , as if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne .
the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest .
what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question .
the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances , of probable alterations in climate , and consequently in vegetation ; of possible magnetic and electric influences .
many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced .
while such discussions were going on , their subject gradually approached , growing larger in apparent diameter , and of a more brilliant lustre .
mankind grew paler as it came .
all human operations were suspended .
there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained , at length , a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation .
the people now , dismissing any lingering <name> that the astronomers were wrong , experienced all the certainty of evil .
the <unk> aspect of their terror was gone .
the hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms .
a very few days suffered , however , to <unk> even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable .
we could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts .
its historical attributes had disappeared .
it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion .
we saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens , but as an <unk> upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains .
it had taken , with <unk> rapidity , the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame , extending from horizon to horizon .
yet a day , and men breathed with greater freedom .
it was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet ; yet we lived .
we even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind .
the exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent ; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it .
meantime , our vegetation had perceptibly altered ; and we gained <name> , from this predicted circumstance , in the foresight of the wise .
a wild luxuriance of foliage , utterly unknown before , burst out upon every vegetable thing .
yet another day  and the evil was not altogether upon us .
it was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us .
a wild change had come over all men ; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general <unk> and horror .
the first sense of pain lay in a rigorous construction of the breast and lungs , and an insufferable dryness of the skin .
it could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected ; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected , were now the topics of discussion .
the result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the <unk> terror through the universal heart of man .
it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases , in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen and <unk> of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere .
oxygen , which was the principle of combustion , and the vehicle of heat , was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life , and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature .
nitrogen , on the contrary , was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame .
an unnatural excess of oxygen would result , it had been ascertained , in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced .
it was the pursuit , the extension of the idea , which had engendered awe .
what would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen ?
a combustion irresistible , <unk> , <unk> , immediate ;  the entire fulfilment , in all their minute and terrible details , of the fiery and <unk> denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book .
why need i paint , charmion , the now <unk> frenzy of mankind ?
that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with <name> , was now the source of the bitterness of despair .
in its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate .
meantime a day again passed  bearing away with it the last shadow of <name> .
we gasped in the rapid modification of the air .
the red blood bounded <unk> through its strict channels .
a furious delirium possessed all men ; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens , they trembled and shrieked aloud .
but the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us ;  even here in aidenn i shudder while i speak .
let me be brief  brief as the ruin that overwhelmed .
for a moment there was a wild lurid light alone , visiting and penetrating all things .
then  let us bow down , charmion , before the excessive majesty of the great god !  then , there came a shouting and pervading sound , as if from the mouth itself of him ; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed , burst at once into a species of intense flame , for whose surpassing brilliancy and <unk> heat even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name .
thus ended all .
* * * * * <unk>  a parable .
yea !
though i walk through the valley of the shadow .
<unk> of <name> ' .
ye who read are still among the living ; but i who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows .
for indeed strange things shall happen , and secret things be known , and many centuries shall pass away , ere these memorials be seen of men .
and , when seen , there <name> be some to disbelieve and some to doubt , and yet a few who <name> find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a <unk> of iron .
the year had been a year of terror , and of feeling more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth .
for many prodigies and signs had taken place , and far and wide , over sea and land , the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad .
to those , nevertheless , cunning in the stars , it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill ; and to me , the greek oinos , among others , it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and <unk> year when , at the entrance of <unk> , the planet jupiter is enjoined with the red ring of the terrible <unk> .
the peculiar spirit of the skies , if i mistake not greatly , made itself manifest , not only in the physical orb of the earth , but in the souls , imaginations , and meditations of mankind .
over some <unk> of the red <unk> wine , within the walls of a <name> hall , in a dim city called <unk> , we sat , at night , a company of seven .
and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass : and the door was fashioned by the <unk> <unk> , and , being of rare workmanship , was fastened from within .
black draperies , likewise in the gloomy room , shut out from our view the moon , the lurid stars , and the <unk> streets  but the <unk> and the memory of evil , they would not be so excluded .
there were things around us and about of which i can render no distinct account  things material and spiritual  <unk> in the atmosphere  a sense of suffocation  anxiety  and , above all , that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake , and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant .
a dead weight <name> upon us .
it <name> upon our limbs  upon the household furniture  upon the <unk> from which we drank ; and all things were depressed , and borne down thereby  all things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel .
<unk> themselves in tall slender lines of light , they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless ; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of <name> at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance , and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions .
yet we laughed and were <name> in our proper way  which was hysterical ; and sang the songs of <unk>  which are madness ; and drank deeply  although the purple wine reminded us of blood .
for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young <unk> .
dead and at full length he lay , enshrouded ;  the genius and the demon of the scene .
alas !
he bore no portion in our mirth , save that his countenance , distorted with the plague , and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence , seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die .
but although i , oinos , felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me , still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression , and gazing down steadily into the depths of the <name> mirror , sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of <unk> .
but gradually my songs they ceased , and their echoes , rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber , became weak , and undistinguishable , and so faded away .
and lo !
from among those sable draperies , where the sounds of the song departed , there came forth a dark and <unk> shadow  a shadow such as the moon , when low in heaven , might fashion from the figure of a man : but it was the shadow neither of man nor of god , nor of any familiar thing .
and quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass .
but the shadow was vague , and formless , and indefinite , and was the shadow neither of man nor god  neither god of greece , nor god of <unk> , nor any egyptian god .
and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway , and under the arch of the <unk> of the door and moved not , nor spoke any word , but there became stationary and remained .
and the door whereupon the shadow rested was , if i remember aright , over against the feet of the young <unk> enshrouded .
but we , the seven there assembled , having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies , dared not steadily behold it , but cast down our eyes , and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of <name> .
and at length i , oinos , speaking some low words , demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation .
and the shadow answered , " i am shadow , and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of <unk> , and hard by those dim plains of <unk> which border upon the foul <unk> canal . "
and then did we , the seven , start from our seats in horror , and stand trembling , and shuddering , and aghast : for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being , but of a multitude of beings , and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable , fell <unk> upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends .
* * * * * <unk>  a fable .
the mountain pinnacles slumber ; valleys , crags , and caves are silent .
" listen to me , " said the demon , as he placed his hand upon my head .
" the region of which i speak is a dreary region in <unk> , by the borders of the river <unk> .
and there is no quiet there , nor silence .
" the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly <name> ; and they flow not onward to the sea , but <unk> forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion .
for many miles on either side of the river 's <unk> bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies .
they sigh one unto the other in that solitude , and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks , and nod to and fro their everlasting heads .
and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of <unk> water .
and they sigh one unto the other .
" but there is a boundary to their realm  the boundary of the dark , horrible , lofty forest .
there , like the waves about the hebrides , the low <unk> is agitated continually .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound .
and from their high summits , one by one , drop everlasting dews .
and at the roots , strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in <unk> slumber .
and overhead , with a rustling and loud noise , the gray clouds rush <unk> forever until they roll , a cataract , over the fiery wall of the horizon .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and by the shores of the river <unk> there is neither quiet nor silence .
" it was night , and the rain fell ; and , falling , it was rain , but , having fallen , it was blood .
and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies , and the rain fell upon my head  and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation .
" and , all at once , the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist , and was crimson in color .
and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon .
and the rock was gray and ghastly , and tall ,  and the rock was gray .
upon its front were characters <unk> in the stones ; and i walked through the morass of water-lilies , until i came close unto the shore , that i might read the characters upon the stone .
but i could not <unk> them .
and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red , and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters ;  and the characters were desolation .
" and i looked upwards , and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock ; and i hid myself among the water-lilies that i might discover the action of the man .
and the man was tall and stately in form , and wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the <unk> of old rome .
and the outlines of his figure were indistinct  but his features were the features of a deity ; for the mantle of the night , and of the mist , and of the moon , and of the dew , had left uncovered the features of his face .
and his brow was lofty with thought , and his eye wild with care ; and in the few furrows upon his cheek , i read the fables of sorrow , and weariness , and disgust with mankind , and a longing after solitude .
" and the man sat upon the rock , and leaned his head upon his hand , and looked out upon the desolation .
he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery , and up into the tall primeval trees , and up higher at the rustling heaven , and into the crimson moon .
and i lay close within shelter of the lilies , and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" and the man turned his attention from the heaven , and looked out upon the dreary river <unk> , and upon the yellow ghastly waters , and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies .
and the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies , and to the murmur that came up from among them .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i went down into the recesses of the morass , and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies , and called unto the <unk> which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass .
and the <unk> heard my call , and came , with the <unk> , unto the foot of the rock , and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult ; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven , where before there had been no wind .
and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest  and the rain beat upon the head of the man  and the floods of the river came down  and the river was tormented into foam  and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds  and the forest crumbled before the wind  and the thunder rolled  and the lightning fell  and the rock rocked to its foundation .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i grew angry and cursed , with the curse of silence , the river , and the lilies , and the wind , and the forest , and the heaven , and the thunder , and the sighs of the water-lilies .
and they became accursed , and were <unk> and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven  and the thunder died away  and the lightning did not flash  and the clouds <name> motionless  and the waters sunk to their level and remained  and the trees ceased to rock  and the water-lilies sighed no more  and the murmur was heard no longer from among them , nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert .
and i looked upon the characters of the rock , and they were changed ;  and the characters were silence .
" and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man , and his countenance was <name> with terror .
and , hurriedly , he raised his head from his hand , and stood forth upon the rock and listened .
but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert , and the characters upon the rock were silence .
and the man shuddered , and turned his face away , and fled afar off , in haste , so that i beheld him no more . "
... now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi  in the <unk> , melancholy volumes of the magi .
therein , i say , are glorious histories of the heaven , and of the earth , and of the mighty sea  and of the genii that overruled the sea , and the earth , and the lofty heaven .
there was much <name> , too , in the sayings which were said by the <unk> ; and holy , holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around <unk>  but , as allah <unk> , that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb , i hold to be the most wonderful of all !
and as the demon made an end of his story , he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed .
and i could not laugh with the demon , and he cursed me because i could not laugh .
and the lynx which <unk> forever in the tomb , came out therefrom , and lay down at the feet of the demon , and looked at him steadily in the face .
* * * * * essays .
* * * * * the poetic principle .
in speaking of the poetic principle , i have no design to be either thorough or profound .
while discussing very much at random the <unk> of what we call poetry , my principal purpose <name> be to cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which best suit my own taste , or which , upon my own fancy , have left the most definite impression .
by " minor poems " i mean , of course , poems of little length .
and here , in the beginning , permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle , which , whether rightfully or <unk> , has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem .
i hold that a long poem does not exist .
i maintain that the phrase , " a long poem , " is simply a flat contradiction in terms .
i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites , by elevating the soul .
the value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement .
but all excitements are , through a <unk> necessity , transient .
that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all , can not be sustained throughout a composition of any great length .
after the lapse of half an hour , at the very utmost , it flags  fails  a revulsion ensues  and then the poem is , in effect , and in fact , no longer such .
there are , no doubt , many who have found difficulty in <unk> the critical <unk> that the " paradise lost " is to be devoutly admired throughout , with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it , during perusal , the amount of enthusiasm which that critical <unk> would demand .
this great work , in fact , is to be regarded as poetical only when , losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of <name> , unity , we view it merely as a series of minor poems .
if , to preserve its unity  its <unk> of effect or impression  we read it ( as would be necessary ) at a single sitting , the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression .
after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry , there follows , inevitably , a passage of <unk> which no critical <unk> can force us to admire ; but if , upon completing the work , we read it again ; omitting the first book  that is to say , commencing with the second  we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned  that damnable which we had previously so much admired .
it follows from all this that the ultimate , aggregate , or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun , is a <unk>  and this is precisely the fact .
in regard to the iliad , we have , if not positive proof , at least very good reason , for believing it intended as a series of <unk> ; but , granting the epic intention , i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of <name> .
the modern epic is , of the <unk> ancient model , but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation .
but the day of these artistic anomalies is over .
if , at any time , any very long poem were popular in reality  which i doubt  it is at least clear that no very long poem <name> ever be popular again .
that the extent of a poetical work is <unk> <unk> , the measure of its merit , seems undoubtedly , when we thus state it , a proposition sufficiently absurd  yet we are indebted for it to the quarterly reviews .
surely there can be nothing in mere size , <unk> considered  there can be nothing in mere bulk , so far as a volume is concerned , which has so continuously elicited admiration from these <unk> pamphlets !
a mountain , to be sure , by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys , does impress us with a sense of the sublime  but no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even " the <unk> . "
even the <unk> have not instructed us to be so impressed by it .
as yet , they have not insisted on our estimating <unk> by the cubic foot , or pollock by the pound  but what else are we to infer from their continual <unk> about " sustained effort " ?
if , by " sustained effort , " any little gentleman has accomplished an epic , let us frankly commend him for the effort  if this indeed be a thing commendable  but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort 's account .
it is to be hoped <unk> common sense , in the time to come , <name> prefer deciding upon a work of <name> rather by the impression it makes  by the effect it produces  than by the time it took to impress the effect , or by the amount of " sustained effort " which had been found necessary in effecting the impression .
the fact is , that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another  nor can all the <unk> in christendom confound them .
by and by , this proposition , with many which i have been just urging , <name> be received as self-evident .
in the meantime , by being generally condemned as <unk> , they <name> not be essentially damaged as truths .
on the other hand , it is clear that a poem may be <unk> brief .
undue brevity <unk> into mere <unk> .
a very short poem , while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid , never produces a profound or enduring effect .
there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax .
de <unk> has wrought innumerable things , pungent and <unk> , but in general they have been too <unk> to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention , and thus , as so many feathers of fancy , have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind .
a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem , in keeping it out of the popular view , is afforded by the following exquisite little <unk> : i arise from dreams of thee in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low , and the stars are shining bright .
i arise from dreams of thee , and a spirit in my feet has led me  who knows how ?  to thy <unk> , sweet !
the wandering airs they faint on the dark the silent stream  the <unk> odors fail like sweet thoughts in a dream ; the nightingale 's complaint , it dies upon her heart , as i must die on thine , o , beloved as thou <name> !
o , lift me from the grass !
i die , i faint , i fail !
let thy love in kisses rain on my lips and eyelids pale .
my cheek is cold and white , alas !
my heart beats loud and fast : o , press it close to thine again , where it <name> break at last !
very few perhaps are familiar with these lines , yet no less a poet than <name> is their author .
their warm , yet delicate and ethereal imagination <name> be appreciated by all , but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the <unk> air of a southern midsummer night .
one of the finest poems by <name> , the very best in my opinion which he has ever written , has no doubt , through this same defect of undue brevity , been kept back from its proper position , not less in the critical than in the popular view : the shadows lay along broadway , 't was near the <unk>  and slowly there a <name> fair was walking in her pride .
alone walk 'd she ; but , <unk> walk 'd spirits at her side .
peace charm 'd the street beneath her feet , and honor charm 'd the air ; and all astir looked kind on her , and called her good as fair  for all god ever gave to her she kept with <unk> care .
she kept with care her beauties rare from lovers warm and true  for heart was cold to all but gold , and the <name> came not to woo  but honor 'd well her charms to sell , if priests the selling do .
now walking there was one more fair  a slight girl , <unk> ; and she had unseen company to make the spirit quail  <unk> want and scorn she walk 'd forlorn , and nothing could avail .
no <name> now can clear her brow from this world 's peace to pray , for as love 's wild prayer dissolved in air , her woman 's heart gave way !  but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven , by man is cursed alway !
in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the <name> who has written so many mere " verses of society . "
the lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy , while they breathe an earnestness , an evident sincerity of sentiment , for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author .
while the epic mania , while the idea that to merit in poetry <unk> is indispensable , has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind , by mere dint of its own absurdity , we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated , but one which , in the brief period it has already endured , may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies combined .
i allude to the heresy of the <unk> .
it has been assumed , tacitly and <unk> , directly and indirectly , that the ultimate object of all poetry is truth .
every poem , it is said , should <unk> a moral , and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be <unk> .
we americans especially have patronized this happy idea , and we <unk> very especially have developed it in full .
we have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the <unk> sake , and to acknowledge such to have been our design , would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force :  but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified , more supremely <name> , than this very poem , this poem per se , this poem which is a poem and nothing more , this poem written solely for the poem 's sake .
with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man , i would nevertheless limit , in some measure , its modes of <unk> .
i would limit to enforce them .
i would not <unk> them by dissipation .
the demands of truth are severe .
she has no sympathy with the <unk> .
all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do .
it is but making her a <unk> paradox to <unk> her in gems and flowers .
in enforcing a truth we need severity rather than <unk> of language .
we must be simple , precise , terse .
we must be cool , calm , <unk> .
in a word , we must be in that mood which , as nearly as possible , is the exact converse of the poetical .
he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and <unk> difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of <unk> .
he must be <unk> beyond redemption who , in spite of these differences , shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth .
dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions , we have the pure intellect , taste , and the moral sense .
i place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies .
it holds intimate relations with either extreme ; but from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves .
nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction .
just as the intellect concerns itself with truth , so taste informs us of the beautiful , while the moral sense is <unk> of duty .
of this latter , while conscience teaches the obligation , and reason the expediency , taste contents herself with displaying the charms , waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformity , her disproportion , her animosity to the fitting , to the appropriate , to the harmonious , in a word , to beauty .
an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the beautiful .
this it is which <unk> to his delight in the manifold forms , and sounds , and odors , and sentiments amid which he exists .
and just as the <name> is repeated in the lake , or the eyes of <unk> in the mirror , so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms , and sounds , and colors , and odors , and sentiments a duplicate source of delight .
but this mere repetition is not poetry .
he who shall simply sing , with however glowing enthusiasm , or with however vivid a truth of description , of the sights , and sounds , and odors , and colors , and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind  he , i say , has yet failed to prove his divine title .
there is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain .
we have still a thirst <unk> , to allay which he has not shown us the <name> springs .
this thirst belongs to the immortality of man .
it is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence .
it is the <name> of the moth for the <name> .
it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us , but a wild effort to reach the beauty above .
inspired by an ecstatic <unk> of the glories beyond the grave , we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps <unk> to eternity alone .
and thus when by poetry , or when by music , the most <unk> of the poetic moods , we find ourselves melted into tears , we weep then , not as the <unk> <unk> supposes , through excess of pleasure , but through a certain <unk> , impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now , wholly , here on earth , at once and forever , those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem , or through the music , we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses .
the struggle to apprehend the <unk> loveliness  this struggle , on the part of souls <unk> constituted  has given to the world all that which it ( the world ) has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic .
the poetic sentiment , of course , may develop itself in various modes  in painting , in sculpture , in architecture , in the dance  very especially in music  and very peculiarly , and with a wide field , in the composition of the landscape garden .
our present theme , however , has regard only to its manifestation in words .
and here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm .
contenting myself with the certainty that music , in its various modes of metre , rhythm , and rhyme , is of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejected  is so <unk> important an adjunct , that he is simply silly who declines its assistance , i <name> not now pause to maintain its absolute <unk> .
it is in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which , when inspired by the poetic sentiment , it struggles  the creation of <unk> beauty .
it may be , indeed , that here this sublime end is , now and , then , attained in <unk> we are often made to feel , with a shivering delight , that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels .
and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense , we shall find the widest field for the poetic development .
the old bards and <unk> had advantages which we do not possess  and <name> moore , singing his own songs , was , in the most legitimate manner , perfecting them as poems .
to recapitulate then :  i would define , in brief , the poetry of words as the <unk> creation of <unk> its sole <unk> is taste .
with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations .
unless incidentally , it has no concern whatever either with duty or with truth .
a few words , however , in explanation .
that pleasure which is at once the most pure , the most elevating , and the most intense , is derived , i maintain , from the contemplation of the beautiful .
in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation , or excitement of the soul , which we recognize as the poetic sentiment , and which is so easily distinguished from truth , which is the satisfaction of the reason , or from passion , which is the excitement of the heart .
i make beauty , therefore  using the word as inclusive of the sublime  i make beauty the province of the poem , simply because it is an obvious rule of <name> that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes :  no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem .
it by no means follows , however , that the <unk> of passion , or the precepts of duty , or even the lessons of truth , may not be introduced into a poem , and with advantage ; for they may <unk> incidentally , in various ways , the general purposes of the work : but the true artist <name> always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem .
i can not better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your consideration , than by the <unk> of the <unk> to longfellow 's " waif " : the day is done , and the darkness falls from the wings of night , as a feather is wafted downward from an eagle in his flight .
i see the lights of the village gleam through the rain and the mist , and a feeling of sadness comes o'er me , that my soul can not resist ; a feeling of sadness and longing , that is not akin to pain , and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain .
come , read to me some poem , some simple and <unk> lay , that shall soothe this restless feeling , and banish the thoughts of day .
not from the grand old masters , not from the bards sublime , whose distant footsteps <name> through the corridors of time .
for , like strains of martial music , their mighty thoughts suggest life 's endless toil and endeavor ; and to-night i long for rest .
read from some humbler poet , whose songs gushed from his heart , as showers from the clouds of summer , or tears from the eyelids start ; who through long days of labor , and nights devoid of ease , still heard in his soul the music of wonderful melodies .
such songs have power to quiet the restless pulse of care , and come like the benediction that follows after prayer .
then read from the treasured volume the poem of thy choice , and lend to the rhyme of the poet the beauty of thy voice .
and the night shall be filled with music , and the cares that infest the day , shall fold their tents like the arabs , and as silently steal away .
with no great range of imagination , these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression .
some of the images are very effective .
nothing can be better than  the bards sublime , whose distant footsteps <name> down the corridors of time .
the idea of the last <unk> is also very effective .
the poem on the whole , however , is chiefly to be admired for the graceful <unk> of its metre , so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments , and especially for the ease of the general manner .
this " ease " or <unk> , in a literary style , it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone  as a point of really difficult attainment .
but not so :  a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it  to the unnatural .
it is but the result of writing with the understanding , or with the instinct , that the tone , in composition , should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt  and must perpetually vary , of course , with the occasion .
the author who , after the fashion of the north american review , should be upon all occasions merely " quiet , " must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly , or stupid ; and has no more right to be considered " easy " or " natural " than a cockney exquisite , or than the sleeping beauty in the <unk> .
among the minor poems of <name> , none has so much impressed me as the one which he <unk> " <name> . "
i quote only a portion of it : there , through the long , long summer hours , the golden light should lie , and thick young herbs and groups of flowers stand in their beauty by .
the <unk> should build and tell his <unk> , close beside my cell ; the idle butterfly should rest him there , and there be heard the <unk> and humming bird .
and what , if cheerful shouts at noon , come , from the village sent , or songs of maids , beneath the moon , with <name> laughter <unk> ?
and what if , in the evening light , betrothed lovers walk in sight of my low monument ?
i would the lovely scene around might know no sadder sight nor sound .
i know , i know i should not see the season 's glorious show , nor would its brightness shine for me ; nor its wild music flow ; but if , around my place of sleep , the friends i love should come to weep , they might not haste to go .
soft airs and song , and light and bloom , should keep them lingering by my tomb .
these to their soften 'd hearts should bear the thought of what has been , and speak of one who can not share the gladness of the scene ; whose part in all the pomp that fills the circuit of the summer hills , is  that his grave is green ; and deeply would their hearts rejoice to hear again his living voice .
the <unk> flow here is even voluptuous  nothing could be more melodious .
the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner .
the intense melancholy which seems to well up , perforce , to the surface of all the poet 's cheerful sayings about his grave , we find thrilling us to the soul  while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill .
the impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness .
and if , in the remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you , there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent , let me remind you that ( how or why we know not ) this certain taint of sadness is <unk> connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty .
it is , nevertheless , a feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain , and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain .
the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as " the health " of <name> <unk> <unk> : i fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone , a woman , of her gentle sex the seeming paragon ; to whom the better elements and kindly stars have given a form so fair , that like the air , 't is less of earth than heaven .
her every tone is music 's own , like those of morning birds , and something more than <name> dwells ever in her words ; the <unk> of her heart are they , and from her lips each flows as one may see the burden 'd <name> forth issue from the rose .
affections are as thoughts to her , the measures of her hours ; her feelings have the <unk> , the freshness of young flowers ; and lovely passions , changing oft , so fill her , she appears the image of themselves by turns ,  the idol of past years !
of her bright face one glance <name> trace a picture on the <name> , and of her voice in echoing hearts a sound must long remain ; but memory , such as mine of her , so very much <unk> , when death is nigh my latest sigh <name> not be life 's , but hers .
i fill 'd this cup to one made up of loveliness alone , a woman , of her gentle sex the seeming paragon  her health !
and would on earth there stood , some more of such a frame , that life might be all poetry , and weariness a name .
it was the misfortune of mr. <unk> to have been born too far south .
had he been a new <unk> , it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of american <unk> by that magnanimous <unk> which has so long controlled the destinies of american letters , in conducting the thing called 'the north american review ' .
the poem just cited is especially beautiful ; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet 's enthusiasm .
we pardon his <unk> for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered .
it was by no means my design , however , to <unk> upon the merits of what i should read you .
these <name> necessarily speak for themselves .
<unk> , in his <unk> from <unk> ' , tells us that <unk> once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book :  whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work .
he replied that he only busied himself about the errors .
on hearing this , apollo , handing him a sack of <unk> wheat , bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward .
now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics  but i am by no means sure that the god was in the right .
i am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood .
excellence , in a poem especially , may be considered in the light of an axiom , which need only be properly put , to become self-evident .
it is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such :  and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of <name> , is to admit that they are not merits altogether .
among the " melodies " of <name> moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view .
i allude to his lines beginning  " come , rest in this bosom . "
the intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in <name> .
there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that <unk> the all in all of the divine passion of love  a sentiment which , perhaps , has found its <name> in more , and in more passionate , human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words : come , rest in this bosom , my own stricken deer , though the herd have fled from thee , thy home is still here ; here still is the smile , that no cloud can <unk> , and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last .
oh !
what was love made for , if 't is not the same through <name> and through torment , through <name> and shame ?
i know not , i ask not , if guilt 's in that heart , i but know that i love thee , whatever thou <name> .
thou hast call 'd me thy <name> in moments of bliss , and thy <name> i 'll be , 'mid the horrors of this ,  through the furnace , <unk> , thy steps to pursue , and shield thee , and save thee ,  or perish there too !
it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination , while granting him fancy  a distinction originating with coleridge  than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore .
the fact is , that the fancy of this poet so far <unk> over all his other faculties , and over the fancy of all other men , as to have induced , very naturally , the idea that he is fanciful <unk> but never was there a greater mistake .
never was a <unk> wrong done the fame of a true poet .
in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundly  more <unk> imaginative ,  in the best sense , than the lines commencing  " i would i were by that dim lake "  which are the composition of <name> moore .
i regret that i am unable to remember them .
one of the noblest  and , speaking of fancy  one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets , was <name> hood .
his " fair <name> " had always for me an inexpressible charm : o saw ye not fair <name> ?
she 's gone into the west , to dazzle when the sun is down and <name> the world of rest she took our daylight with her , the smiles that we love best , with morning blushes on her cheek , and pearls upon her breast .
o turn again , fair <name> , before the fall of night , for fear the moon should shine alone , and stars <unk> 'd bright ; and blessed <name> the lover be that walks beneath their light , and breathes the love against thy cheek i dare not even write !
would i had been , fair <name> , that gallant cavalier , who rode so gaily by thy side , and whisper 'd thee so near !
were there no <name> dames at home , or no true lovers here , that he should cross the seas to win the dearest of the dear ?
i saw thee , lovely <name> , descend along the shore , with bands of <name> gentlemen , and <unk> before ; and gentle youth and maidens <name> , and snowy plumes they wore ; it would have been a <unk> dream , if it had been no more !
alas , alas , fair <name> , she went away with song , with music waiting on her steps , and shoutings of the throng ; but some were sad and felt no mirth , but only music 's wrong , in sounds that sang farewell , farewell , to her you 've loved so long .
farewell , farewell , fair <name> , that vessel never bore so fair a <name> on its deck , nor danced so light before ,  alas for pleasure on the sea , and sorrow on the shore !
the smile that blest one lover 's heart has broken many more !
" the haunted house , " by the same author , is one of the truest poems ever written ,  one of the truest , one of the most unexceptionable , one of the most thoroughly artistic , both in its theme and in its execution .
it is , moreover , powerfully ideal  imaginative .
i regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture .
in place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated " bridge of sighs : " one more unfortunate , weary of breath , rashly importunate gone to her death !
take her up tenderly , lift her with care ;  fashion 'd so <unk> , young and so fair !
look at her garments clinging like <unk> ; whilst the wave constantly <unk> from her clothing ; take her up instantly , loving , not loathing .
touch her not scornfully think of her mournfully , gently and humanly ; not of the stains of her , all that remains of her now is pure womanly .
make no deep scrutiny into her mutiny rash and undutiful ; past all dishonor , death has left on her only the beautiful .
where the lamps quiver so far in the river , with many a light from window and casement , from <name> to basement , she stood , with amazement , houseless by night .
the bleak wind of march made her tremble and shiver ; but not the dark arch , or the black flowing river : mad from life 's history , glad to death 's mystery , swift to be hurl 'd  anywhere , anywhere out of the world !
in she plunged boldly , no matter how coldly the rough river ran ,  over the brink of it , picture it ,  think of it , dissolute man !
lave in it , drink of it then , if you can !
still , for all slips of hers , one of <name> 's family  wipe those poor lips of hers oozing so <unk> , loop up her tresses escaped from the comb , her fair <unk> tresses ; whilst <unk> guesses where was her home ?
who was her father ?
who was her mother !
had she a sister ?
had she a brother ?
or was there a dearer one still , and a nearer one yet , than all other ?
alas !
for the rarity of <name> <name> under the sun !
oh !
it was pitiful !
near a whole city full , home she had none .
<unk> , brotherly , <unk> , motherly , feelings had changed : love , by harsh evidence , thrown from its eminence ; even god 's providence seeming <unk> .
take her up tenderly ; lift her with care ; fashion 'd so <unk> , young , and so fair !
ere her limbs <unk> stiffen too rigidly , decently ,  kindly ,  smooth and compose them ; and her eyes , close them , staring so blindly !
dreadfully staring through muddy <unk> , as when with the daring last look of despairing fixed on futurity .
perishing gloomily , spurred by <unk> , cold <unk> , burning insanity , into her rest ,  cross her hands humbly , as if praying <unk> , over her breast !
owning her weakness , her evil behavior , and leaving , with meekness , her sins to her saviour !
the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos .
the versification , although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic , is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the <unk> of the poem .
among the minor poems of lord <name> is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves : though the day of my <name> 's over , and the <name> of my fate hath declined , thy soft heart refused to discover the faults which so many could find ; though thy soul with my grief was acquainted , it shrunk not to share it with me , and the love which my spirit hath painted it never hath found but in <unk> then when nature around me is smiling , the last smile which answers to mine , i do not believe it beguiling , because it reminds me of thine ; and when winds are at war with the ocean , as the breasts i believed in with me , if their billows excite an emotion , it is that they bear me from <unk> though the rock of my last <name> is shivered , and its fragments are sunk in the wave , though i feel that my soul is delivered to pain  it shall not be its slave .
there is many a pang to pursue me : they may crush , but they shall not <unk>  they may torture , but shall not subdue me  't is of thee that i think  not of them .
though human , thou didst not deceive me , though woman , thou didst not forsake , though loved , thou <unk> to grieve me , though <unk> , thou never couldst shake ,  though trusted , thou didst not <unk> me , though parted , it was not to fly , though watchful , 't was not to <unk> me , nor mute , that the world might <unk> .
yet i blame not the world , nor despise it , nor the war of the many with one  if my soul was not fitted to prize it , 't was folly not sooner to shun : and if dearly that error hath cost me , and more than i once could foresee , i have found that whatever it lost me , it could not deprive me of thee .
from the wreck of the past , which hath perished , thus much i at least may recall , it hath taught me that which i most cherished deserved to be dearest of all : in the desert a fountain is springing , in the wide waste there still is a tree , and a bird in the solitude singing , which speaks to my spirit of thee .
although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult , the versification could scarcely be improved .
no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet .
it is the <unk> idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the <unk> love of woman .
from <name> tennyson , although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived , i have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen .
i call him , and think him the noblest of poets , not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound  not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intense  but because it is at all times the most ethereal  in other words , the most elevating and most pure .
no poet is so little of the earth , earthy .
what i am about to read is from his last long poem , " the <name> : " tears , idle tears , i know not what they mean , tears from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart , and gather to the eyes , in looking on the happy autumn fields , and thinking of the days that are no more .
fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail , that brings our friends up from the <unk> , sad as the last which <unk> over one that sinks with all we love below the verge ; so sad , so fresh , the days that are no more .
ah , sad and strange as in dark summer <unk> the earliest pipe of <unk> 'd birds to dying ears , when unto dying eyes the casement slowly grows a glimmering square ; so sad , so strange , the days that are no more .
dear as remember 'd kisses after death , and sweet as those by hopeless fancy <unk> on lips that are for others ; deep as love , deep as first love , and wild with all regret ; o death in life , the days that are no more .
thus , although in a very cursory and imperfect manner , i have endeavored to convey to you my <name> of the poetic principle .
it has been my purpose to suggest that , while this principle itself is strictly and simply the human aspiration for <unk> beauty , the manifestation of the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul , quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart , or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason .
for in regard to passion , alas !
its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul .
love , on the contrary  love  the true , the divine eros  the <unk> as distinguished from the <unk> <name>  is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes .
and in regard to truth , if , to be sure , through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a <name> where none was apparent before , we experience at once the true poetical effect ; but this effect is referable to the <name> alone , and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the <name> manifest .
we shall reach , however , more immediately a distinct <name> of what true poetry is , by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect .
he recognizes the <unk> which <unk> his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heaven , in the <unk> of the flower , in the clustering of low <unk> , in the waving of the <unk> , in the slanting of tall eastern trees , in the blue distance of mountains , in the grouping of clouds , in the twinkling of <unk> <name> , in the gleaming of silver rivers , in the repose of <unk> lakes , in the <unk> depths of lonely wells .
he perceives it in the songs of birds , in the harp of <unk> , in the sighing of the <unk> , in the <unk> voice of the forest , in the surf that complains to the shore , in the fresh breath of the woods , in the scent of the <name> , in the voluptuous perfume of the <name> , in the suggestive odor that comes to him at eventide from <unk> undiscovered islands , over dim oceans , illimitable and unexplored .
he owns it in all <name> thoughts , in all <unk> motives , in all holy impulses , in all chivalrous , generous , and self-sacrificing deeds .
he feels it in the beauty of woman , in the <name> of her step , in the lustre of her eye , in the <name> of her voice , in her soft laughter , in her sigh , in the <name> of the rustling of her robes .
he deeply feels it in her winning endearments , in her burning enthusiasms , in her gentle charities , in her meek and devotional endurance , but above all , ah , far above all , he <unk> to it , he worships it in the <name> , in the purity , in the strength , in the altogether divine majesty of her <unk> let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem , one very different in character from any that i have before quoted .
it is by <unk> , and is called " the song of the cavalier . "
with our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and <unk> of warfare , we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments , and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem .
to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier : a steed !
a steed !
of matchless <unk> !
a sword of metal <unk> !
<name> else to <name> <unk> is <unk>  <name> else on earth is <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the drum , the <unk> of the trumpet <unk>  be <unk> from heaven that come .
and oh !
the thundering <unk> of <unk> , when as their <unk> <unk> , may tole from heaven an <name> bright , and <unk> a fiend from hell , then <unk> !
then <unk> , brave <unk> all , and <name> your <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's couriers , fame and honor , call us to the field <unk> .
no <unk> <unk> shall fill your eye when the <unk> 's in our hand ,  <unk> we 'll part , and no whit <unk> for the <unk> of the land ; let piping <unk> , and craven wight , thus <unk> and <unk> <unk> , our business is like men to fight , and <unk> to die !
* * * * * the philosophy of composition .
<name> dickens , in a note now lying before me , alluding to an examination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby <unk> , says  " by the way , are you aware that godwin wrote his <name> <name> backwards ?
he first involved his hero in a web of difficulties , forming the second volume , and then , for the first , cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done . "
i can not think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of godwin  and indeed what he himself <unk> is not altogether in accordance with mr. dickens 's idea  but the author of <name> <name> was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage <unk> from at least a somewhat similar process .
nothing is more clear than that every plot , worth the name , must be elaborated to its <unk> before anything be attempted with the pen .
it is only with the <unk> constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence , or <unk> , by making the incidents , and especially the tone at all points , tend to the development of the intention .
there is a radical error , i think , in the usual mode of constructing a story .
either history affords a <unk>  or one is suggested by an incident of the day  or , at best , the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative  designing , generally , to fill in with description , dialogue , or <unk> comment , whatever crevices of fact or action may , from <name> to <name> , render themselves apparent .
i prefer commencing with the consideration of an <unk> keeping originality always in view  for he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest  i say to myself , in the first place , " of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart , the intellect , or ( more generally ) the soul is susceptible , what one shall i , on the present occasion , select ? "
having chosen a novel first , and secondly , a vivid effect , i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tone  whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone , or the converse , or by peculiarity both of incident and tone  afterwards looking about me ( or rather within ) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect .
i have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would  that is to say , who could  detail , step by step , the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion .
why such a paper has never been given to the world , i am much at a loss to say  but perhaps the <unk> vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause .
most writers  poets in especial  prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy  an ecstatic intuition  and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes , at the elaborate and <unk> <unk> of thought  at the true purposes seized only at the last moment  at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view  at the <unk> fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable  at the cautious selections and <unk>  at the painful <unk> and <unk> ,  in a word , at the wheels and pinions , the tackle for <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the cock 's feathers , the red paint , and the black patches , which , in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred , constitute the properties of the literary <unk> i am aware , on the other hand , that the case is by no means common , in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained .
in general , suggestions , having arisen pell-mell , are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner .
for my own part , i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to , nor , at any time , the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions ; and , since the interest of an analysis , or reconstruction , such as i have considered a <unk> , is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed , it <name> not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the modus <unk> by which some one of my own works was put together .
i select " the <name> " as most generally known .
it is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is <unk> either to accident or intuition  that the work proceeded , step by step , to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem .
let us dismiss , as irrelevant to the poem , per se , the circumstance  or say the necessity  which , in the first place , gave rise to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste .
we commence , then , with this intention .
the initial consideration was that of extent .
if any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting , we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect <unk> from unity of impression  for , if two sittings be required , the affairs of the world interfere , and everything like <unk> is at once destroyed .
but since , <unk> <unk> , no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design , it but remains to be seen whether there is , in extent , any advantage to <unk> the loss of unity which attends it .
here i say no , at once .
what we term a long poem is , in fact , merely a succession of brief ones  that is to say , of brief poetical effects .
it is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites , by elevating the soul ; and all intense excitements are , through a <unk> necessity , brief .
for this reason , at least one-half of the " paradise lost " is essentially prose  a succession of poetical excitements interspersed , inevitably , with corresponding depressions  the whole being deprived , through the <unk> of its length , of the vastly important artistic element , <unk> , or unity of effect .
it appears evident , then , that there is a distinct limit , as regards length , to all works of literary <name>  the limit of a single sitting  and that , although in certain classes of prose composition , such as robinson crusoe ( demanding no unity ) , this limit may be advantageously <unk> , it can never properly be <unk> in a poem .
within this limit , the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit  in other words , to the excitement or elevation  again , in other words , to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing ; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect  this , with one <unk>  that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all .
holding in view these considerations , as well as that degree of excitement which i deemed not above the popular , while not below the critical taste , i reached at once what i conceived the proper length for my intended poem  a length of about one hundred lines .
it is , in fact , a hundred and eight .
my next thought concerned the choice of an impression , or effect , to be conveyed : and here i may as well observe that , throughout the construction , i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable .
i should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have repeatedly insisted , and which , with the poetical , stands not in the slightest need of demonstration  the point , i mean , that beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem .
a few words , however , in <unk> of my real meaning , which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to <unk> .
that pleasure which is at once the most intense , the most elevating , and the most pure , is , i believe , found in the contemplation of the beautiful .
when , indeed , men speak of beauty , they mean , precisely , not a quality , as is supposed , but an effect  they refer , in short , just to that intense and pure elevation of soul  not of intellect , or of heart  upon which i have commented , and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating " the beautiful . "
now i designate beauty as the province of the poem , merely because it is an obvious rule of <name> that effects should be made to spring from direct causes  that objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment  no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem .
now the object truth , or the satisfaction of the intellect , and the object passion , or the excitement of the heart , are , although attainable to a certain extent in poetry , far more readily attainable in prose .
truth , in fact , demands a precision , and passion a <unk> ( the truly passionate <name> comprehend me ) which are absolutely antagonistic to that beauty which , i maintain , is the excitement , or pleasurable elevation , of the soul .
it by no means follows from anything here said that passion , or even truth , may not be introduced , and even profitably introduced , into a poem  for they may serve in <unk> , or aid the general effect , as do <unk> in music , by contrast  but the true artist <name> always contrive , first , to tone them into proper <unk> to the predominant aim , and secondly , to <unk> them , as far as possible , in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem .
regarding , then , beauty as my province , my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestation  and all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness .
beauty of whatever kind , in its supreme development , invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears .
melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones .
the length , the province , and the tone being thus determined , i betook myself to ordinary induction , with the view of obtaining some artistic <unk> which might serve me as a <unk> in the construction of the poem  some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn .
in carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects  or more properly points , in the theatrical sense  i did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain .
the universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value , and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis .
i considered it , however , with regard to its susceptibility of improvement , and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition .
as commonly used , the refrain , or burden , not only is limited to lyric verse , but depends for its impression upon the force of monotone  both in sound and thought .
the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity  of repetition .
i resolved to <unk> , and so heighten the effect , by adhering in general to the monotone of sound , while i continually varied that of thought : that is to say , i determined to produce continuously novel effects , by the variation of the application of the refrain  the refrain itself remaining , for the most part , <unk> .
these points being settled , i next bethought me of the nature of my refrain .
since its application was to be repeatedly varied , it was clear that the refrain itself must be brief , for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length .
in proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation .
this led me at once to a single word as the best refrain .
the question now arose as to the character of the word .
having made up my mind to a refrain , the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a <unk> , the refrain forming the close to each stanza .
that such a close , to have force , must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis , admitted no doubt , and these considerations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous <unk> in connection with r as the most <unk> <unk> .
the sound of the refrain being thus determined , it became necessary to select a word <unk> this sound , and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which i had <unk> as the tone of the poem .
in such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word " nevermore . "
in fact , it was the very first which presented itself .
the next <unk> was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word " nevermore . "
in observing the difficulty which i at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition , i did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the <unk> that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a human being  i did not fail to perceive , in short , that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word .
here , then , immediately arose the idea of a <unk> creature capable of speech ; and very naturally , a parrot , in the first instance , suggested itself , but was superseded forthwith by a <name> as equally capable of speech , and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone .
i had now gone so far as the <name> of a <name> , the bird of <unk> , monotonously repeating the one word " nevermore " at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone , and in length about one hundred lines .
now , never losing sight of the object <unk> or perfection at all points , i asked myself  " of all melancholy topics what , according to the universal understanding of mankind , is the most melancholy ? "
death , was the obvious reply .
" and when , " i said , " is this most melancholy of topics most poetical ? "
from what i have already explained at some length , the answer here also is obvious  " when it most closely allies itself to beauty ; the death , then , of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world , and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover . "
i had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a <name> continuously repeating the word " nevermore . "
i had to combine these , bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the application of the word repeated , but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the <name> employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover .
and here it was that i saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending , that is to say , the effect of the variation of application .
i saw that i could make the first query propounded by the lover  the first query to which the <name> should reply " nevermore "  that i could make this first query a commonplace one , the second less so , the third still less , and so on , until at length the lover , startled from his original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself , by its frequent repetition , and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it , is at length excited to superstition , and wildly <unk> queries of a far different character  queries whose solution he has passionately at heart  <unk> them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in <unk>  <unk> them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or <unk> character of the bird ( which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by <unk> ) , but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so <unk> his questions as to receive from the expected " nevermore " the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow .
perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me , or , more strictly , thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction , i first established in mind the climax or concluding query  that query to which " nevermore " should be in the last place an answer  that query in reply to which this word " nevermore " should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair .
here then the poem may be said to have its beginning , at the end where all works of <name> should begin ; for it was here at this point of my <unk> that i first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza : " prophet , " said i , " thing of evil !
prophet still if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore , tell this soul with sorrow laden , if within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
i composed this stanza , at this point , first that , by establishing the climax , i might the better vary and graduate , as regards seriousness , and importance the preceding queries of the lover , and secondly , that i might definitely settle the rhythm , the metre , and the length and general arrangement of the stanza , as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede , so that none of them might surpass this in <unk> effect .
had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas , i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the <unk> effect .
and here i may as well say a few words of the versification .
my first object ( as usual ) was originality .
the extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world .
admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere rhythm , it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite ; and yet , for centuries , no man , in verse has ever done , or ever seemed to think of doing , an original thing .
the fact is that originality ( unless in minds of very unusual force ) is by no means a matter , as some suppose , of impulse or intuition .
in general , to be found , it must be elaborately sought and , although a positive merit of the highest class , demands in its attainment less of invention than negation .
of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the " <name> . "
the former is <unk>  the latter is <unk> <unk> , alternating with <unk> <unk> repeated in the refrain of the fifth verse , and terminating with <unk> <unk> .
less <unk> , the feet employed throughout ( <unk> ) consists of a long syllable followed by a short ; the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet , the second of seven and a half ( in effect two-thirds ) , the third of eight , the fourth of seven and a half , the fifth the same , the sixth three and a half .
now , each of these lines taken individually has been employed before , and what originality the " <name> " has , is in their combinations into stanzas ;  nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted .
the effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects , arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and <unk> .
the next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the <name>  and the first branch of this consideration was the <unk> .
for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest , or the fields  but it has always appeared to me that a close <unk> of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident  it has the force of a frame to a picture .
it has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention , and , of course , must not be confounded with mere unity of place .
i determined , then , to place the lover in his chamber  in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it .
the room is represented as richly furnished  this in mere pursuance of the ideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty , as the sole true poetical <unk> .
the <unk> being thus determined , i had now to introduce the bird  and the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable .
the idea of making the lover suppose , in the first instance , that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter , is a " tapping " at the door , originated in a wish to increase , by <unk> , the <unk> curiosity , and in a <name> to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover 's throwing open the door , finding all dark , and thence adopting the <unk> that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked .
i made the night tempestuous , first to account for the <name> 's seeking admission , and secondly , for the effect of contrast with the ( physical ) serenity within the chamber .
i made the bird alight on the bust of pallas , also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage  it being understood that the bust was absolutely suggested by the bird  the bust of pallas being chosen , first , as most in keeping with the <unk> of the lover , and , secondly , for the <unk> of the word , pallas , itself .
about the middle of the poem , also , i have availed myself of the force of contrast , with a view of deepening the ultimate impression .
for example , an air of the fantastic  approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible  is given to the <name> 's entrance .
he comes in " with many a flirt and flutter . "
not the least obeisance made he  not a moment stopped or stayed he , but with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door .
in the two stanzas which follow , the design is more obviously carried out : then this <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ? "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
the effect of the <unk> being thus provided for , i immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness  this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted , with the line , but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only , etc .
from this epoch the lover no longer jests  no longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the <name> 's demeanor .
he speaks of him as a " grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore , " and feels the " fiery eyes " burning into his " bosom 's core . "
this revolution of thought , or fancy , on the lover 's part , is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader  to bring the mind into a proper frame for the <unk>  which is now brought about as rapidly and as directly as possible .
with the <unk> proper  with the <name> 's reply , " nevermore , " to the lover 's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world  the poem , in its obvious phase , that of a simple narrative , may be said to have its completion .
so far , everything is within the limits of the accountable  of the real .
a <name> having learned by <unk> the single word " nevermore , " and having escaped from the custody of its owner , is driven at midnight , through the violence of a storm , to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams  the <unk> of a student , occupied half in pouring over a volume , half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased .
the casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird 's wings , the bird itself <unk> on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student , who , amused by the incident and the oddity of the <unk> demeanor , demands of it , in jest and with out looking for a reply , its name .
the <name> addressed , answers with its customary word , " nevermore "  a word which finds immediate <name> in the melancholy heart of the student , who , giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion , is again startled by the fowl 's repetition of " nevermore . "
the student now guesses the state of the case , but is impelled , as i have before explained , by the human thirst for <unk> , and in part by superstition , to <unk> such queries to the bird as <name> bring him , the lover , the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer " nevermore . "
with the indulgence , to the extreme , of this <unk> , the narration , in what i have termed its first or obvious phase , has a natural termination , and so far there has been no <unk> of the limits of the real .
but in subjects so handled , however skilfully , or with however vivid an array of incident , there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which <unk> the <unk> eye .
two things are invariably required  first , some amount of complexity , or more properly , adaptation ; and , secondly , some amount of <unk> , some <unk> , however indefinite of meaning .
it is this latter , in especial , which imparts to a work of <name> so much of that richness ( to borrow from colloquy a forcible term ) which we are too fond of <unk> with the ideal .
it is the excess of the suggested meaning  it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under current of theme  which turns into prose ( and that of the very <unk> kind ) the so-called poetry of the so-called <unk> .
holding these opinions , i added the two concluding stanzas of the poem  their <unk> being thus made to <unk> all the narrative which has preceded them .
the <unk> of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines : " take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore ! "
it <name> be observed that the words , " from out my heart , " involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem .
they , with the answer , " nevermore , " dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated .
the reader begins now to regard the <name> as <unk>  but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza , that the intention of making him <unk> of mournful and <unk> remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen : and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming , and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !
* * * * * old english poetry .
[ 1 ] it should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to what is , in itself , a thing apart from poetry  we mean to the simple love of the antique  and that , again , a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings , should be ascribed to a fact which , while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract , and with the old british poems themselves , should not be looked upon as a merit <unk> to the authors of the poems .
almost every devout admirer of the old bards , if demanded his opinion of their productions , would mention vaguely , yet with perfect sincerity , a sense of dreamy , wild , indefinite , and he would perhaps say , indefinable delight ; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure , he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling .
this <unk> is , in fact , a very powerful adjunct to <unk> , but in the case in question it arises independently of the author 's <name> , and is altogether apart from his intention .
words and their rhythm have varied .
verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight , and which delight , in many instances , may be traced to the one source , <unk> , must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air .
this is , of course , no argument against the poems now  we mean it only as against the poets then .
there is a growing <name> to overrate them .
the old english muse was <name> , guileless , sincere and although very learned , still learned without <name> .
no general error <unk> a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and <unk> metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so .
with the two former ethics were the end  with the two latter the means .
the poet of the " creation " wished , by highly artificial verse , to <unk> what he supposed to be moral truth  the poet of the " ancient mariner " to <unk> the poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis .
the one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the <unk> <unk> ; the other , by a path which could not possibly lead him astray , arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude .
but in this view even the " metaphysical verse " of <unk> is but evidence of the simplicity and <unk> of the man .
and he was in this but a type of his school  for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us , and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character .
they used little <name> in composition .
their writings sprang immediately from the soul  and partook intensely of that soul 's nature .
nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon  to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind  but , again , so to mingle the greatest possible fire , force , delicacy , and all good things , with the lowest possible <unk> , baldness , and imbecility , as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school <name> be found inferior to those results in one ( <unk> <unk> ) more artificial .
we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the " book of gems " are such as <name> impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school  but if the intention had been merely to show the school 's character , the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree .
there are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash , with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity .
the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us .
his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false .
his opinion , for example , of sir <name> 's <unk> 's " verses on the <name> of bohemia "  that " there are few finer things in our language , " is untenable and absurd .
in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of <unk> which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time .
here everything is <name> , <unk> , or but awkwardly concealed .
no <unk> for the mere antique ( and in this case we can imagine no other <unk> ) should induce us to <unk> with the sacred name of poetry , a series , such as this , of elaborate and threadbare compliments , stitched , apparently , together , without fancy , without plausibility , and without even an attempt at adaptation .
in common with all the world , we have been much delighted with " the shepherd 's hunting " by withers  a poem partaking , in a remarkable degree , of the peculiarities of <unk> <unk> ' .
speaking of <unk> , the author says : " by the murmur of a spring , or the least boughs <unk> , by a <name> whose leaves spread , shut when <unk> goes to bed , or a shady bush or tree , she could more <unk> in me than all nature 's beauties con in some other wiser man .
by her help i also now make this <unk> place allow something that may <unk> gladness in the very gall of sadness  the dull <unk> , the black shade , that these hanging vaults have made the strange music of the waves beating on these hollow caves , this black den which rocks <unk> , overgrown with eldest moss , the rude <unk> that give light more to terror than delight , this my chamber of neglect walled about with disrespect ; from all these and this dull air a fit object for despair , she hath taught me by her might to draw comfort and delight . "
but these lines , however good , do not bear with them much of the general character of the english antique .
something more of this <name> be found in <unk> 's " farewell to the fairies ! "
we copy a portion of <unk> " maiden lamenting for her <name> , " which we prefer  not only as a specimen of the elder poets , but in itself as a beautiful poem , abounding in pathos , exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness  to anything of its species : " it is a wondrous thing how fleet 't was on those little silver feet , with what a pretty skipping <name> it oft would challenge me the race , and whe n't had left me far away 'twould stay , and run again , and stay ; for it was <unk> much than <unk> , and trod as if on the four winds .
i have a garden of my own , but so with roses overgrown , and lilies , that you would it guess to be a little wilderness ; and all the <unk> of the year it only loved to be there .
among the beds of lilies i have sought it oft where it should lie , yet could not , till itself would rise , find it , although before mine eyes .
for in the <unk> lilies shade it like a bank of lilies laid ; upon the roses it would feed until its lips even seemed to bleed , and then to me 'twould boldly trip , and print those roses on my lip , but all its chief delight was still with roses thus itself to fill , and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold , had it lived long , it would have been lilies without , roses within . "
how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable !
it pervades all .
it comes over the sweet <name> of the words  over the gentleness and <name> which we fancy in the little maiden herself  even over the <unk> , <unk> air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite  like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets , " and all sweet flowers . "
the whole is <unk> with poetry of a very lofty order .
every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and <unk> of the <name> , or the <unk> of the maiden , or her love , or her admiration , or her grief , or the fragrance and warmth and <unk> of the little <unk> bed of lilies and roses which the <name> devoured as it lay upon them , and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and <name> smile on her face .
consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted  the wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite  the " little silver feet "  the <name> challenging his mistress to a race with " a pretty skipping <name> , " running on before , and then , with head turned back , awaiting her approach only to fly from it again  can we not distinctly perceive all these things ?
how exceedingly vigorous , too , is the line , " and trod as if on the four winds ! "
a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite , one for each wind .
then consider the garden of " my own , " so overgrown , entangled with roses and lilies , as to be " a little wilderness "  the <name> loving to be there , and there " only "  the maiden seeking it " where it should lie "  and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until " itself would rise "  the lying among the lilies " like a bank of lilies "  the loving to " fill itself with roses , " " and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold , " and these things being its " chief " delights  and then the <unk> beauty and <unk> of the concluding lines , whose very <unk> only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence , the <unk> , the enthusiasm , the passionate girl , and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child : " had it lived long , it would have been lilies without , roses within .

entered , according to act of congress , in the year 1848 , by <name> a. poe , in the <unk> office of the district court for the southern district of <unk> .
<unk> , trow & co <unk> , 33 <unk> .
with very profound respect , this work is dedicated to <name> <name> humboldt .
preface .
to the few who love me and whom i <unk> those who feel rather than to those who <unk> the dreamers and those who put <name> in dreams as in the only <unk> offer this book of truths , not in its character of <unk> , but for the beauty that abounds in its truth ; constituting it true .
to these i present the composition as an <unk> alone : <unk> us say as a romance ; or , if i be not urging too lofty a claim , as a poem .
what i here <unk> is true : <unk> it can not die : <unk> if by any means it be now trodden down so that it die , it <name> <unk> again to the life <unk> nevertheless it is as a poem only that i wish this work to be judged after i am dead .
e. a. p. eureka : an essay on the material and spiritual universe .
it is with humility really <unk> is with a sentiment even of <unk> i pen the opening sentence of this work : for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most <unk> most <unk> most <unk> most <name> .
what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their <unk> sublime in their <unk> the mere enunciation of my theme ?
i design to speak of the physical , metaphysical and <unk> the material and spiritual universe : <unk> its essence , its origin , its creation , its present condition and its <name> .
i shall be so rash , moreover , as to challenge the conclusions , and thus , in effect , to question the sagacity , of many of the greatest and most justly <unk> of men .
in the beginning , let me as distinctly as possible <unk> the <unk> which i <name> to <unk> , whatever the mathematicians may assert , there is , in this world at least , no such thing as <unk> the ruling idea which , throughout this volume , i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest .
my general proposition , then , is this : <unk> the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things , with the germ of their inevitable annihilation .
in illustration of this idea , i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression .
he who from the top of <unk> casts his eyes leisurely around , is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene .
only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he <name> to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its <unk> .
but as , on the summit of <unk> , no man has thought of whirling on his heel , so no man has ever taken into his <name> the full <unk> of the prospect ; and so , again , whatever considerations lie involved in this <unk> , have as yet no practical existence for mankind .
i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the <unk> the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate <unk> taken at all : —and it may be as well here to mention that by the term <unk> , ” wherever employed without qualification in this essay , i mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space , with all things , spiritual and material , that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse .
in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression , <unk> , ” i shall take a phrase of <unk> universe of <unk> why this distinction is considered necessary , <name> be seen in the sequel .
but even of treatises on the really limited , although always assumed as the <unk> , universe of stars , i know none in which a survey , even of this limited universe , is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality .
the nearest approach to such a work is made in the <unk> of <name> <name> humboldt .
he presents the subject , however , not in its individuality but in its generality .
his theme , in its last result , is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe , as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical universe .
his design is simply <unk> .
in a word , he <unk> the universality of material relation , and <unk> to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality .
but however admirable be the <unk> with which he has treated each particular point of his topic , the mere multiplicity of these points occasions , necessarily , an amount of detail , and thus an <unk> of idea , which <unk> all individuality of impression .
it seems to me that , in aiming at this latter effect , and , through it , at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from <unk> require something like a mental <unk> on the heel .
we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that , while the <unk> vanish altogether , even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one .
among the vanishing <unk> , in a survey of this kind , would be all exclusively terrestrial matters .
the earth would be considered in its <unk> relations alone .
a man , in this view , becomes mankind ; mankind a member of the <unk> family of <unk> .
and now , before proceeding to our subject proper , let me beg the <unk> attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter , which appears to have been found <unk> in a bottle and floating on the mare <unk> ocean well described by the <unk> <unk> , ptolemy <unk> , but little frequented in modern days unless by the <unk> and some other divers for <unk> .
the date of this letter , i confess , surprises me even more particularly than its contents ; for it seems to have been written in the year two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight .
as for the passages i am about to <unk> , they , i fancy , <name> speak for themselves .
“do you know , my dear friend , ” says the writer , addressing , no doubt , a <unk> you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the <unk> first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to truth ?
believe it if you can !
it appears , however , that long , long ago , in the night of time , there lived a turkish philosopher called <unk> and <unk> <unk> [ here , possibly , the letter-writer means aristotle ; the best names are <unk> corrupted in two or three thousand years . ]
“the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision , by means of which <unk> thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose ; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder , or at all events as the principal <unk> , of what was termed the <unk> or à priori philosophy .
he started with what he maintained to be axioms , or self-evident truths : —and the now well understood fact that no truths are <unk> , really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations : <unk> was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all .
from axioms he proceeded , logically , to results .
his most illustrious disciples were one <unk> , a <unk> , ” [ meaning euclid ] “and one kant , a dutchman , the originator of that species of <unk> which , with the change merely of a c for a k , now bears his peculiar name .
“well , <unk> <unk> flourished supreme , until the advent of one hog , <unk> ‘the <unk> shepherd , ’ who preached an entirely different system , which he called the à <unk> or <unk> .
his plan referred altogether to sensation .
he proceeded by observing , analyzing , and classifying <unk> <unk> , as they were somewhat <unk> <unk> arranging them into general laws .
in a word , while the mode of <unk> rested on <unk> , that of hog depended on phenomena ; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that , at its first introduction , <unk> fell into general <unk> .
finally , however , he recovered ground , and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rival : —the savans contenting themselves with <unk> all other competitors , past , present , and to come ; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the <unk> of a median law , to the effect that the <unk> and baconian roads are , and of right ought to be , the <unk> possible avenues to knowledge : <unk> , ’ you must know , my dear friend , ” adds the letter-writer at this point , <unk> an adjective invented as equivalent to <unk> , and at the same time more dignified and <unk> .
“now i do assure you most <unk> the <unk> i represent these matters fairly ; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated , in those days , to retard the progress of true science , which makes its most important <unk> all history <name> <unk> seemingly <unk> leaps .
these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling ; and i need not suggest to you that crawling , among varieties of locomotion , is a very capital thing of its kind ; —but because the tortoise is sure of foot , for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles ?
for many centuries , so great was the infatuation , about hog especially , that a <unk> stop was put to all thinking , properly so called .
no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone .
it mattered not whether the truth was even <unk> such ; for the <unk> philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained .
the end , with them , was a point of no moment , whatever : <unk> means ! ’ they <unk> us look at the means ! <unk> if , on scrutiny of the means , it was found to come neither under the category hog , nor under the category <unk> ( which means ram ) , why then the savans went no farther , but , calling the thinker a fool and <unk> him a <unk> , ’ would never , thenceforward , have any thing to do either with him or with his truths .
“now , my dear friend , ” continues the letter-writer , “it can not be maintained that by the crawling system , exclusively adopted , men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth , even in any long series of ages ; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes .
but their certainty was very far from absolute .
the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the <unk> who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly , the more closely he holds it to his eyes .
they blinded themselves , too , with the impalpable , <unk> scotch snuff of detail ; and thus the boasted facts of the <unk> were by no means always <unk> point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were .
the vital taint , however , in <unk> most lamentable <unk> of <unk> in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely <unk> <unk> those <unk> <unk> , the microscopical <unk> <unk> and <unk> of minute facts , for the most part in physical <unk> all of which they <unk> at the same price upon the highway ; their value depending , it was supposed , simply upon the fact of their fact , without reference to their <unk> or <unk> in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts , called law .
<unk> the <unk> letter goes on to <unk> the persons thus suddenly elevated by the <unk> philosophy into a station for which they were <unk> transferred from the <unk> into the parlors of <unk> its <unk> into its <unk> these individuals a more <unk> more intolerable set of <unk> and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth .
their creed , their text and their sermon were , alike , the one word <unk> , for the most part , even of this one word , they knew not even the meaning .
on those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use , the disciples of hog had no <name> whatever .
all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words <unk> , ’ <unk> , ’ <unk> thought , to be brief , was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves .
cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics , the mathematics , and logic , many of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> and lame of a <unk> more <unk> <unk> miserably ignorant , in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge , than the veriest <unk> hind who proves that he knows something at least , in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing .
<unk> had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty , when pursuing , in blind confidence , the à priori path of axioms , or of the ram .
at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a <unk> .
the simple truth is , that the <unk> erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air ; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all .
this they must have been very blind , indeed , not to see , or at least to suspect ; for , even in their own day , many of their <unk> <unk> had been abandoned : <unk> <unk> <unk> fit , ’ for example , and a <unk> can not act where it is not , ’ and <unk> can not be <unk> , ’ and <unk> can not proceed from <unk> these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted , without hesitation , as axioms , or undeniable truths , were , even at the period of which i speak , seen to be altogether untenable : <unk> absurd in these people , then , to persist in relying upon a basis , as immutable , whose <unk> had become so repeatedly manifest !
“but , even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves , it is easy to convict these à priori <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is easy to show the <unk> <unk> of their axioms in general .
i have now lying before <unk> <name> be observed that we still proceed with the <unk> have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago .
pundit assures me that it is decidedly the <unk> ancient work on its topic , which is <unk> the author , who was much esteemed in his day , was one miller , or mill ; and we find it recorded of him , as a point of some importance , that he rode a <unk> whom he called <name> bentham : —but let us glance at the volume itself !
<unk> ! <unk> or inability to conceive , ’ says mr. mill very properly , <unk> in no case to be received as a criterion of <unk> <unk> now , that this is a palpable <unk> no one in his senses <name> deny .
not to admit the proposition , is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself , whose very title is a <unk> of the steadfast .
if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth , then a truth to <name> hume would very seldom be a truth to <name> ; and ninety-nine <unk> of what is undeniable in heaven would be <unk> <unk> upon earth .
the proposition of mr. mill , then , is sustained .
i <name> not <name> it to be an axiom ; and this merely because i am showing that no axioms exist ; but , with a distinction which could not have been <unk> at even by mr. mill himself , i am ready to <name> that , if an axiom there be , then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an <unk> no more absolute axiom <unk> , consequently , that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced , must be either a <unk> in <unk> is to say no <unk> , if admitted <unk> , must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor .
“and now , by the logic of their own <unk> , let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded .
let us give mr. mill the fairest of play .
we <name> bring the point to no ordinary issue .
we <name> select for investigation no <unk> <unk> axiom of what , not the less <unk> because only <unk> , he terms his secondary <unk> if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth : <unk> <name> select , i say , no axiom of an <unk> so questionable as is to be found in euclid .
we <name> not talk , for example , about such propositions as that two straight lines can not enclose a space , or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts .
we <name> afford the <unk> every advantage .
we <name> come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
here it is : <unk> can not both be <unk> is , can not <unk> in <unk> here mr. mill means , for instance , —and i give the most forcible instance <unk> a tree must be either a tree or not a <unk> it can not be at the same time a tree and not a tree : <unk> which is quite reasonable of itself and <name> answer remarkably well as an axiom , until we bring it into <unk> with an axiom insisted upon a few pages <unk> other <unk> which i have previously <unk> we test it by the logic of its own <unk> .
<unk> tree , ’ mr. mill asserts , <unk> be either a tree or not a <unk> very well : —and now let me ask him , why .
to this little query there is but one response : <unk> defy any man living to invent a second .
the sole answer is this : <unk> we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be any thing else than a tree or not a <unk> this , i repeat , is mr. <unk> sole answer : <unk> <name> not pretend to suggest another : —and yet , by his own showing , his answer is clearly no answer at all ; for has he not already required us to admit , as an axiom , that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of <unk> truth ?
thus <unk> all his <unk> is at sea without a rudder .
let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made , in cases where the <unk> to <unk> is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree .
let no attempt , i say , be made at urging this <unk> ; for , in the first place , there are no degrees of <unk> , ’ and thus no one impossible <name> can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible <name> : —in the second place , mr. mill himself , no doubt after thorough deliberation , has most distinctly , and most rationally , excluded all opportunity for exception , by the emphasis of his proposition , that , in no case , is ability or inability to conceive , to be taken as a criterion of <unk> truth : —in the third place , even were exceptions admissible at all , it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here .
that a tree can be both a tree and not a tree , is an idea which the angels , or the devils , may entertain , and which no doubt many an earthly <unk> , or <unk> , does .
“now i do not quarrel with these ancients , ” continues the letter-writer , <unk> much on account of the transparent frivolity of their <unk> , to be plain , was <unk> , worthless and fantastic <unk> on account of their pompous and <unk> <unk> of all other roads to truth than the two narrow and crooked <unk> one of creeping and the other of <unk> which , in their ignorant perversity , they have dared to confine the <unk> soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly <unk> of <unk> “by the bye , my dear friend , is it not an evidence of the mental slavery <unk> upon those bigoted people by their hogs and rams , that in spite of the eternal <unk> of their savans about roads to truth , none of them fell , even by accident , into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest , the straightest and most available of all mere <unk> great <unk> majestic highway of the consistent ?
is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the <unk> momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth ?
how <unk> rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition !
by its means , investigation has been taken out of the hands of the <unk> , and given as a duty , rather than as a task , to the <unk> the only true <unk> the <unk> men of ardent imagination .
these <unk> <unk> <unk> are the <unk> you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors , were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as i write ?
the <unk> , i repeat , <unk> their theories are merely <unk> , little by little , of their chaff of <unk> at length there stands apparent an <unk> <unk> consistency which the most stolid <unk> it is a <unk> be an absolute and an unquestionable truth .
“i have often thought , my friend , that it must have puzzled these <unk> of a thousand years ago , to determine , even , by which of their two boasted roads it is that the <unk> attains the solution of the more <unk> <unk> by which of them <unk> guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which , for so many centuries , have lain entombed amid the <unk> hieroglyphics of egypt .
in especial , would it not have given these <unk> some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of all their <unk> <unk> fact of gravitation ?
<name> deduced it from the laws of kepler .
kepler admitted that these laws he <unk> laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of british astronomers that principle , the basis of all ( existing ) physical principle , in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of metaphysics .
yes ! <unk> vital laws kepler <unk> is to say , he imagined them .
had he been asked to point out either the <unk> or <unk> route by which he attained them , his reply might have <unk> know nothing about <unk> i do know the machinery of the universe .
here it is .
i grasped it with my <unk> reached it through mere dint of <unk> alas , poor ignorant old man !
could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called <unk> was but the conviction resulting from <unk> or <unk> of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness , eluded his reason , or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression ?
how great a pity it is that some <unk> <unk> had not enlightened him about all this !
how it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that , instead of having gone <unk> and thus <unk> , he had , in fact , proceeded <unk> and <unk> is to say <unk> , or at least <unk> the vast halls where lay gleaming , <unk> , and hitherto untouched by mortal <unk> by mortal <unk> imperishable and priceless secrets of the universe !
“yes , kepler was essentially a <unk> ; but this title , now of so much sanctity , was , in those ancient days , a designation of supreme contempt .
it is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old <unk> sympathize with the <unk> and poetical <unk> of his <unk> words .
for my part , ” continues the unknown correspondent , “i glow with a sacred fire when i even think of them , and feel that i shall never grow weary of their repetition : —in concluding this letter , let me have the real pleasure of <unk> them once again : <unk> care not whether my work be read now or by posterity .
i can afford to wait a century for readers when god himself has waited six thousand years for an observer .
i triumph .
i have stolen the golden secret of the egyptians .
i <name> indulge my sacred <unk> here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and , perhaps , somewhat impertinent epistle ; and perhaps it would be folly to comment , in any respect , upon the <unk> , not to say revolutionary , fancies of the <unk> he <unk> so radically at war with the <unk> and <unk> opinions of this age .
let us proceed , then , to our legitimate <unk> , the universe .
this <unk> admits a choice between two modes of discussion : <unk> may <unk> or <unk> .
beginning at our own point of <unk> the earth on which we <unk> may pass to the other planets of our <unk> to the <unk> to our system considered <unk> thence , through other systems , indefinitely outwards ; or , commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it , we may come down to the habitation of man .
<unk> is to say , in ordinary essays on <unk> first of these two modes is , with certain reservation , adopted : <unk> for the obvious reason that astronomical facts , merely , and principles , being the object , that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate , gradually onward to the point where all <unk> becomes lost in the remote .
for my present purpose , however , —that of enabling the mind to take in , as if from afar and at one glance , a distinct <name> of the individual <unk> is clear that a descent to small from <unk> the outskirts from the centre ( if we could establish a centre ) <unk> the end from the beginning ( if we could fancy a beginning ) would be the preferable course , but for the difficulty , if not impossibility , of presenting , in this course , to the <unk> , a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in <unk> is to say , in number , magnitude and distance .
now , <unk> , at all points , is a primary feature in my general design .
on important topics it is better to be a good deal <unk> than even a very little obscure .
but <unk> is a quality <unk> to no subject per se .
all are alike , in facility of comprehension , to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps .
it is merely because a <unk> , here and there , is heedlessly left <unk> in our road to the <unk> <unk> , that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr. <name> <unk> .
by way of admitting , then , no chance for <unk> , i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader .
in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred , i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to <unk> very especially of the <unk> in detail which <name> be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan .
commencing with a descent , i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made .
let us begin , then , at once , with that merest of words , <unk> this , like <unk> , ” <unk> , ” and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages , is by no means the expression of an <unk> of an effort at one .
it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible <name> .
man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this <unk> cloud behind which lay , forever invisible , the object of this attempt .
a word , in fine , was demanded , by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect .
out of this demand arose the word , <unk> ; ” which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought .
as regards that infinity now <unk> infinity of <unk> often hear it said that <unk> idea is admitted by the <unk> acquiesced <unk> <unk> account of the greater difficulty which attends the <name> of a <unk> but this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers , time out of mind , have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves .
the quibble lies concealed in the word <unk> “the mind , ” we are told , <unk> the idea of limitless , through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited , <unk> now , were the proposition but fairly put , its absurdity would become transparent at once .
clearly , there is no mere difficulty in the case .
the assertion intended , if presented according to its intention and without <unk> , would run thus : <unk> mind admits the idea of limitless , through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited , <unk> it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective <unk> of two arguments between whose respective <unk> reason is called upon to decide : <unk> is a matter of two conceptions , directly conflicting , and each <unk> impossible , one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining , on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other .
the choice is not made between two difficulties ; <unk> is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities .
now of the former , there are <unk> of the latter , none : <unk> as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested .
a task may be more or less difficult ; but it is either possible or not possible : <unk> are no gradations .
it might be more difficult to overthrow the andes than an <unk> ; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other .
a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty , but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the <unk> .
since all this is undeniable : since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of <name> : since one impossibility can not be greater than another : and since , thus , one can not be preferred to another : the philosophers who not only maintain , on the grounds mentioned , man’s idea of infinity but , on account of such <unk> idea , infinity <unk> plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other <unk> impossible too .
this , it <name> be said , is nonsense ; and perhaps it is : <unk> i think it very capital <unk> forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine .
the <unk> mode , however , of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question , is by simply <unk> to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite <unk> fact that the argument alluded to both proves and <unk> its own proposition .
“the mind is impelled , ” say the <unk> and others , “to admit a first cause , by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without <unk> the quibble , as before , lies in the word <unk> here what is it employed to sustain ?
a first cause .
and what is a first cause ?
an ultimate termination of causes .
and what is an ultimate termination of causes ?
<unk> finite .
thus the one quibble , in two processes , by god knows how many philosophers , is made to support now <unk> and now <unk> it not be brought to support something besides ?
as for the <unk> , at least , are insupportable .
<unk> dismiss them : <unk> they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other .
of course , no one <name> suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word <unk> my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself or even our <name> of it , by any such blundering <unk> as that which is ordinarily employed .
nevertheless , as an individual , i may be permitted to say that i cannot conceive infinity , and am convinced that no human being can .
a mind not thoroughly <unk> accustomed to the <unk> analysis of its own <unk> , it is true , often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the <name> of which we speak .
in the effort to entertain it , we proceed step beyond <unk> fancy point still beyond point ; and so long as we continue the effort , it may be said , in fact , that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed ; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it , is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor .
but it is in the act of <unk> the <unk> fulfilling ( as we think ) the <unk> putting the finishing stroke ( as we suppose ) to the <unk> we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point .
this fact , however , we fail to perceive , on account of the absolute coincidence , in time , between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in <unk> attempting , on the other hand , to frame the idea of a limited space , we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility .
we believe in a god .
we may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space ; but our belief , in such cases , is more properly designated as <name> , and is a matter quite distinct from that belief <unk> that intellectual <unk> <unk> the mental <name> .
the fact is , that , upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which <unk> <unk> class representing thoughts of <unk> who has a right to say that he thinks at all , feels himself called upon , not to entertain a <name> , but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point , in the intellectual firmament , where lies a <unk> never to be resolved .
to solve it , indeed , he makes no effort ; for with a rapid instinct he <unk> , not only the impossibility , but , as regards all human purposes , the <unk> , of its solution .
he perceives that the deity has not designed it to be solved .
he sees , at once , that it lies out of the <name> of man , and even how , if not exactly why , it lies out of it .
there are people , i am aware , who , <unk> themselves in attempts at the unattainable , acquire very easily , by dint of the <unk> they emit , among those <unk> with whom darkness and depth are synonymous , a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity ; but the finest quality of thought is its <unk> ; and , with some little <unk> , it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which , extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain , shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension .
it <name> now be understood that , in using the phrase , <unk> of space , ” i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible <name> of an absolute infinity .
i refer simply to the <unk> conceivable <unk> of <unk> shadowy and fluctuating domain , now shrinking , now swelling , in accordance with the <unk> energies of the imagination .
hitherto , the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper , as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse .
it has been always either directly or indirectly <unk> least since the <name> of intelligible <unk> , were it possible for us to attain any given point in space , we should still find , on all sides of us , an interminable succession of stars .
this was the untenable idea of <unk> when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made , at <unk> the <name> for which we struggle in the word <unk> “it is a sphere , ” he says , <unk> which the centre is everywhere , the circumference , <unk> but although this intended definition is , in fact , no definition of the universe of stars , we may accept it , with some mental reservation , as a definition ( rigorous enough for all practical purposes ) of the universe <unk> is to say , of the universe of space .
this latter , then , let us regard as <unk> sphere of which the centre is everywhere , the circumference <unk> in fact , while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space , we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings .
as our <unk> , then , let us adopt the <unk> .
of this <unk> , in itself , he alone is not <unk> alone is not impious who <unk> .
<unk> ne <unk> <unk> , ” says the baron de <unk> ne <unk> <unk> de la nature ou de <unk> de dieu : <unk> <unk> ce <unk> est , il <unk> <unk> dieu <unk> know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of god : —in order to comprehend what he is , we should have to be god <unk> <unk> should have to be god ourselves ! <unk> a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears , i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is <unk> condemned .
by him , <unk> , at least , the <unk> <unk> him as <unk> is to say , as not <unk> distinction which , for all intelligible purposes , <name> stand well instead of a <unk> him , then , existing as spirit , let us content ourselves , to-night , with supposing to have been created , or made out of nothing , by dint of his <unk> some point of space which we <name> take as a <unk> some period into which we do not pretend to inquire , but at all events immensely <unk> him , then again , let us suppose to have been <unk> ?
this is a <unk> momentous epoch in our considerations .
what is it that we are <unk> alone we are justified in supposing to have been , primarily and solely , created ?
we have attained a point where only intuition can aid us : —but now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition .
it is but the conviction arising from those <unk> or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness , elude our reason , or defy our capacity of expression .
with this understanding , i now <unk> an intuition altogether irresistible , although inexpressible , forces me to the conclusion that what god originally <unk> that matter which , by dint of his volition , he first made from his spirit , or from <unk> , could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state <unk> ? <unk> simplicity ?
this <name> be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse .
i use the word <unk> in its ordinary sense ; yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition , is very , very far indeed , from being really a mere assumption .
nothing was ever more <unk> human conclusion was ever , in fact , more <unk> rigorously <unk> : —but , alas !
the processes lie out of the human <unk> all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue .
let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be , when , or if , in its absolute extreme of simplicity .
here the reason flies at once to <unk> a <unk> one <unk> particle of one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> particle , therefore , <unk> form and <unk> particle positively a particle at all <unk> particle absolutely unique , individual , undivided , and not <unk> only because he who created it , by dint of his <name> , can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same <name> , as a matter of course , divide it .
<unk> , then , is all that i predicate of the originally created matter ; but i propose to show that this <unk> is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution , the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe .
the willing into being the primordial particle , has completed the act , or more properly the <name> , of creation .
we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle <unk> is to say , the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see <unk> constitution of the universe from it , the particle .
this constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many .
an action of this character implies rëaction .
a diffusion from unity , under the conditions , involves a tendency to return into <unk> tendency ineradicable until satisfied .
but on these points i <name> speak more fully hereafter .
the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite <unk> .
let us conceive the particle , then , to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space .
from the one particle , as a centre , let us suppose to be <unk> <unk> all <unk> immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant <unk> certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of <unk> yet not infinitely minute atoms .
now , of these atoms , thus diffused , or upon diffusion , what conditions are we <unk> to assume , but to infer , from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion ?
unity being their source , and difference from unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion , we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design , and to form a portion of the design itself : —that is to say , we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the <unk> and simplicity of the origin .
but , for these reasons , shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous , dissimilar , unequal , and <unk> ?
more <unk> we to consider no two atoms as , at their diffusion , of the same nature , or of the same form , or of the same size ? —and , after fulfilment of their diffusion into space , is absolute <unk> , each from each , to be understood of all of them ?
in such arrangement , under such conditions , we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have <unk> design of variety out of <unk> out of <unk> out of <unk> out of <unk> a word , the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically <unk> one .
undoubtedly , therefore , we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned , but for the reflection , first , that <unk> is not <unk> of any divine act ; and , secondly , that the object supposed in view , appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with , in the beginning , as when all are understood immediately to exist .
i mean to say that some are involved in the rest , or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable .
difference of size , for example , <name> at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second , in preference to a third , on account of particular <unk> ; which is to be comprehended as particular <unk> between centres of quantity , in neighboring atoms of different <unk> matter not at all interfering with the <unk> distribution of the atoms .
difference of kind , too , is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form , taken more or less conjointly : —in fact , since the unity of the particle proper implies absolute <unk> , we can not imagine the atoms , at their diffusion , differing in kind , without imagining , at the same time , a special exercise of the divine <name> , at the <unk> of each atom , for the purpose of effecting , in each , a change of its essential nature : <unk> fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged , as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition .
we perceive , therefore , upon the whole , that it would be <unk> , and consequently <unk> , to predicate of the atoms , in view of their purposes , any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion , with particular <unk> after <unk> other differences arising at once out of these , in the very first processes of <unk> : <unk> thus establish the universe on a purely geometrical basis .
of course , it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference , even of form , among all the atoms <unk> more than absolute particular <unk> of each from each .
we are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar <unk> atoms which can ever approximate , until their inevitable <unk> at the end .
although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the <unk> atoms to return into their normal unity , is implied , as i have said , in their abnormal diffusion ; still it is clear that this tendency <name> be without <unk> tendency and no <unk> the <unk> energy , in ceasing to be exerted , shall leave it , the tendency , free to seek its satisfaction .
the divine act , however , being considered as determinate , and <unk> on fulfilment of the diffusion , we understand , at once , a <unk> other words , a <unk> tendency of the <unk> atoms to return into one .
but the <unk> energy being withdrawn , and the rëaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate <unk> of the utmost possible <unk> design is now in danger of being frustrated , in detail , by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general .
multiplicity is the object ; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms , from <unk> at once , through the now <unk> <unk> the fulfilment of any ends proposed in <unk> absolute <unk> among themselves : <unk> is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses , at various points of space : —in other words , nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses , each absolutely one .
for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design , we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited <unk> <unk> something which , on withdrawal of the <unk> volition , shall at the same time allow the approach , and forbid the junction , of the atoms ; suffering them infinitely to approximate , while denying them positive contact ; in a word , having the <unk> to a certain <unk> preventing their <unk> , but no ability to interfere with their <unk> in any respect or degree .
the repulsion , already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards , must be understood , let me repeat , as having power to prevent absolute <unk> , only up to a certain epoch .
unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never ; <unk> we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no <unk> <name> which can not really be entertained , however much we may talk or dream of entertaining <unk> are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined , <name> , <unk> pressure of the <unk> collectively applied , but never and in no degree until , on fulfilment of the divine purposes , such collective application shall be naturally <unk> to a force which , at that ultimate epoch , shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required , and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable , because original and therefore normal , <unk> conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed : <unk> can not even comprehend the possibility of their <unk> ; <unk> , the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive .
that the repulsive something actually exists , we see .
man neither employs , nor knows , a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact .
this is but the well-established proposition of the <unk> of matter .
all experiment <unk> philosophy admits it .
the design of the <unk> necessity for its <unk> have endeavored to show ; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously <unk> ; this on account of an <unk> conviction that the principle at issue is strictly <unk> in a recess impervious to our present <unk> involved in a consideration of what <unk> our human <unk> not to be <unk> a consideration of spirit in itself .
i feel , in a word , that here the god has interposed , and here only , because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god .
in fact , while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity , <name> be recognized , at once , as the principle of the newtonian gravity , what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence <unk> limits to the ( immediate ) satisfaction of the tendency , <name> be understood as that which we have been in the practice of <unk> now as heat , now as magnetism , now as electricity ; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the <unk> of the phraseology with which we endeavor to <unk> it .
calling it , merely for the moment , electricity , we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given , as an ultimate result , the principle , or seeming principle , <unk> .
only where things differ is electricity apparent ; and it is <unk> that they never differ where it is not developed at least , if not apparent .
now , this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached <unk> .
the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms ; and these atoms are represented as different each from each .
difference is their <unk> <unk> as <unk> was the <unk> of their source .
when we say , then , that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort , on the part of the repulsive influence , to prevent the contact , we may as well use the strictly <unk> sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences <name> result in a development of electricity .
all existing bodies , of course , are composed of these atoms in proximate contact , and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences ; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit , on bringing together any two such assemblages , would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each : <unk> expression which , when reduced , is equivalent to this : <unk> amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies , is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are <unk> that no two bodies are absolutely alike , is a simple <unk> from all that has been here said .
electricity , therefore , existing always , is developed whenever any bodies , but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference , are brought into approximation .
to <unk> , for the present , continuing to call <unk> may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light , heat and magnetism ; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of vitality , consciousness and thought .
on this topic , however , i need pause here merely to suggest that these phænomena , whether observed generally or in detail , seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous .
<unk> now the two equivocal terms , <unk> and <unk> , ” let us adopt the more definite expressions , <unk> and <unk> the former is the body ; the latter the soul : the one is the material ; the other the spiritual , principle of the universe .
no other principles <unk> all phænomena are referable to one , or to the other , or to both combined .
so rigorously is this the <unk> thoroughly <unk> is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the <unk> other words , by which matter is manifested to <unk> , for all merely <unk> purposes , we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and <unk> attraction and repulsion are matter : <unk> being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term <unk> and the terms <unk> and <unk> , ” taken together , as equivalent , and therefore <unk> , expressions in logic .
i said , just now , that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity , would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity : and , in fact , there can be little difficulty in such an understanding , if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view , as a force impelling matter to seek matter ; that is to say , when we pay no attention to the known modus <unk> of the newtonian force .
the general coincidence satisfies us ; but , upon looking closely , we see , in detail , much that appears <unk> , and much in regard to which no coincidence , at least , is established .
for example ; the newtonian gravity , when we think of it in certain moods , does not seem to be a tendency to <unk> at all , but rather a tendency of all bodies in all <unk> phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion .
here , then , is an <unk> .
again ; when we reflect on the mathematical law governing the newtonian tendency , we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good , in respect of the modus <unk> , at least , between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed .
in fact , i have attained a point at which it <name> be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes .
so far , we have gone on à priori , from an abstract consideration of simplicity , as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god .
let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us , à <unk> , some legitimate <unk> .
what does the newtonian law declare ? —that all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances .
purposely , i have here given , in the first place , the vulgar version of the law ; and i confess that in this , as in most other vulgar <unk> of great truths , we find little of a suggestive character .
let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology : <unk> atom , of every body , attracts every other atom , both of its own and of every other body , with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted <unk> , indeed , a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind .
but let us see distinctly what it was that <name> <unk> to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools .
he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe , composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced , coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation .
this was the amount of his <unk> is to say , this was the amount of it , according to the conventional cant of the <unk> his successes added proof multiplied by <unk> proof as a sound intellect <unk> the demonstration of the law itself , persist the <unk> , had not been strengthened in any degree .
<unk> , physical proof , ” however , of attraction , here upon earth , in accordance with the newtonian theory , was , at length , much to the satisfaction of some intellectual <unk> , afforded .
this proof arose <unk> and incidentally ( as nearly all important truths have arisen ) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth .
in the famous <unk> , <unk> and bailly experiments for this purpose , the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen , felt , measured , and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer .
but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed <unk> spite of the so-called <unk> of the <unk> by the so-called <unk> and physical <unk> spite of the character of this <unk> ideas which even really philosophical men can not help <unk> of <unk> , especially , the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain , are seen to have been derived , for the most part , from a consideration of the principle as they find it <unk> in the planet upon which they stand .
now , to what does so partial a consideration <unk> what species of error does it give rise ?
on the earth we see and feel , only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth .
no man in the common walks of life could be made to see or to feel anything <unk> be made to perceive that anything , anywhere , has a perpetual , <unk> tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the earth ; yet ( with an exception hereafter to be specified ) it is a fact that every earthly thing ( not to speak now of every heavenly thing ) has a tendency not only to the <unk> centre but in every conceivable direction besides .
now , although the philosophic can not be said to err with the vulgar in this matter , they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced , without knowing it , by the sentiment of the vulgar idea .
<unk> the pagan fables are not believed , ” says <name> , in his very <unk> <unk> , ” <unk> we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing <unk> i mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth , <unk> mankind into the fancy of <unk> or <unk> respecting <unk> been continually <unk> towards this fancy even the mightiest <unk> , although imperceptibly , leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle ; thus preventing them , up to this date , from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite <unk> the <unk> essential <unk> , not of <unk> or <unk> of universality and diffusion .
this <unk> <unk> is unity as the source of the <unk> .
let me now repeat the definition of gravity : <unk> atom , of every body , attracts every other atom , both of its own and of every other body , with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom .
here let the reader pause with me , for a moment , in contemplation of the <unk> the <unk> the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other <unk> merely in this fact of the attraction , without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is <unk> merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all , in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball , exceed , probably , in mere point of number , all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe .
had we discovered , simply , that each atom tended to some one favorite <unk> some especially attractive <unk> should still have fallen upon a discovery which , in itself , would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind : —but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend ?
that each atom <unk> with the most delicate movements of every other atom , and with each and with all at the same time , and forever , and according to a determinate law of which the complexity , even considered by itself solely , is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man .
if i propose to ascertain the influence of one <unk> in a <unk> upon its neighboring <unk> , i can not accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment .
if i venture to <unk> , by even the <unk> part of an inch , the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger , what is the character of that act upon which i have <unk> ?
i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path , which causes the sun to be no longer the sun , and which alters forever the <name> of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator .
these <unk> such as <unk> <unk> rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect : <unk> , i repeat , such as these , are such as we can alone <name> profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle , attraction .
but now , <unk> such <unk> such a vision of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his <unk> any person competent of thought on such topics as these , set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phænomena <unk> condition from which they sprang .
does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage ?
does not a sympathy so <unk> , so ineradicable , and so thoroughly <unk> , suggest a common <unk> as its source ?
does not one extreme <unk> the reason to the other ?
does not the infinitude of division refer to the <unk> of individuality ?
does not the <unk> of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple ?
it is not that the atoms , as we see them , are divided or that they are complex in their <unk> that they are inconceivably divided and <unk> complex : <unk> is the <unk> of the conditions to which i now allude , rather than to the conditions themselves .
in a word , is it not because the atoms were , at some remote epoch of time , even more than <unk> it not because originally , and therefore normally , they were <unk> now , in all <unk> all <unk> all <unk> all modes of <unk> all relations and through all <unk> struggle back to this absolutely , this <unk> , this unconditionally one ?
some person may here demand : <unk> it is to the one that the atoms struggle <unk> we not find and define attraction <unk> merely general tendency to a centre ? <unk> , in especial , do not your <unk> atoms which you describe as having been <unk> from a <unk> at once , <unk> , back to the central point of their origin ? ” i reply that they do ; as <name> be distinctly shown ; but that the cause of their so doing is quite <unk> of the centre as such .
they all tend <unk> towards a centre , because of the <unk> with which they have been <unk> into space .
each atom , forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms , finds more atoms in the direction of the centre , of course , than in any other , and in that direction , therefore , is <unk> is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin .
it is not to any point that the atoms are allied .
it is not any locality , either in the concrete or in the abstract , to which i suppose them bound .
nothing like location was conceived as their origin .
their source lies in the principle , unity .
this is their lost parent .
this they seek <unk> all <unk> it is even partially to be found ; thus <unk> , in some measure , the ineradicable tendency , while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end .
it follows from all this , that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the law , or modus <unk> , of the attractive force in general , <name> account for this law in particular : —that is to say , any principle which <name> show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances , <name> be admitted as satisfactorily accounting , at the same time , for the tendency , according to the same law , of these atoms each to each : <unk> the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each , and not any tendency to a centre as <unk> it <name> be seen , also , that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity , which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth , and declares this merely ; but ( always under the supposition that what i propose be , in the end , admitted ) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided , in the future processes of science , were a more ample phraseology adopted : <unk> instance : <unk> atom tends to every other atom & c. with a force & c. : the general result being a tendency of all , with a similar force , to a general <unk> the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result ; but , while in the one process intuition was the <unk> , in the other it was the goal .
in commencing the former journey i could only say that , with an irresistible intuition , i felt simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of god : —in ending the latter i can only declare that , with an irresistible intuition , i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phænomena of the newtonian gravitation .
thus , according to the schools , i prove nothing .
so be it : <unk> design but to <unk> to convince through the suggestion .
i am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously <unk> human intellects which can not help being abundantly content with <unk> .
to these <unk> to my <unk> is no mathematical demonstration which could bring the least additional true proof of the great truth which i have <unk> truth of original unity as the <unk> the principle of the universal phænomena .
for my part , i am not so sure that i speak and <unk> am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives : <unk> the rising of <unk> <unk> probability that as yet lies in the <unk> do not pretend to be one thousandth part as <unk> i am of the irretrievably <unk> fact that all things and all thoughts of things , with all their ineffable multiplicity of relation , sprang at once into being from the primordial and <unk> one .
referring to the newtonian gravity , dr. <name> , the eloquent author of “the architecture of the heavens , ” says : <unk> truth we have no reason to suppose this great law , as now revealed , to be the ultimate or simplest , and therefore the universal and <unk> , form of a great ordinance .
the mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of distance , has not the aspect of an ultimate principle ; which always assumes the simplicity and <unk> of those axioms which constitute the basis of <unk> now , it is quite true that <unk> principles , ” in the common understanding of the words , always assume the simplicity of geometrical <unk> ( as for <unk> , ” there is no such thing ) —but these principles are clearly not <unk> ; ” in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles , properly <unk> there can be but one principle , the volition of god .
we have no right to assume , then , from what we observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name <unk> , ” anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle proper .
the <unk> <unk> of which dr. <name> speaks as having geometrical simplicity , may and do have this geometrical turn , as being part and parcel of a vast geometrical system , and thus a system of simplicity <unk> which , nevertheless , the truly ultimate principle is , as we know , the consummation of the <unk> is to say , of the <unk> is it not the spiritual capacity of god ?
i quoted dr. <unk> remark , however , not so much to question its philosophy , as by way of calling attention to the fact that , while all men have admitted some principle as existing behind the law of gravity , no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle in particular is : <unk> we except , perhaps , occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to magnetism , or mesmerism , or <unk> , or <unk> , or some other equally delicious <unk> of the same species , and invariably patronized by one and the same species of people .
the great mind of <name> , while boldly grasping the law itself , shrank from the principle of the law .
the more fluent and comprehensive at least , if not the more patient and profound , sagacity of laplace , had not the courage to attack it .
but hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is , perhaps , not so very difficult to understand .
they , as well as all the first class of mathematicians , were mathematicians solely : <unk> intellect , at least , had a <unk> <unk> tone .
what lay not distinctly within the domain of physics , or of mathematics , seemed to them either <unk> or shadow .
nevertheless , we may well wonder that <unk> , who was a marked exception to the general rule in these respects , and whose mental temperament was a singular <unk> of the mathematical with the <unk> , did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue .
either <name> or laplace , seeking a principle and discovering none physical , would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was absolutely none ; but it is almost impossible to fancy , of <unk> , that , having exhausted in his search the physical dominions , he would not have stepped at once , boldly and hopefully , amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of metaphysics .
here , indeed , it is clear that he must have <unk> in search of the treasure : —that he did not find it after all , was , perhaps , because his <name> guide , imagination , was not sufficiently <unk> , or well-educated , to direct him aright .
i observed , just now , that , in fact , there had been certain vague attempts at referring gravity to some very uncertain <unk> .
these attempts , however , although considered bold and justly so considered , looked no farther than to the <unk> merest <unk> the newtonian law .
its modus <unk> has never , to my knowledge , been approached in the way of an effort at explanation .
it is , therefore , with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset , and before i can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide upon them , that i here declare the modus <unk> of the law of gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable <unk> is to say , when we make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the true <unk> we regard it from the proper point of view .
whether we reach the idea of absolute unity as the source of all things , from a consideration of simplicity as the most probable characteristic of the original action of god ; <unk> we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality of relation in the <unk> phænomena ; <unk> whether we attain it as a result of the mutual <unk> afforded by both processes ; <unk> , the idea itself , if entertained at all , is entertained in inseparable connection with another <unk> of the condition of the universe of stars as we now perceive <unk> is to say , a condition of immeasurable diffusion through space .
now a connection between these two <unk> and <unk> can not be established unless through the entertainment of a third <unk> of irradiation .
absolute unity being taken as a centre , then the existing universe of stars is the result of irradiation from that centre .
now , the laws of irradiation are known .
they are part and parcel of the sphere .
they belong to the class of indisputable geometrical properties .
we say of them , “they are <unk> are <unk> to demand why they are true , would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based .
nothing is <unk> , strictly speaking ; but if anything be , then the <unk> laws in question are demonstrated .
but these <unk> do they declare ?
<unk> what steps does it proceed outwardly from a centre ?
from a luminous centre , light issues by irradiation ; and the quantities of light received upon any given plane , supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther from it , <name> be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body , are increased ; and <name> be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished .
the expression of the law may be thus <unk> : —the number of <unk> ( or , if the phrase be preferred , the number of <unk> ) received upon the shifting plane , <name> be inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of the plane .
<unk> yet again , we may say that the <unk> <unk> irradiation , in a <unk> directly proportional with the squares of the distances .
[ illustration ] for example : at the distance b , from the luminous centre a , a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface b .
then at double the <unk> is to say at <unk> <name> be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfaces : <unk> treble the distance , or at d , they <name> be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaces : <unk> , at quadruple the distance , or at e , they <name> have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such <unk> so on forever .
in saying , generally , that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances , we use the term irradiation to express the degree of the diffusion as we proceed outwardly from the centre .
conversing the idea , and employing the word <unk> to express the degree of the drawing together as we come back toward the centre from an outward position , we may say that <unk> proceeds inversely as the squares of the distances .
in other words , we have reached the conclusion that , on the hypothesis that matter was originally <unk> from a centre and is now returning to it , the <unk> , in the return , proceeds exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed .
now here , if we could be permitted to assume that <unk> exactly represented the force of the tendency to the <unk> the one was exactly proportional to the other , and that the two proceeded <unk> should have shown all that is required .
the sole difficulty existing , then , is to establish a direct proportion between <unk> and the force of <unk> ; and this is done , of course , if we establish such proportion between <unk> and the force of irradiation .
a very slight inspection of the heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity , equability , or <unk> , of distribution through that region of space in which , collectively , and in a roughly globular form , they are situated : <unk> species of very general , rather than absolute , equability , being in full keeping with my deduction of <unk> , within certain limits , among the originally diffused atoms , as a <unk> from the evident design of infinite complexity of relation out of <unk> .
i started , it <name> be remembered , with the idea of a generally uniform but particularly <unk> distribution of the atoms ; <unk> idea , i repeat , which an inspection of the stars , as they exist , confirms .
but even in the merely general equability of distribution , as regards the atoms , there appears a difficulty which , no doubt , has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that i suppose this equability of distribution effected through irradiation from a centre .
the very first glance at the idea , irradiation , forces us to the entertainment of the hitherto <unk> and seemingly inseparable idea of <unk> about a centre , with dispersion as we recede from <unk> idea , in a word , of <unk> of distribution in respect to the matter <unk> .
now , i have elsewhere [ 1 ] observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one now in <unk> <unk> <unk> protuberances above the plane of the <unk> reason feels her way , if at all , in her search for the true .
by the <unk> <unk> presented , i leap at once to the <unk> secret which i might never have attained but for the peculiarity and the inferences which , in its mere character of peculiarity , it affords me .
[ 1 ] <unk> in the rue <unk> .
133 .
the process of thought , at this point , may be thus roughly sketched : <unk> say to <unk> , as i have explained it , is a <unk> feel it .
diffusion is a <unk> see it .
irradiation , by which alone these two truths are reconciled , is a consequent <unk> perceive it .
equability of diffusion , first deduced à priori and then corroborated by the inspection of phænomena , is also a <unk> fully admit it .
so far all is clear around me : <unk> are no clouds behind which the <unk> great secret of the <unk> modus <unk> possibly lie hidden ; —but this secret lies hereabouts , most assuredly ; and were there but a cloud in view , i should be driven to suspicion of that <unk> and now , just as i say this , there actually comes a cloud into view .
this cloud is the seeming impossibility of <unk> my truth , irradiation , with my truth , equability of diffusion .
i say now : <unk> this seeming impossibility is to be found what i <unk> i do not say <unk> impossibility ; ” for invincible <name> in my truths assures me that it is a mere difficulty after <unk> i go on to say , with unflinching confidence , that , when this difficulty shall be solved , we shall find , wrapped up in the process of solution , the key to the secret at which we aim .
<unk> feel that we shall discover but one possible solution of the difficulty ; this for the reason that , were there two , one would be <unk> be <unk> be <unk> contain no <unk> no duplicate key can be needed to any secret of nature .
and now , let us see : <unk> usual notions of <unk> fact all our distinct notions of <unk> caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in light .
here there is a continuous <unk> of <unk> , and with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at all .
now , in any such irradiation as <unk> and of unvarying <unk> regions nearer the centre must inevitably be always more crowded with the <unk> matter than the regions more remote .
but i have assumed no such irradiation as this .
i assumed no continuous irradiation ; and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved , first , the necessity of entertaining a <name> which i have shown no man can entertain , and which ( as i <name> more fully explain hereafter ) all observation of the firmament <unk> <name> of the absolute infinity of the universe of <unk> would have involved , secondly , the impossibility of understanding a <unk> is , <unk> existing <unk> , while an act is continued , no rëaction , of course , can take place .
my assumption , then , or rather my inevitable deduction from just <unk> that of a determinate <unk> finally <unk> .
let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space , so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution .
for convenience of illustration , let us imagine , in the first place , a hollow sphere of glass , or of anything else , occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused , by means of irradiation , from the absolute , <unk> , <unk> particle , placed in the centre of the sphere .
now , a certain exertion of the <unk> power ( presumed to be the divine volition ) —in other words , a certain <unk> measure is the quantity of <unk> is to say , the number of <unk> ; emits , by irradiation , this certain number of atoms ; forcing them in all directions outwardly from the <unk> proximity to each other diminishing as they <unk> , finally , they are distributed , loosely , over the interior surface of the sphere .
when these atoms have attained this position , or while proceeding to attain it , a second and inferior exercise of the same <unk> a second and inferior force of the same <unk> , in the same <unk> is to say , by irradiation as <unk> second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first ; the number of atoms , in this case as in the former , being of course the measure of the force which emitted them ; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it <unk> force and the number of atoms sent out by the force , being directly proportional .
when this second stratum has reached its destined <unk> while approaching <unk> third still inferior exertion of the force , or a third inferior force of a similar <unk> number of atoms emitted being in all cases the measure of the <unk> to deposit a third stratum upon the second : —and so on , until these concentric strata , growing gradually less and less , come down at length to the central point ; and the <unk> matter , simultaneously with the <unk> force , is exhausted .
we have now the sphere filled , through means of irradiation , with atoms <unk> diffused .
the two necessary <unk> of irradiation and of equable <unk> satisfied ; and by the sole process in which the possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable .
for this reason , i confidently expect to find , lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere , the secret of which i am in <unk> all-important principle of the modus <unk> of the newtonian law .
let us examine , then , the actual condition of the atoms .
they lie in a series of concentric strata .
they are <unk> diffused throughout the sphere .
they have been <unk> into these states .
the atoms being <unk> distributed , the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata , or spheres , the more atoms <name> lie upon it .
in other words , the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres , is directly proportional with the extent of that surface .
but , in any series of concentric spheres , the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the <unk> [ 2 ] [ 2 ] <unk> surfaces of spheres are as the squares of their radii .
therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that <unk> distance from the centre .
but the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that <unk> is to say , is directly proportional with the force .
therefore the force which <unk> any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that <unk> distance from the centre : <unk> , generally , the force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the <unk> now , rëaction , as far as we know anything of it , is action conversed .
the general principle of gravity being , in the first place , understood as the rëaction of an <unk> the expression of a <name> on the part of matter , while existing in a state of diffusion , to return into the unity whence it was diffused ; and , in the second place , the mind being called upon to determine the character of the <unk> manner in which it would , naturally , be manifested ; in other words , being called upon to conceive a probable law , or modus <unk> , for the return ; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure .
that such would be the case , any one , at least , would be abundantly justified in taking for granted , until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should not be the <unk> such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable .
matter , then , <unk> into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances , might , à priori , be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying inversely as the squares of the distances : and i have already shown [ 3 ] that any principle which <name> explain why the atoms should tend , according to any law , to the general centre , must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining , at the same time , why , according to the same law , they should tend each to each .
for , in fact , the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such , but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends most directly to its real and essential centre , <unk> absolute and final union of all .
[ 3 ] <name> 44 .
the consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment <unk> this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with <unk> : —and , upon the whole , it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view .
the absolute , <unk> particle primarily created by the volition of god , must have been in a condition of positive <unk> , or <unk> <unk> implies relation .
right is positive ; wrong is <unk> merely the negation of right ; as cold is the negation of <unk> of light .
that a thing may be wrong , it is necessary that there be some other thing in relation to which it is <unk> condition which it fails to satisfy ; some law which it <unk> ; some being whom it <unk> .
if there be no such being , law , or condition , in respect to which the thing is <unk> , still more especially , if no beings , laws , or conditions exist at <unk> the thing <unk> be wrong and consequently must be right .
any deviation from <unk> involves a tendency to return into it .
a difference from the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty ; and if the force which <unk> the difficulty be not infinitely continued , the ineradicable tendency to return <name> at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction .
upon withdrawal of the force , the tendency acts .
this is the principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action .
employing a phraseology of which the seeming affectation <name> be pardoned for its <unk> , we may say that rëaction is the return from the condition of as it is and ought not to be into the condition of as it was , originally , and therefore ought to be : —and let me add here that the absolute force of rëaction would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> ever it were possible to measure this latter : —and , consequently , the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced by the tendency which we now <unk> tendency to return into the absolutely <unk> the supremely primitive .
gravity , then , must be the strongest of <unk> idea reached à priori and abundantly confirmed by induction .
what use i make of the idea , <name> be seen in the sequel .
the atoms , now , having been diffused from their normal condition of unity , seek to return <unk> ?
not to any particular point , certainly ; for it is clear that if , upon the diffusion , the whole universe of matter had been projected , collectively , to a distance from the point of irradiation , the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been disturbed in the least : —the atoms would not have sought the point in absolute space from which they were originally impelled .
it is merely the condition , and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise , that these atoms seek to <unk> ; <unk> is merely that condition which is their <unk> , that they <name> .
“but they seek a centre , ” it <name> be said , “and a centre is a <unk> true ; but they seek this point not in its character of <unk> ( for , were the whole sphere moved from its position , they would seek , equally , the centre ; and the centre then would be a new point ) —but because it so happens , on account of the form in which they collectively <unk> ( that of the sphere ) —that only through the point in <unk> <unk> <unk> can attain their true object , unity .
in the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction .
each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the circumference beyond , there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight <unk> greater number of objects that seek it , the individual <unk> greater number of tendencies to <unk> greater number of <unk> for its own tendency to <unk> a word , because in the direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction , generally , for its own individual appetite .
to be brief , the condition , unity , is all that is really sought ; and if the atoms seem to seek the centre of the sphere , it is only <unk> , through <unk> such centre happens to imply , to include , or to involve , the only essential centre , unity .
but on account of this implication or <unk> , there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency to unity in the abstract , from the tendency to the concrete centre .
thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre is , to all practical intents and for all logical purposes , the tendency each to each ; and the tendency each to each is the tendency to the centre ; and the one tendency may be assumed as the other ; whatever <name> apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the other ; and , in conclusion , whatever principle <name> satisfactorily explain the one , can not be questioned as an explanation of the other .
in looking carefully around me for rational objection to what i have advanced , i am able to discover nothing ; —but of that class of objections usually urged by the <unk> for <unk> sake , i very readily perceive three ; and proceed to dispose of them in order .
it may be said , first : “the proof that the force of irradiation ( in the case described ) is directly proportional to the squares of the distances , depends upon an unwarranted <unk> of the number of atoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are <unk> i reply , not only that i am warranted in such assumption , but that i should be utterly <unk> in any other .
what i assume is , simply , that an effect is the measure of its <unk> every exercise of the divine <name> <name> be proportional to that which demands the <unk> the means of <unk> , or of <unk> , <name> be exactly adapted to its purposes .
neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect .
had the force which <unk> any stratum to its position , been either more or less than was needed for the <unk> is to say , not directly proportional to the <unk> to its position that stratum could not have been <unk> .
had the force which , with a view to general equability of distribution , emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum , been not directly proportional to the number , then the number would not have been the number demanded for the equable distribution .
the second <unk> objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer .
it is an admitted principle in <unk> that every body , on receiving an impulse , or disposition to move , <name> move onward in a straight line , in the direction imparted by the impelling force , until deflected , or stopped , by some other force .
how then , it may be asked , is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as <unk> their movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere , when no second force , of more than an imaginary character , appears , to account for the <unk> ?
i reply that the objection , in this case , actually does arise out of <unk> unwarranted <unk> the part of the <unk> assumption of a principle , in <unk> , at an epoch when no <unk> , ” in anything , exist : <unk> use the word <unk> , ” of course , in the <unk> understanding of the word .
“in the <unk> we can <unk> we can <unk> one first <unk> truly ultimate <unk> volition of god .
the primary <unk> of irradiation from <unk> have been independent of all that which the world now calls <unk> all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act : <unk> say <unk> act ; for the creation of the absolute material particle is more properly to be regarded as a <name> than as an <unk> in the ordinary meaning of the term .
thus , we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call <unk> but this primary act itself is to be considered as continuous volition .
the thought of god is to be understood as originating the <unk> proceeding with <unk> regulating <unk> , finally , as being withdrawn from it upon its completion .
then commences rëaction , and through rëaction , <unk> , ” as we employ the word .
it <name> be advisable , however , to limit the application of this word to the two immediate results of the <unk> of the divine <unk> is , to the two agents , attraction and repulsion .
every other natural agent depends , either more or less immediately , upon these two , and therefore would be more conveniently designated as <unk> .
it may be objected , thirdly , that , in general , the peculiar mode of distribution which i have suggested for the atoms , is <unk> hypothesis and nothing <unk> now , i am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous <unk> , grasped immediately , if not lifted , by all very diminutive thinkers , upon the first appearance of any proposition wearing , in any particular , the garb of a theory .
but <unk> can not be wielded here to any good purpose , even by those who succeed in lifting <unk> men or great .
i maintain , first , that only in the mode described is it conceivable that matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution .
i maintain , secondly , that these conditions themselves have been imposed upon me , as necessities , in a train of <unk> as rigorously logical as that which establishes any demonstration in euclid ; and i maintain , thirdly , that even if the charge of <unk> were as fully sustained as it is , in fact , <unk> and untenable , still the validity and <unk> of my result would not , even in the slightest particular , be disturbed .
to explain : —the newtonian <unk> law of <unk> law whose existence as such no one out of bedlam <unk> law whose admission as such enables us to account for nine-tenths of the universal <unk> law which , merely because it does so enable us to account for these phænomena , we are perfectly willing , without reference to any other considerations , to admit , and can not help admitting , as a <unk> law , nevertheless , of which neither the principle nor the modus <unk> of the principle , has ever yet been traced by the human <unk> law , in short , which , neither in its detail nor in its generality , has been found susceptible of explanation at <unk> at length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable , provided only we yield our assent <unk> ?
to an hypothesis ?
why if an <unk> the merest <unk> an hypothesis for whose <unk> in the case of that pure hypothesis the newtonian law <unk> shadow of à priori reason could be <unk> an hypothesis , even so absolute as all this implies , would enable us to perceive a principle for the newtonian <unk> enable us to understand as satisfied , conditions so <unk> <unk> complex and seemingly <unk> as those involved in the relations of which gravity tells us , <unk> rational being could so expose his <unk> as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any <unk> , indeed , he were to persist in so calling it , with the understanding that he did so , simply for the sake of consistency in words ?
but what is the true state of our present case ?
what is the fact ?
not only that it is not an hypothesis which we are required to adopt , in order to admit the principle at issue explained , but that it is a logical conclusion which we are requested not to adopt if we can avoid <unk> we are simply invited to deny if we can : <unk> conclusion of so accurate a <unk> that to dispute it would be the <unk> doubt its validity beyond our power : <unk> conclusion from which we see no mode of escape , turn as we <name> ; a result which <unk> us either at the end of an <unk> journey from the phænomena of the very law discussed , or at the close of a <unk> career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable <unk> assumption , in a word , of simplicity itself .
and if here , for the mere sake of <unk> , it be urged , that although my <unk> is , as i assert , the assumption of absolute simplicity , yet simplicity , considered merely in itself , is no axiom ; and that only deductions from axioms are <unk> is thus that i reply : — every other science than logic is the science of certain concrete relations .
arithmetic , for example , is the science of the relations of <unk> , of the relations of <unk> in general , of the relations of quantity in <unk> whatever can be increased or diminished .
logic , however , is the science of relation in the <unk> absolute <unk> relation considered solely in itself .
an axiom in any particular science other than logic is , thus , merely a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for <unk> when we say , for instance , that the whole is greater than its part : —and , thus again , the principle of the logical <unk> other words , of an axiom in the <unk> , simply , <unk> of relation .
now , it is clear , not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another , but that what is obvious to one mind at one epoch , may be anything but obvious , at another epoch , to the same mind .
it is clear , moreover , that what , to-day , is obvious even to the majority of mankind , or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind , may to-morrow be , to either majority , more or less obvious , or in no respect obvious at all .
it is seen , then , that the <unk> principle itself is susceptible of variation , and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change .
being <unk> , the <unk> which grow out of them are necessarily <unk> too ; or , in other words , are never to be positively depended upon as truths at <unk> truth and immutability are one .
it <name> now be readily understood that no <unk> <unk> idea founded in the fluctuating principle , <unk> of <unk> possibly be so <unk> reliable a basis for any structure erected by the reason , as that <unk> ( whatever it is , wherever we can find it , or if it be practicable to find it anywhere ) <unk> is <unk> <unk> not only presents to the understanding no <unk> of relation , either greater or less , to be considered , but subjects the intellect , not in the <unk> degree , to the necessity of even looking at any relation at all .
if such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term <unk> axiom , ” it is at least preferable , as a logical basis , to any axiom ever propounded , or to all imaginable axioms combined : —and such , precisely , is the idea with which my <unk> process , so thoroughly corroborated by induction , commences .
my particle proper is but absolute <unk> .
to sum up what has been here advanced : <unk> a starting point i have taken it for granted , simply , that the beginning had nothing behind it or before <unk> it was a beginning in <unk> it was a beginning and nothing different from a <unk> short that this beginning <unk> which it was .
if this be a <unk> <unk> then a <unk> <unk> let it be .
to conclude this branch of the subject : <unk> am fully warranted in announcing that the law which we have been in the habit of calling gravity exists on account of <unk> having been <unk> , at its origin , <unk> , into a limited [ 4 ] sphere of space , from one , individual , <unk> , <unk> , and absolute particle proper , by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy , at the same time , the two conditions , irradiation , and <unk> distribution throughout the <unk> is to say , by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the <unk> atoms , respectively , and the particular centre of irradiation .
[ 4 ] limited <unk> sphere is necessarily limited .
i prefer <unk> to a chance of <unk> .
i have already given my reasons for presuming matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely continued force .
supposing a continuous force , we should be unable , in the first place , to comprehend a rëaction at all ; and we should be required , in the second place , to entertain the impossible <name> of an infinite extension of matter .
not to dwell upon the impossibility of the <name> , the infinite extension of matter is an idea which , if not positively <unk> , is at least not in any respect warranted by <unk> observation of the <unk> point to be explained more fully hereafter ; and this <unk> reason for believing in the original <unk> of matter is <unk> confirmed .
for example : <unk> , for the moment , the possibility of understanding space filled with the <unk> <unk> is to say , admitting , as well as we can , for <unk> sake , that the succession of the <unk> atoms had absolutely no <unk> it is abundantly clear that , even when the volition of god had been withdrawn from them , and thus the tendency to return into unity permitted ( <unk> ) to be satisfied , this permission would have been <unk> and <unk> valueless and of no effect whatever .
no rëaction could have taken place ; no movement toward unity could have been made ; no law of gravity could have obtained .
to explain : <unk> the abstract tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal unity : <unk> , what is the same thing , admit any given atom as proposing to move in any given <unk> is clear that , since there is an infinity of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move , it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given , on account of a precisely equal and <unk> tendency in the direction diametrically opposite .
in other words , exactly as many tendencies to unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it ; for it is a mere <unk> to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line , or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite .
thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever .
under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for <unk> sake , there could have been no aggregation of <unk> <unk> <unk> but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential universe .
in fact , view it as we <name> , the whole idea of unlimited matter is not only untenable , but impossible and preposterous .
with the understanding of a sphere of atoms , however , we perceive , at once , a <unk> tendency to union .
the general result of the tendency each to each , being a tendency of all to the centre , the general process of condensation , or approximation , commences immediately , by a common and simultaneous movement , on withdrawal of the divine volition ; the individual <unk> , or <unk> <unk> atom with atom , being subject to almost infinite variations of time , degree , and condition , on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation , arising from the differences of form assumed as <unk> the atoms at the moment of their quitting the particle proper ; as well as from the subsequent particular <unk> , each from each .
what i wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising , at once , ( on withdrawal of the <unk> force , or divine volition , ) out of the condition of the atoms as described , at innumerable points throughout the universal sphere , innumerable <unk> , characterized by innumerable specific differences of form , size , essential nature , and distance each from each .
the development of repulsion ( electricity ) must have commenced , of course , with the very earliest particular efforts at unity , and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of <unk> is to say , in that of condensation , or , again , of <unk> .
thus the two principles proper , attraction and <unk> material and the <unk> each other , in the strictest fellowship , forever .
thus the body and the soul walk hand in hand .
if now , in fancy , we select any one of the <unk> considered as in their primary stages throughout the universal sphere , and suppose this incipient <unk> to be taking place at that point where the centre of our sun <unk> rather where it did exist originally ; for the sun is perpetually shifting his <unk> shall find ourselves met , and borne onward for a time at least , by the most magnificent of <unk> the nebular <unk> of laplace : <unk> <unk> is far too comprehensive a term for what he really <unk> is the constitution of our solar system <unk> one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the universe <unk> universal <unk> <unk> and absolute <unk> which forms the subject of my present discourse .
confining himself to an obviously limited <unk> of our solar system with its comparatively immediate <unk> merely <unk> is to say , assuming without any basis whatever , either <unk> or <unk> of what i have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption ; assuming , for example , matter as diffused ( without pretending to account for the diffusion ) throughout , and somewhat beyond , the space occupied by our <unk> in a state of heterogeneous <unk> and obedient to that <unk> law of gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guess ; <unk> all this ( which is quite true , although he had no logical right to its assumption ) laplace has shown , <unk> and mathematically , that the results in such case necessarily ensuing , are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the system itself .
to explain : <unk> us conceive that particular <unk> of which we have just <unk> one at the point designated by our <unk> <unk> have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a roughly globular form ; its centre being , of course , coincident with what is now , or rather was originally , the centre of our sun ; and its <unk> extending out beyond the orbit of neptune , the most remote of our planets : —in other words , let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to be some <unk> millions of miles .
for ages , this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation , until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine ; having proceeded gradually , of course , from its atomic and imperceptible state , into what we understand of visible , palpable , or otherwise appreciable <unk> .
now , the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary <unk> rotation which , commencing with the absolute <unk> of the aggregation , has been ever since acquiring velocity .
the very first two atoms which met , approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite , would , in rushing partially past each other , form a nucleus for the <unk> movement described .
how this would increase in velocity , is readily seen .
the two atoms are joined by others : <unk> aggregation is formed .
the mass continues to <unk> while condensing .
but any atom at the circumference has , of course , a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre .
the outer atom , however , with its superior velocity , approaches the centre ; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes .
thus every atom , proceeding inwardly , and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre , adds something to the original velocity of that <unk> is to say , increases the <unk> movement of the mass .
let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies precisely the space circumscribed by the orbit of neptune , and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves , in the general rotation , is precisely that velocity with which neptune now revolves about the sun .
at this epoch , then , we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force , having gotten the better of the <unk> centripetal , loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum , or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata , at the equator of the sphere , where the <unk> velocity <unk> ; so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions : <unk> as the exterior portion thrown off , by excessive velocity of rotation , from a grindstone , would form a ring about the grindstone , but for the solidity of the superficial material : were this <unk> , or anything similar in consistency , precisely the <unk> i describe would be presented .
the ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass , revolved , of course , as a separate ring , with just that velocity with which , while the surface of the mass , it <unk> .
in the meantime , condensation still proceeding , the interval between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase , until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter .
now , admitting the ring to have possessed , by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials , a constitution nearly uniform , then this ring , as such , would never have ceased revolving about its primary ; but , as might have been anticipated , there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials , to make them cluster about centres of superior solidity ; and thus the annular form was destroyed .
[ 5 ] no doubt , the band was soon broken up into several portions , and one of these portions , <unk> in mass , absorbed the others into itself ; the whole settling , <unk> , into a planet .
that this latter , as a planet , continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a ring , is sufficiently clear ; and that it took upon itself also , an additional movement in its new condition of sphere , is readily explained .
the ring being understood as yet unbroken , we see that its exterior , while the whole revolves about the parent body , moves more rapidly than its interior .
when the rupture occurred , then , some portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others .
the superior movement prevailing , must have whirled each fragment <unk> is to say , have caused it to <unk> ; and the direction of the rotation must , of course , have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose .
all the fragments having become subject to the rotation described , must , in <unk> , have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their <unk> planet was neptune .
its material continuing to undergo condensation , and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting , at length , the better of the centripetal , as before in the case of the parent orb , a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet : this ring , having been <unk> in its constitution , was broken up , and its several fragments , being absorbed by the most massive , were collectively <unk> into a moon .
subsequently , the operation was repeated , and a second moon was the result .
we thus account for the planet neptune , with the two satellites which accompany him .
[ 5 ] laplace assumed his <unk> heterogeneous , merely that he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the rings ; for had the <unk> been homogeneous , they would not have broken .
i reach the same <unk> of the secondary masses immediately resulting from the <unk> from an à priori consideration of their general <unk> .
in throwing off a ring from its equator , the sun <unk> that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation ; but , as this condensation still proceeded , the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed , through the increase of rotation .
by the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of <unk> , we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed : a second equatorial band was , consequently , thrown off , which , proving <unk> , was broken up , as before in the case of neptune ; the fragments settling into the planet <unk> ; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the sun indicates , of course , the <unk> speed of that <unk> equatorial surface at the moment of the separation .
<unk> , adopting a rotation from the collective <unk> of the fragments composing it , as previously explained , now threw off ring after ring ; each of which , becoming broken up , settled into a moon : <unk> moons , at different epochs , having been formed , in this manner , by the rupture and general <unk> of as many distinct <unk> rings .
by the time the sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of saturn , the balance , we are to suppose , between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed , through increase of <unk> velocity , the result of condensation , that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary ; and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before ; which , on rupture through <unk> , became consolidated into the planet saturn .
this latter threw off , in the first place , seven uniform bands , which , on rupture , were <unk> respectively into as many moons ; but , subsequently , it appears to have discharged , at three distinct but not very distant epochs , three rings whose equability of constitution was , by apparent accident , so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture ; thus they continue to revolve as rings .
i use the phrase <unk> accident ; ” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was , of course , nothing : —the term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable law .
shrinking still farther , until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of jupiter , the sun now found need of farther effort to restore the <unk> of its two forces , continually <unk> in the still continued increase of rotation .
jupiter , accordingly , was now thrown off ; passing from the annular to the <unk> condition ; and , on attaining this latter , threw off in its turn , at four different epochs , four rings , which finally resolved themselves into so many moons .
still shrinking , until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the <unk> , the sun now discarded a ring which appears to have had eight centres of superior solidity , and , on breaking up , to have separated into eight fragments no one of which so far <unk> in mass as to absorb the others .
all therefore , as distinct although comparatively small planets , proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances , each from each , may be considered as in some degree the measure of the force which drove them asunder : <unk> the orbits , nevertheless , being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling them one , in view of the other <unk> orbits .
continuing to shrink , the sun , on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of mars , now discharged this <unk> course by the process repeatedly described .
having no moon , however , mars could have thrown off no ring .
in fact , an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent body , the centre of the system .
the <unk> of its <unk> , which is the <unk> of its density , and which again is the <unk> of its condensation , out of which latter arose the constant disturbance of <unk> , by this period , have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed .
thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of <unk> the planets , first , and secondly , in the original mass .
we must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the planets as we approach the sun , to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded .
exactly the converse is to be understood .
the longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior ; the shortest , between those of the two exterior , planets .
the decrease of the interval of space is , nevertheless , the measure of the density , and thus inversely of the condensation , of the sun , throughout the processes detailed .
having shrunk , however , so far as to fill only the orbit of our earth , the parent sphere whirled from itself still one other <unk> <unk> a condition so nebulous as to admit of this <unk> <unk> , in its turn , yet another , which is our moon ; —but here terminated the lunar formations .
finally , subsiding to the orbits first of <name> and then of mercury , the sun discarded these two interior planets ; neither of which has given birth to any moon .
thus from his original <unk> , to speak more accurately , from the condition in which we first considered <unk> a partially <unk> nebular mass , certainly much more than <unk> millions of miles in <unk> great central orb and origin of our <unk> system , has gradually descended , by condensation , in obedience to the law of gravity , to a globe only <unk> miles in diameter ; but it by no means follows , either that its condensation is yet complete , or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet .
i have here <unk> outline of course , but still with all the detail necessary for <unk> view of the nebular theory as its author himself conceived it .
from whatever point we regard it , we shall find it beautifully true .
it is by far too beautiful , indeed , not to possess truth as its <unk> here i am very profoundly serious in what i say .
in the revolution of the satellites of <unk> , there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of laplace ; but that one inconsistency can <unk> a theory constructed from a million of intricate <unk> , is a fancy fit only for the fantastic .
in <unk> , confidently , that the apparent anomaly to which i refer , <name> , sooner or later , be found one of the strongest possible <unk> of the general hypothesis , i pretend to no especial spirit of <unk> .
it is a matter which the only difficulty seems not to foresee .
[ 6 ] [ 6 ] i am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the satellites of <unk> is a simply perspective anomaly arising from the inclination of the axis of the planet .
the bodies whirled off in the processes described , would exchange , it has been seen , the superficial rotation of the orbs whence they originated , for a revolution of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres ; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed , so long as the centripetal force , or that with which the discarded body <unk> toward its parent , is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded ; that is , than the centrifugal , or , far more properly , than the <unk> , velocity .
from the unity , however , of the origin of these two forces , we might have expected to find them as they are <unk> one accurately <unk> the other .
it has been shown , indeed , that the act of <unk> is , in every case , merely an act for the preservation of the <unk> .
after referring , however , the centripetal force to the <unk> law of gravity , it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises , to seek beyond the limits of mere <unk> is to say , of secondary <unk> solution of the <unk> of <unk> velocity .
this latter they attribute directly to a first <unk> god .
the force which carries a <unk> body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the <unk> is the childish phraseology <unk> the finger of deity itself .
in this view , the planets , fully formed , are conceived to have been hurled from the divine hand , to a position in the vicinity of the suns , with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses , or attractive capacities , of the suns themselves .
an idea so grossly <unk> , although so <unk> adopted , could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation , each to each , of two forces so seemingly independent , one of the other , as are the <unk> and <unk> .
but it should be remembered that , for a long time , the coincidence between the <unk> rotation and her <unk> <unk> matters seemingly far more independent than those now <unk> looked upon as positively miraculous ; and there was a strong disposition , even among astronomers , to attribute the <name> to the direct and continual agency of <unk> , in this case , it was said , had found it necessary to interpose , specially , among his general laws , a set of <unk> regulations , for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories , or perhaps the horrors , of the other side of the <unk> that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided , and must perpetually avoid , the <unk> scrutiny of mankind .
the advance of science , however , soon <unk> to the philosophical instinct needed no <unk> the one movement is but a <unk> more , even , than a <unk> the other .
for my part , i have no <name> with <unk> at once so <unk> , so idle , and so awkward .
they belong to the veriest cowardice of thought .
that nature and the god of nature are distinct , no thinking being can long doubt .
by the former we imply merely the laws of the latter .
but with the very idea of god , omnipotent , <unk> , we entertain , also , the idea of the infallibility of his laws .
with him there being neither past nor <unk> him all being <unk> we not insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingency ? <unk> , rather , what idea can we have of any possible contingency , except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws ?
he who , <unk> himself of prejudice , shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself , can not fail to arrive , in the end , at the condensation of laws into <unk> can not fail of reaching the conclusion that each law of nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws , and that all are but consequences of one primary exercise of the divine volition .
such is the principle of the <unk> which , with all necessary deference , i here venture to suggest and to maintain .
in this view , it <name> be seen that , dismissing as frivolous , and even impious , the fancy of the <unk> force having been imparted to the planets immediately by “the finger of god , ” i consider this force as originating in the rotation of the stars : <unk> rotation as brought about by the <unk> of the primary atoms , towards their respective centres of aggregation : <unk> <unk> as the consequence of the law of gravity : <unk> law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into <unk> : <unk> tendency to return as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of <unk> act by which a god , <unk> and alone existing , became all things at once , through dint of his volition , while all things were thus constituted a portion of god .
the radical assumptions of this discourse suggest to me , and in fact imply , certain important modifications of the nebular theory as given by laplace .
the efforts of the repulsive power i have considered as made for the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms , and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to <unk> is to say , in the ratio of condensation .
[ 7 ] in other words , electricity , with its <unk> phænomena , heat , light and magnetism , is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds , and , of course , inversely as density proceeds , or the cessation to condense .
thus the sun , in the process of its aggregation , must soon , in developing repulsion , have become excessively <unk> incandescent : and we can perceive how the operation of <unk> its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of its surface consequent on cooling .
any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested , is separated , through <unk> , from the interior mass .
but , on every successive rejection of the crust , the new surface would appear incandescent as before ; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged , may well be imagined as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed , by the whole mass , to restore the equilibrium of its two forces , <unk> through condensation .
in other words : <unk> the time the electric influence ( repulsion ) has prepared the surface for rejection , we are to understand that the <unk> influence ( attraction ) is precisely ready to reject it .
here , then , as everywhere , the body and the soul walk hand in hand .
[ 7 ] see <name> 70 .
these ideas are <unk> confirmed at all points .
since condensation can never , in any body , be considered as absolutely at an end , we are warranted in anticipating that , whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter , we shall find indications of resident <unk> in all the <unk> <unk> and planets as well as suns .
that our moon is strongly <unk> , we see at her every total eclipse , when , if not so , she would disappear .
on the dark part of the satellite , too , during her phases , we often observe flashes like our own <unk> ; and that these latter , with our various other so-called electrical phænomena , without reference to any more steady radiance , must give our earth a certain appearance of <unk> to an inhabitant of the moon , is quite evident .
in fact , we should regard all the phænomena referred to , as mere manifestations , in different moods and degrees , of the <unk> <unk> condensation .
if my views are <unk> , we should be prepared to find the newer <unk> is to say , those nearer the <unk> luminous than those older and more remote : —and the extreme brilliancy of <name> ( on whose dark portions , during her phases , the <unk> are frequently visible ) does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb .
she is no doubt vividly <unk> , although less so than mercury : while the <unk> of neptune may be comparatively nothing .
admitting what i have urged , it is clear that , from the moment of the <unk> <unk> a ring , there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light , on account of the continuous <unk> of his surface ; and that a period would <unk> period immediately previous to a new <unk> a very material decrease of both light and heat , must become apparent .
now , we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable .
on the melville <unk> <unk> merely one out of a hundred <unk> find traces of <unk> <unk> plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our sun to any portion of the surface of the earth .
is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the <unk> of <name> ?
at this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence ; and , in fact , this influence must then have attained its maximum : <unk> out of view , of course , the period when the earth itself was <unk> period of its mere organization .
again : <unk> know that there exist <unk> <unk> is to say , suns whose existence we determine through the movements of others , but whose <unk> is not sufficient to impress us .
are these suns invisible merely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet ?
and yet again : <unk> we <unk> least in certain <unk> for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected , by the hypothesis that , having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history , each of these suns , in whirling off a new secondary , has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interior ? <unk> the well-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the earth , i need of course , do nothing more than refer : <unk> comes in the strongest possible <unk> of all that i have said on the topic now at issue .
in speaking , not long ago , of the repulsive or electrical influence , i remarked that “the important phænomena of vitality , consciousness , and thought , whether we observe them generally or in detail , seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the <unk> [ 8 ] i mentioned , too , that i would recur to the suggestion : —and this is the proper point at which to do so .
looking at the matter , first , in detail , we perceive that not merely the manifestation of vitality , but its importance , consequence , and elevation of character , keep pace , very closely , with the <unk> , or complexity , of the animal structure .
looking at the question , now , in its generality , and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards <unk> , we find that <unk> , brought about directly through condensation , is proportional with it forever .
we thus reach the proposition that the importance of the development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds <unk> with the terrestrial condensation .
[ 8 ] <name> 36 .
now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the earth .
as it has proceeded in its condensation , superior and still superior races have appeared .
is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which have attended , at least , if not immediately caused , these successive elevations of <unk> <unk> it improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive <unk> discharges from the <unk> other words , by the successive variations in the solar influence on the earth ?
were this idea <unk> , we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of yet a new planet , interior to mercury , may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial <unk> modification from which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to man .
these thoughts impress me with all the force of <unk> i throw them out , of course , merely in their obvious character of suggestion .
the nebular theory of laplace has lately received far more confirmation than it needed , at the hands of the philosopher , <unk> .
these two have thus together <unk> , to be sure , that matter at any period actually existed as described , in a state of nebular diffusion , but that , admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system , and to have commenced a movement towards a <unk> must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now seen , in that system , to obtain .
a demonstration such as <unk> <unk> and mathematical demonstration , as far as demonstration can <unk> and <unk> , indeed , by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe , the professional <unk> mere madmen who deny the newtonian law of gravity on which the results of the french mathematicians are <unk> demonstration , i say , such as this , would to most intellects be <unk> i confess that it is so to <unk> the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends .
that the demonstration does not prove the hypothesis , according to the common understanding of the word <unk> , ” i admit , of course .
to show that certain existing <unk> certain established <unk> be , even mathematically , accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis , is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself .
in other words : <unk> show that , certain data being given , a certain existing result might , or even must , have ensued , <name> fail to prove that this result did ensue , from the data , until such time as it shall be also shown that there are , and can be , no other data from which the result in question might equally have ensued .
but , in the case now discussed , although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of <unk> <unk> , ” still there are many intellects , and those of the loftiest order , to which no proof could bring one <unk> of additional conviction .
without going into details which might <unk> upon the <unk> of metaphysics , i may as well here observe that the force of conviction , in cases such as this , <name> always , with the <unk> , be proportional to the amount of complexity intervening between the hypothesis and the result .
to be less abstract : —the greatness of the complexity found existing among <unk> conditions , by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these conditions at once , strengthens , also in the same proportion , our <name> in that hypothesis which does , in such manner , satisfactorily account for them : —and as no complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical conditions , so no conviction can be <unk> my mind at <unk> that with which i am impressed by an hypothesis that not only <unk> these conditions , with mathematical accuracy , and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole , but is , at the same time , the sole hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for them at all .
a most <unk> opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific <unk> opinion that the so-called nebular <unk> has been overthrown .
this fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made , among what hitherto have been termed the <unk> , ” through the large telescope of cincinnati , and the <unk> instrument of lord <unk> .
certain spots in the firmament which presented , even to the most powerful of the old telescopes , the appearance of <unk> , or haze , had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory of laplace .
they were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which i have been attempting to describe .
thus it was supposed that we <unk> <unk> <unk> evidence , by the way , which has always been found very <unk> the truth of the hypothesis ; and , although certain <unk> improvements , every now and then , enabled us to perceive that a spot , here and there , which we had been classing among the <unk> , was , in fact , but a cluster of stars <unk> its nebular character only from its immensity of <unk> it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual <unk> of numerous other masses , the <unk> of the <unk> , bidding defiance to every effort at segregation .
of these latter the most interesting was the great <unk> in the constellation orion : —but this , with innumerable other <unk> <unk> , ” when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes , has become resolved into a simple collection of stars .
now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the nebular hypothesis of laplace ; and , on announcement of the discoveries in question , the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent <unk> of the theory , dr. <name> , went so far as to <unk> the necessity of <unk> an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy book .
[ 9 ] [ 9 ] <unk> of the architecture of the <unk> a letter , <unk> to be from dr. <name> to a friend in <name> , went the rounds of our newspapers , about two years ago , i think , admitting “the <unk> to which i refer .
in a subsequent lecture , however , dr. n. appears in some manner to have gotten the better of the necessity , and does not quite renounce the theory , although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as “a purely hypothetical <unk> what else was the law of gravity before the <unk> experiments ?
and who questioned the law of gravity , even then ?
many of my readers <name> no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations has at least a strong tendency to overthrow the hypothesis ; while some of them , more thoughtful , <name> suggest that , although the theory is by no means <unk> through the segregation of the particular <unk> , ” alluded to , still a failure to <unk> them , with such telescopes , might well have been understood as a triumphant <unk> of the theory : —and this latter class <name> be surprised , perhaps , to hear me say that even with them i disagree .
if the propositions of this discourse have been comprehended , it <name> be seen that , in my view , a failure to <unk> the <unk> would have tended to the refutation , rather than to the confirmation , of the nebular hypothesis .
let me explain : —the newtonian law of gravity we may , of course , assume as demonstrated .
this law , it <name> be remembered , i have referred to the rëaction of the first divine <unk> the rëaction of an exercise of the divine volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty .
this difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the <unk> impelling that whose originality , and therefore whose rightful condition , was one , to take upon itself the <unk> condition of many .
it is only by conceiving this difficulty as temporarily overcome , that we can comprehend a rëaction .
there could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely continued .
so long as the act lasted , no rëaction , of course , could commence ; in other words , no gravitation could take <unk> we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other .
but gravitation has taken place ; therefore the act of creation has ceased : and gravitation has long ago taken place ; therefore the act of creation has long ago ceased .
we can no more expect , then , to observe the primary processes of creation ; and to these primary processes the condition of <unk> has already been explained to belong .
through what we know of the propagation of light , we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed , under the forms in which we now see them , for an inconceivable number of years .
so far back at least , then , as the period when these stars underwent condensation , must have been the epoch at which the <unk> processes began .
that we may conceive these processes , then , as still going on in the case of certain <unk> , ” while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end , we are forced into assumptions for which we have really no basis <unk> have to thrust in , again , upon the revolting reason , the blasphemous idea of special <unk> have to suppose that , in the particular instances of these <unk> , ” an unerring god found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary <unk> improvements of the general <unk> <unk> and <unk> , in a word , which had the effect of <unk> the completion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the <unk> during which all the other <unk> bodies had time , not only to be fully constituted , but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age .
of course , it <name> be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the <unk> now , must be merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago , the processes at present observed , or supposed to be observed , are , in fact , not processes now actually going on , but the phantoms of processes completed long in the <unk> as i maintain all these <unk> processes must have been .
to this i reply that neither is the <unk> condition of the condensed stars their actual condition , but a condition completed long in the past ; so that my argument drawn from the relative condition of the stars and the <unk> , ” is in no manner disturbed .
moreover , those who maintain the existence of <unk> , do not refer the <unk> to extreme distance ; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective <unk> .
that we may conceive , indeed , a nebular mass as visible at all , we must conceive it as very near us in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes .
in maintaining the appearances in question , then , to be really nebulous , we maintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view .
thus , their condition , as we see them now , must be referred to an epoch far less remote than that to which we may refer the <unk> condition of at least the majority of the <unk> a word , should astronomy ever demonstrate a <unk> , ” in the sense at present intended , i should consider the nebular <unk> , indeed , as corroborated by the <unk> as thereby irretrievably overthrown .
by way , however , of rendering unto cæsar no more than the things that are <unk> , let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result , seems to have been suggested to laplace in great measure by a <unk> the very <unk> of which we have just been <unk> the generally prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the <unk> , so <unk> .
these he supposed to be , in reality , what their designation implies .
the fact is , this great man had , very properly , an inferior <name> in his own merely <unk> powers .
in respect , therefore , to the actual existence of <unk> existence so confidently maintained by his <unk> <unk> depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard .
it <name> be seen that the only valid objections to his theory , are those made to its hypothesis as <unk> what suggested <unk> to what it suggests ; to its propositions rather than to its results .
his most unwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre , in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms , in unlimited succession , extended throughout the universal space .
i have already shown that , under such circumstances , there could have occurred no movement at all ; and laplace , consequently , assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended to establish .
his original idea seems to have been a compound of the true <unk> atoms with the false <unk> of his contemporaries ; and thus his theory presents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced , as a mathematical result , from a hybrid <unk> of ancient imagination <unk> with modern <unk> .
<unk> real strength lay , in fact , in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct : <unk> this he relied ; and in no instance did it fail or deceive him : —in the case of the nebular <unk> , it led him , blindfolded , through a labyrinth of error , into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of truth .
let us now fancy , for the moment , that the ring first thrown off by the <unk> is to say , the ring whose <unk> constituted <unk> not , in fact , break up until the <unk> of the ring out of which <unk> arose ; that this latter ring , again , remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang saturn ; that this latter , again , remained entire until the discharge of that from which originated <unk> so on .
let us imagine , in a word , that no dissolution occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to mercury .
we thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of <unk> concentric circles ; and looking as well at them as at the processes by which , according to <unk> hypothesis , they were constructed , we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original irradiation as i have described it .
is it impossible that , on measuring the forces , respectively , by which each successive <unk> circle was thrown <unk> is to say , on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which occasioned the successive <unk> should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed ?
is it improbable that we should discover these forces to have <unk> in the original <unk> to the squares of the distances ?  our solar system , consisting , in chief , of one sun , with sixteen planets certainly , and possibly a few more , revolving about it at various distances , and attended by seventeen moons assuredly , but very probably by several <unk> now to be considered as an example of the innumerable <unk> which proceeded to take place throughout the universal sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the divine volition .
i mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a generic instance of these <unk> , or , more correctly , of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived .
if we keep our attention fixed on the idea of the utmost possible relation as the omnipotent design , and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference of form , among the original atoms , and particular <unk> , we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient <unk> reached precisely the same result in the end .
we shall rather be inclined to think that no two <unk> bodies in the <unk> suns , planets or <unk> particularly , while all are generally , similar .
still less , then , can we imagine any two assemblages of such <unk> two <unk> having more than a general resemblance .
[ 10 ] our telescopes , at this point , thoroughly confirm our deductions .
taking our own solar system , then , as merely a loose or general type of all , we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the universe under the aspect of a spherical space , throughout which , dispersed with merely general equability , exist a number of but generally similar systems .
[ 10 ] it is not impossible that some unlooked-for optical improvement may disclose to us , among innumerable varieties of systems , a luminous sun , encircled by luminous and <unk> rings , within and without and between which , revolve luminous and <unk> planets , attended by moons having <unk> even these latter again having moons .
let us now , expanding our conceptions , look upon each of these systems as in itself an atom ; which in fact it is , when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the universe .
regarding all , then , as but colossal atoms , each with the same ineradicable tendency to unity which <unk> the actual atoms of which it <unk> enter at once upon a new order of <unk> .
the smaller systems , in the vicinity of a larger one , would , inevitably , be drawn into still closer vicinity .
a thousand would assemble here ; a million <unk> here , again , even a <unk> , thus , immeasurable vacancies in space .
and if now , it be demanded why , in the case of these <unk> these merely <unk> <unk> speak , simply , of an <unk> , ” and not , as in the case of the actual atoms , of a more or less consolidated <unk> : <unk> it be asked , for instance , why i do not <name> what i suggest to its legitimate conclusion , and describe , at once , these assemblages of <unk> as rushing to consolidation in <unk> each becoming condensed into one magnificent <unk> reply is that <unk> <unk> am but pausing , for a moment , on the awful threshold of the future .
for the present , calling these assemblages <unk> , ” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation .
their absolute consolidation is to come .
we have now reached a point from which we behold the universe as a spherical space , interspersed , <unk> , with clusters .
it <name> be noticed that i here prefer the <unk> <unk> to the phrase <unk> a merely general equability , ” employed before .
it is evident , in fact , that the equability of distribution <name> diminish in the ratio of the <unk> <unk> is to say , as the things distributed diminish in number .
thus the increase of <unk> increase which must continue until , sooner or later , an epoch <name> arrive at which the largest <unk> <name> absorb all the <unk> be viewed as , simply , a <unk> indication of the tendency to one .
and here , at length , it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained facts of astronomy confirm the general arrangement which i have thus , <unk> , assigned to the heavens .
thoroughly , they do .
<unk> observation , guided by the laws of perspective , enables us to understand that the perceptible universe exists as a cluster of clusters , irregularly disposed .
the <unk> of which this universal <unk> of <unk> consists , are merely what we have been in the practice of <unk> <unk> , of these <unk> , ” one is of paramount interest to mankind .
i allude to the galaxy , or milky way .
this interests us , first and most obviously , on account of its great superiority in apparent size , not only to any one other cluster in the firmament , but to all the other clusters taken together .
the largest of these latter occupies a mere point , comparatively , and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope .
the galaxy sweeps throughout the heaven and is brilliantly visible to the naked eye .
but it interests man chiefly , although less immediately , on account of its being his home ; the home of the earth on which he exists ; the home of the sun about which this earth revolves ; the home of that <unk> of orbs of which the sun is the centre and <unk> earth one of sixteen <unk> , or <unk> moon one of seventeen <unk> , or satellites .
the galaxy , let me repeat , is but one of the clusters which i have been <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> revealed to <unk> the telescope alone , <unk> faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky .
we have no reason to suppose the milky way really more extensive than the least of these <unk> its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to <unk> is to say , from our position in its midst .
however strange the assertion may at first appear to those <unk> in astronomy , still the astronomer himself has no hesitation in asserting that we are in the midst of that inconceivable host of <unk> <unk> <unk> constitute the galaxy .
moreover , not only have <unk> only has our sun a right to claim the galaxy as its own especial cluster , but , with slight reservation , it may be said that all the distinctly visible stars of the <unk> the stars visible to the naked <unk> equally a right to claim it as their own .
there has been a great deal of <unk> in respect to the shape of the galaxy ; which , in nearly all our astronomical treatises , is said to resemble that of a capital y .
the cluster in question has , in reality , a certain <unk> general resemblance to the planet saturn , with its <unk> triple ring .
instead of the solid orb of that planet , however , we must picture to ourselves a <unk> <unk> , or collection of stars ; our sun lying <unk> the shore of the <unk> that side of it which is nearest the constellation of the cross and farthest from that of <unk> .
the surrounding ring , where it approaches our position , has in it a longitudinal gash , which does , in fact , cause the ring , in our vicinity , to assume , loosely , the appearance of a capital y .
we must not fall into the error , however , of conceiving the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all remote , comparatively speaking , from the also indefinite <unk> cluster which it surrounds ; and thus , for mere purpose of explanation , we may speak of our sun as actually situated at that point of the y where its three component lines unite ; and , conceiving this letter to be of a certain <unk> a certain thickness , very trivial in comparison with its <unk> may even speak of our position as in the middle of this thickness .
<unk> ourselves thus placed , we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena <unk> are perspective altogether .
when we look upward or <unk> is to say , when we cast our eyes in the direction of the <unk> <unk> look through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction of its length , or along either of the three component lines .
of course , in the former case , the stars appear <unk> the latter , <unk> reverse this explanation : <unk> inhabitant of the earth , when looking , as we commonly express ourselves , at the galaxy , is then beholding it in some of the directions of its <unk> looking along the lines of the <unk> when , looking out into the general heaven , he turns his eyes from the galaxy , he is then surveying it in the direction of the <unk> thickness ; and on this account the stars seem to him scattered ; while , in fact , they are as close together , on an average , as in the mass of the cluster .
no consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this <unk> stupendous extent .
if , with a telescope of high <unk> power , we carefully inspect the firmament , we shall become aware of a belt of <unk> what we have hitherto called <unk> band , of varying breadth , stretching from horizon to horizon , at right angles to the general course of the milky way .
this band is the ultimate cluster of clusters .
this belt is the universe .
our galaxy is but one , and perhaps one of the most inconsiderable , of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate , universal belt or band .
the appearance of this cluster of clusters , to our eyes , as a belt or band , is altogether a perspective <unk> of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and <unk> cluster , the galaxy , under guise also of a belt , traversing the heavens at right angles to the universal one .
the shape of the <unk> cluster is , of course generally , that of each individual cluster which it includes .
just as the scattered stars which , on looking from the galaxy , we see in the general sky , are , in fact , but a portion of that galaxy itself , and as closely intermingled with it as any of the <unk> points in what seems the <unk> portion of its <unk> are the scattered <unk> which , on casting our eyes from the universal belt , we perceive at all points of the <unk> , i say , are these scattered <unk> to be understood as only <unk> scattered , and as part and parcel of the one supreme and universal sphere .
no astronomical fallacy is more untenable , and none has been more pertinaciously adhered to , than that of the absolute <unk> of the universe of stars .
the reasons for limitation , as i have already assigned them , à priori , seem to me unanswerable ; but , not to speak of these , observation assures us that there is , in numerous directions around us , certainly , if not in all , a positive <unk> , at the very least , affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise .
were the succession of stars endless , then the background of the sky would present us an uniform <unk> , like that displayed by the <unk> there could be absolutely no point , in all that background , at which would not exist a <unk> the only mode , therefore , in which , under such a state of affairs , we could comprehend the <unk> which our telescopes find in innumerable directions , would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no <name> from it has yet been able to reach us at all .
that this may be so , who shall venture to deny ?
i maintain , simply , that we have not even the shadow of a reason for believing that it is so .
when speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the earth as tending merely to the <unk> centre , i observed that , <unk> certain exceptions to be specified hereafter , every body on the earth tended not only to the <unk> centre , but in every conceivable direction <unk> [ 11 ] the <unk> refer to those frequent gaps in the heavens , where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no <unk> bodies , but no indications of their existence : <unk> yawning chasms , blacker than <unk> , seem to afford us glimpses , through the boundary walls of the universe of stars , into the illimitable universe of vacancy , beyond .
now as any body , existing on the earth , chances to pass , either through its own movement or the <unk> , into a line with any one of these <unk> , or <unk> abysses , it clearly is no longer attracted in the direction of that void , and for the moment , consequently , is <unk> than at any period , either after or before .
independently of the consideration of these <unk> , however , and looking only at the generally <unk> distribution of the stars , we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the earth to the <unk> centre , is in a state of perpetual variation .
[ 11 ] <name> 62 .
we comprehend , then , the insulation of our universe .
we perceive the isolation of <unk> all that which we grasp with the senses .
we know that there exists one cluster of <unk> collection around which , on all sides , extend the immeasurable <unk> of a space to all human perception <unk> .
but because upon the confines of this universe of stars we are compelled to pause , through want of farther evidence from the senses , is it right to conclude that , in fact , there is no material point beyond that which we have thus been permitted to attain ?
have we , or have we not , an analogical right to the inference that this perceptible <unk> this cluster of <unk> but one of a series of clusters of clusters , the rest of which are invisible through <unk> the diffusion of their light being so excessive , ere it reaches us , as not to produce upon our <unk> a <unk> from there being no such <unk> as light at all , in these unspeakably distant <unk> , lastly , from the mere interval being so vast , that the electric tidings of their presence in space , have not <unk> the <unk> myriads of <unk> enabled to traverse that interval ?
have we any right to <unk> we any ground whatever for visions such as these ?
if we have a right to them in any degree , we have a right to their infinite extension .
the human <name> has obviously a leaning to the <unk> , ” and <unk> the phantom of the idea .
it seems to long with a passionate fervor for this impossible <name> , with the <name> of intellectually believing it when conceived .
what is general among the whole race of man , of course no individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal ; nevertheless , there may be a class of superior <unk> , to whom the human bias alluded to may wear all the character of <unk> .
my question , however , remains <unk> : <unk> we any right to <unk> us say , rather , to <unk> interminable succession of the <unk> of clusters , ” or of <unk> more or less similar ?
i reply that the <unk> , ” in a case such as this , depends absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the right .
let me declare , only , that , as an individual , i myself feel impelled to the <unk> daring to call it <unk> there does exist a limitless succession of <unk> , more or less similar to that of which we have <unk> that of which alone we shall ever have <unk> the very least until the return of our own particular universe into unity .
if such clusters of clusters exist , <unk> they <unk> is abundantly clear that , having had no part in our origin , they have no portion in our laws .
they neither attract us , nor we them .
their <unk> spirit is not <unk> not that which obtains in any part of our universe .
they could not impress our senses or our souls .
among them and <unk> all , for the moment , <unk> are no influences in common .
each exists , apart and independently , in the bosom of its proper and particular god .
in the conduct of this discourse , i am aiming less at physical than at metaphysical order .
the clearness with which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding , depends very little , i have long since learned to perceive , upon a merely natural , and almost altogether upon a moral , arrangement .
if then i seem to step somewhat too <unk> from point to point of my topic , let me suggest that i do so in the <name> of thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of graduated impression by which alone the intellect of man can expect to <unk> the grandeurs of which i speak , and , in their majestic <unk> , to comprehend them .
so far , our attention has been directed , almost exclusively , to a general and relative grouping of the <unk> bodies in space .
of <unk> there has been little ; and whatever ideas of quantity have been <unk> is to say , of number , magnitude , and <unk> been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more <unk> conceptions .
these latter let us now attempt to entertain .
our solar system , as has been already mentioned , consists , in chief , of one sun and sixteen planets certainly , but in all probability a few others , revolving around it as a centre , and attended by seventeen moons of which we know , with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing .
these various bodies are not true spheres , but <unk> <unk> flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they <unk> : —the <unk> being a consequence of the rotation .
neither is the sun absolutely the centre of the system ; for this sun itself , with all the planets , revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space , which is the <unk> general centre of gravity .
neither are we to consider the paths through which these different <unk> <unk> moons about the planets , the planets about the sun , or the sun about the common <unk> circles in an accurate sense .
they are , in fact , <unk> of the <unk> being the point about which the revolution is made .
an ellipse is a curve , returning into itself , one of whose diameters is longer than the other .
in the longer diameter are two points , equidistant from the middle of the line , and so situated otherwise that if , from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve , the two lines , taken together , <name> be equal to the longer diameter itself .
now let us conceive such an ellipse .
at one of the points mentioned , which are the <unk> , let us fasten an orange .
by an elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea ; and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse .
let us now move the pea continuously around the <unk> always on the circumference of the ellipse .
the elastic thread , which , of course , varies in length as we move the pea , <name> form what in geometry is called a radius <unk> .
now , if the orange be understood as the sun , and the pea as a planet revolving about it , then the revolution should be made at such a <unk> a velocity so <unk> the radius <unk> may pass over equal areas of space in equal times .
the progress of the pea should <unk> other words , the progress of the planet is , of course , <unk> in proportion to its distance from the <unk> in proportion to its proximity .
those planets , moreover , move the more slowly which are the farther from the sun ; the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other , as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the sun .
the wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described , however , are not to be understood as obtaining in our system alone .
they everywhere prevail where attraction prevails .
they control the universe .
every shining speck in the firmament is , no doubt , a luminous sun , resembling our own , at least in its general features , and having in attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets , greater or less , whose still lingering <unk> is not sufficient to render them visible to us at so vast a distance , but which , nevertheless , revolve , <unk> , about their starry centres , in obedience to the principles just <unk> obedience to the three <unk> laws of <unk> three immortal laws guessed by the imaginative kepler , and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and mathematical <name> .
among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon matter-of-fact , it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation under the comprehensive <unk> , <unk> the point to be considered is , who guesses .
in guessing with plato , we spend our time to better purpose , now and then , than in <unk> to a demonstration by <unk> .
in many works on astronomy i find it distinctly stated that the laws of kepler are the basis of the great principle , gravitation .
this idea must have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by kepler , and his proving them à <unk> to have an actual existence , led <name> to account for them by the hypothesis of gravitation , and , finally , to demonstrate them à priori , as necessary consequences of the hypothetical principle .
thus so far from the laws of kepler being the basis of gravity , gravity is the basis of these <unk> it is , indeed , of all the laws of the material universe which are not referable to repulsion alone .
the mean distance of the earth from the <unk> is to say , from the heavenly body in our closest <unk> <unk> miles .
mercury , the planet nearest the sun , is distant from him 37 millions of miles .
<name> , the next , revolves at a distance of 68 millions : —the earth , which comes next , at a distance of 95 millions : <unk> , then , at a distance of 144 millions .
now come the eight <unk> ( ceres , <unk> , <name> , pallas , <unk> , <name> , <name> , and <unk> ) at an average distance of about 250 millions .
then we have jupiter , distant <unk> millions ; then saturn , 900 millions ; then <unk> , 19 hundred millions ; finally neptune , lately discovered , and revolving at a distance , say of 28 hundred millions .
leaving neptune out of the <unk> which as yet we know little accurately and which is , possibly , one of a system of <unk> <name> be seen that , within certain limits , there exists an order of interval among the planets .
speaking loosely , we may say that each outer planet is twice as far from the sun as is the next inner one .
may not the order here <unk> not the law of <unk> deduced from consideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation ?
the <name> hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance , it is folly to attempt comprehending , unless in the light of abstract arithmetical facts .
they are not practically tangible ones .
they convey no precise ideas .
i have stated that neptune , the planet farthest from the sun , revolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of miles .
so far good : <unk> have stated a mathematical fact ; and , without comprehending it in the least , we may put it to <unk> .
but in mentioning , even , that the moon revolves about the earth at the comparatively trifling distance of <unk> miles , i entertained no expectation of giving any one to <unk> <unk> <unk> far from the earth the moon actually is .
<unk> miles !
there are , perhaps , few of my readers who have not crossed the atlantic ocean ; yet how many of them have a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening between shore and shore ?
i doubt , indeed , whether the man lives who can force into his <name> the most remote <name> of the interval between one <unk> and its next neighbor upon the turnpike .
we are in some measure aided , however , in our consideration of distance , by combining this consideration with the kindred one of velocity .
sound passes through <unk> feet of space in a second of time .
now were it possible for an inhabitant of the earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the moon , and to hear the report , he would have to wait , after perceiving the former , more than 13 entire days and nights before getting any intimation of the latter .
however feeble be the impression , even thus conveyed , of the <unk> real distance from the earth , it <name> , nevertheless , effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our sun and neptune ; or even that of the 95 millions between the sun and the earth we inhabit .
a cannon-ball , flying at the greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been known to fly , could not traverse the latter interval in less than 20 years ; while for the former it would require <unk> .
our <unk> real diameter is <unk> miles ; yet she is comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly 50 such orbs to compose one as great as the earth .
the diameter of our own globe is <unk> <unk> from the enunciation of these <name> what positive idea do we derive ?
if we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit , we behold a landscape stretching , say 40 miles , in every direction ; forming a circle 250 miles in circumference ; and including an area of <unk> square miles .
the extent of such a prospect , on account of the <unk> with which its portions necessarily present themselves to view , can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated : <unk> the entire panorama would comprehend no more than one <unk> part of the mere surface of our globe .
were this panorama , then , to be succeeded , after the lapse of an hour , by another of equal extent ; this again by a third , after the lapse of another hour ; this again by a fourth after lapse of another <unk> so on , until the scenery of the whole earth were exhausted ; and were we to be engaged in examining these various <unk> for twelve hours of every day ; we should nevertheless , be 9 years and 48 days in completing the general survey .
but if the mere surface of the earth <unk> the grasp of the imagination , what are we to think of its cubical contents ?
it embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 <unk> , 200 <unk> of tons .
let us suppose it in a state of quiescence ; and now let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion !
not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the <unk> worlds of our <unk> the combined physical strength of all these <unk> admitting all to be more powerful than <unk> avail to stir the ponderous mass a single inch from its position .
what are we to understand , then , of the force , which under similar circumstances , would be required to move the largest of our planets , jupiter ?
this is <unk> miles in diameter , and would include within its <unk> more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own .
yet this stupendous body is actually flying around the sun at the rate of <unk> miles an <unk> is to say , with a velocity 40 times greater than that of a cannon-ball !
the thought of such a <unk> can not well be said to startle the mind : <unk> <unk> and <unk> it .
not unfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an <name> .
let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles from <unk> close <unk> of this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution .
now can we , i demand , fashion for ourselves any <name> so distinct of this ideal <unk> spiritual exaltation , as that involved in the supposition that , even by this immeasurable mass of matter , whirled immediately before his eyes , with a velocity so unutterable , <unk> <unk> though he <unk> not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed ?
at this point , however , it seems proper to suggest that , in fact , we have been speaking of comparative trifles .
our sun , the central and controlling orb of the system to which jupiter belongs , is not only greater than jupiter , but greater by far than all the planets of the system taken together .
this fact is an essential condition , indeed , of the stability of the system itself .
the diameter of jupiter has been mentioned : <unk> is <unk> miles : —that of the sun is <unk> miles .
an inhabitant of the latter , travelling 90 miles a day , would be more than 80 years in going round a great circle of its circumference .
it occupies a cubical space of 681 <unk> , 472 <unk> of miles .
the moon , as has been stated , revolves about the earth at a distance of <unk> <unk> an orbit , consequently , of nearly a million and a half .
now , were the sun placed upon the earth , centre over centre , the body of the former would extend , in every direction , not only to the line of the <unk> orbit , but beyond it , a distance of <unk> miles .
and here , once again , let me suggest that , in fact , we have still been speaking of comparative trifles .
the distance of the planet neptune from the sun has been stated : <unk> is 28 hundred millions of miles ; the circumference of its orbit , therefore , is about 17 billions .
let this be borne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars .
between this and the <name> of our system , ( the sun , ) there is a gulf of space , to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an archangel .
from our system , then , and from our sun , or <name> , the <name> at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apart : <unk> , for the moment , let us imagine it placed upon our sun , centre over centre , as we just now imagined this sun itself placed upon the earth .
let us now conceive the particular <name> we have in mind , extending , in every direction , beyond the orbit of <unk> <unk> the earth : <unk> on , beyond the orbit of <unk> <unk> <unk> , finally , we fancy it filling the <unk> billions of miles in <unk> is described by the revolution of <unk> planet .
when we have conceived all this , we shall have entertained no extravagant <name> .
there is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we have imagined .
i mean to say that we have the very best <unk> basis for such belief : —and , in looking back at the original , atomic arrangements for diversity , which have been assumed as a part of the divine plan in the constitution of the universe , we shall be enabled easily to understand , and to credit , the existence of even far vaster <unk> in <unk> size than any to which i have hitherto alluded .
the largest orbs , of course , we must expect to find rolling through the widest vacancies of space .
i remarked , just now , that to convey an idea of the interval between our sun and any one of the other stars , we should require the eloquence of an archangel .
in so saying , i should not be accused of exaggeration ; for , in simple truth , these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to exaggerate .
but let us bring the matter more distinctly before the eye of the mind .
in the first place , we may get a general , relative <name> of the interval referred to , by comparing it with the <unk> spaces .
if , for example , we suppose the earth , which is , in reality , 95 millions of miles from the sun , to be only one foot from that <unk> ; then neptune would be 40 feet distant ; and the <name> <name> <unk> , at the very least , 159 .
now i presume that , in the termination of my last sentence , few of my readers have noticed anything especially <unk> wrong .
i said that the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot , the distance of neptune would be 40 feet , and that of <name> <unk> , 159 .
the proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared , perhaps , to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two <unk> of the earth from the sun and that of <name> <unk> from the same <unk> .
but my account of the matter should , in reality , have run thus : —the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot , the distance of neptune would be 40 feet , and that of <name> <unk> , <unk> : —that is to say , i had assigned to <name> <unk> , in my first statement of the case , only the <unk> part of that distance which is the least distance possible at which it can actually lie .
to proceed : <unk> distant a mere planet is , yet when we look at it through a telescope , we see it under a certain <unk> a certain appreciable size .
now i have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars ; nevertheless , when we view any one of them , even through the most powerful telescope , it is found to present us with no form , and consequently with no magnitude whatever .
we see it as a point and nothing more .
again ; <unk> us suppose ourselves walking , at night , on a highway .
in a field on one side of the road , is a line of tall objects , say trees , the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky .
this line of objects extends at right angles to the road , and from the road to the horizon .
now , as we proceed along the road , we see these objects changing their positions , respectively , in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view .
let us suppose this fixed <unk> fixed for our <unk> be the rising moon .
we become aware , at once , that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon , as to seem flying behind us , the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite .
we then go on to perceive that the farther the objects are from us , the less they alter their positions ; and the converse .
then we begin , unwittingly , to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration .
finally , we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line , by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem .
now this relative alteration is what we call <unk> ; ” and by <unk> we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies .
applying the principle to the trees in question , we should , of course , be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of that tree , which , however far we proceeded along the road , should evince no <unk> at all .
this , in the case described , is a thing impossible ; but impossible only because all distances on our earth are trivial indeed : —in comparison with the vast <unk> quantities , we may speak of them as absolutely nothing .
now , let us suppose the <name> <name> <unk> directly overhead ; and let us imagine that , instead of standing on the earth , we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through space to a distance equalling the diameter of the <unk> <unk> is to say , to a distance of 190 millions of miles .
having observed , by means of the most delicate <unk> instruments , the exact position of the <name> , let us now pass along this inconceivable road , until we reach its other extremity .
now , once again , let us look at the <name> .
it is precisely where we left it .
our instruments , however delicate , assure us that its relative position is <unk> identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey .
no <unk> <unk> been found .
the fact is , that , in regard to the distance of the fixed <unk> any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it <unk> science , until very lately , could speak only with a negative certainty .
assuming the brightest as the nearest , we could say , even of them , only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the hither side of which they can not be : <unk> far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain .
we perceived , for example , that <name> <unk> can not be nearer to us than 19 <unk> , 200 billions of miles ; but , for all we knew , and indeed for all we now know , it may be distant from us the square , or the cube , or any other power of the number mentioned .
by dint , however , of wonderfully minute and cautious observations , continued , with novel instruments , for many laborious years , <unk> , not long ago deceased , has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars ; among others , that of the <name> numbered 61 in the constellation of the swan .
the distance in this latter instance ascertained , is <unk> times that of the sun ; which last it <name> be remembered , is 95 millions of miles .
the <name> 61 <unk> , then , is nearly 64 <unk> of miles from <unk> more than three times the distance assigned , as the least possible , for <name> <unk> .
in attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of velocity , as we did in endeavoring to estimate the distance of the moon , we must leave out of sight , altogether , such <unk> as the speed of a cannon-ball , or of sound .
light , however , according to the latest calculations of <unk> , proceeds at the rate of <unk> miles in a second .
thought itself can not pass through this interval more <unk> , indeed , thought can traverse it at all .
yet , in coming from 61 <unk> to us , even at this inconceivable rate , light occupies more than ten years ; and , consequently , were the <name> this moment blotted out from the universe , still , for ten years , would it continue to <name> on , <unk> in its paradoxical <name> .
keeping now in mind whatever feeble <name> we may have attained of the interval between our sun and 61 <unk> , let us remember that this interval , however <unk> vast , we are permitted to consider as but the average interval among the countless host of stars composing that cluster , or <unk> , ” to which our system , as well as that of 61 <unk> , belongs .
i have , in fact , stated the case with great moderation : <unk> have excellent reason for believing 61 <unk> to be one of the nearest stars , and thus for concluding , at least for the present , that its distance from us is less than the average distance between <name> and <name> in the magnificent cluster of the milky way .
and here , once again and finally , it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles .
ceasing to wonder at the space between <name> and <name> in our own or in any particular cluster , let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster , in the all comprehensive cluster of the universe .
i have already said that light proceeds at the rate of <unk> miles in a <unk> is , about 10 millions of miles in a minute , or about 600 millions of miles in an hour : <unk> so far removed from us are some of the <unk> that even light , speeding with this velocity , could not and does not reach us , from those mysterious regions , in less than 3 millions of years .
this calculation , moreover , is made by the elder <unk> , and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope .
there are <unk> , ” however , which , through the magical tube of lord <unk> , are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of a million of ages <unk> .
in a word , the events which we behold <unk> this <unk> those <unk> the identical events which interested their inhabitants ten hundred thousand centuries ago .
in <unk> distances such as this suggestion forces upon the <unk> than upon the <unk> find , at length , a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of quantity .
our fancies thus occupied with the <unk> distances , let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often experienced , while pursuing the beaten path of astronomical reflection , in accounting for the immeasurable <unk> alluded <unk> comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless , have been made to intervene between <name> and <unk> cluster and <unk> understanding , to be brief , a sufficient reason for the <unk> scale , in respect of mere space , on which the universe is seen to be constructed .
a rational cause for the <unk> , i maintain that astronomy has palpably failed to assign : —but the considerations through which , in this essay , we have proceeded step by step , enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that space and duration are one .
that the universe might endure throughout an <unk> at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes , it was necessary that the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite .
it was required , in a word , that the stars should be gathered into <unk> from invisible <unk> from <unk> to <unk> so grow grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of <unk> development : <unk> was required that the stars should do all <unk> have time thoroughly to accomplish all these divine <unk> the period in which all things were effecting their return into unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the inevitable end .
throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the divine adaptation .
the density of the stars , respectively , proceeds , of course , as their condensation diminishes ; condensation and <unk> keep pace with each other ; through the latter , which is the index of the former , we estimate the <unk> and spiritual development .
thus , in the density of the globes , we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled .
as density <unk> the divine intentions are <unk> less and still less remains to be <unk> the same <unk> we expect to find an <unk> of the end : —and thus the philosophical mind <name> easily comprehend that the divine designs in constituting the stars , advance mathematically to their fulfilment : —and more ; it <name> readily give the advance a mathematical expression ; it <name> decide that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the <unk> and goal of their creation .
not only is this divine adaptation , however , mathematically accurate , but there is that about it which stamps it as divine , in distinction from that which is merely the work of human <unk> .
i allude to the complete <unk> of adaptation .
for example ; in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect ; a particular intention brings to pass a particular object ; but this is all ; we see no <unk> .
the effect does not <unk> upon the cause ; the intention does not change relations with the object .
in divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard <unk> we may take at any time a cause for an effect , or the <unk> that we can never absolutely decide which is which .
to give an instance : —in polar climates the human frame , to maintain its animal heat , requires , for combustion in the capillary system , an abundant supply of highly <unk> food , such as <unk> .
but again : —in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales .
now , whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded , or the only thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained ?
it is impossible to decide .
there is an absolute <unk> of adaptation .
the pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of the approach to this species of <unk> .
in the construction of plot , for example , in fictitious literature , we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine , of any one of them , whether it depends from any one other or <unk> it .
in this sense , of course , perfection of plot is really , or practically , <unk> only because it is a finite intelligence that <unk> .
the plots of god are perfect .
the universe is a plot of god .
and now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced , again , to struggle against its propensity for analogical <unk> its <unk> grasping at the infinite .
moons have been seen revolving about planets ; planets about stars ; and the poetical instinct of <unk> instinct of the symmetrical , if the symmetry be but a symmetry of surface : <unk> instinct , which the soul , not only of man but of all created beings , took up , in the beginning , from the geometrical basis of the universal <unk> us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of cycles .
closing our eyes equally to <unk> and <unk> , we insist upon imagining a revolution of all the orbs of the galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole .
each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined , of course , to be similarly supplied and constructed ; while , that the <unk> may be wanting at no point , we go on to conceive these clusters themselves , again , as revolving about some still more <name> sphere ; <unk> latter , still again , with its encircling clusters , as but one of a yet more magnificent series of <unk> , <unk> about yet another orb central to <unk> orb still more unspeakably <unk> orb , let us rather say , of infinite sublimity <unk> multiplied by the infinitely sublime .
such are the conditions , continued in perpetuity , which the voice of what some people term <unk> calls upon the fancy to <unk> and the reason to contemplate , if possible , without becoming dissatisfied with the picture .
such , in general , are the interminable <unk> beyond <unk> which we have been instructed by philosophy to comprehend and to account for , at least in the best manner we can .
now and then , however , a philosopher <unk> whose <unk> takes a very determinate <unk> genius , to speak more <unk> , has a <unk> <unk> bias , doing every thing up by the <unk> us to see precisely that point out of sight , at which the revolutionary processes in question do , and of right ought to , come to an end .
it is hardly worth while , perhaps , even to sneer at the reveries of <unk> : —but much has been said , latterly , of the hypothesis of <unk> there exists , in the centre of the galaxy , a stupendous globe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve .
the period of our own , indeed , has been <unk> millions of years .
that our sun has a motion in space , independently of its rotation , and revolution about the <unk> centre of gravity , has long been suspected .
this motion , granting it to exist , would be manifested <unk> .
the stars in that <unk> region which we were leaving behind us , would , in a very long series of years , become crowded ; those in the opposite quarter , scattered .
now , by means of astronomical history , we ascertain , <unk> , that some such phænomena have occurred .
on this ground it has been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the <name> <unk> <unk> : —but this inference is , perhaps , the maximum to which we have any logical right .
<unk> , however , has gone so far as to designate a particular <name> , <unk> in the <unk> , as being at or about the very spot around which a general revolution is performed .
now , since by <unk> we are led , in the first instance , to these dreams , it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy , at least in some measure , during their development ; and that analogy which suggests the revolution , suggests at the same time a central orb about which it should be performed : <unk> far the astronomer was consistent .
this central orb , however , should , <unk> , be greater than all the orbs , taken together , which surround it .
of these there are about 100 millions .
“why , then , ” it was of course demanded , “do we not see this vast central <unk> least equal in mass to 100 millions of such suns as <unk> do we not see <unk> , especially , who occupy the mid region of the <unk> very locality near which , at all events , must be situated this incomparable <name> ? ” the reply was <unk> must be <unk> , as are our <unk> here , then , to suit a purpose , analogy is suddenly let fall .
“not so , ” it may be <unk> know that <unk> suns actually <unk> it is true that we have reason at least for supposing so ; but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the <unk> suns in question are encircled by luminous suns , while these again are surrounded by <unk> planets : —and it is precisely all this with which <unk> is called upon to find any thing analogous in the <unk> it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the galaxy .
admitting the thing to be so , we can not help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the why it is so must prove to all à priori philosophers .
but granting , in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else , the <unk> of the vast central orb , we may still inquire how this orb , so enormous , could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it .
upon the urging of this question , the idea of an actually solid central sun appears , in some measure , to have been abandoned ; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all .
here again then , to suit a purpose , analogy is let fall .
the planets of our system revolve , it is true , about a common centre of gravity ; but they do this in connexion with , and in consequence of , a material sun whose mass more than <unk> the rest of the system .
the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines .
but this idea of the <unk> idea which , in view of all ordinary geometry , is merely the mathematical , as <unk> from the practical , <unk> , in sober fact , the practical <name> which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we have to deal , at least in fancy , when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy .
let the most vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable !
it would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself , travelling forever upon the circumference of this unutterable circle , would still , forever , be travelling in a straight line .
that the path of our sun in such an orbit would , to any human perception , deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line , even in a million of years , is a proposition not to be entertained : <unk> we are required to believe that a curvature has become apparent during the brief period of our astronomical <unk> a mere <unk> the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years .
it may be said that <unk> has really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our <unk> now well-established progress through space .
admitting , if necessary , this fact to be in reality such , i maintain that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this <unk> fact of a curvature .
for its thorough determination , ages <name> be required ; and , when determined , it <name> be found indicative of some <unk> or other multiple relation between our sun and some one or more of the proximate stars .
i hazard nothing however , in <unk> , that , after the lapse of many centuries , all efforts at determining the path of our sun through space , <name> be abandoned as fruitless .
this is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of <unk> it must experience , from its <unk> relations with other orbs , in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the galaxy .
but in examining other <unk> than that of the milky <unk> surveying , generally , the clusters which overspread the <unk> we or do we not find confirmation of <unk> hypothesis ?
we do not .
the forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed ; but on close inspection , through powerful telescopes , we recognize the sphere , very distinctly , as at least the proximate form of all : <unk> constitution , in general , being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre .
“it is difficult , ” says sir <name> <unk> , “to form any <name> of the <unk> state of such systems .
on one hand , without a <unk> motion and a centrifugal force , it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive collapse .
on the other , granting such a motion and such a force , we find it no less difficult to reconcile their forms with the rotation of the whole system [ meaning cluster ] around any single axis , without which internal collision would appear to be <unk> some remarks lately made about the <unk> by dr. <name> , in taking quite a different view of the <unk> conditions from any taken in this <unk> a very peculiar <unk> to the point now at issue .
he says : “when our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them , we find that those which were thought to be irregular , are not so ; they approach nearer to a globe .
here is one that looked oval ; but lord <unk> telescope brought it into a circle ... . now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping circular masses of <unk> .
we find they are not entirely circular , but the reverse ; and that all around them , on every side , there are volumes of stars , stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great <unk> [ 12 ] [ 12 ] i must be understood as denying , especially , only the revolutionary portion of <unk> hypothesis .
of course , if no great central orb exists now in our cluster , such <name> exist hereafter .
whenever existing , it <name> be merely the nucleus of the consolidation .
were i to describe , in my own words , what must necessarily be the existing condition of each <unk> on the hypothesis that all matter is , as i suggest , now returning to its original unity , i should simply be going over , nearly verbatim , the language here employed by dr. <name> , without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular phænomena .
and here let me fortify my position still farther , by the voice of a greater than <unk> one , moreover , to whom all the data of <unk> have long been familiar things , carefully and thoroughly considered .
referring to the elaborate calculations of <unk> very researches which form <unk> <unk> , whose <unk> powers have never , perhaps been equalled , has the following observation : “when we regard the real , proper , or <unk> motions of the stars , we find many groups of them moving in opposite directions ; and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary , at least , to conceive that the systems composing the milky way , or the clusters , generally , composing the universe , are revolving about any particular centre unknown , whether luminous or <unk> .
it is but man’s longing for a fundamental first cause , that impels both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an <unk> [ 13 ] [ 13 ] <unk> man die nicht <unk> <unk> <unk> der <unk> , so <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> ; und die <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> es <unk> <unk> nicht <unk> , <unk> , dass <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> oder <unk> der <unk> <unk> , <unk> den <unk> <unk> , sich um <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> oder <unk> <unk> <unk> .
das <unk> nach den <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk> des <unk> , wie seine <unk> , zu <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> here alluded <unk> of <unk> groups moving in opposite <unk> quite inexplicable by <unk> idea ; but arises , as a necessary consequence , from that which forms the basis of this discourse .
while the merely general direction of each <unk> each moon , planet , <name> , or <unk> , on my hypothesis , be , of course , absolutely <unk> ; while the general path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all ; it is clear , nevertheless , that this general <unk> would be compounded of what , with scarcely any exaggeration , we may term an infinity of particular <unk> infinity of local deviations from <unk> result of continuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous masses , as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the end .
i quoted , just now , from sir <name> <unk> , the following words , used in reference to the clusters : <unk> one hand , without a <unk> motion and a centrifugal force , it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive <unk> the fact is , that , in surveying the <unk> with a telescope of high power , we shall find it quite impossible , having once conceived this idea of <unk> , ” not to gather , at all points , <unk> of the idea .
a nucleus is always apparent , in the direction of which the stars seem to be <unk> themselves ; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena : —the clusters are really denser near the <unk> in the regions more remote from it .
in a word , we see every thing as we should see it were a collapse taking place ; but , in general , it may be said of these clusters , that we can fairly entertain , while looking at them , the idea of <unk> movement about a centre , only by admitting the possible existence , in the distant domains of space , of <unk> laws with which we are unacquainted .
on the part of <unk> , however , there is evidently a reluctance to regard the <unk> as in “a state of progressive <unk> but if <unk> even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this state , why , it may well be demanded , is he disinclined to admit it ?
simply on account of a prejudice ; <unk> because the supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the eternal stability of the universe .
if the propositions of this discourse are <unk> , the <unk> of progressive <unk> is precisely that state in which alone we are warranted in considering all things ; and , with due humility , let me here confess that , for my part , i am at a loss to conceive how any other understanding of the existing condition of affairs , could ever have made its way into the human <name> .
“the tendency to <unk> and “the attraction of <unk> are <unk> phrases .
in using either , we speak of the rëaction of the first act .
never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing matter imbued with an ineradicable quality forming part of its material <unk> quality , or instinct , forever inseparable from it , and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is perpetually impelled to seek its <unk> .
never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this <unk> idea .
going boldly behind the vulgar thought , we have to conceive , <unk> , that the <unk> principle <unk> to matter <unk> while <unk> while existing as many instead of as <unk> to it by virtue of its state of irradiation <unk> , in a word , altogether to its condition , and not in the <unk> degree to itself .
in this view , when the irradiation shall have returned into its <unk> the rëaction shall be <unk> <unk> principle <name> no longer exist .
and , in fact , astronomers , without at any time reaching the idea here suggested , seem to have been <unk> it , in the assertion that “if there were but one body in the universe , it would be impossible to understand how the principle , gravity , could obtain : <unk> is to say , from a consideration of matter as they find it , they reach a conclusion at which i <unk> arrive .
that so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long <unk> , is , nevertheless , a mystery which i find it difficult to fathom .
it is , perhaps , in no little degree , however , our propensity for the <unk> the <unk> the present case more particularly for the <unk> has been leading us astray .
and , in fact , the sense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with an almost blindfold reliance .
it is the poetical essence of the <unk> the universe which , in the <unk> of its symmetry , is but the most sublime of poems .
now symmetry and consistency are <unk> terms : <unk> poetry and truth are one .
a thing is consistent in the ratio of its <unk> in the ratio of its consistency .
a perfect consistency , i repeat , can be nothing but an absolute <unk> we may take it for granted , then , that man can not long or widely err , if he suffer himself to be guided by his poetical , which i have maintained to be his truthful , in being his symmetrical , instinct .
he must have a care , however , lest , in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry of forms and motions , he leave out of sight the really essential symmetry of the principles which determine and control them .
that the <unk> bodies would finally be merged in <unk> , at last , all would be drawn into the substance of one stupendous central orb already <unk> an idea which , for some time past , seems , vaguely and <unk> , to have held possession of the fancy of mankind .
it is an idea , in fact , which belongs to the class of the excessively obvious .
it springs , instantly , from a superficial observation of the <unk> and seemingly <unk> , or <unk> movements of those individual portions of the universe which come most immediately and most closely under our observation .
there is not , perhaps , a human being , of ordinary education and of average reflective capacity , to whom , at some period , the fancy in question has not occurred , as if spontaneously , or <unk> , and wearing all the character of a very profound and very original <name> .
this <name> , however , so commonly entertained , has never , within my knowledge , arisen out of any abstract considerations .
being , on the contrary , always suggested , as i say , by the <unk> movements about centres , a reason for it , also , <unk> cause for the <unk> of all the orbs into one , imagined to be already existing , was naturally sought in the same <unk> these <unk> movements themselves .
thus it happened that , on announcement of the gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of <unk> comet , at every successive revolution about our sun , astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was <unk> a principle was discovered sufficient to account , physically , for that final , universal <unk> which , i repeat , the analogical , symmetrical or poetical instinct of man had <unk> to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis .
this <unk> sufficient reason for the final <unk> declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading space ; which medium , by retarding , in some degree , the progress of the comet , perpetually weakened its <unk> force ; thus giving a predominance to the centripetal ; which , of course , <name> the comet nearer and nearer at each revolution , and would eventually precipitate it upon the sun .
all this was strictly <unk> the medium or ether ; but this ether was assumed , most <unk> , on the ground that no other mode than the one spoken of could be discovered , of accounting for the observed decrease in the orbit of the comet : <unk> if from the fact that we could discover no other mode of accounting for it , it followed , in any respect , that no other mode of accounting for it existed .
it is clear that innumerable causes might operate , in combination , to diminish the orbit , without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with one of them .
in the meantime , it has never been fairly shown , perhaps , why the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the <unk> atmosphere , through which the comet passes at <unk> , is not enough to account for the <unk> .
that <unk> comet <name> be absorbed into the sun , is probable ; that all the comets of the system <name> be absorbed , is more than merely possible ; but , in such case , the principle of absorption must be referred to eccentricity of <unk> the close approximation to the sun , of the comets at their <unk> ; and is a principle not affecting , in any degree , the ponderous spheres , which are to be regarded as the true material constituents of the <unk> comets , in general , let me here suggest , in passing , that we can not be far wrong in looking upon them as the <unk> of the <unk> heaven .
the idea of a retarding ether and , through it , of a final <unk> of all things , seemed at one time , however , to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon .
by reference to <unk> recorded <unk> years ago , it was found that the velocity of the <unk> revolution then was considerably less than it is now ; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is uniformly in accordance with <unk> law , and was accurately determined <unk> years <unk> is now in advance of the position it should occupy , by nearly <unk> miles .
the increase of velocity proved , of course , a diminution of orbit ; and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief in an ether , as the sole mode of accounting for the <unk> , when <unk> came to the rescue .
he showed that , owing to the <unk> of the <unk> , the shorter axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length ; the longer axes being permanent ; and that this variation is continuous and <unk> that every orbit is in a state of transition , either from circle to ellipse , or from ellipse to circle .
in the case of the moon , where the shorter axis is <unk> , the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and , consequently , is <unk> too ; but , after a long series of ages , the ultimate eccentricity <name> be attained ; then the shorter axis <name> proceed to <unk> , until the orbit becomes a circle ; when the process of shortening <name> again take place ; —and so on forever .
in the case of the earth , the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle .
the facts thus demonstrated do away , of course , with all necessity for supposing an ether , and with all apprehension of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> account .
it <name> be remembered that i have myself assumed what we may term an ether .
i have spoken of a subtle influence which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter , although becoming manifest only through <unk> <unk> .
to this <unk> daring to touch it at all in any effort at explaining its awful <unk> have referred the various phænomena of electricity , heat , light , magnetism ; and <unk> vitality , consciousness , and <unk> a word , of <unk> .
it <name> be seen , at once , then , that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the ether of the astronomers ; inasmuch as theirs is matter and mine not .
with the idea of a material ether , seems , thus , to have departed altogether the thought of that universal <unk> so long <unk> by the poetical fancy of mankind : <unk> <unk> in which a sound philosophy might have been warranted in putting <name> , at least to a certain extent , if for no other reason than that by this poetical fancy it had been so <unk> .
but so far as <unk> far as mere physics have yet spoken , the cycles of the universe are <unk> universe has no conceivable end .
had an end been demonstrated , however , from so purely collateral a cause as an ether , man’s instinct of the divine capacity to adapt , would have rebelled against the demonstration .
we should have been forced to regard the universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human <name> .
creation would have affected us as an imperfect plot in a romance , where the <unk> is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external and foreign to the main subject ; instead of springing out of the bosom of the <unk> of the heart of the ruling <unk> of arising as a result of the primary <unk> inseparable and inevitable part and parcel of the fundamental <name> of the book .
what i mean by the symmetry of mere surface <name> now be more clearly understood .
it is simply by the <unk> of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into the general idea of which <unk> hypothesis is but a <unk> idea of the <unk> <unk> of the orbs .
dismissing this <unk> physical <name> , the symmetry of principle sees the end of all things <unk> involved in the thought of a beginning ; seeks and finds in this origin of all things the rudiment of this end ; and perceives the <unk> of supposing this end likely to be brought about less <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the rëaction of the originating act .
recurring , then , to a previous suggestion , let us understand the <unk> us understand each <name> , with its attendant <unk> but a <unk> atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for unity which characterized , in the beginning , the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the universal sphere .
as these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines , so let us conceive as at least generally <unk> , the paths of the <unk> towards their respective centres of aggregation : —and in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters , with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation , we have at length attained the great <unk> awful <unk> existing condition of the universe .
of the still more awful future a not irrational analogy may guide us in framing an hypothesis .
the equilibrium between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system , being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it belongs , there must occur , at once , a chaotic or seemingly chaotic precipitation , of the moons upon the planets , of the planets upon the suns , and of the suns upon the nuclei ; and the general result of this precipitation must be the gathering of the myriad <unk> stars of the firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely superior spheres .
in being immeasurably fewer , the worlds of that day <name> be immeasurably greater than our own .
then , indeed , amid unfathomable abysses , <name> be glaring unimaginable suns .
but all this <name> be merely a <unk> magnificence <unk> the great end .
of this end the new <name> described , can be but a very partial postponement .
while undergoing consolidation , the clusters themselves , with a speed prodigiously accumulative , have been rushing towards their own general <unk> now , with a <unk> electric velocity , commensurate only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of their appetite for <unk> , the majestic remnants of the tribe of stars flash , at length , into a common embrace .
the inevitable catastrophe is at hand .
but this <unk> is it ?
we have seen accomplished the <unk> of the orbs .
henceforward , are we not to understand one material globe of globes as constituting and comprehending the universe ?
such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption and consideration of this discourse .
i have already alluded to that absolute <unk> of adaptation which is the <unk> of the divine <unk> it divine .
up to this point of our reflections , we have been regarding the electrical influence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone matter is enabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of its purposes : <unk> far , in a word , we have been considering the influence in question as ordained for <unk> <unk> <unk> the objects of matter .
with a perfectly legitimate <unk> , we are now permitted to look at matter , as created solely for the sake of this <unk> to serve the objects of this spiritual ether .
through the <unk> the <unk> the agency of matter , and by dint of its <unk> this ether <unk> spirit <unk> .
it is merely in the development of this ether , through <unk> , that particular masses of matter become <unk> in the ratio of their <unk> ; <unk> reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving what we call thought and thus attaining conscious intelligence .
in this view , we are enabled to perceive matter as a <unk> as an end .
its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its diffusion ; and with the return into unity these purposes cease .
the absolutely consolidated globe of globes would be <unk> : <unk> not for a moment could it continue to exist .
matter , created for an end , would unquestionably , on fulfilment of that end , be matter no longer .
let us endeavor to understand that it would disappear , and that god would remain all in all .
that every work of divine <name> must <unk> and <unk> with its particular design , seems to me especially obvious ; and i make no doubt that , on perceiving the final globe of globes to be <unk> , the majority of my readers <name> be satisfied with my <unk> it can not continue to <unk> nevertheless , as the startling thought of its instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect can not be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly abstract , let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more ordinary point of view : <unk> us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated in an à <unk> consideration of matter as we actually find it .
i have before said that <unk> and repulsion being <unk> the sole properties by which matter is manifested to mind , we are justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and <unk> other words that attraction and repulsion are matter ; there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the terms <unk> and <unk> taken together , as equivalent , and therefore <unk> , expressions in <unk> [ 14 ] [ 14 ] <name> 37 .
now the very definition of attraction implies <unk> existence of parts , particles , or atoms ; for we define it as the tendency of <unk> atom & c. to every other <unk> & c. according to a certain law .
of course where there are no <unk> there is absolute <unk> the tendency to <unk> is <unk> can be no attraction : <unk> has been fully shown , and all philosophy admits it .
when , on fulfilment of its purposes , then , matter shall have returned into its original condition of <unk> condition which <unk> the expulsion of the <unk> ether , whose province and whose capacity are limited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when , this ether being no longer needed , the overwhelming pressure of the finally collective attraction shall at length just sufficiently <unk> [ 15 ] and expel it : <unk> , i say , matter , finally , <unk> the ether , shall have returned into absolute unity , <unk> <name> then ( to speak paradoxically for the moment ) be matter without attraction and without <unk> other words , matter without <unk> other words , again , matter no more .
in sinking into unity , it <name> sink at once into that nothingness which , to all finite perception , unity must <unk> that material <unk> from which alone we can conceive it to have been <unk> have been created by the volition of god .
[ 15 ] <unk> , therefore , must be the strongest of <unk> <name> 39 .
i repeat <unk> us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of globes <name> instantaneously disappear , and that god <name> remain all in all .
but are we here to pause ?
not so .
on the universal <unk> and dissolution , we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may <unk> creation and irradiation , returning into <unk> action and rëaction of the divine <name> .
guiding our imaginations by that <unk> law of laws , the law of <unk> , are we not , indeed , more than justified in entertaining a <unk> us say , rather , in indulging a <unk> the processes we have here ventured to contemplate <name> be renewed forever , and forever , and forever ; a novel universe swelling into existence , and then subsiding into nothingness , at every throb of the heart divine ?
and <unk> heart <unk> is it ?
it is our <unk> let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls from that cool exercise of <unk> that deep tranquillity of <unk> which alone we can <name> to attain the presence of this , the most sublime of truths , and look it leisurely in the face .
the phænomena on which our conclusions must at this point depend , are merely spiritual shadows , but not the less thoroughly substantial .
we walk about , amid the destinies of our <unk> , encompassed by dim but ever present memories of a <name> more <unk> distant in the <unk> time , and infinitely awful .
we live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams ; yet never mistaking them for dreams .
as memories we know them .
during our youth the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment .
so long as this youth endures , the feeling that we exist , is the most natural of all feelings .
we understand it thoroughly .
that there was a period at which we did not <unk> , that it might so have happened that we never had existed at <unk> the considerations , indeed , which during this youth , we find difficulty in understanding .
why we should not exist , is , up to the epoch of our manhood , of all queries the most unanswerable .
<unk> from all time and to all <unk> , up to the epoch of manhood , a normal and unquestionable condition : <unk> , because it is .
but now comes the period at which a conventional <unk> awakens us from the truth of our dream .
doubt , surprise and <unk> arrive at the same moment .
they say : <unk> live and the time was when you lived not .
you have been created .
an intelligence exists greater than your own ; and it is only through this intelligence you live at <unk> these things we struggle to comprehend and can not : <unk> , because these things , being untrue , are thus , of necessity , incomprehensible .
no thinking being lives who , at some luminous point of his life of thought , has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding , or believing , that anything exists greater than his own soul .
the utter impossibility of any <unk> soul feeling itself inferior to another ; the intense , overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the thought ; <unk> , with the <unk> aspirations at perfection , are but the spiritual , coincident with the material , struggles towards the original <unk> , to my mind at least , a species of proof far surpassing what man terms demonstration , that no one soul is inferior to <unk> nothing is , or can be , superior to any one <unk> each soul is , in part , its own <unk> own creator : —in a word , that <unk> material and spiritual <unk> exists solely in the diffused matter and spirit of the universe ; and that the <unk> of this diffused matter and spirit <name> be but the <unk> of the purely spiritual and individual god .
in this view , and in this view alone , we comprehend the riddles of divine <unk> inexorable fate .
in this view alone the existence of evil becomes intelligible ; but in this view it becomes <unk> becomes <unk> .
our souls no longer rebel at a sorrow which we ourselves have imposed upon ourselves , in furtherance of our own <unk> a <unk> even with a futile <unk> the extension of our own <name> .
i have spoken of memories that haunt us during our youth .
they sometimes pursue us even in our manhood : <unk> gradually less and less indefinite shapes : <unk> and then speak to us with low voices , saying : “there was an epoch in the night of time , when a <unk> being <unk> of an absolutely infinite number of similar beings that people the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite space .
[ 16 ] it was not and is not in the power of this <unk> more than it is in your <unk> extend , by actual increase , the <name> of his existence ; but just as it is in your power to expand or to concentrate your pleasures ( the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the same ) so did and does a similar capability <unk> to this divine being , who thus passes his eternity in perpetual variation of concentrated self and almost infinite <unk> .
what you call the universe is but his present expansive existence .
he now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect <unk> partial and <unk> pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures , but which are really but infinite <unk> of himself .
all these <unk> which you term animate , as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in <unk> these creatures have , in a greater or less degree , a capacity for pleasure and for pain : <unk> the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of happiness which <unk> by right to the divine being when concentrated within himself .
these creatures are all , too , more or less conscious <unk> ; conscious , first , of a proper identity ; conscious , secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses , of an identity with the divine being of whom we <unk> an identity with god .
of the two classes of consciousness , fancy that the former <name> grow weaker , the latter stronger , during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual <unk> become <unk> the bright stars become <unk> one .
think that the sense of individual identity <name> be gradually merged in the general <unk> man , for example , ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself man , <name> at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of jehovah .
in the meantime bear in mind that all is <unk> within <unk> less within the greater , and all within the spirit <unk> [ 16 ] see pages <unk> commencing “i reply that the right , ” and ending <unk> and particular <unk> the end .

the cask of amontillado by <name> <name> poe the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could , but when he ventured upon insult , i vowed revenge .
you , who so well know the nature of my soul , <name> not suppose , however , that i gave utterance to a threat .
at length i would be avenged ; this was a point definitely settled  but the very <unk> with which it was resolved , <unk> the idea of risk .
i must not only punish , but punish with impunity .
a wrong is <unk> when retribution <unk> its <unk> .
it is equally <unk> when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong .
it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good <name> .
i continued , as was my wont , to smile in his face , and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his <unk> .
he had a weak point  this fortunato  although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared .
he prided himself on his <unk> in wine .
few italians have the true <unk> spirit .
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity  to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires .
in painting and <unk> , fortunato , like his countrymen , was a quack  but in the matter of old wines he was sincere .
in this respect i did not differ from him materially : i was skillful in the italian <unk> myself , and bought largely whenever i could .
it was about dusk , one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season , that i encountered my friend .
he accosted me with excessive warmth , for he had been drinking much .
the man wore motley .
he had on a <unk> <unk> dress , and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells .
i was so pleased to see him , that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand .
i said to him  " my dear fortunato , you are luckily met .
how remarkably well you are looking to-day !
but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado , and i have my doubts . "
" how ? "
said he .
" amontillado ?
a pipe ?
impossible !
and in the middle of the carnival ! "
" i have my doubts , " i replied ; " and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter .
you were not to be found , and i was fearful of losing a bargain . "
" amontillado ! "
" i have my doubts . "
" amontillado ! "
" and i must satisfy them . "
" amontillado ! "
" as you are engaged , i am on my way to <unk> .
if any one has a critical turn , it is he .
he <name> tell me  " " <unk> can not tell amontillado from <name> . "
" and yet some fools <name> have it that his taste is a match for your own . "
" come , let us go . "
" whither ? "
" to your vaults . "
" my friend , no ; i <name> not impose upon your good nature .
i perceive you have an engagement .
<unk>  " " i have no engagement ;  come . "
" my friend , no .
it is not the engagement , but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted .
the vaults are <unk> damp .
they are encrusted with nitre . "
" let us go , nevertheless .
the cold is merely nothing .
amontillado !
you have been imposed upon .
and as for <unk> , he can not distinguish <name> from amontillado . "
thus speaking , fortunato possessed himself of my arm .
putting on a mask of black silk , and drawing a <unk> closely about my person , i suffered him to hurry me to my <unk> .
there were no attendants at home ; they had <unk> to make <name> in honour of the time .
i had told them that i should not return until the morning , and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house .
these orders were sufficient , i well knew , to insure their immediate disappearance , one and all , as soon as my back was turned .
i took from their <unk> two <unk> , and giving one to fortunato , bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults .
i passed down a long and winding staircase , requesting him to be cautious as he followed .
we came at length to the foot of the descent , and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the <unk> .
the gait of my friend was unsteady , and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode .
" the pipe , " said he .
" it is farther on , " said i ; " but observe the white <unk> which gleams from these cavern walls . "
he turned towards me , and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the <unk> of intoxication .
" nitre ? "
he asked , at length .
" nitre , " i replied .
" how long have you had that cough ? "
" ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh ! "
my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes .
" it is nothing , " he said , at last .
" come , " i said , with decision , " we <name> go back ; your health is precious .
you are <name> , respected , admired , beloved ; you are happy , as once i was .
you are a man to be missed .
for me it is no matter .
we <name> go back ; you <name> be ill , and i can not be responsible .
besides , there is <unk>  " " enough , " he said ; " the cough is a mere nothing ; it <name> not kill me .
i shall not die of a cough . "
" true  true , " i replied ; " and , indeed , i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily  but you should use all proper caution .
a draught of this <unk> <name> defend us from the <unk> . "
here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i <name> from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould .
" drink , " i said , presenting him the wine .
he raised it to his lips with a leer .
he paused and nodded to me familiarly , while his bells jingled .
" i drink , " he said , " to the buried that repose around us . "
" and i to your long life . "
he again took my arm , and we proceeded .
" these vaults , " he said , " are extensive . "
" the <unk> , " i replied , " were a great and numerous family . "
" i forget your arms . "
" a huge human foot <unk> , in a field azure ; the foot <unk> a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel . "
" and the motto ? "
" <unk> me <unk> <unk> . "
" good ! "
he said .
the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled .
my own fancy grew warm with the <unk> .
we had passed through walls of piled bones , with casks and <unk> <unk> , into the inmost recesses of catacombs .
i paused again , and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow .
" the nitre ! "
i said ; " see , it increases .
it hangs like moss upon the vaults .
we are below the river 's bed .
the drops of moisture trickle among the bones .
come , we <name> go back ere it is too late .
your cough  " " it is nothing , " he said ; " let us go on .
but first , another draught of the <unk> . "
i broke and reached him a <unk> of de grave .
he emptied it at a breath .
his eyes flashed with a fierce light .
he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a <unk> i did not understand .
i looked at him in surprise .
he repeated the movement  a grotesque one .
" you do not comprehend ? "
he said .
" not i , " i replied .
" then you are not of the brotherhood . "
" how ? "
" you are not of the masons . "
" yes , yes , " i said ; " yes , yes . "
" you ?
impossible !
a <name> ? "
" a <name> , " i replied .
" a sign , " he said , " a sign . "
" it is this , " i answered , producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my <unk> .
" you jest , " he exclaimed , <unk> a few paces .
" but let us proceed to the amontillado . "
" be it so , " i said , replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm .
he leaned upon it heavily .
we continued our route in search of the amontillado .
we passed through a range of low arches , descended , passed on , and descending again , arrived at a deep crypt , in which the <unk> of the air caused our <unk> rather to glow than flame .
at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious .
its walls had been lined with human remains , piled to the vault overhead , in the fashion of the great catacombs of <name> .
three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner .
from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down , and lay promiscuously upon the earth , forming at one point a mound of some size .
within the wall thus exposed by the <unk> of the bones , we perceived a still interior recess , in depth about four feet in width three , in height six or seven .
it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself , but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs , and was backed by one of their <unk> walls of solid granite .
it was in vain that fortunato , uplifting his dull torch , endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess .
its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see .
" proceed , " i said ; " herein is the amontillado .
as for <unk>  " " he is an <unk> , " interrupted my friend , as he stepped unsteadily forward , while i followed immediately at his heels .
in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche , and finding his progress arrested by the rock , stood stupidly bewildered .
a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite .
in its surface were two iron <unk> , distant from each other about two feet , horizontally .
from one of these depended a short chain , from the other a <unk> .
throwing the links about his waist , it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it .
he was too much astounded to resist .
withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess .
" pass your hand , " i said , " over the wall ; you can not help feeling the nitre .
indeed , it is very damp .
once more let me implore you to return .
no ?
then i must positively leave you .
but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power . "
" the amontillado ! "
ejaculated my friend , not yet recovered from his astonishment .
" true , " i replied ; " the amontillado . "
as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken .
throwing them aside , i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar .
with these materials and with the aid of my trowel , i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche .
i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off .
the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess .
it was not the cry of a drunken man .
there was then a long and obstinate silence .
i laid the second tier , and the third , and the fourth ; and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain .
the noise lasted for several minutes , during which , that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction , i ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones .
when at last the clanking subsided , i resumed the trowel , and finished without interruption the fifth , the sixth , and the seventh tier .
the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast .
i again paused , and holding the <unk> over the <unk> , threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within .
a succession of loud and shrill screams , bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form , seemed to thrust me violently back .
for a brief moment i hesitated  i trembled .
<unk> my <unk> , i began to grope with it about the recess ; but the thought of an instant reassured me .
i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs , and felt satisfied .
i <unk> the wall ; i replied to the yells of him who clamoured .
i <unk>  i aided  i surpassed them in volume and in strength .
i did this , and the <unk> grew still .
it was now midnight , and my task was drawing to a close .
i had completed the eighth , the ninth , and the tenth tier .
i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh ; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in .
i struggled with its weight ; i placed it partially in its destined position .
but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head .
it was succeeded by a sad voice , which i had difficulty in recognizing as that of the <name> fortunato .
the voice said  " <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  he !
he !
he !  a very good joke indeed  an excellent jest .
we shall have many a <name> laugh about it at the <unk>  he !
he !
he !  over our wine  he !
he !
he ! "
" the amontillado ! "
i said .
" he !
he !
he !  he !
he !
he !  yes , the amontillado .
but is it not getting late ?
<name> not they be awaiting us at the <unk> , the <name> fortunato and the rest ?
let us be gone . "
" yes , " i said , " let us be gone . "
" for the love of god , <unk> !  " " yes , " i said , " for the love of god ! "
but to these words i <unk> in vain for a reply .
i grew impatient .
i called aloud  " fortunato ! "
no answer .
i called again  " fortunato  " no answer still .
i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within .
there came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells .
my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs .
i hastened to make an end of my labour .
i forced the last stone into its position ; i plastered it up .
against the new masonry i <unk> the old rampart of bones .
for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them .
in pace <unk> ! 
the fall of the house of usher son <unk> est <name> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> il <unk> .
de <unk> .
during the whole of a dull , dark , and <unk> day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds <name> <unk> low in the heavens , i had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening <name> on , within view of the melancholy house of usher .
i know not how it was  but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit .
i say insufferable ; for the feeling was <unk> by any of that <unk> , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the <unk> natural images of the desolate or terrible .
i looked upon the scene before me  upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain  upon the bleak walls  upon the vacant <unk> windows  upon a few rank <unk>  and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees  with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the <unk> of the <unk> upon opium  the bitter lapse into everyday life  the hideous dropping off of the veil .
there was an <unk> , a sinking , a sickening of the heart  an <unk> <unk> of thought which no <unk> of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime .
what was it  i paused to think  what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher ?
it was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered .
i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .
it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down  but with a shudder even more thrilling than before  upon the <unk> and inverted images of the grey <unk> , and the ghastly <unk> , and the vacant and <unk> windows .
nevertheless , in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks .
its proprietor , <name> usher , had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting .
a letter , however , had lately reached me in a distant part of the country  a letter from him  which , in its wildly importunate nature , had admitted of no other than a personal reply .
the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation .
the writer spoke of acute bodily illness  of a mental disorder which oppressed him  and of an <name> <name> to see me , as his best , and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some <unk> of his malady .
it was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said  it was the apparent heart that went with his request  which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons .
although , as boys , we had been even intimate associates , yet i really knew little of my friend .
his reserve had been always excessive and habitual .
i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted <name> , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of <unk> yet unobtrusive <name> , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science .
i had learned , too , the very remarkable fact , that the stem of the usher race , all <unk> as it was , had put forth , at no period , any enduring branch ; in other words , that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent , and had always , with very trifling and very temporary variation , so lain .
it was this deficiency , i considered , while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the <unk> character of the people , and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one , in the long lapse of centuries , might have exercised upon the other  it was this deficiency , perhaps , of collateral issue , and the consequent <unk> transmission , from sire to son , of the <unk> with the name , which had , at length , so identified the two as to <unk> the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the " house of usher "  an appellation which seemed to include , in the minds of the peasantry who used it , both the family and the family mansion .
i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment  that of looking down within the tarn  had been to deepen the first singular impression .
there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my <unk>  for why should i not so term it ?  served mainly to <unk> the increase itself .
such , i have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis .
and it might have been for this reason only , that , when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy  a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me .
i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there <name> an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity  an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the grey wall , and the silent tarn  a <unk> and mystic vapour , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and <unk> .
shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .
its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .
the <unk> of ages had been great .
minute <unk> overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine tangled <unk> from the eaves .
yet all this was apart from any extraordinary <unk> .
no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones .
in this there was much that reminded me of the <unk> <unk> of old <unk> which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .
beyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability .
perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .
noticing these things , i rode over a short causeway to the house .
a servant in waiting took my horse , and i entered the gothic archway of the hall .
a valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master .
much that i encountered on the way contributed , i know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken .
while the objects around me  while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the <unk> blackness of the floors , and the <unk> <unk> trophies which rattled as i strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , i had been accustomed from my infancy  while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this  i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .
on one of the staircases , i met the physician of the family .
his countenance , i thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity .
he accosted me with trepidation and passed on .
the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master .
the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty .
the windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a dis <unk> from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .
feeble gleams of <unk> light made their way through the <unk> panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .
dark draperies <name> upon the walls .
the general furniture was profuse , comfortless , antique , and tattered .
many books and musical instruments lay scattered about , but failed to give any vitality to the scene .
i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow .
an air of stern , deep , and <unk> gloom <name> over and pervaded all .
upon my entrance , usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , i at first thought , of an overdone cordiality  of the constrained effort of the <unk> man of the world .
a glance , however , at his countenance , convinced me of his perfect sincerity .
we sat down ; and for some moments , while he spoke not , i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity , half of awe .
surely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had <name> usher !
it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the <name> being before me with the companion of my early boyhood .
yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable .
a <unk> of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a <unk> beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of <unk> unusual in similar formations ; a <unk> <name> , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than <unk> softness and tenuity ; these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the <name> , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .
and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke .
the now ghastly pallor of the skin , and the now miraculous lustre of the eye , above all things startled and even awed me .
the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its <unk> expression with any idea of simple humanity .
in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an <unk>  an inconsistency ; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual <unk>  an excessive nervous agitation .
for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared , no less by his letter , than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits , and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament .
his action was alternately vivacious and sullen .
his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic <unk>  that abrupt , weighty , <unk> , and <unk> enunciation  that leaden , self balanced and perfectly <unk> guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the <unk> eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .
it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit , of his <name> <name> to see me , and of the solace he expected me to afford him .
he entered , at some length , into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady .
it was , he said , a constitutional and a family evil , and one for which he despaired to find a remedy  a mere nervous affection , he immediately added , which would undoubtedly soon pass off .
it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations .
some of these , as he detailed them , interested and bewildered me ; although , perhaps , the terms , and the general manner of the narration had their weight .
he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses ; the most insipid food was alone <unk> ; he could wear only garments of certain texture ; the odours of all flowers were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar sounds , and these from <unk> instruments , which did not inspire him with horror .
to an anomalous species of terror i found him a <unk> slave .
" i shall perish , " said he , " i must perish in this deplorable folly .
thus , thus , and not otherwise , shall i be lost .
i dread the events of the future , not in themselves , but in their results .
i shudder at the thought of any , even the most trivial , incident , which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul .
i have , indeed , no abhorrence of danger , except in its absolute effect  in terror .
in this unnerved  in this pitiable condition  i feel that the period <name> sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together , in some struggle with the grim <unk> , fear . "
i learned , moreover , at intervals , and through broken and equivocal hints , another singular feature of his mental condition .
he was <unk> by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth  in regard to an influence whose <unk> force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be <unk>  an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion , had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit  an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the <unk> of his existence .
he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin  to the severe and long-continued illness  indeed to the evidently approaching dis solution  of a tenderly beloved sister  his sole companion for long years  his last and only relative on earth .
" her decease , " he said , with a bitterness which i can never forget , " would leave him ( him the hopeless and the frail ) the last of the ancient race of the ushers . "
while he spoke , the <name> <name> ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared .
i regarded her with an utter astonishment not <unk> with dread  and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings .
a sensation of stupor oppressed me , as my eyes followed her retreating steps .
when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother  but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary <unk> had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .
the disease of the <name> <name> had long baffled the skill of her physicians .
a settled apathy , a gradual wasting away of the person , and frequent although transient affections of a partially <unk> character , were the unusual diagnosis .
hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady , and had not <unk> herself finally to bed ; but , on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house , she succumbed ( as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation ) to the <unk> power of the destroyer ; and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtain  that the <name> , at least while living , would be seen by me no more .
for several days ensuing , her name was <unk> by either usher or myself : and during this period i was busied in <name> endeavours to <unk> the melancholy of my friend .
we painted and read together ; or i listened , as if in a dream , to the wild <unk> of his speaking guitar .
and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe , in one unceasing radiation of gloom .
i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher .
yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies , or of the occupations , in which he involved me , or led me the way .
an excited and highly <unk> <unk> threw a <unk> lustre over all .
his long improvised <unk> <name> ring for ever in my ears .
among other things , i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and <unk> of the wild air of the last waltz of <name> <unk> .
from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded , and which grew , touch by touch , into <unk> at which i shuddered the more <unk> , because i shuddered knowing not why ;  from these paintings ( vivid as their images now are before me ) i would in vain endeavour to <unk> more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words .
by the utter simplicity , by the nakedness of his designs , he arrested and overawed attention .
if ever mortal painted an idea , that mortal was <name> usher .
for me at least  in the circumstances then surrounding me  there arose out of the pure <unk> which the <unk> contrived to throw upon his canvas , an intensity of intolerable awe , no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of <unk> .
one of the <unk> conceptions of my friend , partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction , may be shadowed forth , although feebly , in words .
a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel , with low walls , smooth , white , and without interruption or device .
certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth .
no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent , and no torch , or other artificial source of light was discernible ; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout , and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour .
i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of <unk> instruments .
it was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar , which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of the performances .
but the <unk> facility of his <unk> could not be so accounted for .
they must have been , and were , in the notes , as well as in the words of his wild <unk> ( for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with <unk> verbal <unk> ) , the result of that intense mental <unk> and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement .
the words of one of these <unk> i have easily remembered .
i was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it , as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , i fancied that i perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of usher , of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne .
the verses , which were entitled " the haunted palace , " ran very nearly , if not accurately , thus : i .
in the <unk> of our valleys , by good angels tenanted , once a fair and stately palace  radiant palace  reared its head .
in the monarch thought 's dominion  it stood there !
never seraph spread a <unk> over fabric half so fair .
ii .
banners yellow , glorious , golden , on its roof did float and flow ; ( this  all this  was in the olden time long ago ) and every gentle air that <unk> , in that sweet day , along the ramparts plumed and pallid , a winged odour went away .
iii .
wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a <unk> 's well tuned law , round about a throne , where sitting ( <unk> ! )
in state his <name> well <unk> , the ruler of the realm was seen .
iv .
and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing and sparkling evermore , a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
v. but evil things , in robes of sorrow , assailed the monarch 's high estate ; ( ah , let us mourn , for never morrow shall <name> upon him , desolate ! )
and , round about his home , the <name> that blushed and bloomed is but a <unk> story , of the old time entombed .
<name> .
and travellers now within that valley , through the <unk> windows , see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant <name> ; while , like a rapid ghastly river , through the pale door , a hideous throng rush out forever , and laugh  but smile no more .
i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad , led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher 's which i mention not so much on account of its novelty ( for other <unk> have thought thus , ) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it .
this opinion , in its general form , was that of the <unk> of all vegetable things .
but , in his disordered fancy , the idea had assumed a more daring character , and <unk> , under certain conditions , upon the kingdom of <unk> .
i lack words to express the full extent , or the <name> abandon of his persuasion .
the belief , however , was connected ( as i have previously hinted ) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers .
the conditions of the <unk> had been here , he imagined , fulfilled in the method of <unk> of these stones  in the order of their arrangement , as well as in that of the many <unk> which overspread them , and of the decayed trees which stood around  above all , in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement , and in its <unk> in the still waters of the tarn .
its evidence  the evidence of the <unk>  was to be seen , he said , ( and i here started as he spoke , ) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls .
the result was discoverable , he added , in that silent , yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family , and which made him what i now saw him  what he was .
such opinions need no comment , and i <name> make none .
our books  the books which , for years , had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid  were , as might be supposed , in strict keeping with this character of <unk> .
we <unk> together over such works as the <unk> et <unk> of <unk> ; the <unk> of machiavelli ; the heaven and hell of swedenborg ; the subterranean voyage of <name> <unk> by <unk> ; the <unk> of <name> <unk> , of <name> <unk> , and of de la <unk> ; the journey into the blue distance of <unk> ; and the city of the sun by <unk> .
one favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> <unk> de <unk> ; and there were passages in <unk> <unk> , about the old african <unk> and <unk> , over which usher would sit dreaming for hours .
his chief delight , however , was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic  the <name> of a forgotten church  the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the <unk> , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the <name> <name> was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight , ( previously to its final interment ) , in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building .
the worldly reason , however , assigned for this singular proceeding , was one which i did not feel at <name> to dispute .
the brother had been led to his resolution ( so he told me ) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased , of certain <unk> and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men , and of the remote and exposed situation of the <unk> of the family .
i <name> not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , i had no <name> to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural , precaution .
at the request of usher , i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary <unk> .
the body having been <unk> , we two alone bore it to its rest .
the vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment .
it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a <unk> , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .
the door , of massive iron , had been , also , similarly protected .
its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound , as it moved upon its hinges .
having deposited our mournful burden upon <unk> within this region of horror , we partially turned aside the yet <unk> lid of the coffin , and looked upon the face of the tenant .
a striking <unk> between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention ; and usher , <unk> , perhaps , my thoughts , murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins , and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them .
our glances , however , rested not long upon the dead  for we could not regard her <unk> .
the disease which had thus entombed the <name> in the maturity of youth , had left , as usual in all maladies of a strictly <unk> character , the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face , and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death .
we replaced and screwed down the lid , and , having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house .
and now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend .
his ordinary manner had vanished .
his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten .
he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and <unk> step .
the pallor of his countenance had assumed , if possible , a more ghastly <name>  but the <unk> of his eye had utterly gone out .
the once occasional <unk> of his tone was heard no more ; and a tremulous <unk> , as if of extreme terror , habitually characterized his utterance .
there were times , indeed , when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret , to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage .
at times , again , i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness , for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours , in an attitude of the profoundest attention , as if listening to some imaginary sound .
it was no wonder that his condition terrified  that it infected me .
i felt creeping upon me , by slow yet certain degrees , the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions .
it was , especially , upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the <name> <name> within the <unk> , that i experienced the full power of such feelings .
sleep came not near my couch  while the hours waned and waned away .
i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me .
i endeavoured to believe that much , if not all of what i felt , was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room  of the dark and tattered draperies , which , tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest , swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls , and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed .
but my efforts were fruitless .
an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame ; and , at length , there sat upon my very heart an <unk> of utterly <unk> alarm .
shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle , i uplifted myself upon the pillows , and , peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , <unk>  i know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me  to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , i knew not whence .
overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night , ) and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .
i had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention .
i presently recognized it as that of usher .
in an instant afterwards he rapped , with a gentle touch , at my door , and entered , bearing a lamp .
his countenance was , as usual , <unk> <name>  but , moreover , there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes  an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour .
his air appalled me  but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured , and i even welcomed his presence as a relief .
" and you have not seen it ? "
he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence  " you have not then seen it ?  but , stay !
you shall . "
thus speaking , and having carefully shaded his lamp , he hurried to one of the <unk> , and threw it freely open to the storm .
the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet .
it was , indeed , a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night , and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty .
a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which <name> so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the <unk> velocity with which they flew <unk> from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .
i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this  yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars  nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning .
but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor , as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us , were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous <unk> which <name> about and enshrouded the mansion .
" you must not  you shall not behold this ! "
said i , <unk> , to usher , as i led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat .
" these appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon  or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank <unk> of the tarn .
let us close this casement ;  the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame .
here is one of your favourite romances .
i <name> read , and you shall listen ;  and so we <name> pass away this terrible night together . "
the antique volume which i had taken up was the " mad <unk> " of sir launcelot canning ; but i had called it a favourite of usher 's more in sad jest than in <name> ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and <unk> <unk> which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual <unk> of my friend .
it was , however , the only book immediately at hand ; and i indulged a vague <name> that the excitement which now agitated the <unk> , might find relief ( for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies ) even in the <unk> of the folly which i should read .
could i have judged , indeed , by the wild <unk> air of vivacity with which he <unk> , or apparently <unk> , to the words of the tale , i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design .
i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred , the hero of the <unk> , having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit , proceeds to make good an entrance by force .
here , it <name> be remembered , the words of the narrative run thus : " and ethelred , who was by nature of a doughty heart , and who was now mighty withal , on account of the <unk> of the wine which he had drunken , waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit , who , in sooth , was of an obstinate and <unk> turn , but , feeling the rain upon his shoulders , and fearing the rising of the tempest , uplifted his <unk> outright , and , with blows , made quickly room in the <unk> of the door for his <unk> hand ; and now pulling therewith sturdily , he so cracked , and ripped , and tore all asunder , that the noise of the dry and <unk> wood alarmed and <unk> throughout the forest . "
at the termination of this sentence i started , and for a moment , paused ; for it appeared to me ( although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me )  it appeared to me that , from some very remote portion of the mansion , there came , indistinctly , to my ears , what might have been , in its exact similarity of character , the <name> ( but a stifled and dull one certainly ) of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described .
it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the <unk> , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
i continued the story : " but the good champion ethelred , now entering within the door , was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the <unk> hermit ; but , in the stead thereof , a dragon of a <unk> and prodigious demeanour , and of a fiery tongue , which sate in guard before a palace of gold , with a floor of silver ; and upon the wall there <name> a shield of shining brass with this legend <unk>  who <unk> herein , a <unk> hath bin ; who <unk> the dragon , the shield he shall win ; and ethelred uplifted his <unk> , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his <unk> breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . "
here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement  for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound  the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already <unk> up for the dragon 's unnatural shriek as described by the <unk> .
oppressed , as i certainly was , upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence , by a thousand conflicting sensations , in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant , i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting , by any observation , the sensitive nervousness of my companion .
i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; although , assuredly , a strange alteration had , during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanour .
from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring <unk> .
his head had dropped upon his breast  yet i knew that he was not asleep , from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile .
the motion of his body , too , was at variance with this idea  for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway .
having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded : " and now , the champion , having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon , <unk> himself of the brazen shield , and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it , removed the carcass from out of the way before him , and approached <unk> over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall ; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming , but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor , with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound . "
no sooner had these syllables passed my lips , than  as if a shield of brass had indeed , at the moment , fallen heavily upon a floor of silver  i became aware of a distinct , hollow , metallic , and <unk> , yet apparently muffled <unk> .
completely unnerved , i leaped to my feet ; but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed .
i rushed to the chair in which he sat .
his eyes were bent fixedly before him , and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity .
but , as i placed my hand upon his shoulder , there came a strong shudder over his whole person ; a sickly smile quivered about his lips ; and i saw that he spoke in a low , hurried , and <unk> murmur , as if unconscious of my presence .
bending closely over him , i at length drank in the hideous import of his words .
" not hear it ?  yes , i hear it , and have heard it .
long long  long  many minutes , many hours , many days , have i heard it  yet i dared not  oh , pity me , miserable wretch that i am !  i dared not  i dared not speak !
we have put her living in the tomb !
said i not that my senses were acute ?
i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin .
i heard them  many , many days ago  yet i dared not  i dared not speak !
and now  to-night  ethelred  <name> !
<name> !  the breaking of the hermit 's door , and the <unk> of the dragon , and the <unk> of the shield !  say , rather , the rending of her coffin , and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison , and her struggles within the <unk> archway of the vault !
oh whither shall i fly ?
<name> she not be here anon ?
is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste ?
have i not heard her footsteps on the stair ?
do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart ?
madman ! "
here he sprang furiously to his feet , and shrieked out his syllables , as if in the effort he were giving up his soul  " madman !
i tell you that she now stands without the door ! "
as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the <unk> of a spell  the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed , threw slowly back , upon the instant , their ponderous and <name> jaws .
it was the work of the rushing gust  but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the <name> <name> of usher .
there was blood upon her white robes , and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame .
for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold ,  then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final <unk> , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .
from that chamber , and from that mansion , i fled aghast .
the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway .
suddenly there shot along the path a wild light , and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued ; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me .
the radiance was that of the full , setting , and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once <unk> fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building , in a zigzag direction , to the base .
while i gazed , this fissure rapidly widened  there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind  the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight  my <name> reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder  there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters  and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the " house of usher " .
* watson , dr <unk> , <unk> , and especially the bishop of <unk> .
the <unk> of the red death by <name> <name> poe the " red death " had long <unk> the country .
no pestilence had ever been so fatal , or so hideous .
blood was its <unk> and its seal  the redness and the horror of blood .
there were sharp pains , and sudden dizziness , and then profuse bleeding at the pores , with dissolution .
the <name> stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim , were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men .
and the whole seizure , progress and termination of the disease , were the incidents of half an hour .
but the <name> <unk> was happy and dauntless and sagacious .
when his dominions were half <unk> , he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court , and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his <unk> abbeys .
this was an extensive and magnificent structure , the creation of the <name> 's own eccentric yet <name> taste .
a strong and lofty wall <unk> it in .
this wall had gates of iron .
the courtiers , having entered , brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts .
they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within .
the <name> was amply <unk> .
with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to <unk> .
the external world could take care of itself .
in the meantime it was folly to grieve , or to think .
the <name> had provided all the appliances of pleasure .
there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were musicians , there was beauty , there was wine .
all these and security were within .
without was the " red death " .
it was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion , and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad , that the <name> <unk> entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence .
it was a voluptuous scene , that masquerade .
but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held .
these were seven  an imperial suite .
in many palaces , however , such suites form a long and straight vista , while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand , so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded .
here the case was very different , as might have been expected from the <unk> love of the bizarre .
the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time .
there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards , and at each turn a novel effect .
to the right and left , in the middle of each wall , a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite .
these windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing <name> of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened .
that at the eastern extremity was <name> , for example in blue  and vividly blue were its windows .
the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries , and here the panes were purple .
the third was green throughout , and so were the <unk> .
the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange  the fifth with white  the sixth with <name> .
the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black <name> tapestries that <name> all over the ceiling and down the walls , falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and <name> .
but in this chamber only , the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations .
the panes here were <name>  a deep blood colour .
now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or <unk> , amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof .
there was no light of any kind <unk> from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers .
but in the corridors that followed the suite , there stood , opposite to each window , a heavy tripod , bearing a <unk> of fire , that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so <unk> illumined the room .
and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances .
but in the western or black chamber the effect of the <unk> that streamed upon the dark hangings through the <unk> panes , was ghastly in the extreme , and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered , that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all .
it was in this apartment , also , that there stood against the western wall , a gigantic clock of <name> .
its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull , heavy , monotonous clang ; and when the <unk> made the circuit of the face , and the hour was to be stricken , there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical , but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that , at each lapse of an hour , the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause , momentarily , in their performance , to <unk> to the sound ; and thus the <unk> perforce ceased their evolutions ; and there was a brief <unk> of the whole <name> company ; and , while the <unk> of the clock yet rang , it was observed that the <unk> grew pale , and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation .
but when the echoes had fully ceased , a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly ; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly , and made whispering vows , each to the other , that the next <unk> of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and then , after the lapse of sixty minutes , ( which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies , ) there came yet another <unk> of the clock , and then were the same <unk> and <unk> and meditation as before .
but , in spite of these things , it was a <name> and magnificent revel .
the tastes of the duke were peculiar .
he had a fine eye for colours and effects .
he disregarded the <unk> of mere fashion .
his plans were bold and fiery , and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre .
there are some who would have thought him mad .
his followers felt that he was not .
it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not .
he had directed , in great part , the movable embellishments of the seven chambers , upon occasion of this great <unk> ; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the <unk> .
be sure they were grotesque .
there were much glare and glitter and <unk> and <unk>  much of what has been since seen in " <unk> " .
there were <unk> figures with <unk> limbs and appointments .
there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions .
there were much of the beautiful , much of the wanton , much of the bizarre , something of the terrible , and not a little of that which might have excited disgust .
to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked , in fact , a multitude of dreams .
and these  the dreams  writhed in and about taking <name> from the rooms , and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the <name> of their steps .
and , anon , there strikes the <name> clock which stands in the hall of the <name> .
and then , for a moment , all is still , and all is silent save the voice of the clock .
the dreams are <unk> as they stand .
but the echoes of the chime die away  they have endured but an instant  and a light , <unk> laughter floats after them as they depart .
and now again the music swells , and the dreams live , and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever , taking <name> from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the <unk> .
but to the chamber which lies most <unk> of the seven , there are now none of the <unk> who venture ; for the night is waning away ; and there flows a <unk> light through the <unk> panes ; and the blackness of the sable drapery <unk> ; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet , there comes from the near clock of <name> a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote <unk> of the other apartments .
but these other apartments were densely crowded , and in them beat feverishly the heart of life .
and the revel went <unk> on , until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock .
and then the music ceased , as i have told ; and the evolutions of the <unk> were quieted ; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before .
but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the <name> of the clock ; and thus it happened , perhaps , that more of thought crept , with more of time , into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled .
and thus too , it happened , perhaps , that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence , there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before .
and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself <unk> around , there arose at length from the whole company a buzz , or murmur , expressive of disapprobation and surprise  then , finally , of terror , of horror , and of disgust .
in an assembly of <unk> such as i have painted , it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation .
in truth the masquerade <unk> of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in question had <unk> herod , and gone beyond the bounds of even the <name> 's indefinite decorum .
there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which can not be touched without emotion .
even with the utterly lost , to whom life and death are equally jests , there are matters of which no jest can be made .
the whole company , indeed , seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed .
the figure was tall and gaunt , and shrouded from head to foot in the <unk> of the grave .
the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat .
and yet all this might have been endured , if not approved , by the mad <unk> around .
but the <unk> had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death .
his <unk> was <unk> in blood  and his broad brow , with all the features of the face , was <unk> with the <name> horror .
when the eyes of the <name> <unk> fell upon this spectral image ( which , with a slow and solemn movement , as if more fully to sustain its role , stalked to and fro among the <unk> ) he was seen to be convulsed , in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste ; but , in the next , his brow reddened with rage .
" who dares , "  he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him  " who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery ?
seize him and <unk> him  that we may know whom we have to <name> , at sunrise , from the battlements ! "
it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the <name> <unk> as he uttered these words .
they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly , for the <name> was a bold and robust man , and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand .
it was in the blue room where stood the <name> , with a group of pale courtiers by his side .
at first , as he spoke , there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder , who at the moment was also near at hand , and now , with deliberate and stately step , made closer approach to the speaker .
but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the <unk> had inspired the whole party , there were found none who put forth hand to seize him ; so that , <unk> , he passed within a yard of the <name> 's person ; and , while the vast assembly , as if with one impulse , shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls , he made his way uninterruptedly , but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first , through the blue chamber to the purple  through the purple to the green  through the green to the orange  through this again to the white  and even thence to the <name> , ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him .
it was then , however , that the <name> <unk> , maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice , rushed hurriedly through the six chambers , while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all .
he bore aloft a drawn dagger , and had approached , in rapid impetuosity , to within three or four feet of the retreating figure , when the latter , having attained the extremity of the <name> apartment , turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer .
there was a sharp cry  and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet , upon which , instantly afterwards , fell prostrate in death the <name> <unk> .
then , summoning the wild courage of despair , a throng of the <unk> at once threw themselves into the black apartment , and , seizing the <unk> , whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the <name> clock , gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave <unk> and <unk> mask , which they handled with so violent a rudeness , <unk> by any tangible form .
and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death .
he had come like a thief in the night .
and one by one dropped the <unk> in the <unk> halls of their revel , and died each in the despairing posture of his fall .
and the life of the <name> clock went out with that of the last of the <name> .
and the flames of the <unk> expired .
and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all .
the <name> by <name> <name> poe once upon a midnight dreary , while i pondered , weak and weary , over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten <name>  while i nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , as of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door .
" 't is some visitor , " i muttered , " tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more . "
ah , distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december , and each separate dying <unk> wrought its ghost upon the floor .
eagerly i wished the morrow ;  vainly i had sought to borrow from my books <unk> of sorrow  sorrow for the lost <name>  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name>  nameless here for evermore .
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ; so that now , to still the beating of my heart , i stood repeating " 't is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door ; this it is and nothing more . "
presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer , " sir , " said i , " or madam , truly your forgiveness i implore ; but the fact is i was napping , and so gently you came rapping , and so faintly you came tapping , tapping at my chamber door , that i scarce was sure i heard you "  here i opened wide the door  darkness there and nothing more .
deep into that darkness peering , long i stood there wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before ; but the silence was unbroken , and the stillness gave no token , and the only word there spoken was the whispered word , " <name> ? "
this i whispered , and an <name> murmured back the word , " <name> ! "
 merely this and nothing more .
back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning , soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before .
" surely , " said i , " surely that is something at my window lattice ; let me see , then , what <unk> is and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore ;  't is the wind and nothing more .
open here i flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter , in there stepped a stately <name> of the saintly days of yore .
not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he , but , with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door  perched , and sat , and nothing more .
then the <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling , by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only that one word , as if its soul in that one word he did <unk> nothing farther then he uttered ; not a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered : " other friends have flown before  on the morrow he <name> leave me , as my hopes have flown before . "
then the bird said " nevermore . "
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken , " doubtless , " said i , " what it utters is its only stock and store , caught from some unhappy master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "
but the <name> still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling , straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door ; then , upon the <name> sinking , i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy , thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking " nevermore . "
this i sat engaged in guessing , but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom 's core ; this and more i sat <unk> , with my head at ease reclining on the cushion 's <name> lining that the <unk> <unk> o'er , but whose <name> <name> lining with the <unk> <unk> o'er she shall press , ah , nevermore !
then , methought , the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censer swung by <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the tufted floor .
" wretch , " i cried , " thy god hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee respite  respite and <unk> from thy memories of <name> !
<unk> , oh <unk> this kind <unk> and forget this lost <name> ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !  whether <unk> sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , desolate , yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror haunted  tell me truly , i implore  is there  is there balm in <unk> ?  tell me  tell me , i implore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if , within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" be that our sign of parting , bird or fiend ! "
i shrieked , <unk>  " get thee back into the tempest and the night 's <unk> shore !
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken !
leave my loneliness unbroken !  quit the bust above my door !
take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming and the <unk> o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !

"
this stanza from " the <name> " was recommended by <name> <name> <name> as an inscription upon the baltimore monument which marks the resting place of <name> <name> poe , the most interesting and original figure in american letters .
and , to signify that peculiar musical quality of poe 's genius which <unk> every reader , mr. <name> suggested this additional verse , from the " haunted palace " : and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing , and sparkling ever more , a troop of echoes , whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
born in poverty at boston , <name> 19 1809 , dying under painful circumstances at baltimore , october 7 , 1849 , his whole literary career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence , his memory <unk> <unk> by his earliest biographer , griswold , how completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently has poe come into his own , for " the <name> , " first published in 1845 , and , within a few months , read , recited and <unk> wherever the english language was spoken , the <unk> poet received $ 10 !
less than a year later his brother poet , n. p. <name> , issued this touching appeal to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author , his dying wife and her devoted mother , then living under very <unk> circumstances in a little cottage at fordham , n. y. : " here is one of the finest scholars , one of the most original men of genius , and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of our country , whose temporary suspension of labor , from bodily illness , drops him immediately to a level with the common objects of public <name> .
there is no intermediate <unk> , no respectful shelter , where , with the delicacy due to genius and culture , he might secure aid , till , with returning health , he would resume his labors , and his <unk> sense of independence . "
and this was the tribute paid by the american public to the master who had given to it such tales of <unk> charm , of witchery and mystery as " the fall of the house of usher " and " ligeia " ; such fascinating <unk> as " the unparalleled adventure of <name> <unk> , " " <unk> .
found in a bottle , " " a descent into a <unk> " and " the balloon hoax " ; such tales of conscience as " <name> <name> , " " the black cat " and " the <unk> heart , " wherein the <unk> of remorse are portrayed with an awful fidelity ; such tales of natural beauty as " the island of the <name> " and " the domain of <unk> " ; such marvellous studies in <unk> as the " <unk> , " " the murders in the rue morgue , " " the <unk> letter " and " the mystery of <name> <unk> , " the latter , a recital of fact , demonstrating the author 's wonderful capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human mind ; such tales of illusion and banter as " the premature burial " and " the system of dr. <unk> and professor <unk> " ; such bits of <unk> as " the devil in the belfry " and " the <name> of the odd " ; such tales of adventure as " the narrative of <name> <name> <unk> " ; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for poe the enthusiastic admiration of <name> dickens , although they made him many enemies among the <unk> minor american writers so mercilessly exposed by him ; such poems of beauty and <name> as " the bells , " " the haunted palace , " " <unk> , " " the city in the sea " and " the <name> . "
what delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain of <unk> !
what an atmosphere of beauty , music , color !
what resources of imagination , construction , analysis and absolute <name> !
one might almost sympathize with <name> <name> <unk> , who , confessing to a half <name> in the old superstition of the significance of <unk> , found , in the <unk> letters of <name> poe 's name , the words " a <unk> . "
his mind , she says , was indeed a " haunted palace , " echoing to the <unk> of angels and demons .
" no man , " poe himself wrote , " has recorded , no man has dared to record , the wonders of his inner life . "
in these twentieth century days  of lavish recognition  artistic , popular and material  of genius , what rewards might not a poe claim !
<name> 's father , a son of general <name> poe , the american revolutionary patriot and friend of <unk> , had married mrs. hopkins , an english actress , and , the match meeting with parental disapproval , had himself taken to the stage as a profession .
notwithstanding mrs. poe 's beauty and talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence .
when <name> , at the age of two years , was <unk> , the family was in the utmost destitution .
apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless and friendless .
but fate decreed that a few <unk> of <name> were to <unk> his life , for the little fellow was adopted by <name> <name> , a wealthy merchant of richmond , <unk> a brother and sister , the remaining children , were cared for by others .
in his new home <name> found all the luxury and advantages money could provide .
he was petted , spoiled and shown off to strangers .
in mrs. <name> he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow .
mr. <name> took much pride in the <unk> , precocious lad .
at the age of five the boy recited , with fine effect , passages of english poetry to the visitors at the <name> house .
from his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the manor house school , at <unk> , a suburb of london .
it was the rev .
dr. <unk> , head of the school , whom poe so quaintly portrayed in " <name> <name> . "
returning to richmond in 1820 <name> was sent to the school of professor <name> h. clarke .
he proved an apt pupil .
years afterward professor clarke thus wrote : " while the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses , poe wrote genuine poetry ; the boy was a born poet .
as a scholar he was ambitious to excel .
he was remarkable for self-respect , without <unk> .
he had a sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend .
his nature was entirely free from selfishness . "
at the age of seventeen poe entered the university of <name> at <unk> .
he left that institution after one session .
official records prove that he was not expelled .
on the contrary , he gained a creditable record as a student , although it is admitted that he contracted debts and had " an ungovernable passion for <unk> . "
these debts may have led to his quarrel with mr. <name> which eventually compelled him to make his own way in the world .
early in 1827 poe made his first literary venture .
he induced <name> <name> , a poor and youthful printer , to publish a small volume of his verses under the title " <unk> and other poems . "
in 1829 we find poe in baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses , which was soon published .
its title was " <name> aaraaf , <unk> and other poems . "
neither of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention .
soon after mrs. <name> 's death , which occurred in 1829 , poe , through the aid of mr. <name> , secured admission to the united states military academy at west point .
any glamour which may have attached to cadet life in poe 's eyes was speedily lost , for discipline at west point was never so severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor .
poe 's bent was more and more toward literature .
life at the academy daily became increasingly distasteful .
soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and to disregard his duties , his aim being to secure his dismissal from the united states service .
in this he succeeded .
on march 7 , 1831 , poe found himself free .
mr. <name> 's second marriage had thrown the lad on his own resources .
his literary career was to begin .
poe 's first genuine victory was won in 1833 , when he was the successful competitor for a prize of $ 100 offered by a baltimore periodical for the best prose story .
" a <unk> .
found in a bottle " was the winning tale .
poe had submitted six stories in a volume .
" our only difficulty , " says mr. <unk> , one of the judges , " was in selecting from the <name> contents of the volume . "
during the fifteen years of his literary life poe was connected with various newspapers and magazines in richmond , philadelphia and new york .
he was faithful , punctual , industrious , thorough .
n. p. <name> , who for some time employed poe as critic and <unk> on the " evening mirror , " wrote thus : " with the highest admiration for poe 's genius , and a willingness to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
we saw but one presentiment of the <unk> quiet , patient , industrious and most gentlemanly person .
" we heard , from one who knew him well ( what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities ) , that with a single glass of wine his whole nature was reversed , the demon became uppermost , and , though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible , his <name> was palpably insane .
in this reversed character , we repeat , it was never our chance to meet him . "
on <name> 22 , 1835 , poe married his cousin , <name> <unk> , in baltimore .
she had barely turned thirteen years , poe himself was but twenty-six .
he then was a resident of richmond and a regular <unk> to the " southern literary messenger . "
it was not until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither .
poe 's devotion to his <unk> was one of the most beautiful features of his life .
many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her beauty and charm .
consumption had marked her for its victim , and the constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender means permitted .
<name> died <name> 30 , 1847 , when but twenty-five years of age .
a friend of the family pictures the death-bed scene  mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet , while her pet cat was suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth .
these verses from " <name> <name> , " written by poe in 1849 , the last year of his life , tell of his sorrow at the loss of his <unk> : i was a child and she was a child , in a kingdom by the sea ; but we loved with a love that was more than love  i and my <name> <name> ; with a love that the winged <unk> of heaven coveted her and me .
and this was the reason that , long ago ; in this kingdom by the sea .
a wind blew out of a cloud , chilling my beautiful <name> <name> ; so that her <unk> kinsmen came and bore her away from me , to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea , poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the " southern literary messenger " in richmond , <unk> ; " <name> 's magazine " and the " gentleman 's magazine " in philadelphia .
; the " evening mirror , " the " broadway journal , " and " <unk> 's <name> 's book " in new york .
everywhere poe 's life was one of <unk> toil .
no tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of <name> and spirit .
poe 's initial salary with the " southern literary messenger , " to which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales , was $ 10 a week !
two years later his salary was but $ 600 a year .
even in 1844 , when his literary reputation was established securely , he wrote to a friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had agreed to pay him $ 20 monthly for two pages of criticism .
those were discouraging times in american literature , but poe never lost <name> .
he was finally to triumph wherever <unk> talents win admirers .
his genius has had no better description than in this stanza from <name> <name> 's poem , read at the dedication exercises of the actors ' monument to poe , may 4 , 1885 , in new york : he was the voice of beauty and of woe , passion and mystery and the dread unknown ; pure as the mountains of perpetual snow , cold as the icy winds that round them moan , dark as the eaves wherein earth 's thunders groan , wild as the tempests of the upper sky , sweet as the faint , far-off celestial tone of <name> whispers , fluttering from on high , and tender as love 's tear when youth and beauty die .
in the two and a half score years that have elapsed since poe 's death he has come fully into his own .
for a while griswold 's malignant <unk> colored the public estimate of poe as man and as writer .
but , thanks to j. h. <unk> , w. f. gill , <name> <unk> , <name> <name> <unk> and others these <unk> have been dispelled and poe is seen as he actually <unk> as a man without failings , it is true , but as the finest and most original genius in american letters .
as the years go on his fame increases .
his works have been translated into many foreign languages .
his is a household name in <name> and <unk> fact , the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that poe 's own country has been slow to appreciate him .
but that reproach , if it ever was warranted , certainly is untrue .
w. h. r. <name> <name> poe by <name> <name> <name> the situation of american literature is anomalous .
it has no centre , or , if it have , it is like that of the sphere of <unk> .
it is , divided into many systems , each revolving round its several suns , and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a <unk> way .
our capital city , unlike london or <name> , is not a great central heart from which life and vigor <unk> to the extremities , but resembles more an isolated <unk> stuck down as near a 's may be to the centre of the land , and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any present need .
boston , new york , philadelphia , each has its literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects of germany ; and the young <name> of the west has also one of her own , of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the atlantic .
perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of contemporary literature .
it is even more grateful to give praise where it is needed than where it is deserved , and friendship so often <unk> the iron <unk> of justice into a vague flourish , that she writes what seems rather like an <unk> than a criticism .
yet if praise be given as an alms , we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man 's hat .
the critic 's ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of <unk> or of sugar .
but it is easier to be generous than to be just , and we might readily put <name> in that fabulous direction to the hiding place of truth , did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mixed with it .
remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of imaginative men , but mr. poe 's biography displays a <unk> and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with .
the offspring of a romantic marriage , and left an orphan at an early age , he was adopted by mr. <name> , a wealthy virginian , whose barren <unk> seemed the <unk> of a large estate to the young poet .
having received a classical education in england , he returned home and entered the university of <name> , where , after an extravagant course , followed by reformation at the last extremity , he was graduated with the highest honors of his class .
then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the <unk> greeks , which ended at st. petersburg , where he got into difficulties through want of a passport , from which he was rescued by the american consul and sent home .
he now entered the military academy at west point , from which he obtained a dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father , by a second marriage , an event which cut off his expectations as an heir .
the death of mr. <name> , in whose <name> his name was not mentioned , soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard , and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support .
previously to this , however , he had published ( in 1827 ) a small volume of poems , which soon ran through three editions , and excited high expectations of its author 's future distinction in the minds of many competent judges .
that no certain <unk> can be drawn from a poet 's earliest <unk> there are instances enough to prove .
shakespeare 's first poems , though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness , give but a very faint promise of the directness , condensation and overflowing moral of his <unk> works .
perhaps , however , shakespeare is hardly a case in point , his " <name> and adonis " having been published , we believe , in his <unk> year .
<name> 's latin verses show tenderness , a fine eye for nature , and a delicate appreciation of classic models , but give no hint of the author of a new style in poetry .
pope 's youthful pieces have all the sing-song , wholly <unk> by the glittering malignity and eloquent <unk> of his later productions .
collins ' callow <unk> died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius which he afterward displayed .
we have never thought that the world lost more in the " marvellous boy , " <unk> , than a very ingenious <unk> of obscure and <unk> dulness .
where he becomes original ( as it is called ) , the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid .
<unk> white 's promises were <unk> by the respectable name of mr. <unk> , but surely with no authority from apollo .
they have the merit of a traditional piety , which to our mind , if uttered at all , had been less objectionable in the retired closet of a diary , and in the sober raiment of prose .
they do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning pertinacity of <unk> ; neither have they the interest of his occasional simple , lucky beauty .
burns having fortunately been rescued by his humble station from the <unk> society of the " best models , " wrote well and naturally from the first .
had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste , we should have had a series of poems from which , as from his letters , we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of chaff .
coleridge 's youthful efforts give no promise whatever of that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest , tenderest , most original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times .
<unk> " hours of idleness " would never find a reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity .
in wordsworth 's first <unk> there is but a dim <unk> of the creator of an <name> .
from <unk> 's early poems , a safer <unk> might have been drawn .
they show the patient <unk> , the close student of history , and the unwearied explorer of the beauties of predecessors , but they give no assurances of a man who should add aught to stock of household words , or to the rarer and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor .
the earliest specimens of <name> 's poetic mind already , also , give tokens of that ethereal <unk> in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions of words , but leaves its body , the verse , to be entombed , without <name> of resurrection , in a mass of them .
<unk> is generally <unk> as a wonder of <unk> .
but his early <unk> show only a capacity for <unk> and for the <unk> arrangement of certain conventional combinations of words , a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical organization , and an unhappy memory .
an early poem is only remarkable when it displays an effort of reason , and the rudest verses in which we can trace some <name> of the ends of poetry , are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile versification .
a school-boy , one would say , might acquire the regular <unk> of pope merely by an association with the motion of the <unk> tilt .
mr. poe 's early productions show that he could see through the verse to the spirit beneath , and that he already had a feeling that all the life and <name> of the one must depend on and be <unk> by the <name> of the other .
we call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read .
we know of none that can compare with them for maturity of purpose , and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre .
such pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express by the contradictory phrase of innate experience .
we copy one of the shorter poems , written when the author was only fourteen .
there is a little dimness in the filling up , but the <name> and symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain .
there is a smack of <unk> about it .
to <name> <name> , thy beauty is to me like those <unk> barks of yore , that gently , o'er a perfumed sea , the weary , <unk> wanderer bore to his own native shore .
on desperate seas long wont to roam , thy <name> hair , thy classic face , thy <unk> airs have brought me home to the <name> that was greece and the grandeur that was rome .
lo !
in <name> brilliant <unk> how <unk> i see thee stand !
the agate lamp within thy hand , ah !
psyche , from the regions which are holy land !
it is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us .
here is no " withering scorn , " no heart " blighted " ere it has safely got into its teens , none of the drawing-room <unk> which <name> had brought into vogue .
all is limpid and serene , with a pleasant dash of the greek <unk> in it .
the <name> of the whole , too , is remarkable .
it is not of that kind which can be demonstrated <unk> upon the tips of the fingers .
it is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone can estimate .
it seems simple , like a greek column , because of its perfection .
in a poem named " ligeia , " under which title he intended to <unk> the music of nature , our <unk> gives us the following exquisite picture : ligeia !
ligeia !
my beautiful one , whose <unk> idea <name> to <name> run , say , is it thy <name> , on the breezes to toss , or , capriciously still , like the lone albatross , incumbent on night , as she on the air , to keep watch with delight on the <name> there ?
<name> <name> , himself a man of genius , and whose lyre has been too long capriciously silent , appreciated the high merit of these and similar passages , and <name> a proud horoscope for their author .
mr. poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call genius .
no man could ever tell us precisely what it is , and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power .
let talent writhe and <unk> itself as it may , it has no such magnetism .
larger of bone and sinew it may be , but the wings are wanting .
talent sticks fast to earth , and its most perfect works have still one foot of <name> .
genius claims kindred with the very workings of nature herself , so that a sunset shall seem like a quotation from <name> , and if shakespeare be read in the very presence of the sea itself , his verses shall but seem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean .
talent may make friends for itself , but only genius can give to its creations the divine power of winning love and veneration .
enthusiasm can not cling to what itself is <unk> , nor <name> he ever have disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a disciple .
great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon , while talent keeps him , as <unk> did , securely <unk> in the pommel of his sword .
to the eye of genius , the veil of the spiritual world is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and evil who throng continually around it .
no man of mere talent ever flung his inkstand at the devil .
when we say that mr. poe had genius , we do not mean to say that he has produced evidence of the highest .
but to say that he possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal , industry , and a reverence for the trust reposed in him , to achieve the proudest triumphs and the <unk> laurels .
if we may believe the <unk> ; and <unk> of our newspapers , we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them at all desirable , whether for its hardness of attainment or its seclusion .
the highest peak of our <unk> is , according to these gentlemen , by far the most thickly settled portion of the country , a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable residence for individuals of a poetical temperament , if love of solitude be , as immemorial tradition asserts , a necessary part of their <unk> .
mr. poe has two of the prime qualities of genius , a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis , and a wonderful <unk> of imagination .
the first of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words , as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone .
this enables him to conceive truly , to maintain a proper relation of parts , and to draw a correct outline , while the second groups , fills up and colors .
both of these mr. poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose works , the last <unk> in his earlier tales , and the first in his later ones .
in judging of the merit of an author , and assigning him his niche among our household gods , we have a right to regard him from our own point of view , and to measure him by our own standard .
but , in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works , we must be governed by his own design , and placing them by the side of his own ideal , find how much is wanting .
we differ from mr. poe in his opinions of the objects of <name> .
he <unk> that object to be the creation of beauty , and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we disagree with him .
but in what we shall say of his writings , we shall take his own standard as our guide .
the <name> of the god of song is equally accessible from every side , and there is room enough in it for all who bring offerings , or seek in oracle .
in his tales , mr. poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable into the weird confines of superstition and unreality .
he combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united ; a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery , and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed .
both are , in truth , the natural results of the <unk> quality of his mind , to which we have before alluded , analysis .
it is this which distinguishes the artist .
his mind at once reaches forward to the effect to be produced .
having resolved to bring about certain emotions in the reader , he makes all subordinate parts tend strictly to the common centre .
even his mystery is mathematical to his own mind .
to him x is a known quantity all along .
in any picture that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his colors .
however vague some of his figures may seem , however formless the shadows , to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram .
for this reason mr. poe has no sympathy with <unk> .
the mystic dwells in the mystery , is enveloped with it ; it colors all his thoughts ; it affects his optic nerve especially , and the commonest things get a rainbow edging from it .
mr. poe , on the other hand , is a spectator ab extra .
he <unk> , he <unk> , he watches " with an eye serene , the very pulse of the machine , " for such it practically is to him , with wheels and <unk> and <unk> , all working to produce a certain end .
this analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical , and by giving him the <name> to be minute , enables him to throw a wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies .
a <unk> he paints with great power .
he loves to <unk> one of these <unk> of the mind , and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its roots .
in raising images of horror , also , he has strange success , conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible doubt which is the secret of all horror .
he leaves to imagination the task of finishing the picture , a task to which only she is competent .
" for much imaginary work was there ; conceit deceitful , so compact , so kind , that for achilles ' image stood his spear grasped in an armed hand ; himself behind was left unseen , save to the eye of mind . "
besides the merit of <name> , mr. poe 's writings have also that of form .
his style is highly finished , graceful and truly classical .
it would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers .
as an example of his style we would refer to one of his tales , " the house of usher , " in the first volume of his " tales of the grotesque and <unk> . "
it has a singular charm for us , and we think that no one could read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty .
had its author written nothing else , it would alone have been enough to stamp him as a man of genius , and the master of a classic style .
in this tale occurs , perhaps , the most beautiful of his poems .
the great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and the unreal as sources of effect .
they have not used dread and horror alone , but only in combination with other qualities , as means of <unk> the fancies of their readers .
the loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about her .
mr. poe 's secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror .
in this his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of <name> , not artifice .
we can not call his materials the noblest or purest , but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction .
as a critic , mr. poe was <unk> deficient .
unerring in his analysis of <unk> , metres and plots , he seemed wanting in the faculty of perceiving the <unk> ethics of <name> .
his criticisms are , however , distinguished for scientific precision and <unk> of logic .
they have the exactness , and at the same time , the coldness of mathematical demonstrations .
yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague <unk> and sharp personalities of the day .
if deficient in warmth , they are also without the heat of <unk> .
they are especially valuable as illustrating the great truth , too generally overlooked , that <unk> power is a subordinate quality of the critic .
on the whole , it may be considered certain that mr. poe has attained an individual eminence in our literature which he <name> keep .
he has given proof of power and originality .
he has done that which could only be done once with success or safety , and the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness .
death of <name> a. poe by n. p. <name> the ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body , equally powerful and having the complete mastery by <unk> one man , that is to say , inhabited by both a devil and an <name> seems to have been realized , if all we hear is true , in the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written above .
our own impression of the nature of <name> a. poe , differs in some important degree , however , from that which has been generally conveyed in the notices of his death .
let us , before telling what we personally know of him , copy a graphic and highly finished <unk> , from the pen of dr. <name> w. griswold , which appeared in a recent number of the " tribune " : " <name> <name> poe is dead .
he died in baltimore on <name> , october 7th .
this announcement <name> startle many , but few <name> be grieved by it .
the poet was known , personally or by reputation , in all this country ; he had readers in england and in several of the states of continental europe ; but he had few or no friends ; and the regrets for his death <name> be suggested principally by the consideration that in him literary <name> has lost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars .
" his conversation was at times almost <unk> in its eloquence .
his voice was <unk> with astonishing skill , and his large and <unk> expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who listened , while his own face glowed , or was <unk> in pallor , as his imagination quickened his blood or <name> it back frozen to his heart .
his imagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of genius .
suddenly starting from a proposition , exactly and sharply defined , in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness , he rejected the forms of customary logic , and by a crystalline process of <unk> , built up his <unk> demonstrations in forms of <unk> and <unk> grandeur , or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty , so minutely and distinctly , yet so rapidly , that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations , till he himself dissolved the spell , and brought his hearers back to common and base existence , by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the <unk> passion .
" he was at all times a <unk> in ideal <unk> heaven or <unk> with the creatures and the accidents of his <name> .
he <unk> streets , in madness or melancholy , with lips moving in indistinct curses , or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer ( never for himself , for he felt , or professed to feel , that he was already damned , but ) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry ; or with his glances <unk> to a heart gnawed with anguish , and with a face shrouded in gloom , he would brave the wildest storms , and all night , with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains , would speak as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by him from the aidenn , close by whose <unk> his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his constitution subjected him  close by the aidenn where were those he <unk> aidenn which he might never see , but in fitful glimpses , as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more happy natures whose <name> to sin did not involve the doom of death .
" he seemed , except when some fitful pursuit <unk> his <name> and engrossed his faculties , always to bear the memory of some controlling sorrow .
the remarkable poem of 'the <name> ' was probably much more nearly than has been supposed , even by those who were very intimate with him , a reflection and an <name> of his own history .
he was that <unk> " <unk> master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of <unk> more . '
" every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his works , whatever their design , traces of his personal character : elements of his immortal being , in which the individual <unk> the person .
while we read the pages of the <unk> of the house of usher , ' or of <unk> revelations , ' we see in the solemn and stately gloom which <unk> one , and in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both , indications of the <unk> of what was most remarkable and peculiar in the <unk> intellectual nature .
but we see here only the better phases of his nature , only the symbols of his <unk> action , for his harsh experience had deprived him of all <name> in man or woman .
he had made up his mind upon the numberless <unk> of the social world , and the whole system with him was an imposture .
this conviction gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally <unk> character .
still , though he regarded society as composed altogether of villains , the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with <unk> , while it continually caused him by <unk> to fail of the success of honesty .
he was in many respects like <name> <name> in <unk> 's novel of 'the <unk> . '
passion , in him , comprehended  many of the worst emotions which <unk> against human happiness .
you could not contradict him , but you raised quick <unk> ; you could not speak of wealth , but his cheek paled with gnawing envy .
the astonishing natural advantages of this poor boy  his beauty , his readiness , the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery atmosphere  had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into prejudices against him .
<unk> , envious  bad enough , but not the worst , for these salient angles were all varnished over with a cold , <unk> <unk> , his passions <unk> themselves in <unk> .
there seemed to him no moral susceptibility ; and , what was more remarkable in a proud nature , little or nothing of the true point of honor .
he had , to a morbid excess , that , <name> to rise which is <unk> called ambition , but no wish for the esteem or the love of his species ; only the hard wish to <unk> shine , not serve  succeed , that he might have the right to despise a world which galled his <unk> .
" we have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon his literature .
it was more conspicuous in his later than in his earlier writings .
nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three <unk> much of his best <unk> in some sense biographical ; in draperies of his imagination , those who had taken the trouble to trace his steps , could perceive , but slightly concealed , the figure of himself . "
apropos of the <unk> portion of the above <unk> sketch , let us truthfully say : some four or five years since , when <unk> a daily paper in this city , mr. poe was employed by us , for several months , as critic and <unk> .
this was our first personal acquaintance with him .
he resided with his wife and mother at fordham , a few miles out of town , but was at his desk in the office , from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to press .
with the highest admiration for his genius , and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
with his pale , beautiful , and intellectual face , as a reminder of what genius was in him , it was impossible , of course , not to treat him always with deferential courtesy , and , to our occasional request that he would not <unk> too deep in a criticism , or that he would <unk> a passage colored too highly with his <unk> against society and mankind , he readily and courteously <unk> more yielding than most men , we thought , on points so <unk> sensitive .
with a prospect of taking the lead in another periodical , he , at last , voluntarily gave up his employment with us , and , through all this considerable period , we had seen but one <unk> of the <unk> quiet , patient , industrious , and most gentlemanly person , commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability .
residing as he did in the country , we never met mr. poe in hours of leisure ; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of business , and we met him often in the <unk> the same sad <unk> , winning and refined gentleman , such as we had always known him .
it was by rumor only , up to the day of his death , that we knew of any other development of manner or character .
we heard , from one who knew him well ( what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities ) , that , with a single glass of wine , his whole nature was reversed , the demon became uppermost , and , though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible , his <name> was palpably insane .
possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity , at such times , and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory , he easily seemed <unk> only another phase of his natural character , and was accused , accordingly , of insulting arrogance and <unk> .
in this reversed character , we repeat , it was never our chance to see him .
we know it from hearsay , and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity of physical constitution ; which puts it upon very nearly the ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity .
the arrogance , vanity , and depravity of heart , of which mr. poe was generally accused , seem to us referable altogether to this reversed phase of his character .
under that degree of intoxication which only acted upon him by <unk> his sense of truth and right , he doubtless said and did much that was wholly <unk> with his better nature ; but , when himself , and as we knew him only , his modesty and unaffected humility , as to his own <unk> , were a constant charm to his character .
his letters , of which the constant application for autographs has taken from us , we are sorry to confess , the greater portion , exhibited this quality very strongly .
in one of the carelessly written notes of which we chance still to retain possession , for instance , he speaks of " the <name> "  that extraordinary poem which electrified the world of imaginative readers , and has become the type of a school of poetry of its <unk> , in evident <name> , attributes its success to the few words of commendation with which we had <unk> it in this <unk>  it <name> throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy of the note : " fordham , <name> 20 , 1849 " my dear <name>  the poem which i <unk> , and which i am so vain as to <name> you <name> like , in some respects , has been just published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to write , now and then .
it pays well as times <unk> unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices ; for whatever i send it i feel i am <unk> to the tomb of the <unk> .
the verses accompanying this , may i beg you to take out of the tomb , and bring them to light in the <unk> journal ? '
if you can oblige me so far as to copy them , i do not think it <name> be necessary to say 'from the   , that would be too bad ; and , perhaps , 'from a late   paper , ' would do .
" i have not forgotten how a 'good word in season ' from you made 'the <name> , ' and made <unk> ' ( which <unk> , people have done me the honor of attributing to you ) , therefore , i would ask you ( if i dared ) to say something of these lines if they please you .
" truly yours ever , " <name> a .
poe . "
in double proof of his <name> disposition to do the best for himself , and of the <unk> and grateful nature which has been denied him , we give another of the only three of his notes which we chance to retain : " fordham , <name> 22 , 1848 .
" my dear mr. <name>  i am about to make an effort at <unk> myself in the literary world , and feel that i may depend upon your aid .
" my general aim is to start a magazine , to be called 'the <unk> , ' but it would be useless to me , even when established , if not entirely out of the control of a publisher .
i mean , therefore , to get up a journal which shall be my own at all points .
with this end in view , i must get a list of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with ; nearly two hundred i have already .
i propose , however , to go south and west , among my personal and literary friends  old college and west point acquaintances  and see what i can do .
in order to get the means of taking the first step , i propose to lecture at the society library , on thursday , the 3d of february , and , that there may be no cause of <unk> , my subject shall not be literary at all .
i have chosen a broad text : 'the universe . '
" having thus given you the facts of the case , i leave all the rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity .
gratefully , most gratefully ,   " your friend always ,   " <name> a. <unk> " brief and <unk> as these letters are , we think they sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to mr. <unk> , willingness to persevere , belief in another 's friendship , and capability of cordial and grateful friendship !
such he assuredly was when sane .
such only he has invariably seemed to us , in all we have happened personally to know of him , through a friendship of five or six years .
and so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known , than what we hear of only , that we remember him but with admiration and respect ; these descriptions of him , when morally insane , seeming to us like portraits , painted in sickness , of a man we have only known in health .
but there is another , more touching , and far more forcible evidence that there was goodness in <name> a. poe .
to reveal it we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which <unk> covers grief and refinement in poverty ; but we think it may be excused , if so we can brighten the memory of the poet , even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his death .
our first knowledge of mr. poe 's removal to this city was by a call which we received from a <name> who introduced herself to us as the mother of his wife .
she was in search of employment for him , and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill , that her daughter was a confirmed invalid , and that their circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself .
the countenance of this <name> , made beautiful and saintly with an evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and sorrowful tenderness , her gentle and mournful voice urging its plea , her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined manners , and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims and abilities of her son , disclosed at once the presence of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be .
it was a hard fate that she was watching over .
mr. poe wrote with fastidious difficulty , and in a style too much above the popular level to be well paid .
he was always in pecuniary difficulty , and , with his sick wife , frequently in want of the merest necessaries of life .
<name> after <name> , for years , the most touching sight to us , in this whole city , has been that tireless minister to genius , thinly and <unk> clad , going from office to office with a poem , or an article on some literary subject , to sell , sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice that he was ill , and begging for him , mentioning nothing but that " he was ill , " whatever might be the reason for his writing nothing , and never , amid all her tears and <unk> of distress , suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a doubt of him , or a complaint , or a lessening of pride in his genius and good intentions .
her daughter died a year and a half since , but she did not desert him .
she continued his <unk> <name>  living with him , caring for him , guarding him against exposure , and when he was carried away by temptation , amid grief and the loneliness of feelings <unk> to , and awoke from his self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering , begging for him still .
if woman 's devotion , born with a first love , and fed with human passion , <unk> its object , as it is allowed to do , what does not a devotion like <unk> , disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible <unk> for him who inspired it ?
we have a letter before us , written by this <name> , mrs. <unk> , on the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring care .
it is merely a request that we would call upon her , but we <name> copy a few of its words  sacred as its privacy is  to warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above , and add force to the appeal we wish to make for her : " i have this morning heard of the death of my darling <name> ... . can you give me any circumstances or particulars ? ...
oh !
do not desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction ! ...
ask mr.   to come , as i must deliver a message to him from my poor <name> ... .
i need not ask you to notice his death and to speak well of him .
i know you <name> .
but say what an affectionate son he was to me , his poor desolate mother ... " to hedge round a grave with respect , what choice is there , between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world , and the story of such a woman 's <unk> devotion !
risking what we do , in delicacy , by making it public , we feel  other reasons aside  that it betters the world to make known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted .
what we have said <name> speak to some hearts .
there are those who <name> be glad to know how the lamp , whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away recognition , was watched over with care and pain , that they may send to her , who is more darkened than they by its extinction , some token of their sympathy .
she is destitute and alone .
if any , far or near , <name> send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder of her life , we <name> joyfully place it in her hands .
the unparalleled adventures of one <name> <unk> ( *1 ) by late accounts from rotterdam , that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement .
indeed , phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected  so entirely novel  so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions  as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all europe is in an uproar , all physics in a ferment , all reason and astronomy together by the ears .
it appears that on the   day of   ( i am not positive about the date ) , a vast crowd of people , for purposes not specifically mentioned , were assembled in the great square of the exchange in the <unk> city of rotterdam .
the day was warm  unusually so for the season  there was hardly a breath of air stirring ; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then <unk> with friendly showers of momentary duration , that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament .
nevertheless , about noon , a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly : the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded ; and , in an instant afterward , ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens , ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths , and a shout , which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of niagara , resounded long , loudly , and furiously , through all the environs of rotterdam .
the origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident .
from behind the huge bulk of one of those <unk> masses of cloud already mentioned , was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space , a queer , heterogeneous , but apparently solid substance , so oddly shaped , so <unk> put together , as not to be in any manner comprehended , and never to be sufficiently admired , by the host of sturdy <unk> who stood open-mouthed below .
what could it be ?
in the name of all the <unk> and devils in rotterdam , what could it possibly portend ?
no one knew , no one could imagine ; no one  not even the burgomaster <unk> <unk> <name> <unk>  had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery ; so , as nothing more reasonable could be done , every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth , and <unk> up his right eye towards the phenomenon , puffed , paused , <unk> about , and grunted significantly  then <unk> back , grunted , paused , and finally  puffed again .
in the meantime , however , lower and still lower toward the goodly city , came the object of so much curiosity , and the cause of so much smoke .
in a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned .
it appeared to be  yes !
it was undoubtedly a species of balloon ; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in rotterdam before .
for who , let me ask , ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers ?
no man in holland certainly ; yet here , under the very noses of the people , or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question , and composed , i have it on the best authority , of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose .
it was an <unk> insult to the good sense of the <unk> of rotterdam .
as to the shape of the phenomenon , it was even still more reprehensible .
being little or nothing better than a huge <unk> turned upside down .
and this <unk> was regarded as by no means lessened when , upon nearer inspection , there was perceived a large <unk> depending from its apex , and , around the upper rim or base of the cone , a circle of little instruments , resembling <unk> , which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of <name> <name> .
but still worse .
suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine , there <name> , by way of car , an enormous drab beaver hat , with a brim <unk> broad , and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle .
it is , however , somewhat remarkable that many citizens of rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before ; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity ; while the <unk> <unk> <unk> , upon sight of it , uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise , and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself .
now this was a circumstance the more to be observed , as <unk> , with three companions , had actually disappeared from rotterdam about five years before , in a very sudden and unaccountable manner , and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever .
to be sure , some bones which were thought to be human , mixed up with a quantity of <unk> rubbish , had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of rotterdam , and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed , and that the sufferers were in all probability <name> <unk> and his associates .
but to return .
the balloon ( for such no doubt it was ) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth , allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant .
this was in truth a very droll little somebody .
he could not have been more than two feet in height ; but this altitude , little as it was , would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium , and tilt him over the edge of his <name> car , but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast , and rigged on to the cords of the balloon .
the body of the little man was more than proportionately broad , giving to his entire figure a <unk> highly absurd .
his feet , of course , could not be seen at all , although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car , or to speak more properly , in the top of the hat .
his hands were enormously large .
his hair was extremely gray , and collected in a cue behind .
his nose was prodigiously long , crooked , and <unk> ; his eyes full , brilliant , and acute ; his <name> and cheeks , although wrinkled with age , were broad , puffy , and double ; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head .
this odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose <unk> of sky-blue satin , with tight breeches to match , fastened with silver buckles at the knees .
his vest was of some bright yellow material ; a white <unk> cap was set <unk> on one side of his head ; and , to complete his equipment , a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat , and fell down , in a dainty manner , upon his bosom , in a fantastic <unk> of <unk> dimensions .
having descended , as i said before , to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth , the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation , and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to <name> <unk> .
throwing out , therefore , a quantity of sand from a canvas bag , which , he lifted with great difficulty , he became stationary in an instant .
he then proceeded , in a hurried and agitated manner , to extract from a <unk> in his <unk> a large morocco pocket-book .
this he poised suspiciously in his hand , then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise , and was evidently astonished at its weight .
he at length opened it , and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red <unk> and tied carefully with red tape , let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster , <unk> <name> <unk> .
his excellency stooped to take it up .
but the <unk> , still greatly <unk> , and having apparently no farther business to detain him in rotterdam , began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure ; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to <unk> , the half dozen bags which he threw out , one after another , without taking the trouble to empty their contents , tumbled , every one of them , most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster , and rolled him over and over no less than <unk> times , in the face of every man in rotterdam .
it is not to be supposed , however , that the great <unk> suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity .
it is said , on the contrary , that during each and every one of his <unk> twenty <unk> he emitted no less than <unk> distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe , to which he held fast the whole time with all his might , and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death .
in the meantime the balloon arose like a lark , and , soaring far away above the city , at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged , and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of rotterdam .
all attention was now directed to the letter , the descent of which , and the consequences attending thereupon , had proved so fatally <unk> of both person and personal dignity to his excellency , the illustrious burgomaster <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> .
that <unk> , however , had not failed , during his <unk> movements , to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question , which was seen , upon inspection , to have fallen into the most proper hands , being actually addressed to himself and professor <unk> , in their official capacities of president and vice-president of the rotterdam college of astronomy .
it was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot , and found to contain the following extraordinary , and indeed very serious , communications .
to their excellencies <name> <unk> and <unk> , president and vice-president of the states ' college of astronomers , in the city of rotterdam .
" your excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble <unk> , by name <name> <unk> , and by occupation a <unk> of bellows , who , with three others , disappeared from rotterdam , about five years ago , in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden , and extremely unaccountable .
if , however , it so please your excellencies , i , the writer of this communication , am the identical <name> <unk> himself .
it is well known to most of my fellow citizens , that for the period of forty years i continued to occupy the little square brick building , at the head of the alley called sauerkraut , in which i resided at the time of my disappearance .
my ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind  they , as well as myself , steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows .
for , to speak the truth , until of late years , that the heads of all the people have been set <unk> with politics , no better business than my own could an honest citizen of rotterdam either <name> or deserve .
credit was good , employment was never wanting , and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will .
but , as i was saying , we soon began to feel the effects of <name> and long speeches , and <unk> , and all that sort of thing .
people who were formerly , the very best customers in the world , had now not a moment of time to think of us at all .
they had , so they said , as much as they could do to read about the revolutions , and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age .
if a fire wanted fanning , it could readily be fanned with a newspaper , and as the government grew weaker , i have no doubt that leather and iron acquired <unk> in proportion , for , in a very short time , there was not a pair of bellows in all rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer .
this was a state of things not to be endured .
i soon grew as poor as a rat , and , having a wife and children to provide for , my burdens at length became intolerable , and i spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life .
duns , in the meantime , left me little leisure for contemplation .
my house was literally besieged from morning till night , so that i began to rave , and foam , and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure .
there were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance , keeping watch continually about my door , and threatening me with the law .
upon these three i internally vowed the bitterest revenge , if ever i should be so happy as to get them within my clutches ; and i believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution , by blowing my brains out with a <unk> .
i thought it best , however , to <unk> my wrath , and to treat them with promises and fair words , until , by some good turn of fate , an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me .
" one day , having given my creditors the slip , and feeling more than usually dejected , i continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever , until at length i chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller 's stall .
seeing a chair close at hand , for the use of customers , i threw myself doggedly into it , and , hardly knowing why , opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach .
it proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on speculative astronomy , written either by professor <unk> of berlin or by a frenchman of somewhat similar name .
i had some little <unk> of information on matters of this nature , and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book , reading it actually through twice before i awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me .
by this time it began to grow dark , and i directed my steps toward home .
but the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind , and , as i sauntered along the dusky streets , i revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer .
there are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner .
the longer i meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me .
the limited nature of my education in general , and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy , so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what i had read , or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence , merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination ; and i was vain enough , or perhaps reasonable enough , to doubt whether those crude ideas which , arising in <unk> minds , have all the appearance , may not often in effect possess all the force , the reality , and other inherent properties , of instinct or intuition ; whether , to proceed a step farther , profundity itself might not , in matters of a purely speculative nature , be detected as a legitimate source of <unk> and error .
in other words , i believed , and still do believe , that truth , is frequently of its own essence , superficial , and that , in many cases , the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her , than in the actual situations wherein she may be found .
nature herself seemed to afford me <unk> of these ideas .
in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that i could not distinguish a <name> with nearly as much precision , when i gazed on it with <name> , direct and <unk> attention , as when i suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone .
i was not , of course , at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the <unk> area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina .
this knowledge , and some of another kind , came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years , during which i have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life , and forgotten the <unk> in far different occupations .
but at the epoch of which i speak , the analogy which a casual observation of a <name> offered to the conclusions i had already drawn , struck me with the force of positive conformation , and i then finally made up my mind to the course which i afterwards pursued .
" it was late when i reached home , and i went immediately to bed .
my mind , however , was too much occupied to sleep , and i lay the whole night buried in meditation .
arising early in the morning , and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors , i repaired eagerly to the bookseller 's stall , and laid out what little ready money i possessed , in the purchase of some volumes of mechanics and practical astronomy .
having arrived at home safely with these , i devoted every spare moment to their perusal , and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as i thought sufficient for the execution of my plan .
in the intervals of this period , i made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance .
in this i finally succeeded  partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a <unk> of their claim , and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which i told them i had in view , and for assistance in which i <unk> their services .
by these means  for they were ignorant men  i found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose .
" matters being thus arranged , i contrived , by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution , to dispose of what property i had remaining , and to borrow , in small sums , under various <unk> , and without paying any attention to my future means of <unk> , no inconsiderable quantity of ready money .
with the means thus <unk> i proceeded to procure at intervals , <unk> muslin , very fine , in pieces of twelve yards each ; twine ; a lot of the varnish of <unk> ; a large and deep basket of <unk> , made to order ; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions .
this i directed my wife to make up as soon as possible , and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding .
in the meantime i worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions ; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords ; bought a <unk> , a compass , a spy-glass , a common barometer with some important modifications , and two astronomical instruments not so generally known .
i then took opportunities of conveying by night , to a retired situation east of rotterdam , five <unk> casks , to contain about fifty gallons each , and one of a larger size ; six tinned ware tubes , three inches in diameter , properly shaped , and ten feet in length ; a quantity of a particular metallic substance , or <unk> , which i shall not name , and a dozen <unk> of a very common acid .
the gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself  or at least never applied to any similar purpose .
the secret i would make no difficulty in disclosing , but that it of right belongs to a citizen of <unk> , in <name> , by whom it was <unk> communicated to myself .
the same individual submitted to me , without being at all aware of my intentions , a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal , through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility .
i found it , however , altogether too expensive , and was not sure , upon the whole , whether <unk> muslin with a coating of gum <unk> , was not equally as good .
i mention this circumstance , because i think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material i have spoken of , and i do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention .
" on the spot which i intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon , i privately dug a hole two feet deep ; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter .
in the centre of this circle , being the station designed for the large cask , i also dug a hole three feet in depth .
in each of the five smaller holes , i deposited a <unk> containing fifty pounds , and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds , of cannon powder .
these  the keg and <unk>  i connected in a proper manner with covered trains ; and having let into one of the <unk> the end of about four feet of slow match , i covered up the hole , and placed the cask over it , leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch , and barely visible beyond the cask .
i then filled up the remaining holes , and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation .
" besides the articles above enumerated , i conveyed to the depot , and there secreted , one of m. <unk> 's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air .
i found this machine , however , to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which i intended making it applicable .
but , with severe labor and <unk> perseverance , i at length met with entire success in all my preparations .
my balloon was soon completed .
it would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas ; would take me up easily , i calculated , with all my implements , and , if i managed rightly , with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain .
it had received three coats of varnish , and i found the <unk> muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself , quite as strong and a good deal less expensive .
" everything being now ready , i exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller 's stall ; and promising , on my part , to return as soon as circumstances would permit , i gave her what little money i had left , and bade her farewell .
indeed i had no fear on her account .
she was what people call a notable woman , and could manage matters in the world without my assistance .
i believe , to tell the truth , she always looked upon me as an idle boy , a mere <unk> , good for nothing but building castles in the air , and was rather glad to get rid of me .
it was a dark night when i bade her good-bye , and taking with me , as <unk> , the three creditors who had given me so much trouble , we carried the balloon , with the car and accoutrements , by a roundabout way , to the station where the other articles were deposited .
we there found them all unmolested , and i proceeded immediately to business .
" it was the first of <name> .
the night , as i said before , was dark ; there was not a <name> to be seen ; and a <unk> rain , falling at intervals , rendered us very uncomfortable .
but my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon , which , in spite of the varnish with which it was defended , began to grow rather heavy with the moisture ; the powder also was liable to damage .
i therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence , pounding down ice around the central cask , and stirring the acid in the others .
they did not cease , however , <unk> me with questions as to what i intended to do with all this apparatus , and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor i made them undergo .
they could not perceive , so they said , what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin , merely to take a part in such horrible incantations .
i began to get uneasy , and worked away with all my might , for i verily believe the idiots supposed that i had entered into a compact with the devil , and that , in short , what i was now doing was nothing better than it should be .
i was , therefore , in great fear of their leaving me altogether .
i contrived , however , to <unk> them by promises of payment of all scores in full , as soon as i could bring the present business to a termination .
to these speeches they gave , of course , their own interpretation ; <unk> , no doubt , that at all events i should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money ; and provided i paid them all i owed , and a trifle more , in consideration of their services , i dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass .
" in about four hours and a half i found the balloon sufficiently inflated .
i attached the car , therefore , and put all my implements in it  not forgetting the condensing apparatus , a copious supply of water , and a large quantity of provisions , such as <unk> , in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk .
i also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat .
it was now nearly daybreak , and i thought it high time to take my departure .
dropping a lighted cigar on the ground , as if by accident , i took the opportunity , in stooping to pick it up , of <unk> privately the piece of slow match , whose end , as i said before , protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks .
this manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns ; and , jumping into the car , i immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth , and was pleased to find that i shot upward , carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast , and able to have carried up as many more .
" scarcely , however , had i attained the height of fifty yards , when , roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner , came so dense a hurricane of fire , and smoke , and sulphur , and legs and arms , and gravel , and burning wood , and blazing metal , that my very heart sunk within me , and i fell down in the bottom of the car , trembling with unmitigated terror .
indeed , i now perceived that i had entirely overdone the business , and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced .
accordingly , in less than a second , i felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples , and immediately thereupon , a concussion , which i shall never forget , burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder .
when i afterward had time for reflection , i did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion , as regarded myself , to its proper cause  my situation directly above it , and in the line of its greatest power .
but at the time , i thought only of preserving my life .
the balloon at first collapsed , then furiously expanded , then whirled round and round with horrible velocity , and finally , reeling and staggering like a drunken man , hurled me with great force over the rim of the car , and left me dangling , at a terrific height , with my head downward , and my face outwards , by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length , which <name> accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the <unk> , and in which , as i fell , my left foot became most <unk> entangled .
it is impossible  utterly impossible  to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation .
i gasped convulsively for breath  a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame  i felt my eyes starting from their sockets  a horrible nausea overwhelmed me  and at length i fainted away .
" how long i remained in this state it is impossible to say .
it must , however , have been no inconsiderable time , for when i partially recovered the sense of existence , i found the day breaking , the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean , and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon .
my sensations , however , upon thus recovering , were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated .
indeed , there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which i began to take of my situation .
i <name> up to my eyes each of my hands , one after the other , and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins , and the horrible blackness of the <unk> .
i afterward carefully examined my head , shaking it repeatedly , and feeling it with minute attention , until i succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not , as i had more than half suspected , larger than my balloon .
then , in a knowing manner , i felt in both my breeches pockets , and , missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case , endeavored to account for their disappearance , and not being able to do so , felt inexpressibly chagrined .
it now occurred to me that i suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle , and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind .
but , strange to say !
i was neither astonished nor <unk> .
if i felt any emotion at all , it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness i was about to display in <unk> myself from this dilemma ; and i never , for a moment , looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt .
for a few minutes i remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation .
i have a distinct recollection of frequently <unk> my lips , putting my forefinger to the side of my nose , and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who , at ease in their <unk> , meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance .
having , as i thought , sufficiently collected my ideas , i now , with great caution and deliberation , put my hands behind my back , and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the <unk> of my <unk> .
this buckle had three teeth , which , being somewhat <name> , turned with great difficulty on their axis .
i brought them , however , after some trouble , at right angles to the body of the buckle , and was glad to find them remain firm in that position .
holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth , i now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat .
i had to rest several times before i could accomplish this manoeuvre , but it was at length accomplished .
to one end of the cravat i then made fast the buckle , and the other end i tied , for greater security , tightly around my wrist .
drawing now my body upwards , with a prodigious exertion of muscular force , i succeeded , at the very first trial , in throwing the buckle over the car , and <unk> it , as i had anticipated , in the circular rim of the <unk> .
" my body was now inclined towards the side of the car , at an <name> of about forty-five degrees ; but it must not be understood that i was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular .
so far from it , i still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon ; for the change of situation which i had acquired , had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position , which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril .
it should be remembered , however , that when i fell in the first instance , from the car , if i had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon , instead of turned outwardly from it , as it actually was ; or if , in the second place , the cord by which i was suspended had chanced to <name> over the upper edge , instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car ,  i say it may be readily conceived that , in either of these supposed cases , i should have been unable to accomplish even as much as i had now accomplished , and the wonderful adventures of <name> <unk> would have been utterly lost to posterity , i had therefore every reason to be grateful ; although , in point of fact , i was still too stupid to be anything at all , and <name> for , perhaps , a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner , without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever , and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment .
but this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away , and <unk> succeeded horror , and dismay , and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin .
in fact , the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat , and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium , had now begun to retire within their proper channels , and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger , merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it .
but this weakness was , luckily for me , of no very long duration .
in good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair , and , with frantic cries and struggles , i jerked my way bodily upwards , till at length , clutching with a <unk> grip the <unk> rim , i writhed my person over it , and fell headlong and shuddering within the car .
" it was not until some time afterward that i recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon .
i then , however , examined it with attention , and found it , to my great relief , uninjured .
my implements were all safe , and , fortunately , i had lost neither ballast nor provisions .
indeed , i had so well secured them in their places , that such an accident was entirely out of the question .
looking at my watch , i found it six o'clock .
i was still rapidly ascending , and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and <unk> miles .
immediately beneath me in the ocean , lay a small black object , slightly oblong in shape , seemingly about the size , and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a <unk> .
bringing my telescope to bear upon it , i plainly discerned it to be a british ninety <unk> ship , <unk> , and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the <unk> .
besides this ship , i saw nothing but the ocean and the sky , and the sun , which had long arisen .
" it is now high time that i should explain to your excellencies the object of my perilous voyage .
your excellencies <name> bear in mind that distressed circumstances in rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide .
it was not , however , that to life itself i had any , positive disgust , but that i was harassed beyond endurance by the <unk> miseries attending my situation .
in this state of mind , wishing to live , yet wearied with life , the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination .
i then finally made up my mind .
i determined to depart , yet live  to leave the world , yet continue to exist  in short , to drop <unk> , i resolved , let what would ensue , to force a passage , if i could , to the moon .
now , lest i should be supposed more of a madman than i actually am , i <name> detail , as well as i am able , the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature , although without doubt difficult , and <unk> full of danger , was not absolutely , to a bold spirit , beyond the confines of the possible .
" the moon 's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to .
now , the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is <unk> of the earth 's equatorial radii , or only about <unk> miles .
i say the mean or average interval .
but it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon 's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than <unk> of the <name> <unk> of the ellipse itself , and the earth 's centre being situated in its focus , if i could , in any manner , contrive to meet the moon , as it were , in its <unk> , the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished .
but , to say nothing at present of this possibility , it was very certain that , at all events , from the <unk> miles i would have to <unk> the radius of the earth , say 4,000 , and the radius of the moon , say <unk> , in all <unk> , leaving an actual interval to be traversed , under average circumstances , of <unk> miles .
now this , i reflected , was no very extraordinary distance .
travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour , and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated .
but even at this velocity , it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon .
there were , however , many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour , and , as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind , i <name> mention them more fully hereafter .
" the next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance .
from indications afforded by the barometer , we find that , in <unk> from the surface of the earth we have , at the height of 1,000 feet , left below us about <unk> of the entire mass of atmospheric air , that at <unk> we have ascended through nearly one-third ; and that at <unk> , which is not far from the elevation of <unk> , we have surmounted one-half the material , or , at all events , one-half the <unk> , body of air incumbent upon our globe .
it is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth 's diameter  that is , not exceeding eighty miles  the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained , and , moreover , that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence .
but i did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air , and the mechanical laws regulating its <unk> and compression , in what may be called , comparatively speaking , the immediate vicinity of the earth itself ; and , at the same time , it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface .
now , all such reasoning and from such data must , of course , be simply analogical .
the greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet , attained in the <unk> expedition of messieurs <unk> and <unk> .
this is a moderate altitude , even when compared with the eighty miles in question ; and i could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation .
" but , in point of fact , an ascension being made to any given altitude , the <unk> quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended ( as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before ) , but in a ratio constantly decreasing .
it is therefore evident that , ascend as high as we may , we can not , literally speaking , arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found .
it must exist , i argued ; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction .
" on the other hand , i was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere , beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever .
but a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me , although no positive refutation of their creed , still a point worthy very serious investigation .
on comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of <unk> 's comet at its <unk> , after giving credit , in the most exact manner , for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets , it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing ; that is to say , the <name> axis of the <unk> ellipse is growing shorter , in a slow but perfectly regular decrease .
now , this is precisely what ought to be the case , if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit .
for it is evident that such a medium must , in retarding the comet 's velocity , increase its centripetal , by weakening its centrifugal force .
in other words , the sun 's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power , and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution .
indeed , there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question .
but again .
the real diameter of the same comet 's <unk> is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun , and <unk> with equal rapidity in its departure towards its <unk> .
was i not justifiable in supposing with m. <unk> , that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium i have spoken of before , and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity ?
the <unk> phenomenon , also called the <unk> light , was a matter worthy of attention .
this radiance , so apparent in the tropics , and which can not be mistaken for any <unk> lustre , extends from the horizon obliquely upward , and follows generally the direction of the sun 's equator .
it appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward , beyond the orbit of <name> at least , and i believed indefinitely farther .
( <unk> ) indeed , this medium i could not suppose confined to the path of the comet 's ellipse , or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun .
it was easy , on the contrary , to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our <unk> system , condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves , and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations , so to speak , purely geological .
" having adopted this view of the subject , i had little further hesitation .
granting that on my passage i should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth , i conceived that , by means of the very ingenious apparatus of m. <unk> , i should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration .
this would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon .
i had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended , and confidently looked forward to its successful application , if i could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period .
this brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel .
" it is true that balloons , in the first stage of their <unk> from the earth , are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate .
now , the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air ; and , at first sight , it does not appear probable that , as the balloon acquires altitude , and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of <unk> rapidly diminishing  i say , it does not appear at all reasonable that , in this its progress upwards , the original velocity should be accelerated .
on the other hand , i was not aware that , in any recorded ascension , a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent ; although such should have been the case , if on account of nothing else , on account of the escape of gas through balloons <unk> , and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish .
it seemed , therefore , that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to <unk> the effect of some <unk> power .
i now considered that , provided in my passage i found the medium i had imagined , and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we <unk> atmospheric air , it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction i should discover it  that is to say , in regard to my power of ascending  for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar ( in proportion to the occurrence of which , i could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion ) , but , being what it was , would , at all events , continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen .
in the meantime , the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing , in proportion to the squares of the distances , and thus , with a velocity prodigiously <unk> , i should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the <unk> attraction would be superseded by that of the moon .
in accordance with these ideas , i did not think it worth while to <unk> myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days .
" there was still , however , another difficulty , which occasioned me some little <unk> .
it has been observed , that , in balloon <unk> to any considerable height , besides the pain attending respiration , great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body , often accompanied with bleeding at the nose , and other symptoms of an alarming kind , and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained .
( <unk> ) this was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling .
was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely , or at least until terminated by death itself ?
i finally thought not .
their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body , and consequent <unk> of the superficial blood-vessels  not in any positive <unk> of the animal system , as in the case of difficulty in breathing , where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due <unk> of blood in a <unk> of the heart .
unless for default of this <unk> , i could see no reason , therefore , why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum ; for the expansion and compression of chest , commonly called breathing , is action purely muscular , and the cause , not the effect , of respiration .
in a word , i conceived that , as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure , the sensations of pain would gradually diminish  and to endure them while they continued , i relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution .
" thus , may it please your excellencies , i have detailed some , though by no means all , the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage .
i shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in <name> , and , at all events , so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind .
" having attained the altitude before mentioned , that is to say three miles and three-quarters , i threw out from the car a quantity of feathers , and found that i still ascended with sufficient rapidity ; there was , therefore , no necessity for discharging any ballast .
i was glad of this , for i wished to retain with me as much weight as i could <name> , for reasons which <name> be explained in the sequel .
i as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience , breathing with great freedom , and feeling no pain whatever in the head .
the cat was lying very demurely upon my coat , which i had taken off , and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance .
these latter being tied by the leg , to prevent their escape , were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car .
" at twenty minutes past six o'clock , the barometer showed an elevation of <unk> feet , or five miles to a fraction .
the prospect seemed unbounded .
indeed , it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry , what a great extent of the earth 's area i beheld .
the convex surface of any segment of a sphere is , to the entire surface of the sphere itself , as the versed <unk> of the segment to the diameter of the sphere .
now , in my case , the versed <unk>  that is to say , the thickness of the segment beneath me  was about equal to my elevation , or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface .
'as five miles , then , to eight thousand , ' would express the proportion of the earth 's area seen by me .
in other words , i beheld as much as a <unk> part of the whole surface of the globe .
the sea appeared unruffled as a mirror , although , by means of the spy-glass , i could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation .
the ship was no longer visible , having drifted away , apparently to the eastward .
i now began to experience , at intervals , severe pain in the head , especially about the ears  still , however , breathing with tolerable freedom .
the cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever .
" at twenty minutes before seven , the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud , which put me to great trouble , by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin .
this was , to be sure , a singular <unk> , for i had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation .
i thought it best , however , to throw out two <unk> pieces of ballast , reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds .
upon so doing , i soon rose above the difficulty , and perceived immediately , that i had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent .
in a few seconds after my leaving the cloud , a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other , and caused it to kindle up , throughout its vast extent , like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal .
this , it must be remembered , was in the broad light of day .
no fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night .
hell itself might have been found a fitting image .
even as it was , my hair stood on end , while i gazed afar down within the yawning abysses , letting imagination descend , as it were , and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls , and ruddy <unk> , and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire .
i had indeed made a narrow escape .
had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud  that is to say  had not the inconvenience of getting wet , determined me to discharge the ballast , inevitable ruin would have been the consequence .
such perils , although little considered , are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons .
i had by this time , however , attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head .
" i was now rising rapidly , and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half .
i began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath .
my head , too , was excessively painful ; and , having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks , i at length discovered it to be blood , which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears .
my eyes , also , gave me great uneasiness .
upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree ; and all objects in the car , and even the balloon itself , appeared distorted to my vision .
these symptoms were more than i had expected , and occasioned me some alarm .
at this juncture , very <unk> , and without consideration , i threw out from the car three <unk> pieces of ballast .
the accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained , carried me too rapidly , and without sufficient gradation , into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere , and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself .
i was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes , and even when this , in a measure , ceased , i could catch my breath only at long intervals , and in a gasping manner  bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears , and even slightly at the eyes .
the pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme , and struggled to escape ; while the cat <unk> piteously , and , with her tongue hanging out of her mouth , staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison .
i now too late discovered the great rashness of which i had been guilty in discharging the ballast , and my agitation was excessive .
i anticipated nothing less than death , and death in a few minutes .
the physical suffering i underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life .
i had , indeed , little power of reflection left , and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase .
thus i found that my senses would shortly give way altogether , and i had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent , when the recollection of the trick i had played the three creditors , and the possible consequences to myself , should i return , operated to <unk> me for the moment .
i lay down in the bottom of the car , and endeavored to collect my faculties .
in this i so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood .
having no <unk> , however , i was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner i was able , and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm , with the blade of my penknife .
the blood had hardly commenced flowing when i experienced a sensible relief , and by the time i had lost about half a moderate basin full , most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely .
i nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately ; but , having tied up my arm as well as i could , i lay still for about a quarter of an hour .
at the end of this time i arose , and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than i had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension .
the difficulty of breathing , however , was diminished in a very slight degree , and i found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser .
in the meantime , looking toward the cat , who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat , i discovered to my infinite surprise , that she had taken the opportunity of my <unk> to bring into light a litter of three little kittens .
this was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected ; but i was pleased at the occurrence .
it would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise , which , more than anything else , had influenced me in attempting this ascension .
i had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause , or nearly so , of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface .
should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother , i must consider my theory in fault , but a failure to do so i should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea .
" by eight o'clock i had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth .
thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase , but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had i not discharged the ballast which i did .
the pains in my head and ears returned , at intervals , with violence , and i still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose ; but , upon the whole , i suffered much less than might have been expected .
i breathed , however , at every moment , with more and more difficulty , and each <unk> was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest .
i now unpacked the condensing apparatus , and got it ready for immediate use .
" the view of the earth , at this period of my ascension , was beautiful indeed .
to the westward , the northward , and the southward , as far as i could see , lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean , which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of <unk> .
at a vast distance to the eastward , although perfectly discernible , extended the islands of great britain , the entire atlantic coasts of <name> and spain , with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of africa .
of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered , and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth .
from the rock of gibraltar , now dwindled into a dim speck , the dark mediterranean sea , dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars , spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended , until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon , and i found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract .
overhead , the sky was of a <unk> black , and the stars were brilliantly visible .
" the pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering , i determined upon giving them their <name> .
i first untied one of them , a beautiful <unk> pigeon , and placed him upon the rim of the <unk> .
he appeared extremely uneasy , looking anxiously around him , fluttering his wings , and making a loud cooing noise , but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car .
i took him up at last , and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon .
he made , however , no attempt to descend as i had expected , but struggled with great vehemence to get back , uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries .
he at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim , but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast , and he fell dead within the car .
the other one did not prove so unfortunate .
to prevent his following the example of his companion , and accomplishing a return , i threw him downward with all my force , and was pleased to find him continue his descent , with great velocity , making use of his wings with ease , and in a perfectly natural manner .
in a very short time he was out of sight , and i have no doubt he reached home in safety .
puss , who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness , now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction .
her kittens were quite lively , and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever .
" at a <unk> eight , being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain , i proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser .
this apparatus <name> require some little explanation , and your excellencies <name> please to bear in mind that my object , in the first place , was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which i was existing , with the intention of introducing within this barricade , by means of my condenser , a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration .
with this object in view i had prepared a very strong perfectly <unk> , but flexible <unk> bag .
in this bag , which was of sufficient dimensions , the entire car was in a manner placed .
that is to say , it ( the bag ) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car , up its sides , and so on , along the outside of the ropes , to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached .
having pulled the bag up in this way , and formed a complete enclosure on all sides , and at bottom , it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth , by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work  in other words , between the net-work and the hoop .
but if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage , what was to sustain the car in the meantime ?
now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop , but attached by a series of running loops or <unk> .
i therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time , leaving the car suspended by the remainder .
having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag , i <unk> the loops  not to the hoop , for that would have been impossible , since the cloth now intervened  but to a series of large buttons , affixed to the cloth itself , about three feet below the mouth of the bag , the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops .
this done , a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim , a farther portion of the cloth introduced , and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons .
in this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop .
it is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car , while the whole weight of the car itself , with all its contents , would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons .
this , at first sight , would seem an inadequate dependence ; but it was by no means so , for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves , but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them .
indeed , had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were , i should not have been at all uneasy .
i now raised up the hoop again within the covering of <unk> , and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion .
this was done , of course , to keep the bag distended at the top , and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation .
all that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure ; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together , and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary <unk> .
" in the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car , had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass , through which i could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction .
in that portion of the cloth forming the bottom , was likewise , a fourth window , of the same kind , and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself .
this enabled me to see perpendicularly down , but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead , on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there , and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth , i could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith .
this , of course , was a matter of little consequence ; for had i even been able to place a window at top , the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it .
" about a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening , eight inches in diameter , and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw .
in this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser , the body of the machine being , of course , within the chamber of <unk> .
through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere <unk> being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine , was thence discharged , in a state of condensation , to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber .
this operation being repeated several times , at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration .
but in so confined a space it would , in a short time , necessarily become foul , and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs .
it was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car  the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below .
to avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber , this purification was never accomplished all at once , but in a gradual manner  the valve being opened only for a few seconds , then closed again , until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected .
for the sake of experiment i had put the cat and kittens in a small basket , and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom , close by the valve , through which i could feed them at any moment when necessary .
i did this at some little risk , and before closing the mouth of the chamber , by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached .
" by the time i had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained , it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock .
during the whole period of my being thus employed , i endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration , and bitterly did i repent the negligence or rather <unk> , of which i had been guilty , of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance .
but having at length accomplished it , i soon began to reap the benefit of my invention .
once again i breathed with perfect freedom and ease  and indeed why should i not ?
i was also <unk> surprised to find myself , in a great measure , relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me .
a slight headache , accompanied with a sensation of fulness or <unk> about the wrists , the ankles , and the throat , was nearly all of which i had now to complain .
thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off , as i had expected , and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration .
" at twenty minutes before nine o'clock  that is to say , a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber , the mercury attained its limit , or ran down , in the barometer , which , as i mentioned before , was one of an extended construction .
it then indicated an altitude on my part of <unk> feet , or five-and-twenty miles , and i consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth 's area amounting to no less than the three <unk> part of its entire <unk> .
at nine o'clock i had again lost sight of land to the eastward , but not before i became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the n. n. w. the <unk> of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed , although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro .
i observed now that even the lightest <unk> never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea .
" at half past nine i tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve .
they did not float as i had expected ; but dropped down perpendicularly , like a bullet , en <unk> , and with the greatest velocity  being out of sight in a very few seconds .
i did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon ; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had , of a sudden , met with so prodigious an <unk> .
but it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers ; that they actually fell , as they appeared to do , with great rapidity ; and that i had been surprised by the united <unk> of their descent and my own elevation .
" by ten o'clock i found that i had very little to occupy my immediate attention .
affairs went <unk> , and i believed the balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently although i had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase .
i suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind , and enjoyed better spirits than i had at any period since my departure from rotterdam , <unk> myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus , and now in <unk> the atmosphere within the chamber .
this latter point i determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes , more on account of the preservation of my health , than from so frequent a <unk> being absolutely necessary .
in the meanwhile i could not help making anticipations .
fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon .
imagination , feeling herself for once <unk> , roamed at <name> among the <unk> wonders of a shadowy and unstable land .
now there were hoary and <unk> forests , and <unk> precipices , and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom .
then i came suddenly into still noonday solitudes , where no wind of heaven ever intruded , and where vast meadows of poppies , and slender , <unk> flowers spread themselves out a weary distance , all silent and motionless forever .
then again i journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake , with a boundary line of clouds .
and out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees , like a wilderness of dreams .
and i have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell , but sunk slowly and steadily down , and commingled with the waves , while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out , and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed .
" this then , " i said thoughtfully , " is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age , and more melancholy as the hours run on . "
but fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my <name> .
horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently <unk> themselves upon my mind , and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility .
yet i would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations , rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention .
" at five o'clock , p.m. , being engaged in <unk> the atmosphere within the chamber , i took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve .
the cat herself appeared to suffer again very much , and i had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing ; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely .
i had expected , of course , to see them betray a sense of pain , although in a less degree than their mother , and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure .
but i was not prepared to find them , upon close examination , evidently enjoying a high degree of health , breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity , and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever .
i could only account for all this by extending my theory , and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be , as i had taken for granted , chemically insufficient for the purposes of life , and that a person born in such a medium might , possibly , be unaware of any inconvenience attending its <unk> , while , upon removal to the denser strata near the earth , he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those i had so lately experienced .
it has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident , at this time , occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats , and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded .
in passing my hand through the valve , with a cup of water for the old puss , the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket , and thus , in a moment , loosened it from the bottom .
had the whole actually vanished into air , it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner .
positively , there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the <unk> of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained .
my good wishes followed it to the earth , but of course , i had no <name> that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune .
" at six o'clock , i perceived a great portion of the earth 's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow , which continued to advance with great rapidity , until , at five minutes before seven , the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night .
it was not , however , until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to <unk> the balloon ; and this circumstance , although of course fully anticipated , did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure .
it was evident that , in the morning , i should behold the rising <unk> many hours at least before the citizens of rotterdam , in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward , and thus , day after day , in proportion to the height ascended , would i enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period .
i now determined to keep a journal of my passage , reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously , without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness .
" at ten o'clock , feeling sleepy , i determined to lie down for the rest of the night ; but here a difficulty presented itself , which , obvious as it may appear , had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which i am now speaking .
if i went to sleep as i proposed , how could the atmosphere in the chamber be <unk> in the <unk> ?
to breathe it for more than an hour , at the farthest , would be a matter of impossibility , or , if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter , the most ruinous consequences might ensue .
the consideration of this dilemma gave me no little <unk> ; and it <name> hardly be believed , that , after the dangers i had undergone , i should look upon this business in so serious a light , as to give up all <name> of accomplishing my ultimate design , and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent .
but this hesitation was only momentary .
i reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom , and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important , which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual .
it was very certain that i could not do without sleep ; but i might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose .
it would require but five minutes at most to <unk> the atmosphere in the fullest manner , and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing .
but this was a question which , i am willing to confess , occasioned me no little trouble in its solution .
to be sure , i had heard of the student who , to prevent his falling asleep over his books , held in one hand a ball of copper , the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair , served effectually to startle him up , if , at any moment , he should be overcome with drowsiness .
my own case , however , was very different indeed , and left me no room for any similar idea ; for i did not wish to keep awake , but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time .
i at length hit upon the following expedient , which , simple as it may seem , was hailed by me , at the moment of discovery , as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope , the steam-engine , or the <name> of printing itself .
" it is necessary to premise , that the balloon , at the elevation now attained , continued its course upward with an even and <unk> ascent , and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest <unk> whatever .
this circumstance favored me greatly in the project i now determined to adopt .
my supply of water had been put on board in <unk> containing five gallons each , and ranged very securely around the interior of the car .
i unfastened one of these , and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the <unk> from one side to the other ; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf , upon which i placed the keg , and steadied it in a horizontal position .
about eight inches immediately below these ropes , and four feet from the bottom of the car i fastened another shelf  but made of thin plank , being the only similar piece of wood i had .
upon this latter shelf , and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg , a small <unk> pitcher was deposited .
i now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher , and fitted in a plug of soft wood , cut in a tapering or conical shape .
this plug i pushed in or pulled out , as might happen , until , after a few experiments , it arrived at that exact degree of <unk> , at which the water , oozing from the hole , and falling into the pitcher below , would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes .
this , of course , was a matter briefly and easily ascertained , by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time .
having arranged all this , the rest of the plan is obvious .
my bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car , as to bring my head , in lying down , immediately below the mouth of the pitcher .
it was evident , that , at the expiration of an hour , the pitcher , getting full , would be forced to run over , and to run over at the mouth , which was somewhat lower than the rim .
it was also evident , that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet , could not do otherwise than fall upon my face , and that the sure consequences would be , to waken me up instantaneously , even from the soundest slumber in the world .
" it was fully eleven by the time i had completed these arrangements , and i immediately betook myself to bed , with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention .
nor in this matter was i disappointed .
punctually every sixty minutes was i aroused by my trusty <unk> , when , having emptied the pitcher into the <unk> of the keg , and performed the duties of the condenser , i retired again to bed .
these regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than i had anticipated ; and when i finally arose for the day , it was seven o'clock , and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon .
" <name> 3d .
i found the balloon at an immense height indeed , and the earth 's apparent <unk> increased in a material degree .
below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks , which undoubtedly were islands .
far away to the northward i perceived a thin , white , and exceedingly brilliant line , or streak , on the edge of the horizon , and i had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the <unk> of the polar sea .
my curiosity was greatly excited , for i had hopes of passing on much farther to the north , and might possibly , at some period , find myself placed directly above the pole itself .
i now lamented that my great elevation would , in this case , prevent my taking as accurate a survey as i could wish .
much , however , might be ascertained .
nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day .
my apparatus all continued in good order , and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible <unk> .
the cold was intense , and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat .
when darkness came over the earth , i betook myself to bed , although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation .
the <unk> was punctual in its duty , and i slept until next morning soundly , with the exception of the periodical interruption .
" <name> 4th .
arose in good health and spirits , and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea .
it had lost , in a great measure , the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn , being now of a <unk> , and of a lustre dazzling to the eye .
the islands were no longer visible ; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast , or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight , it is impossible to say .
i was inclined , however , to the latter opinion .
the rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent .
cold by no means so intense .
nothing of importance occurred , and i passed the day in reading , having taken care to supply myself with books .
" <name> 5th .
beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness .
in time , however , the light spread itself over all , and i again saw the line of ice to the northward .
it was now very distinct , and appeared of a much darker <name> than the waters of the ocean .
i was evidently approaching it , and with great rapidity .
fancied i could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward , and one also to the westward , but could not be certain .
weather moderate .
nothing of any consequence happened during the day .
went early to bed .
" <name> 6th .
was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance , and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north .
it was evident that if the balloon held its present course , it would soon arrive above the frozen ocean , and i had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the pole .
during the whole of the day i continued to near the ice .
toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased , owing undoubtedly to the earth 's form being that of an <unk> <unk> , and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the arctic circle .
when darkness at length overtook me , i went to bed in great anxiety , fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when i should have no opportunity of observing it .
" <name> 7th .
arose early , and , to my great <name> , at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern pole itself .
it was there , beyond a doubt , and immediately beneath my feet ; but , alas !
i had now ascended to so vast a distance , that nothing could with accuracy be discerned .
indeed , to judge from the progression of the <name> indicating my various altitudes , respectively , at different periods , between six a.m. on the second of <name> , and twenty minutes before nine a.m. of the same day ( at which time the barometer ran down ) , it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now , at four o'clock in the morning of <name> the seventh , reached a height of not less , certainly , than <unk> miles above the surface of the sea .
this elevation may appear immense , but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth .
at all events i undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth 's <name> diameter ; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart <unk> projected : and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon .
your excellencies may , however , readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the arctic circle , although situated directly beneath me , and therefore seen without any appearance of being <unk> , were still , in themselves , comparatively too diminutive , and at too great a distance from the point of sight , to admit of any very accurate examination .
nevertheless , what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting .
<unk> from that huge rim before mentioned , and which , with slight qualification , may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions , one unbroken , or nearly unbroken , sheet of ice continues to extend .
in the first few degrees of this its progress , its surface is very sensibly flattened , farther on depressed into a plane , and finally , becoming not a little concave , it terminates , at the pole itself , in a circular centre , sharply defined , whose apparent diameter <unk> at the balloon an <name> of about sixty-five seconds , and whose dusky <name> , varying in intensity , was , at all times , darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere , and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness .
farther than this , little could be ascertained .
by twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference , and by seven <unk> .
i lost sight of it entirely ; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice , and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator .
" <name> 8th .
found a sensible diminution in the earth 's apparent diameter , besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance .
the whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow , and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye .
my view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds , between whose masses i could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself .
this difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours ; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together , as it were , the floating bodies of vapor , and the inconvenience became , of course , more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent .
nevertheless , i could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of north <name> , and was holding a course , due south , which would bring me to the tropics .
this circumstance did not fail to give me the most <unk> satisfaction , and i hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success .
indeed , the direction i had hitherto taken , had filled me with uneasiness ; for it was evident that , had i continued it much longer , there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all , whose orbit is inclined to the <unk> at only the small <name> of 5 degrees 8 ' 48 " .
" <name> 9th .
to-day the earth 's diameter was greatly diminished , and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow .
the balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward , and arrived , at nine p.m. , over the northern edge of the mexican gulf .
" <name> 10th .
i was suddenly aroused from slumber , about five o'clock this morning , by a loud , crackling , and terrific sound , for which i could in no manner account .
it was of very brief duration , but , while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which i had any previous experience .
it is needless to say that i became excessively alarmed , having , in the first instance , attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon .
i examined all my apparatus , however , with great attention , and could discover nothing out of order .
spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary , but could find no means whatever of accounting for it .
went to bed dissatisfied , and in a state of great anxiety and agitation .
" <name> 11th .
found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth , and a considerable increase , now observable for the first time , in that of the moon itself , which wanted only a few days of being full .
it now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life .
" <name> 12th .
a singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon , and although fully anticipated , afforded me the most unequivocal delight .
having reached , in its former course , about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude , it turned off suddenly , at an acute <name> , to the eastward , and thus proceeded throughout the day , keeping nearly , if not altogether , in the exact plane of the lunar <unk> .
what was worthy of remark , a very perceptible <unk> in the car was a consequence of this change of route  a <unk> which prevailed , in a more or less degree , for a period of many hours .
" <name> 13th .
was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud , crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth .
thought long upon the subject , but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion .
great decrease in the earth 's apparent diameter , which now <unk> from the balloon an <name> of very little more than twenty-five degrees .
the moon could not be seen at all , being nearly in my zenith .
i still continued in the plane of the <unk> , but made little progress to the eastward .
" <name> 14th .
extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth .
to-day i became strongly impressed with the idea , that the balloon was now actually running up the line of <unk> to the point of <unk>  in other words , holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth .
the moon itself was directly overhead , and consequently hidden from my view .
great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere .
" <name> 15th .
not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness .
about twelve o'clock i became aware , for the third time , of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before .
it now , however , continued for some moments , and gathered intensity as it continued .
at length , while , stupefied and terror-stricken , i stood in expectation of i knew not what hideous destruction , the car vibrated with excessive violence , and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which i could not distinguish , came with a voice of a thousand thunders , roaring and booming by the balloon .
when my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided , i had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which i was so rapidly approaching , and , in all probability , one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth , and termed <unk> stones for want of a better appellation .
" <name> 16th .
to-day , looking upward as well as i could , through each of the side windows alternately , i beheld , to my great delight , a very small portion of the moon 's disk protruding , as it were , on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon .
my agitation was extreme ; for i had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage .
indeed , the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree , and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion .
sleep was a matter nearly out of the question .
i became quite ill , and my frame trembled with exhaustion .
it was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer .
during the now brief interval of darkness a <unk> stone again passed in my vicinity , and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension .
" <name> 17th .
this morning proved an epoch in my voyage .
it <name> be remembered that , on the thirteenth , the earth <unk> an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees .
on the fourteenth this had greatly diminished ; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable ; and , on retiring on the night of the sixteenth , i had noticed an <name> of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes .
what , therefore , must have been my amazement , on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber , on the morning of this day , the seventeenth , at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume , as to <unk> no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter !
i was thunderstruck !
no words can give any adequate idea of the extreme , the absolute horror and astonishment , with which i was seized possessed , and altogether overwhelmed .
my knees tottered beneath me  my teeth chattered  my hair started up on end .
" the balloon , then , had actually burst ! "
these were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind : " the balloon had positively burst !  i was falling  falling with the most impetuous , the most unparalleled velocity !
to judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over , it could not be more than ten minutes , at the farthest , before i should meet the surface of the earth , and be hurled into annihilation ! "
but at length reflection came to my relief .
i paused ; i considered ; and i began to doubt .
the matter was impossible .
i could not in any reason have so rapidly come down .
besides , although i was evidently approaching the surface below me , it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity i had at first so horribly conceived .
this consideration served to calm the <unk> of my mind , and i finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view .
in fact , amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses , when i could not see the vast difference , in appearance , between the surface below me , and the surface of my mother earth .
the latter was indeed over my head , and completely hidden by the balloon , while the moon  the moon itself in all its <name>  lay beneath me , and at my feet .
" the stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps , after all , that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation .
for the <unk> in itself was not only natural and inevitable , but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever i should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite  or , more precisely , where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon .
to be sure i arose from a sound slumber , with all my senses in confusion , to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon , and one which , although expected , was not expected at the moment .
the revolution itself must , of course , have taken place in an easy and gradual manner , and it is by no means clear that , had i even been awake at the time of the occurrence , i should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion  that is to say , by any inconvenience or <unk> , either about my person or about my apparatus .
" it is almost needless to say that , upon coming to a due sense of my situation , and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul , my attention was , in the first place , wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon .
it lay beneath me like a chart  and although i judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance , the <unk> of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness .
the entire absence of ocean or sea , and indeed of any lake or river , or body of water whatsoever , struck me , at first glance , as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition .
yet , strange to say , i beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial , although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains , conical in shape , and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance .
the highest among them does not exceed three and <unk> miles in perpendicular elevation ; but a map of the volcanic districts of the <unk> <unk> would afford to your excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description i might think proper to attempt .
the greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption , and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power , by the repeated thunders of the <unk> <unk> stones , which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling .
" <name> 18th .
to-day i found an enormous increase in the moon 's apparent bulk  and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm .
it <name> be remembered , that , in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon , the existence , in its vicinity , of an atmosphere , dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet , had entered largely into my calculations ; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary , and , it may be added , in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all .
but , in addition to what i have already urged in regard to <unk> comet and the <unk> light , i had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of mr. <unk> , of <unk> .
he observed the moon when two days and a half old , in the evening soon after sunset , before the dark part was visible , and continued to watch it until it became visible .
the two <unk> appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation , each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays , before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible .
soon afterward , the whole dark limb became illuminated .
this prolongation of the <unk> beyond the semicircle , i thought , must have arisen from the <unk> of the sun 's rays by the moon 's atmosphere .
i <unk> , also , the height of the atmosphere ( which could <unk> light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new ) to be <unk> <name> feet ; in this view , i supposed the greatest height capable of <unk> the solar <name> , to be <unk> feet .
my ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the <unk> volume of the philosophical transactions , in which it is stated that at an <unk> of jupiter 's satellites , the third disappeared after having been about 1 " or 2 " of time indistinct , and the fourth became <unk> near the limb .
( <unk> ) " <unk> frequently observed saturn , jupiter , and the fixed stars , when approaching the moon to <unk> , to have their circular figure changed into an oval one ; and , in other <unk> , he found no alteration of figure at all .
hence it might be supposed , that at some times and not at others , there is a dense matter <unk> the moon wherein the rays of the stars are <unk> .
" upon the resistance or , more properly , upon the support of an atmosphere , existing in the state of density imagined , i had , of course , entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent .
should i then , after all , prove to have been mistaken , i had in consequence nothing better to expect , as a <unk> to my adventure , than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite .
and , indeed , i had now every reason to be terrified .
my distance from the moon was comparatively trifling , while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all , and i could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air .
" <name> 19th .
this morning , to my great <name> , about nine o'clock , the surface of the moon being frightfully near , and my apprehensions excited to the utmost , the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere .
by ten , i had reason to believe its density considerably increased .
by eleven , very little labor was necessary at the apparatus ; and at twelve o'clock , with some hesitation , i ventured to <unk> the <unk> , when , finding no inconvenience from having done so , i finally threw open the <unk> chamber , and <unk> it from around the car .
as might have been expected , spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger .
but these and other difficulties attending respiration , as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life , i determined to endure as i best could , in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon .
this approach , however , was still impetuous in the extreme ; and it soon became <unk> certain that , although i had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite , still i had been wrong in supposing this density , even at the surface , at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon .
yet this should have been the case , and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth , the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation .
that it was not the case , however , my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough ; why it was not so , can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which i have formerly alluded .
at all events i was now close upon the planet , and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity .
i lost not a moment , accordingly , in throwing overboard first my ballast , then my <unk> , then my condensing apparatus and <unk> chamber , and finally every article within the car .
but it was all to no purpose .
i still fell with horrible rapidity , and was now not more than half a mile from the surface .
as a last resource , therefore , having got rid of my coat , hat , and boots , i cut loose from the balloon the car itself , which was of no inconsiderable weight , and thus , clinging with both hands to the net-work , i had barely time to observe that the whole country , as far as the eye could reach , was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations , ere i tumbled headlong into the very heart of a <unk> city , and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people , who none of them uttered a single syllable , or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance , but stood , like a parcel of idiots , grinning in a ludicrous manner , and eyeing me and my balloon <unk> , with their arms set <unk> .
i turned from them in contempt , and , gazing upward at the earth so lately left , and left perhaps for ever , beheld it like a huge , dull , copper shield , about two degrees in diameter , fixed <unk> in the heavens overhead , and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold .
no traces of land or water could be discovered , and the whole was clouded with variable spots , and belted with tropical and equatorial zones .
" thus , may it please your excellencies , after a series of great anxieties , unheard of dangers , and unparalleled escapes , i had , at length , on the nineteenth day of my departure from rotterdam , arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary , and the most momentous , ever accomplished , undertaken , or conceived by any <unk> of earth .
but my adventures yet remain to be related .
and indeed your excellencies may well imagine that , after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character , but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection , in capacity of satellite , with the world inhabited by man , i may have intelligence for the private ear of the states ' college of astronomers of far more importance than the details , however wonderful , of the mere voyage which so happily concluded .
this is , in fact , the case .
i have much  very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate .
i have much to say of the climate of the planet ; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold , of unmitigated and burning <name> for one fortnight , and more than polar <unk> for the next ; of a constant transfer of moisture , by <unk> like that in <unk> , from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it ; of a variable zone of running water , of the people themselves ; of their manners , customs , and political institutions ; of their peculiar physical construction ; of their ugliness ; of their want of ears , those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified ; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech ; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of <unk> ; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth  a connection analogous with , and depending upon , that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites , and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are <unk> with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other ; and above all , if it so please your excellencies  above all , of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon  regions which , owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite 's rotation on its own axis with its <unk> revolution about the earth , have never yet been turned , and , by god 's <name> , never shall be turned , to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man .
all this , and more  much more  would i most willingly detail .
but , to be brief , i must have my reward .
i am pining for a return to my family and to my home , and as the price of any farther communication on my part  in consideration of the light which i have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science  i must solicit , through the influence of your honorable body , a pardon for the crime of which i have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from rotterdam .
this , then , is the object of the present paper .
its bearer , an inhabitant of the moon , whom i have prevailed upon , and properly instructed , to be my messenger to the earth , <name> await your excellencies ' pleasure , and return to me with the pardon in question , if it can , in any manner , be obtained .
" i have the honor to be , etc. , your excellencies ' very humble servant , " <name> <unk> . "
upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document , professor <unk> , it is said , dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise , and <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> having taken off his spectacles , wiped them , and deposited them in his pocket , so far forgot both himself and his dignity , as to turn round three times upon his heel in the <unk> of astonishment and admiration .
there was no doubt about the matter  the pardon should be obtained .
so at least swore , with a round oath , professor <unk> , and so finally thought the illustrious <name> <unk> , as he took the arm of his brother in science , and without saying a word , began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted .
having reached the door , however , of the burgomaster 's dwelling , the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear  no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the <unk> of rotterdam  the pardon would be of little use , as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance .
to the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented , and the matter was therefore at an end .
not so , however , rumors and speculations .
the letter , having been published , gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion .
some of the <unk> even made themselves ridiculous by <unk> the whole business ; as nothing better than a hoax .
but hoax , with these sort of people , is , i believe , a general term for all matters above their comprehension .
for my part , i can not conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation .
let us see what they say : <unk> .
that certain wags in rotterdam have certain especial <unk> to certain <unk> and astronomers .
do n't understand at all .
secondly .
that an odd little dwarf and bottle <unk> , both of whose ears , for some <unk> , have been cut off close to his head , has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of <unk> .
well  what of that ?
thirdly .
that the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of holland , and therefore could not have been made in the moon .
they were dirty papers  very dirty  and <unk> , the printer , would take his bible oath to their having been printed in rotterdam .
he was mistaken  undoubtedly  mistaken .
fourthly , that <name> <unk> himself , the drunken villain , and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors , were all seen , no longer than two or three days ago , in a <unk> house in the suburbs , having just returned , with money in their pockets , from a trip beyond the sea .
do n't believe it  do n't believe a word of it .
lastly .
that it is an opinion very generally received , or which ought to be generally received , that the college of astronomers in the city of rotterdam , as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world ,  not to mention colleges and astronomers in general ,  are , to say the least of the matter , not a whit better , nor greater , nor wiser than they ought to be .
<unk> end of text <unk> notes to <name> <unk> ( *1 ) note  strictly speaking , there is but little similarity between the above <unk> trifle and the celebrated " <unk> " of mr. locke ; but as both have the character of <unk>  ( although the one is in a tone of banter , the other of downright <name> ) , and as both <unk> are on the same subject , the moon  moreover , as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific detail  the author of " <name> <unk> " thinks it necessary to say , in self-defence , that his own <unk> <unk> was published in the " southern literary messenger " about three weeks before the commencement of mr. l 's in the " new york sun . "
<unk> a likeness which , perhaps , does not exist , some of the new york papers copied " <name> <unk> , " and <unk> it with the " <unk> , " by way of detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other .
as many more persons were actually <unk> by the " <unk> " than would be willing to acknowledge the fact , it may here afford some little amusement to show why no one should have been <unk> point out those particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to establish its real character .
indeed , however <name> the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction , it wanted much of the force which might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy .
that the public were misled , even for an instant , merely proves the gross ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an astronomical nature .
the moon 's distance from the earth is , in round <name> , <unk> miles .
if we <name> to ascertain how near , apparently , a lens would bring the satellite ( or any distant object ) , we , of course , have but to divide the distance by the <unk> or , more strictly , by the <unk> power of the glass .
mr. l. makes his lens have a power of <unk> times .
by this divide <unk> ( the moon 's real distance ) , and we have five miles and five <unk> , as the apparent distance .
no animal at all could be seen so far ; much less the minute points <unk> in the story .
mr. l. speaks about sir <name> <name> 's perceiving flowers ( the papaver <unk> , etc .
) , and even detecting the color and the shape of the eyes of small birds .
shortly before , too , he has himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter ; but even this , as i have said , is giving the glass by far too great power .
it may be observed , in passing , that this prodigious glass is said to have been <unk> at the <unk> of messrs. <unk> and <name> , in <unk> ; but messrs. h. and <unk> establishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of the hoax .
on <name> 13 , pamphlet edition , speaking of " a hairy veil " over the eyes of a species of bison , the author says : " it immediately occurred to the acute mind of dr. <name> that this was a providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected . "
but this can not be thought a very " acute " observation of the doctor 's .
the inhabitants of our side of the moon have , evidently , no darkness at all , so there can be nothing of the " extremes " mentioned .
in the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of thirteen full <unk> moons .
the <unk> throughout , even when professing to accord with <unk> lunar chart , is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart , and even grossly at variance with itself .
the points of the compass , too , are in inextricable confusion ; the writer appearing to be ignorant that , on a lunar map , these are not in accordance with terrestrial points ; the east being to the left , etc .
deceived , perhaps , by the vague titles , mare <unk> , mare <unk> , mare <unk> , etc. , given to the dark spots by former astronomers , mr. l. has entered into details regarding oceans and other large bodies of water in the moon ; whereas there is no astronomical point more positively ascertained than that no such bodies exist there .
in examining the boundary between light and darkness ( in the crescent or <unk> moon ) where this boundary crosses any of the dark places , the line of division is found to be rough and jagged ; but , were these dark places liquid , it would evidently be even .
the description of the wings of the <unk> , on <name> 21 , is but a literal copy of <name> <unk> ' account of the wings of his flying islanders .
this simple fact should have induced suspicion , at least , it might be thought .
on <name> 23 , we have the following : " what a prodigious influence must our thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an embryo in the womb of time , the passive subject of chemical affinity ! "
this is very fine ; but it should be observed that no astronomer would have made such remark , especially to any journal of science ; for the earth , in the sense intended , is not only thirteen , but forty-nine times larger than the moon .
a similar objection applies to the whole of the concluding pages , where , by way of introduction to some discoveries in saturn , the philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy account of that planet  this to the " edinburgh journal of science ! "
but there is one point , in particular , which should have betrayed the fiction .
let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals upon the moon 's surface  what would first arrest the attention of an observer from the earth ?
certainly neither their shape , size , nor any other such peculiarity , so soon as their remarkable situation .
they would appear to be walking , with heels up and head down , in the manner of flies on a ceiling .
the real observer would have uttered an instant ejaculation of surprise ( however prepared by previous knowledge ) at the <unk> of their position ; the fictitious observer has not even mentioned the subject , but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such creatures , when it is <unk> that he could have seen only the diameter of their heads !
it might as well be remarked , in conclusion , that the size , and particularly the powers of the <unk> ( for example , their ability to fly in so rare an atmosphere  if , indeed , the moon have any ) , with most of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence , are at variance , generally , with all analogical reasoning on these themes ; and that analogy here <name> often amount to conclusive demonstration .
it is , perhaps , scarcely necessary to add , that all the suggestions attributed to brewster and <name> , in the beginning of the article , about " a <unk> of artificial light through the <unk> object of vision , " etc. , etc. , belong to that species of <unk> writing which comes , most properly , under the denomination of <unk> .
there is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the stars  a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood .
if , indeed , the casting of large lenses were all that is required , man's ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task , and we might have them of any size demanded .
but , unhappily , in proportion to the increase of size in the lens , and consequently of <unk> power , is the diminution of light from the object , by diffusion of its rays .
and for this evil there is no remedy within human ability ; for an object is seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself , whether direct or reflected .
thus the only " artificial " light which could avail mr. locke , would be some artificial light which he should be able to <unk> upon the " <unk> object of vision , " but upon the real object to be <unk> wit : upon the moon .
it has been easily calculated that , when the light proceeding from a <name> becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light proceeding from the whole of the stars , in a clear and <unk> night , then the <name> is no longer visible for any practical purpose .
the <name> of <name> 's telescope , lately constructed in england , has a speculum with a reflecting surface of <unk> square inches ; the <name> telescope having one of only <unk> .
the metal of the <name> of <name> 's is 6 feet diameter ; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges , and 5 at the centre .
the weight is 3 tons .
the <unk> length is 50 feet .
i have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book , whose title-page runs thus : " <unk> dans la <unk> ou <name> voyage <unk> fait au <unk> de la <unk> , <unk> <unk> par <name> gonzales , <unk> <unk> , <unk> dit <name> courier <unk> .
mis en notre <unk> par j .
b. d. a. <name> , chez <unk> <unk> , <unk> la <unk> de saint <unk> .
et chez j. <unk> , au premier <unk> de la <unk> du <unk> , <unk> <name> consultations , <unk> . "
pp .
76 .
the writer professes to have translated his work from the english of one mr. <unk> ( <unk> ? )
although there is a terrible <unk> in the statement .
" j ' en ai <unk> , " says he " <unk> de monsieur <unk> , <unk> des <unk> <unk> qui <unk> <unk> dans la <unk> des <unk> <unk> , et sur tout de la philosophic <unk> .
je lui ai cette obligation entre <name> <unk> , de m ' <unk> non <unk> mis en main <unk> <unk> en <unk> , mais encore <name> <unk> du sieur <name> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> pour sa <unk> , sur la version <unk> j ' <unk> que j ' ay <unk> <name> plan de la <unk> . "
after some irrelevant adventures , much in the manner of <name> blas , and which occupy the first thirty pages , the author relates that , being ill during a sea voyage , the crew abandoned him , together with a negro servant , on the island of st. <name> .
to increase the chances of obtaining food , the two separate , and live as far apart as possible .
this brings about a training of birds , to serve the purpose of <unk> between them .
by and by these are taught to <name> parcels of some <unk> this weight is gradually increased .
at length the idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the birds , with a view to raising the author himself .
a machine is contrived for the purpose , and we have a minute description of it , which is materially helped out by a steel engraving .
here we perceive the signor gonzales , with point ruffles and a huge <unk> , seated astride something which resembles very closely a <unk> , and borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans  ( <unk> ) who had strings reaching from their tails to the machine .
the main event detailed in the signor 's narrative depends upon a very important fact , of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the end of the book .
the <unk> , with whom he had become so familiar , were not really <unk> of st. <name> , but of the moon .
thence it had been their custom , time out of mind , to migrate annually to some portion of the earth .
in proper season , of course , they would return home ; and the author , happening , one day , to require their services for a short voyage , is unexpectedly carried straight tip , and in a very brief period arrives at the satellite .
here he finds , among other odd things , that the people enjoy extreme happiness ; that they have no law ; that they die without pain ; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height ; that they live five thousand years ; that they have an emperor called <unk> ; and that they can jump sixty feet high , when , being out of the <unk> influence , they fly about with fans .
i can not forbear giving a specimen of the general philosophy of the volume .
" i must not forget here , that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon , and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed .
i have also me and the earth .
as to the stars , since there was no night where i was , they always had the same appearance ; not brilliant , as usual , but pale , and very nearly like the moon of a morning .
but few of them were visible , and these ten times larger ( as well as i could judge ) than they seem to the inhabitants of the earth .
the moon , which wanted two days of being full , was of a terrible <unk> .
" i must not forget here , that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon , and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed .
i have also to inform you that , whether it was calm weather or <name> , i found myself always immediately between the moon and the <unk> i was convinced of this for two <unk> my birds always flew in a straight line ; and because whenever we attempted to rest , we were carried insensibly around the globe of the earth .
for i admit the opinion of <unk> , who maintains that it never ceases to revolve from the east to the west , not upon the poles of the <unk> , commonly called the poles of the world , but upon those of the zodiac , a question of which i propose to speak more at length <unk> , when i shall have leisure to refresh my memory in regard to the <unk> which i learned at <unk> when young , and have since forgotten . "
notwithstanding the blunders <unk> , the book is not without some claim to attention , as affording a naive specimen of the current astronomical notions of the time .
one of these assumed , that the " <unk> power " extended but a short distance from the <unk> surface , and , accordingly , we find our voyager " carried insensibly around the globe , " etc .
there have been other " voyages to the moon , " but none of higher merit than the one just mentioned .
that of bergerac is utterly meaningless .
in the third volume of the " american quarterly review " <name> be found quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain " journey " of the kind in question  a criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic most exposes the stupidity of the book , or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy .
i forget the title of the work ; but the means of the voyage are more <unk> ill conceived than are even the <unk> of our friend the signor gonzales .
the adventurer , in digging the earth , happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong attraction , and straightway <unk> of it a box , which , when cast loose from its terrestrial fastenings , flies with him , forthwith , to the satellite .
the " flight of <name> <unk> , " is a <unk> d ' <unk> not altogether contemptible , and has been translated into <name> .
<name> , the hero , was , in fact , the gamekeeper of an <name> peer , whose eccentricities gave rise to the tale .
the " flight " is made on an <unk> back , from hungry hill , a lofty mountain at the end of <unk> bay .
in these various <unk> the aim is always <unk> ; the theme being a description of <unk> customs as compared with ours .
in none is there any effort at plausibility in the details of the voyage itself .
the writers seem , in each instance , to be utterly <unk> in respect to astronomy .
in " <name> <unk> " the design is original , inasmuch as regards an attempt at <unk> , in the application of scientific principles ( so far as the whimsical nature of the subject would permit ) , to the actual passage between the earth and the moon .
( <unk> ) the <unk> light is probably what the ancients called <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  pliny , lib .
2 , p. 26 .
( <unk> ) since the original publication of <name> <unk> , i find that mr. green , of nassau balloon notoriety , and other late <unk> , deny the assertions of humboldt , in this respect , and speak of a decreasing inconvenience ,  precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter .
( <unk> ) <unk> writes that he has several times found , in skies perfectly clear , when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous , that , at the same altitude of the moon , at the same elongation from the earth , and with one and the same excellent telescope , the moon and its <unk> did not appear equally lucid at all times .
from the circumstances of the observation , it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air , in the tube , in the moon , or in the eye of the spectator , but must be looked for in something ( an atmosphere ? )
existing about the moon .
the <unk> what ho !
what ho !
this fellow is dancing mad !
he hath been bitten by the <unk> .
  all in the <unk> many years ago , i contracted an intimacy with a mr. <name> legrand .
he was of an ancient <unk> family , and had once been wealthy ; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want .
to avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters , he left new orleans , the city of his forefathers , and took up his residence at sullivan 's island , near charleston , south <name> .
this island is a very singular one .
it consists of little else than the sea sand , and is about three miles long .
its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile .
it is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek , oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime , a favorite resort of the marsh hen .
the vegetation , as might be supposed , is scant , or at least <unk> .
no trees of any magnitude are to be seen .
near the western extremity , where fort moultrie stands , and where are some miserable frame buildings , tenanted , during summer , by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever , may be found , indeed , the bristly <unk> ; but the whole island , with the exception of this western point , and a line of hard , white beach on the seacoast , is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet <name> , so much prized by the horticulturists of england .
the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet , and forms an almost impenetrable <unk> , <unk> the air with its fragrance .
in the inmost recesses of this <unk> , not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island , legrand had built himself a small hut , which he occupied when i first , by mere accident , made his acquaintance .
this soon ripened into friendship  for there was much in the <unk> to excite interest and esteem .
i found him well educated , with unusual powers of mind , but infected with <unk> , and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy .
he had with him many books , but rarely employed them .
his chief amusements were <unk> and fishing , or sauntering along the beach and through the <unk> , in quest of shells or entomological specimens ;  his collection of the latter might have been envied by a <unk> .
in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro , called jupiter , who had been <unk> before the reverses of the family , but who could be induced , neither by threats nor by promises , to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young " massa <name> . "
it is not improbable that the relatives of legrand , conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect , had contrived to <unk> this obstinacy into jupiter , with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer .
the winters in the latitude of sullivan 's island are seldom very severe , and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary .
about the middle of october , 18 , there occurred , however , a day of remarkable <unk> .
just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend , whom i had not visited for several weeks  my residence being , at that time , in charleston , a distance of nine miles from the island , while the facilities of passage and <unk> were very far behind those of the present day .
upon reaching the hut i rapped , as was my custom , and getting no reply , sought for the key where i knew it was secreted , unlocked the door and went in .
a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth .
it was a novelty , and by no means an ungrateful one .
i threw off an overcoat , took an arm-chair by the crackling logs , and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts .
soon after dark they arrived , and gave me a most cordial welcome .
jupiter , grinning from ear to ear , bustled about to prepare some <unk> for supper .
legrand was in one of his fits  how else shall i term them ?  of enthusiasm .
he had found an unknown <unk> , forming a new genus , and , more than this , he had hunted down and secured , with jupiter 's assistance , a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new , but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow .
" and why not to-night ? "
i asked , rubbing my hands over the blaze , and wishing the whole tribe of <unk> at the devil .
" ah , if i had only known you were here ! "
said legrand , " but it 's so long since i saw you ; and how could i foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others ?
as i was coming home i met lieutenant g  , from the fort , and , very foolishly , i lent him the bug ; so it <name> be impossible for you to see it until the morning .
stay here to-night , and i <name> send <unk> down for it at sunrise .
it is the loveliest thing in creation ! "
" what ?  sunrise ? "
" nonsense !
no !  the bug .
it is of a brilliant gold color  about the size of a large <unk>  with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back , and another , somewhat longer , at the other .
the antennæ are  " " dey aint no tin in him , massa <name> , i keep a tellin on you , " here interrupted jupiter ; " de bug is a <unk> bug , solid , <unk> bit of him , inside and all , <unk> him wing  <unk> feel half so <unk> a bug in my life . "
" well , suppose it is , <unk> , " replied legrand , somewhat more earnestly , it seemed to me , than the case demanded , " is that any reason for your letting the birds burn ?
the color "  here he turned to me  " is really almost enough to warrant jupiter 's idea .
you never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit  but of this you can not judge till tomorrow .
in the mean time i can give you some idea of the shape . "
saying this , he seated himself at a small table , on which were a pen and ink , but no paper .
he looked for some in a drawer , but found none .
" never mind , " said he at length , " this <name> answer ; " and he <name> from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty <unk> , and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen .
while he did this , i retained my seat by the fire , for i was still chilly .
when the design was complete , he handed it to me without rising .
as i received it , a loud growl was heard , succeeded by a scratching at the door .
jupiter opened it , and a large newfoundland , belonging to legrand , rushed in , leaped upon my shoulders , and loaded me with caresses ; for i had shown him much attention during previous visits .
when his <unk> were over , i looked at the paper , and , to speak the truth , found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted .
" well ! "
i said , after contemplating it for some minutes , " this is a strange scarabæus , i must confess : new to me : never saw anything like it before  unless it was a skull , or a <unk>  which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation . "
" a <unk> ! "
echoed legrand  " oh  yes  well , it has something of that appearance upon paper , no doubt .
the two upper black spots look like eyes , eh ?
and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth  and then the shape of the whole is oval . "
" perhaps so , " said i ; " but , legrand , i fear you are no artist .
i must wait until i see the beetle itself , if i am to form any idea of its personal appearance . "
" well , i do n't know , " said he , a little nettled , " i draw tolerably  should do it at least  have had good masters , and flatter myself that i am not quite a <unk> . "
" but , my dear fellow , you are joking then , " said i , " this is a very passable skull  indeed , i may say that it is a very excellent skull , according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology  and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it .
why , we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint .
i presume you <name> call the bug scarabæus <unk> <unk> , or something of that kind  there are many similar titles in the natural histories .
but where are the antennæ you spoke of ? "
" the antennæ ! "
said legrand , who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject ; " i am sure you must see the antennæ .
i made them as distinct as they are in the original insect , and i presume that is sufficient . "
" well , well , " i said , " perhaps you have  still i do n't see them ; " and i handed him the paper without additional remark , not wishing to ruffle his temper ; but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken ; his ill humor puzzled me  and , as for the drawing of the beetle , there were positively no antennæ visible , and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a <unk> .
he received the paper very <unk> , and was about to crumple it , apparently to throw it in the fire , when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention .
in an instant his face grew violently red  in another as excessively pale .
for some minutes he continued to <unk> the drawing minutely where he sat .
at length he arose , took a candle from the table , and proceeded to seat himself upon a <unk> in the farthest corner of the room .
here again he made an anxious examination of the paper ; turning it in all directions .
he said nothing , however , and his conduct greatly astonished me ; yet i thought it prudent not to <unk> the growing <unk> of his temper by any comment .
presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet , placed the paper carefully in it , and deposited both in a <unk> , which he locked .
he now grew more composed in his demeanor ; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared .
yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted .
as the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie , from which no sallies of mine could arouse him .
it had been my intention to pass the night at the hut , as i had frequently done before , but , seeing my host in this mood , i deemed it proper to take leave .
he did not press me to remain , but , as i departed , he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality .
it was about a month after this ( and during the interval i had seen nothing of legrand ) when i received a visit , at charleston , from his man , jupiter .
i had never seen the good old negro look so <unk> , and i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend .
" well , <unk> , " said i , " what is the matter now ?  how is your master ? "
" why , to speak de <unk> , massa , him not so <name> well as <unk> be . "
" not well !
i am truly sorry to hear it .
what does he complain of ? "
" dar !
dat 's it !  him <unk> plain of <unk>  but him <name> sick for all dat . "
" very sick , jupiter !  why did n't you say so at once ?
is he confined to bed ? "
" no , dat he aint !  he aint find <unk>  dat 's just whar de shoe pinch  my mind is got to be <name> <unk> <unk> poor massa <name> . "
" jupiter , i should like to understand what it is you are talking about .
you say your master is sick .
has n't he told you what ails him ? "
" why , massa , taint <unk> while for to git mad about de matter  massa <name> say <unk> at all aint de matter wid him  but den what make him go about looking dis here way , wid he head down and he soldiers up , and as white as a <unk> ?
and den he keep a <unk> all de time  " " keeps a what , jupiter ? "
" keeps a <unk> wid de <unk> on de slate  de queerest <unk> i <unk> did see .
<unk> gittin to be <unk> , i tell you .
hab for to keep mighty tight eye <unk> him <unk> .
<unk> day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day .
i had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did come  but <unk> sich a fool dat i had n't de heart <unk> all  he look so <name> poorly . "
" eh ?  what ?  ah yes !  upon the whole i think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow  do n't flog him , jupiter  he ca n't very well stand it  but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness , or rather this change of conduct ?
has anything unpleasant happened since i saw you ? "
" no , massa , dey aint bin <unk> unpleasant since den  't was fore den i'm feared  't was de <name> day you was dare . "
" how ?
what do you mean ? "
" why , massa , i mean de bug  dare now . "
" the what ? "
" de bug ,  i 'm <name> <unk> dat massa <name> bin bit somewhere <unk> de head by dat <unk> . "
" and what cause have you , jupiter , for such a supposition ? "
" claws <unk> , massa , and mouth too .
i <unk> did see sick a deuced bug  he kick and he bite <unk> ting what cum near him .
massa <name> cotch him fuss , but had for to let him go gin mighty quick , i tell you  den was de time he must <name> got de bite .
i did n't like de look oh de bug <unk> , myself , no how , so i would n't take hold ob him wid my finger , but i cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat i found .
i rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he <unk>  dat was de way . "
" and you think , then , that your master was really bitten by the beetle , and that the bite made him sick ? "
" i do n't <unk> <unk> about it  i nose it .
what make him dream <unk> de <unk> so much , if taint cause he bit by de <unk> ?
<unk> heerd <unk> dem <unk> fore dis . "
" but how do you know he dreams about gold ? "
" how i know ?
why cause he talk about it in he sleep  dat 's how i nose . "
" well , <unk> , perhaps you are right ; but to what fortunate circumstance am i to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day ? "
" what de matter , massa ? "
" did you bring any message from mr .
legrand ? "
" no , massa , i bring dis here <unk> ; " and here jupiter handed me a note which ran thus : my dear   why have i not seen you for so long a time ?
i <name> you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little <unk> of mine ; but no , that is improbable .
since i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety .
i have something to tell you , yet scarcely know how to tell it , or whether i should tell it at all .
i have not been quite well for some days past , and poor old <unk> <unk> me , almost beyond endurance , by his <unk> attentions would you believe it ?  he had prepared a huge stick , the other day , with which to <unk> me for giving him the slip , and spending the day , <unk> , among the hills on the main land .
i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging .
i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met .
if you can , in any way , make it convenient , come over with jupiter .
do come .
i wish to see you <unk> , upon business of importance .
i assure you that it is of the highest importance .
ever yours , <name> legrand .
there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness .
its whole style differed materially from that of legrand .
what could he be dreaming of ?
what new <unk> possessed his excitable <name> ?
what " business of the highest importance " could he possibly have to transact ?
jupiter 's account of him <unk> no good .
i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had , at length , fairly unsettled the reason of my friend .
without a moment 's hesitation , therefore , i prepared to accompany the negro .
upon reaching the wharf , i noticed a scythe and three spades , all apparently new , lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark .
" what is the meaning of all this , <unk> ? "
i inquired .
" him <unk> , massa , and spade . "
" very true ; but what are they doing here ? "
" him de <unk> and de spade what massa <name> sis <unk> my buying for him in de town , and de <unk> own lot of money i had to gib for em . "
" but what , in the name of all that is mysterious , is your <unk> <unk> going to do with <unk> and spades ? "
" dat 's more <name> i know , and <unk> take me if i do n't <unk> 't is more <name> he know , too .
but it 's all cum ob do bug . "
finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter , whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by " de bug , " i now stepped into the boat and made sail .
with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie , and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut .
it was about three in the afternoon when we arrived .
legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation .
he grasped my hand with a nervous <unk> which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained .
his countenance was pale even to <unk> , and his <unk> eyes glared with unnatural lustre .
after some inquiries respecting his health , i asked him , not knowing what better to say , if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from lieutenant g   .
" oh , yes , " he replied , coloring violently , " i got it from him the next morning .
nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus .
do you know that jupiter is quite right about it ? "
" in what way ? "
i asked , with a sad <unk> at heart .
" in supposing it to be a bug of real gold . "
he said this with an air of profound seriousness , and i felt inexpressibly shocked .
" this bug is to make my fortune , " he continued , with a triumphant smile , " to <unk> me in my family possessions .
is it any wonder , then , that i prize it ?
since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me , i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index .
jupiter ; bring me that scarabæus ! "
" what !
de bug , massa ?
i 'd rudder not go fer <unk> dat bug  you mus git him for your own self . "
hereupon legrand arose , with a grave and stately air , and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed .
it was a beautiful scarabæus , and , at that time , unknown to naturalists  of course a great prize in a scientific point of view .
there were two round , black spots near one extremity of the back , and a long one near the other .
the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy , with all the appearance of burnished gold .
the weight of the insect was very remarkable , and , taking all things into consideration , i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it ; but what to make of legrand 's <unk> with that opinion , i could not , for the life of me , tell .
" i sent for you , " said he , in a <unk> tone , when i had completed my examination of the beetle , " i sent for you , that i might have your counsel and assistance in <unk> the views of fate and of the bug "  " my dear legrand , " i cried , interrupting him , " you are certainly unwell , and had better use some little precautions .
you shall go to bed , and i <name> remain with you a few days , until you get over this .
you are feverish and "  " feel my pulse , " said he .
i felt it , and , to say the truth , found not the slightest indication of fever .
" but you may be ill and yet have no fever .
allow me this once to <unk> for you .
in the first place , go to bed .
in the next "  " you are mistaken , " he interposed , " i am as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer .
if you really wish me well , you <name> relieve this excitement . "
" and how is this to be done ? "
" very easily .
jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills , upon the main land , and , in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide .
you are the only one we can trust .
whether we succeed or fail , the excitement which you now perceive in me <name> be equally allayed . "
" i am anxious to oblige you in any way , " i replied ; " but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills ? "
" it has . "
" then , legrand , i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding . "
" i am sorry  very sorry  for we shall have to try it by ourselves . "
" try it by yourselves !
the man is surely mad !  but stay !  how long do you propose to be absent ? "
" probably all night .
we shall start immediately , and be back , at all events , by sunrise . "
" and <name> you promise me , upon your honor , that when this freak of yours is over , and the bug business ( good god ! )
settled to your satisfaction , you <name> then return home and follow my advice implicitly , as that of your physician ? "
" yes ; i promise ; and now let us be off , for we have no time to lose . "
with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend .
we started about four o'clock  legrand , jupiter , the dog , and myself .
jupiter had with him the scythe and spades  the whole of which he insisted upon carrying  more through fear , it seemed to me , of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master , than from any excess of industry or <unk> .
his demeanor was dogged in the extreme , and " dat deuced bug " were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey .
for my own part , i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns , while legrand contented himself with the scarabæus , which he carried attached to the end of a bit of <unk> ; <unk> it to and fro , with the air of a <unk> , as he went .
when i observed this last , plain evidence of my friend 's aberration of mind , i could scarcely refrain from tears .
i thought it best , however , to humor his fancy , at least for the present , or until i could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success .
in the mean time i endeavored , but all in vain , to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition .
having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him , he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance , and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than " we shall see ! "
we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff ; and , ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land , proceeded in a <unk> direction , through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate , where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen .
legrand led the way with decision ; pausing only for an instant , here and there , to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion .
in this manner we journeyed for about two hours , and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen .
it was a species of table land , near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill , densely wooded from base to pinnacle , and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil , and in many cases were prevented from <unk> themselves into the valleys below , merely by the support of the trees against which they <unk> .
deep ravines , in various directions , gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene .
the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles , through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe ; and jupiter , by direction of his master , proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall <unk> , which stood , with some eight or ten oaks , upon the level , and far surpassed them all , and all other trees which i had then ever seen , in the beauty of its foliage and form , in the wide spread of its branches , and in the general majesty of its appearance .
when we reached this tree , legrand turned to jupiter , and asked him if he thought he could climb it .
the old man seemed a little staggered by the question , and for some moments made no reply .
at length he approached the huge trunk , walked slowly around it , and examined it with minute attention .
when he had completed his scrutiny , he merely said , " yes , massa , <unk> climb any tree he <unk> see in he life . "
" then up with you as soon as possible , for it <name> soon be too dark to see what we are about . "
" how far mus go up , massa ? "
inquired jupiter .
" get up the main trunk first , and then i <name> tell you which way to go  and here  stop !
take this beetle with you . "
" de bug , massa <name> !  de <unk> bug ! "
cried the negro , drawing back in dismay  " what for mus tote de bug way up de tree ?  <unk> if i do ! "
" if you are afraid , <unk> , a great big negro like you , to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle , why you can <name> it up by this string  but , if you do not take it up with you in some way , i shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel . "
" what de matter now , massa ? "
said <unk> , evidently shamed into compliance ; " always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger .
was only <unk> any how .
me <unk> de bug !
what i <unk> for de bug ? "
here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string , and , maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit , prepared to ascend the tree .
in youth , the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , the most magnificent of american <unk> , has a trunk peculiarly smooth , and often rises to a great height without lateral branches ; but , in its <unk> age , the bark becomes gnarled and uneven , while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem .
thus the difficulty of ascension , in the present case , lay more in semblance than in reality .
embracing the huge cylinder , as closely as possible , with his arms and knees , seizing with his hands some projections , and resting his naked toes upon others , jupiter , after one or two narrow escapes from falling , at length wriggled himself into the first great fork , and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished .
the risk of the achievement was , in fact , now over , although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground .
" which way mus go now , massa <name> ? "
he asked .
" keep up the largest branch  the one on this side , " said legrand .
the negro obeyed him promptly , and apparently with but little trouble ; ascending higher and higher , until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it .
presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo .
" how much <unk> is got for go ? "
" how high up are you ? "
asked legrand .
" <unk> so fur , " replied the negro ; " can see de sky <unk> de top ob de tree . "
" never mind the sky , but attend to what i say .
look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side .
how many limbs have you passed ? "
" one , two , tree , four , <unk>  i done pass <unk> big limb , massa , <unk> dis side . "
" then go one limb higher . "
in a few minutes the voice was heard again , announcing that the seventh limb was attained .
" now , <unk> , " cried legrand , evidently much excited , " i want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can .
if you see anything strange , let me know . "
by this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor friend 's insanity , was put finally at rest .
i had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy , and i became seriously anxious about getting him home .
while i was pondering upon what was best to be done , jupiter 's voice was again heard .
" mos <unk> for to <unk> <unk> dis limb <name> far  tis dead limb putty much all de way . "
" did you say it was a dead limb , jupiter ? "
cried legrand in a <unk> voice .
" yes , massa , him dead as de <unk>  done up for <unk>  done departed dis here life . "
" what in the name heaven shall i do ? "
asked legrand , seemingly in the greatest distress .
" do ! "
said i , glad of an opportunity to interpose a word , " why come home and go to bed .
come now !  that 's a fine fellow .
it 's getting late , and , besides , you remember your promise . "
" jupiter , " cried he , without heeding me in the least , " do you hear me ? "
" yes , massa <name> , hear you <unk> so plain . "
" try the wood well , then , with your knife , and see if you think it very rotten . "
" him rotten , massa , sure <unk> , " replied the negro in a few moments , " but not so <name> rotten as <unk> be .
<unk> <unk> out leetle way <unk> de limb by myself , dat 's true . "
" by yourself !  what do you mean ? "
" why i mean de bug .
't is <name> <unk> bug .
<unk> i drop him down fuss , and den de limb wo n't break wid just de weight ob one nigger . "
" you infernal scoundrel ! "
cried legrand , apparently much relieved , " what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that ?
as sure as you drop that beetle i 'll break your neck .
look here , jupiter , do you hear me ? "
" yes , massa , need n't <unk> at poor nigger dat style . "
" well !
now listen !  if you <name> venture out on the limb as far as you think safe , and not let go the beetle , i 'll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down . "
" i 'm gwine , massa <name>  deed i is , " replied the negro very promptly  " mos out to the <unk> now . "
" out to the end ! "
here fairly screamed legrand , " do you say you are out to the end of that limb ? "
" soon be to de <unk> , massa ,  <unk> !
<unk> !
what is dis here <unk> de tree ? "
" well ! "
cried legrand , highly delighted , " what is it ? "
" why taint <unk> but a skull  somebody bin lef him head up de tree , and de crows done <unk> <unk> bit ob de meat off . "
" a skull , you say !  very well !  how is it fastened to the limb ?  what holds it on ? "
" sure <unk> , massa ; mus look .
why dis <name> <unk> <unk> , <unk> my word  dare 's a great big nail in de skull , what <unk> ob it on to de tree . "
" well now , jupiter , do exactly as i tell you  do you hear ? "
" yes , massa . "
" pay attention , then !  find the left eye of the skull . "
" hum !
hoo !
dat 's good !
why dare aint no eye lef at all . "
" curse your stupidity !
do you know your right hand from your left ? "
" yes , i nose dat  nose all <unk> dat  tis my lef hand what i chops de wood wid . "
" to be sure !
you are left-handed ; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand .
now , i suppose , you can find the left eye of the skull , or the place where the left eye has been .
have you found it ? "
here was a long pause .
at length the negro asked , " is de lef eye of de skull <unk> de same side as de lef hand of de skull , too ?  cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all  <unk> mind !
i got de lef eye now  here de lef eye !
what mus do wid it ? "
" let the beetle drop through it , as far as the string <name> reach  but be careful and not let go your hold of the string . "
" all dat done , massa <name> ; mighty easy ting for to put de bug <unk> de hole  look out for him dare below ! "
during this colloquy no portion of jupiter 's person could be seen ; but the beetle , which he had suffered to descend , was now visible at the end of the string , and glistened , like a globe of burnished gold , in the last rays of the setting sun , some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood .
the scarabæus <name> quite clear of any branches , and , if allowed to fall , would have fallen at our feet .
legrand immediately took the scythe , and cleared with it a circular space , three or four yards in diameter , just beneath the insect , and , having accomplished this , ordered jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree .
driving a <name> , with great nicety , into the ground , at the precise spot where the beetle fell , my friend now produced from his pocket a tape measure .
fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk , of the tree which was nearest the <name> , he unrolled it till it reached the <name> , and thence farther unrolled it , in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the <name> , for the distance of fifty feet  jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe .
at the spot thus attained a second <name> was driven , and about this , as a centre , a rude circle , about four feet in diameter , described .
taking now a spade himself , and giving one to jupiter and one to me , legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible .
to speak the truth , i had no especial relish for such amusement at any time , and , at that particular moment , would most willingly have declined it ; for the night was coming on , and i felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken ; but i saw no mode of escape , and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend 's <unk> by a refusal .
could i have depended , indeed , upon jupiter 's aid , i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force ; but i was too well assured of the old negro 's disposition , to <name> that he would assist me , under any circumstances , in a personal contest with his master .
i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable southern superstitions about money buried , and that his <unk> had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus , or , perhaps , by jupiter 's obstinacy in maintaining it to be " a bug of real gold . "
a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions  especially if <unk> in with favorite preconceived ideas  and then i called to mind the poor fellow 's speech about the beetle 's being " the index of his fortune . "
upon the whole , i was sadly vexed and puzzled , but , at length , i concluded to make a virtue of necessity  to dig with a good <name> , and thus the sooner to convince the visionary , by <unk> demonstration , of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained .
the lanterns having been lit , we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause ; and , as the glare fell upon our persons and implements , i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed , and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any <unk> who , by chance , might have stumbled upon our whereabouts .
we dug very steadily for two hours .
little was said ; and our chief embarrassment lay in the <unk> of the dog , who took exceeding interest in our proceedings .
he , at length , became so <unk> that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity ;  or , rather , this was the apprehension of legrand ;  for myself , i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home .
the noise was , at length , very effectually silenced by jupiter , who , getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation , tied the brute 's mouth up with one of his suspenders , and then returned , with a grave chuckle , to his task .
when the time mentioned had expired , we had reached a depth of five feet , and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest .
a general pause ensued , and i began to <name> that the farce was at an end .
legrand , however , although evidently much disconcerted , wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced .
we had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter , and now we slightly enlarged the limit , and went to the farther depth of two feet .
still nothing appeared .
the <unk> , whom i sincerely pitied , at length clambered from the pit , with the bitterest disappointment <unk> upon every feature , and proceeded , slowly and reluctantly , to put on his coat , which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor .
in the mean time i made no remark .
jupiter , at a signal from his master , began to gather up his tools .
this done , and the dog having been <unk> , we turned in profound silence towards home .
we had taken , perhaps , a dozen steps in this direction , when , with a loud oath , legrand strode up to jupiter , and seized him by the collar .
the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent , let fall the spades , and fell upon his knees .
" you scoundrel , " said legrand , hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth  " you infernal black villain !  speak , i tell you !  answer me this instant , without <unk> !  which  which is your left eye ? "
" oh , my golly , massa <name> !
aint dis here my lef eye for <unk> ? "
roared the terrified jupiter , placing his hand upon his right organ of vision , and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity , as if in immediate dread of his master 's attempt at a <unk> .
" i thought so !  i knew it !
hurrah ! "
<unk> legrand , letting the negro go , and executing a series of <unk> and <unk> , much to the astonishment of his valet , who , arising from his knees , looked , mutely , from his master to myself , and then from myself to his master .
" come !
we must go back , " said the latter , " the game 's not up yet ; " and he again led the way to the <unk> .
" jupiter , " said he , when we reached its foot , " come here !
was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards , or with the face to the limb ? "
" de face was out , massa , so dat de crows could get at de eyes good , widout any trouble . "
" well , then , was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle ? "
 here legrand touched each of jupiter 's eyes .
" twas dis eye , massa  de lef eye  jis as you tell me , " and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated .
" that <name> do  must try it again . "
here my friend , about whose madness i now saw , or fancied that i saw , certain indications of method , removed the <name> which marked the spot where the beetle fell , to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position .
taking , now , the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the <name> , as before , and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet , a spot was indicated , removed , by several yards , from the point at which we had been digging .
around the new position a circle , somewhat larger than in the former instance , was now described , and we again set to work with the spades .
i was dreadfully weary , but , scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts , i felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed .
i had become most unaccountably interested  nay , even excited .
perhaps there was something , amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrand  some air of forethought , or of deliberation , which impressed me .
i dug eagerly , and now and then caught myself actually looking , with something that very much resembled expectation , for the fancied treasure , the vision of which had <unk> my unfortunate companion .
at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me , and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half , we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog .
his uneasiness , in the first instance , had been , evidently , but the result of <unk> or <name> , but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone .
upon <unk> again attempting to muzzle him , he made furious resistance , and , leaping into the hole , tore up the mould frantically with his claws .
in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones , forming two complete skeletons , intermingled with several buttons of metal , and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen .
one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife , and , as we dug farther , three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light .
at sight of these the <name> of jupiter could scarcely be restrained , but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment he urged us , however , to continue our exertions , and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward , having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth .
we now worked in <name> , and never did i pass ten minutes of more intense excitement .
during this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood , which , from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness , had plainly been subjected to some <unk> process  perhaps that of the <unk> of mercury .
this box was three feet and a half long , three feet broad , and two and a half feet deep .
it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron , riveted , and forming a kind of open <unk> over the whole .
on each side of the chest , near the top , were three rings of iron  six in all  by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons .
our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the <unk> very slightly in its bed .
we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight .
luckily , the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts .
these we <name> back  trembling and panting with anxiety .
in an instant , a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us .
as the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit , there flashed upwards a glow and a glare , from a confused heap of gold and of jewels , that absolutely dazzled our eyes .
i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed .
amazement was , of course , predominant .
legrand appeared exhausted with excitement , and spoke very few words .
jupiter 's countenance wore , for some minutes , as deadly a pallor as it is possible , in nature of things , for any negro 's visage to assume .
he seemed <unk>  <unk> .
presently he fell upon his knees in the pit , and , burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold , let them there remain , as if enjoying the luxury of a bath .
at length , with a deep sigh , he exclaimed , as if in a soliloquy , " and dis all cum ob de <unk> !
de putty <unk> bug !
de poor little <unk> , what i <unk> in dat <unk> kind ob style !
aint you shamed ob yourself , nigger ?  answer me dat ! "
it became necessary , at last , that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure .
it was growing late , and it <unk> us to make exertion , that we might get every thing housed before daylight .
it was difficult to say what should be done , and much time was spent in deliberation  so confused were the ideas of all .
we , finally , lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents , when we were enabled , with some trouble , to raise it from the hole .
the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles , and the dog left to guard them , with strict orders from jupiter neither , upon any pretence , to stir from the spot , nor to open his mouth until our return .
we then hurriedly made for home with the chest ; reaching the hut in safety , but after excessive toil , at one o'clock in the morning .
worn out as we were , it was not in human nature to do more immediately .
we rested until two , and had supper ; starting for the hills immediately afterwards , armed with three stout sacks , which , by good luck , were upon the premises .
a little before four we arrived at the pit , divided the remainder of the booty , as equally as might be , among us , and , leaving the holes <unk> , again set out for the hut , at which , for the second time , we deposited our golden <unk> , just as the first faint streaks of the <name> gleamed from over the tree-tops in the east .
we were now thoroughly broken down ; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose .
after an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours ' duration , we arose , as if by <unk> , to make examination of our treasure .
the chest had been full to the brim , and we spent the whole day , and the greater part of the next night , in a scrutiny of its contents .
there had been nothing like order or arrangement .
every thing had been heaped in promiscuously .
having assorted all with care , we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed .
in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars  estimating the value of the pieces , as accurately as we could , by the tables of the period .
there was not a particle of silver .
all was gold of antique date and of great variety  french , spanish , and <name> money , with a few english guineas , and some counters , of which we had never seen specimens before .
there were several very large and heavy coins , so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions .
there was no american money .
the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating .
there were diamonds  some of them exceedingly large and fine  a hundred and ten in all , and not one of them small ; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy ;  three hundred and ten emeralds , all very beautiful ; and twenty-one <unk> , with an <name> .
these stones had all been broken from their <unk> and thrown loose in the chest .
the <unk> themselves , which we picked out from among the other gold , appeared to have been beaten up with hammers , as if to prevent identification .
besides all this , there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments ;  nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings ;  <name> chains  thirty of these , if i remember ;  <unk> very large and heavy <unk> ;  five gold <unk> of great value ;  a prodigious golden punch bowl , ornamented with richly chased <unk> and <unk> figures ; with two <unk> exquisitely <unk> , and many other smaller articles which i can not recollect .
the weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds <unk> ; and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and <unk> superb gold watches ; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars , if one .
many of them were very old , and as time keepers valueless ; the works having suffered , more or less , from <unk>  but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth .
we estimated the entire contents of the chest , that night , at a million and a half of dollars ; and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels ( a few being retained for our own use ) , it was found that we had greatly <unk> the treasure .
when , at length , we had concluded our examination , and the intense excitement of the time had , in some measure , subsided , legrand , who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle , entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it .
" you remember ; " said he , " the night when i handed you the rough sketch i had made of the scarabæus .
you recollect also , that i became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a <unk> .
when you first made this assertion i thought you were jesting ; but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect , and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact .
still , the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me  for i am considered a good artist  and , therefore , when you handed me the scrap of parchment , i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire . "
" the scrap of paper , you mean , " said i .
" no ; it had much of the appearance of paper , and at first i supposed it to be such , but when i came to draw upon it , i discovered it , at once , to be a piece of very thin parchment .
it was quite dirty , you remember .
well , as i was in the very act of <unk> it up , my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking , and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceived , in fact , the figure of a <unk> just where , it seemed to me , i had made the drawing of the beetle .
for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy .
i knew that my design was very different in detail from this  although there was a certain similarity in general outline .
presently i took a candle , and seating myself at the other end of the room , proceeded to <unk> the parchment more closely .
upon turning it over , i saw my own sketch upon the reverse , just as i had made it .
my first idea , now , was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline  at the singular coincidence involved in the fact , that unknown to me , there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment , immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus , and that this skull , not only in outline , but in size , should so closely resemble my drawing .
i say the <unk> of this coincidence absolutely <unk> me for a time .
this is the usual effect of such coincidences .
the mind struggles to establish a connexion  a sequence of cause and effect  and , being unable to do so , suffers a species of temporary paralysis .
but , when i recovered from this stupor , there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence .
i began distinctly , positively , to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarabæus .
i became perfectly certain of this ; for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other , in search of the cleanest spot .
had the skull been then there , of course i could not have failed to notice it .
here was indeed a mystery which i felt it impossible to explain ; but , even at that early moment , there seemed to glimmer , faintly , within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect , a <unk> <name> of that truth which last night 's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration .
i arose at once , and putting the parchment securely away , dismissed all farther reflection until i should be alone .
" when you had gone , and when jupiter was fast asleep , i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair .
in the first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession .
the spot where we discovered the <unk> was on the coast of the main land , about a mile eastward of the island , and but a short distance above high water <name> .
upon my taking hold of it , it gave me a sharp bite , which caused me to let it drop .
jupiter , with his accustomed caution , before seizing the insect , which had flown towards him , looked about him for a leaf , or something of that nature , by which to take hold of it .
it was at this moment that his eyes , and mine also , fell upon the scrap of parchment , which i then supposed to be paper .
it was lying half buried in the sand , a corner sticking up .
near the spot where we found it , i observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship 's long boat .
the wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while ; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced .
" well , jupiter picked up the parchment , wrapped the beetle in it , and gave it to me .
soon afterwards we turned to go home , and on the way met lieutenant g .
i showed him the insect , and he begged me to let him take it to the fort .
upon my consenting , he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket , without the parchment in which it had been wrapped , and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection .
perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind , and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once  you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with natural history .
at the same time , without being conscious of it , i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket .
" you remember that when i went to the table , for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle , i found no paper where it was usually kept .
i looked in the drawer , and found none there .
i searched my pockets , hoping to find an old letter , when my hand fell upon the parchment .
i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession ; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force .
" no doubt you <name> think me fanciful  but i had already established a kind of connexion .
i had put together two links of a great chain .
there was a boat lying upon a sea-coast , and not far from the boat was a parchment  not a paper  with a skull depicted upon it .
you <name> , of course , ask 'where is the connexion ? '
i reply that the skull , or <unk> , is the well-known emblem of the pirate .
the flag of the death 's head is hoisted in all engagements .
" i have said that the scrap was parchment , and not paper .
parchment is <unk>  almost imperishable .
matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment ; since , for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing , it is not nearly so well adapted as paper .
this reflection suggested some meaning  some relevancy  in the <unk> .
i did not fail to observe , also , the form of the parchment .
although one of its corners had been , by some accident , destroyed , it could be seen that the original form was oblong .
it was just such a slip , indeed , as might have been chosen for a memorandum  for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved . "
" but , " i interposed , " you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle .
how then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull  since this latter , according to your own admission , must have been designed ( god only knows how or by whom ) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus ? "
" ah , hereupon turns the whole mystery ; although the secret , at this point , i had comparatively little difficulty in solving .
my steps were sure , and could afford but a single result .
i reasoned , for example , thus : when i <name> the scarabæus , there was no skull apparent upon the parchment .
when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you , and observed you narrowly until you returned it .
you , therefore , did not design the skull , and no one else was present to do it .
then it was not done by human agency .
and nevertheless it was done .
" at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember , and did remember , with entire distinctness , every incident which occurred about the period in question .
the weather was chilly ( oh rare and happy accident !
) , and a fire was blazing upon the hearth .
i was heated with exercise and sat near the table .
you , however , had drawn a chair close to the chimney .
just as i placed the parchment in your hand , and as you were in the act of inspecting it , wolf , the newfoundland , entered , and leaped upon your shoulders .
with your left hand you caressed him and kept him off , while your right , holding the parchment , was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees , and in close proximity to the fire .
at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it , and was about to caution you , but , before i could speak , you had withdrawn it , and were engaged in its examination .
when i considered all these particulars , i doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light , upon the parchment , the skull which i saw designed upon it .
you are well aware that chemical preparations exist , and have existed time out of mind , by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or <unk> , so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire .
<unk> , digested in <unk> <unk> , and diluted with four times its weight of water , is sometimes employed ; a green tint results .
the regulus of cobalt , dissolved in spirit of nitre , gives a red .
these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools , but again become apparent upon the <unk> of heat .
" i now scrutinized the <unk> with care .
its outer edges  the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the <unk>  were far more distinct than the others .
it was clear that the action of the <unk> had been imperfect or unequal .
i immediately kindled a fire , and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat .
at first , the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull ; but , upon persevering in the experiment , there became visible , at the corner of the slip , diagonally opposite to the spot in which the <unk> was delineated , the figure of what i at first supposed to be a goat .
a closer scrutiny , however , satisfied me that it was intended for a kid . "
" <name> !
<name> ! "
said i , " to be sure i have no right to laugh at you  a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth  but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain  you <name> not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat  pirates , you know , have nothing to do with goats ; they <unk> to the farming interest . "
" but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat . "
" well , a kid then  pretty much the same thing . "
" pretty much , but not altogether , " said legrand .
" you may have heard of one captain kidd .
i at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of <unk> or <unk> signature .
i say signature ; because its position upon the <unk> suggested this idea .
the <unk> at the corner diagonally opposite , had , in the same manner , the air of a stamp , or seal .
but i was sorely put out by the absence of all else  of the body to my imagined instrument  of the text for my <unk> . "
" i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature . "
" something of that kind .
the fact is , i felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending .
i can scarcely say why .
perhaps , after all , it was rather a <name> than an actual belief ;  but do you know that jupiter 's silly words , about the bug being of solid gold , had a remarkable effect upon my fancy ?
and then the series of accidents and coincidences  these were so very extraordinary .
do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been , or may be , sufficiently cool for fire , and that without the fire , or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared , i should never have become aware of the <unk> , and so never the possessor of the treasure ? "
" but proceed  i am all impatience . "
" well ; you have heard , of course , the many stories current  the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried , somewhere upon the atlantic coast , by kidd and his associates .
these rumors must have had some foundation in fact .
and that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous , could have resulted , it appeared to me , only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed .
had kidd concealed his plunder for a time , and afterwards reclaimed it , the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form .
you <name> observe that the stories told are all about <unk> , not about <unk> .
had the pirate recovered his money , there the affair would have dropped .
it seemed to me that some accident  say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality  had deprived him of the means of recovering it , and that this accident had become known to his followers , who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all , and who , <unk> themselves in vain , because <unk> attempts , to regain it , had given first birth , and then universal currency , to the reports which are now so common .
have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast ? "
" never . "
" but that kidd 's accumulations were immense , is well known .
i took it for granted , therefore , that the earth still held them ; and you <name> scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a <name> , nearly amounting to certainty , that the parchment so strangely found , involved a lost record of the place of deposit . "
" but how did you proceed ? "
" i held the <unk> again to the fire , after increasing the heat ; but nothing appeared .
i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure ; so i carefully <unk> the parchment by pouring warm water over it , and , having done this , i placed it in a tin pan , with the skull downwards , and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal .
in a few minutes , the pan having become thoroughly heated , i removed the slip , and , to my inexpressible <name> , found it spotted , in several places , with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines .
again i placed it in the pan , and suffered it to remain another minute .
upon taking it off , the whole was just as you see it now . "
here legrand , having <unk> the parchment , submitted it to my inspection .
the following characters were rudely traced , in a red tint , between the <unk> and the goat : " <unk> ) ) <unk> ; <unk> ) <unk> ) <unk> ) ; <unk> ; <unk> ) ) 85 ; <unk> ) ; : <unk> <unk> ( 88 ) <unk> ; 46 ( ; <unk> ?
; 8 ) <unk> ( ; 485 ) ; <unk> : <unk> ( ; <unk> 2 ( <unk>  4 ) <unk> ; <unk> ) ; ) <unk> ) <unk> ; 1 ( <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; 4 <unk> ; 4 ) <unk> ( <unk> ; 48 ; ( 88 ; 4 ( <unk> ? 34 ; 48 ) <unk> ; 161 ; : 188 ; <unk> ?
; " " but , " said i , returning him the slip , " i am as much in the dark as ever .
were all the jewels of <unk> awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma , i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them . "
" and yet , " said legrand , " the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters .
these characters , as any one might readily guess , form a cipher  that is to say , they convey a meaning ; but then , from what is known of kidd , i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse <unk> .
i made up my mind , at once , that this was of a simple species  such , however , as would appear , to the crude intellect of the sailor , absolutely insoluble without the key . "
" and you really solved it ? "
" readily ; i have solved others of an <unk> ten thousand times greater .
circumstances , and a certain bias of mind , have led me to take interest in such riddles , and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not , by proper application , resolve .
in fact , having once established connected and <unk> characters , i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import .
" in the present case  indeed in all cases of secret writing  the first question regards the language of the cipher ; for the principles of solution , so far , especially , as the more simple <unk> are concerned , depend upon , and are varied by , the genius of the particular <unk> .
in general , there is no alternative but experiment ( directed by probabilities ) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution , until the true one be attained .
but , with the cipher now before us , all difficulty was removed by the signature .
the pun upon the word <unk> is appreciable in no other language than the english .
but for this consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french , as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main .
as it was , i assumed the <unk> to be english .
" you observe there are no divisions between the words .
had there been divisions , the task would have been comparatively easy .
in such case i should have commenced with a <unk> and analysis of the shorter words , and , had a word of a single letter occurred , as is most likely , ( a or i , for example , ) i should have considered the solution as assured .
but , there being no division , my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters , as well as the least frequent .
counting all , i constructed a table , thus : of the character 8 there are <unk> ; " 26 .

" now , in english , the letter which most frequently occurs is e. afterwards , succession runs thus : a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z .
e <unk> so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen , in which it is not the prevailing character .
" here , then , we leave , in the very beginning , the <unk> for something more than a mere guess .
the general use which may be made of the table is obvious  but , in this particular cipher , we shall only very partially require its aid .
as our predominant character is 8 , we <name> commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet .
to verify the supposition , let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples  for e is doubled with great frequency in english  in such words , for example , as <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' been , ' <unk> , ' & c. in the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times , although the <unk> is brief .
" let us assume 8 , then , as e .
now , of all words in the language , 'the ' is most usual ; let us see , therefore , whether there are not repetitions of any three characters , in the same order of <unk> , the last of them being 8 .
if we discover repetitions of such letters , so arranged , they <name> most probably represent the word 'the . '
upon inspection , we find no less than seven such arrangements , the characters being ; 48 .
we may , therefore , assume that ; represents t , 4 represents h , and 8 represents e  the last being now well confirmed .
thus a great step has been taken .
" but , having established a single word , we are enabled to establish a vastly important point ; that is to say , several <unk> and terminations of other words .
let us refer , for example , to the last instance but one , in which the combination ; 48 occurs  not far from the end of the cipher .
we know that the ; immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word , and , of the six characters succeeding this 'the , ' we are cognizant of no less than five .
let us set these characters down , thus , by the letters we know them to represent , leaving a space for the unknown  t <unk> .
" here we are enabled , at once , to discard the <unk> , ' as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t ; since , by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy , we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part .
we are thus narrowed into t <unk> , and , going through the alphabet , if necessary , as before , we arrive at the word <unk> , ' as the sole possible reading .
we thus gain another letter , r , represented by ( , with the words 'the tree ' in <unk> .
" looking beyond these words , for a short distance , we again see the combination ; 48 , and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes .
we have thus this arrangement : the tree ; 4 ( <unk> ? 34 the , or , substituting the natural letters , where known , it reads thus : the tree <unk> ? <unk> the .
" now , if , in place of the unknown characters , we leave blank spaces , or substitute dots , we read thus : the tree <unk> ... h the , when the word <unk> ' makes itself evident at once .
but this discovery gives us three new letters , o , u and g , represented by <unk> ?
and 3 .
" looking now , narrowly , through the cipher for combinations of known characters , we find , not very far from the beginning , this arrangement , 83 ( 88 , or <unk> , which , plainly , is the conclusion of the word <unk> , ' and gives us another letter , d , represented by <unk> .
" four letters beyond the word <unk> , ' we perceive the combination ; 46 ( ; 88 .
" translating the known characters , and representing the unknown by dots , as before , we read thus : th <unk> .
an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word <unk> , ' and again furnishing us with two new characters , i and n , represented by 6 and * .
" referring , now , to the beginning of the <unk> , we find the combination , <unk> .
" translating , as before , we obtain good , which assures us that the first letter is a , and that the first two words are 'a good . '
" it is now time that we arrange our key , as far as discovered , in a <unk> form , to avoid confusion .
it <name> stand thus : 5 represents a <unk> " d 8 " e 3 " g 4 " h 6 " i * " n <unk> " o ( " r ; " t " we have , therefore , no less than ten of the most important letters represented , and it <name> be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution .
i have said enough to convince you that <unk> of this nature are readily soluble , and to give you some insight into the <unk> of their development .
but be assured that the specimen before us <unk> to the very simplest species of <unk> .
it now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment , as <unk> .
here it is : " <unk> good glass in the bishop 's <unk> in the devil 's seat forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the <unk> a <name> line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out . ' "
" but , " said i , " the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever .
how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this <unk> about <unk> 's seats , ' <unk> 's heads , ' and <unk> 's hotels ? ' "
" i confess , " replied legrand , " that the matter still wears a serious aspect , when regarded with a casual glance .
my first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the <unk> . "
" you mean , to <unk> it ? "
" something of that kind . "
" but how was it possible to effect this ? "
" i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division , so as to increase the difficulty of solution .
now , a not <unk> man , in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to <unk> the matter .
when , in the course of his composition , he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause , or a point , he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters , at this place , more than usually close together .
if you <name> observe the ms. , in the present instance , you <name> easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding .
acting upon this hint , i made the division thus : 'a good glass in the bishop 's <unk> in the devil 's seat  forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes  northeast and by north  main branch seventh limb east side  shoot from the left eye of the <unk>  a <unk> from the tree through the shot fifty feet out . ' "
" even this division , " said i , " leaves me still in the dark . "
" it left me also in the dark , " replied legrand , " for a few days ; during which i made diligent inquiry , in the neighborhood of sullivan 's island , for any building which went by the name of the <unk> 's hotel ; ' for , of course , i dropped the obsolete word <unk> . '
gaining no information on the subject , i was on the point of extending my sphere of search , and proceeding in a more systematic manner , when , one morning , it entered into my head , quite suddenly , that this <unk> 's <unk> ' might have some reference to an old family , of the name of <unk> , which , time out of mind , had held possession of an ancient <unk> , about four miles to the northward of the island .
i accordingly went over to the plantation , and <unk> my inquiries among the older negroes of the place .
at length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as <unk> 's castle , and thought that she could guide me to it , but that it was not a castle nor a tavern , but a high rock .
" i offered to pay her well for her trouble , and , after some demur , she consented to accompany me to the spot .
we found it without much difficulty , when , dismissing her , i proceeded to examine the place .
the <unk> ' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks  one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its apex , and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done .
" while i was busied in reflection , my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock , perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stood .
this ledge projected about eighteen inches , and was not more than a foot wide , while a niche in the <name> just above it , gave it a rude resemblance to one of the <unk> chairs used by our ancestors .
i made no doubt that here was the <unk> 's seat ' alluded to in the ms. , and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle .
" the 'good glass , ' i knew , could have reference to nothing but a telescope ; for the word <unk> ' is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen .
now here , i at once saw , was a telescope to be used , and a definite point of view , admitting no variation , from which to use it .
nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases , " forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes , ' and <unk> and by north , ' were intended as directions for the <unk> of the glass .
greatly excited by these discoveries , i hurried home , procured a telescope , and returned to the rock .
" i let myself down to the ledge , and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position .
this fact confirmed my preconceived idea .
i proceeded to use the glass .
of course , the <unk> degrees and thirteen minutes ' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon , since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words , <unk> and by north . '
this latter direction i at once established by means of a <unk> ; then , pointing the glass as nearly at an <name> of forty-one degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess , i moved it cautiously up or down , until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that <unk> its fellows in the distance .
in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot , but could not , at first , distinguish what it was .
adjusting the focus of the telescope , i again looked , and now made it out to be a human skull .
" upon this discovery i was so <unk> as to consider the enigma solved ; for the phrase <unk> branch , seventh limb , east side , ' could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree , while <unk> from the left eye of the death 's head ' admitted , also , of but one interpretation , in regard to a search for buried treasure .
i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull , and that a <unk> , or , in other words , a straight line , drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot , ' ( or the spot where the bullet fell , ) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet , would indicate a definite point  and beneath this point i thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed . "
" all this , " i said , " is exceedingly clear , and , although ingenious , still simple and explicit .
when you left the bishop 's hotel , what then ? "
" why , having carefully taken the bearings of the tree , i turned <unk> .
the instant that i left 'the devil 's seat , ' however , the circular rift vanished ; nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards , turn as i would .
what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business , is the fact ( for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact ) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock .
" in this expedition to the <unk> 's hotel ' i had been attended by jupiter , who had , no doubt , observed , for some weeks past , the abstraction of my demeanor , and took especial care not to leave me alone .
but , on the next day , getting up very early , i contrived to give him the slip , and went into the hills in search of the tree .
after much toil i found it .
when i came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging .
with the rest of the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself . "
" i suppose , " said i , " you missed the spot , in the first attempt at digging , through jupiter 's stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull . "
" precisely .
this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the <unk> '  that is to say , in the position of the <name> nearest the tree ; and had the treasure been beneath the <unk> , ' the error would have been of little moment ; but 'the shot , ' together with the nearest point of the tree , were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction ; of course the error , however trivial in the beginning , increased as we proceeded with the line , and by the time we had gone fifty feet , threw us quite off the scent .
but for my deep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried , we might have had all our labor in vain . "
" but your <unk> , and your conduct in swinging the beetle  how excessively odd !
i was sure you were mad .
and why did you insist upon letting fall the bug , instead of a bullet , from the skull ? "
" why , to be <name> , i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity , and so resolved to punish you quietly , in my own way , by a little bit of sober <unk> .
for this reason i swung the beetle , and for this reason i let it fall it from the tree .
an observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea . "
" yes , i perceive ; and now there is only one point which puzzles me .
what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole ? "
" that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself .
there seems , however , only one plausible way of accounting for them  and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply .
it is clear that kidd  if kidd indeed secreted this treasure , which i doubt not  it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor .
but this labor concluded , he may have thought it expedient to remove all <unk> in his secret .
perhaps a couple of blows with a <unk> were sufficient , while his <unk> were busy in the pit ; perhaps it required a dozen  who shall tell ? "
four beasts in one  the <unk> <unk> a ses <unk> .
 <unk> 's xerxes. antiochus <unk> is very generally looked upon as the <unk> of the prophet <name> .
this honor is , however , more properly <unk> to cambyses , the son of <name> .
and , indeed , the character of the syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any <unk> embellishment .
his accession to the throne , or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty , a hundred and <unk> years before the coming of christ ; his attempt to plunder the <name> of <name> at ephesus ; his implacable hostility to the jews ; his pollution of the holy of <unk> ; and his miserable death at <unk> , after a tumultuous reign of eleven years , are circumstances of a prominent kind , and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious , dastardly , cruel , silly , and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation .
let us suppose , gentle reader , that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty , and let us , for a few minutes , imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man , the remarkable city of antioch .
to be sure there were , in syria and other countries , sixteen cities of that appellation , besides the one to which i more particularly allude .
but ours is that which went by the name of <unk> <unk> , from its vicinity to the little village of <name> , where stood a <name> to that divinity .
it was built ( although about this matter there is some dispute ) by seleucus <unk> , the first king of the country after <name> the great , in memory of his father antiochus , and became immediately the residence of the syrian monarchy .
in the flourishing times of the <name> empire , it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces ; and many of the emperors of the <name> city ( among whom may be mentioned , especially , <unk> and <unk> ) spent here the greater part of their time .
but i perceive we have arrived at the city itself .
let us ascend this <unk> , and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country .
" what broad and rapid river is that which forces its way , with innumerable falls , through the mountainous wilderness , and finally through the wilderness of buildings ? "
that is the <unk> , and it is the only water in sight , with the exception of the mediterranean , which stretches , like a broad mirror , about twelve miles off to the southward .
every one has seen the mediterranean ; but let me tell you , there are few who have had a peep at antioch .
by few , i mean , few who , like you and me , have had , at the same time , the advantages of a modern education .
therefore cease to regard that sea , and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us .
you <name> remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty .
were it later  for example , were it the year of our lord eighteen hundred and forty-five , we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle .
in the nineteenth century antioch is  that is to say , antioch <name> be  in a lamentable state of decay .
it <name> have been , by that time , totally destroyed , at three different periods , by three successive earthquakes .
indeed , to say the truth , what little of its former self may then remain , <name> be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to damascus .
this is well .
i see you profit by my advice , and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises  in satisfying your eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that most renown this city.  i beg pardon ; i had forgotten that shakespeare <name> not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come .
but does not the appearance of <unk> justify me in calling it grotesque ?
" it is well fortified ; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to <name> . "
very true .
" there are a prodigious number of stately palaces . "
there are .
" and the numerous temples , sumptuous and magnificent , may bear comparison with the most <unk> of antiquity . "
all this i must acknowledge .
still there is an infinity of mud huts , and abominable hovels .
we can not help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel , and , were it not for the <unk> fumes of idolatrous incense , i have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench .
did you ever behold streets so <unk> narrow , or houses so miraculously tall ?
what gloom their shadows cast upon the ground !
it is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day ; we should otherwise have the darkness of egypt in the time of her desolation .
" it is certainly a strange place !
what is the meaning of yonder singular building ?
see !
it towers above all others , and lies to the eastward of what i take to be the <name> palace . "
that is the new <name> of the sun , who is adored in syria under the title of <unk> <unk> .
hereafter a very notorious <name> emperor <name> institute this worship in rome , and thence derive a <unk> , <unk> .
i dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the <name> .
you need not look up at the heavens ; his <unk> is not there  at least not the <unk> adored by the <unk> .
that deity <name> be found in the interior of yonder building .
he is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid , whereby is denoted fire .
" hark  behold !  who can those ridiculous beings be , half naked , with their faces painted , shouting and gesticulating to the rabble ? "
some few are <unk> .
others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers .
the greatest portion , however  those especially who <unk> the populace with clubs  are the principal courtiers of the palace , executing as in duty bound , some laudable <unk> of the king 's .
" but what have we here ?
heavens !
the town is swarming with wild beasts !
how terrible a spectacle !  how dangerous a peculiarity ! "
terrible , if you please ; but not in the least degree dangerous .
each animal if you <name> take the pains to observe , is following , very quietly , in the wake of its master .
some few , to be sure , are led with a rope about the neck , but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species .
the lion , the tiger , and the leopard are entirely without restraint .
they have been trained without difficulty to their present profession , and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of <unk> .
it is true , there are occasions when nature asserts her violated dominions ;  but then the devouring of a <unk> , or the <unk> of a consecrated bull , is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in <unk> .
" but what extraordinary tumult do i hear ?
surely this is a loud noise even for antioch !
it argues some commotion of unusual interest . "
yes  undoubtedly .
the king has ordered some novel spectacle  some <unk> exhibition at the hippodrome  or perhaps the massacre of the scythian prisoners  or the conflagration of his new palace  or the tearing down of a handsome <name>  or , indeed , a bonfire of a few jews .
the uproar increases .
shouts of laughter ascend the skies .
the air becomes <unk> with wind instruments , and horrible with clamor of a million throats .
let us descend , for the love of fun , and see what is going on !
this way  be careful !
here we are in the principal street , which is called the street of <unk> .
the sea of people is coming this way , and we shall find a difficulty in <unk> the tide .
they are pouring through the alley of <unk> , which leads directly from the palace ;  therefore the king is most probably among the rioters .
yes ;  i hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the east .
we shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the <name> of <unk> .
let us <unk> ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary ; he <name> be here anon .
in the meantime let us survey this image .
what is it ?
oh !
it is the god <unk> in proper person .
you perceive , however , that he is neither a lamb , nor a goat , nor a <unk> , neither has he much resemblance to the pan of the <unk> .
yet all these appearances have been given  i beg pardon  <name> be given  by the learned of future ages , to the <unk> of the <unk> .
put on your spectacles , and tell me what it is .
what is it ?
" bless me !
it is an ape ! "
true  a baboon ; but by no means the less a deity .
his name is a derivation of the greek <unk>  what great fools are <unk> !
but see !  see !  yonder <unk> a ragged little urchin .
where is he going ?
what is he <unk> about ?
what does he say ?
oh !
he says the king is coming in triumph ; that he is dressed in state ; that he has just finished putting to death , with his own hand , a thousand chained <unk> prisoners !
for this exploit the <unk> is <unk> him to the skies .
hark !
here comes a troop of a similar description .
they have made a latin hymn upon the valor of the king , and are singing it as they go : mille , mille , mille , mille , mille , mille , <unk> , <unk> <unk> !
mille , mille , mille , mille , <unk> !
mille , mille , mille , <unk> qui mille mille <unk> !
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
( *1 ) which may be thus <unk> : a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , we , with one warrior , have slain !
a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand .
sing a thousand over again !
<unk> !  let us sing long life to our king , who knocked over a thousand so fine !
<unk> !  let us roar , he has given us more red gallons of gore than all syria can furnish of wine !
" do you hear that flourish of trumpets ? "
yes : the king is coming !
see !
the people are aghast with admiration , and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence .
he comes ;  he is coming ;  there he is !
" who ?  where ?  the king ?  do not behold him  can not say that i perceive him . "
then you must be blind .
" very possible .
still i see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen , who are busy in <unk> themselves before a gigantic <unk> , and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal 's hoofs .
see !
the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over  and another  and another  and another .
indeed , i can not help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet . "
rabble , indeed !  why these are the <name> and free citizens of <unk> !
beasts , did you say ?  take care that you are not overheard .
do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man ?
why , my dear sir , that <unk> is no other than antiochus <unk> , antiochus the illustrious , king of syria , and the most potent of all the <unk> of the east !
it is true , that he is entitled , at times , antiochus <unk>  antiochus the madman  but that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits .
it is also certain that he is at present <unk> in the hide of a beast , and is doing his best to play the part of a <unk> ; but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king .
besides , the monarch is of gigantic stature , and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large .
we may , however , presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state .
such , you <name> allow , is the massacre of a thousand jews .
with how superior a dignity the monarch <unk> on all fours !
his tail , you perceive , is held aloft by his two principal <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing , were it not for the protuberance of his eyes , which <name> certainly start out of his head , and the queer color of his face , which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed .
let us follow him to the hippodrome , whither he is proceeding , and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing : who is king but <unk> ?
say  do you know ?
who is king but <unk> ?
bravo !  bravo !
there is none but <unk> , no  there is none : so tear down the temples , and put out the sun !
well and strenuously <name> !
the populace are hailing him <unk> of poets , ' as well as <unk> of the east , ' <unk> of the universe , ' and 'most remarkable of <unk> . '
they have <unk> his effusion , and do you hear ?  he is singing it over again .
when he arrives at the hippodrome , he <name> be crowned with the poetic wreath , in anticipation of his victory at the approaching <unk> .
" but , good jupiter !
what is the matter in the crowd behind us ? "
behind us , did you say ?  oh !
ah !  i perceive .
my friend , it is well that you spoke in time .
let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible .
here !  let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this <unk> , and i <name> inform you presently of the origin of the commotion .
it has turned out as i have been anticipating .
the singular appearance of the <unk> and the head of a man , has , it seems , given offence to the notions of propriety entertained , in general , by the wild animals domesticated in the city .
a mutiny has been the result ; and , as is usual upon such occasions , all human efforts <name> be of no avail in <unk> the mob .
several of the <unk> have already been devoured ; but the general voice of the <unk> patriots seems to be for eating up the <unk> .
'the <name> of poets , ' therefore , is upon his hinder legs , running for his life .
his courtiers have left him in the lurch , and his <unk> have followed so excellent an example .
<unk> of the universe , ' thou <name> in a sad predicament !
<unk> of the east , ' thou <name> in danger of <unk> !
therefore never regard so piteously thy tail ; it <name> undoubtedly be draggled in the mud , and for this there is no help .
look not behind thee , then , at its unavoidable degradation ; but take courage , ply thy legs with vigor , and scud for the hippodrome !
remember that thou <name> antiochus <unk> .
antiochus the illustrious !  also <unk> of poets , ' <unk> of the east , ' <unk> of the universe , ' and 'most remarkable of <unk> ! '
heavens !
what a power of speed thou <name> displaying !
what a capacity for <unk> thou <name> developing !
run , <name> !  bravo , <unk> !
well done , <unk> !  glorious antiochus !  he runs !  he leaps !  he flies !
like an arrow from a <unk> he approaches the hippodrome !
he leaps !  he shrieks !  he is there !
this is well ; for <unk> thou , <unk> of the east , ' been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the amphitheatre , there is not a bear 's cub in <unk> that would not have had a nibble at thy <unk> .
let us be off  let us take our departure !  for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king's escape !
listen !
it has already commenced .
see !  the whole town is <unk> .
" surely this is the most populous city of the east !
what a wilderness of people !
what a jumble of all ranks and ages !
what a multiplicity of sects and nations !
what a variety of costumes !
what a babel of languages !
what a screaming of beasts !
what a tinkling of instruments !
what a parcel of philosophers ! "
come let us be off .
" stay a moment !
i see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome ; what is the meaning of it , i beseech you ? "
that ?  oh , nothing !
the <name> and free citizens of <unk> being , as they declare , well satisfied of the <name> , valor , wisdom , and divinity of their king , and having , moreover , been <unk> of his late superhuman agility , do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows ( in addition to the poetic crown ) with the wreath of victory in the <unk>  a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next <unk> , and which , therefore , they now give him in advance .
footnotes  four beasts ( *1 ) <unk> <unk> says , that the hymn here introduced was <name> by the rabble upon the occasion of <unk> , in the <unk> war , having slain , with his own hand , nine hundred and fifty of the enemy .
the murders in the rue morgue what song the <unk> sang , or what name achilles assumed when he hid himself among women , although puzzling questions , are not beyond all conjecture .
 sir <name> <unk> the mental features discoursed of as the analytical , are , in themselves , but little susceptible of analysis .
we appreciate them only in their effects .
we know of them , among other things , that they are always to their possessor , when inordinately possessed , a source of the liveliest enjoyment .
as the strong man <unk> in his physical ability , <unk> in such exercises as call his muscles into action , so glories the <unk> in that moral activity which <unk> he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play .
he is fond of <unk> , of <unk> , of hieroglyphics ; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of <unk> which appears to the ordinary apprehension <unk> .
his results , brought about by the very soul and essence of method , have , in truth , the whole air of intuition .
the faculty of <unk> is possibly much <unk> by mathematical study , and especially by that highest branch of it which , unjustly , and merely on account of its retrograde operations , has been called , as if par excellence , analysis .
yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse .
a chess-player , for example , does the one without effort at the other .
it follows that the game of chess , in its effects upon mental character , is greatly misunderstood .
i am not now writing a treatise , but simply <unk> a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random ; i <name> , therefore , take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more <unk> <unk> by the unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess .
in this latter , where the pieces have different and bizarre motions , with various and variable values , what is only complex is mistaken ( a not unusual error ) for what is profound .
the attention is here called powerfully into play .
if it flag for an instant , an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat .
the possible moves being not only manifold but <unk> , the chances of such <unk> are multiplied ; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more <unk> rather than the more acute player who conquers .
in draughts , on the contrary , where the moves are unique and have but little variation , the probabilities of <unk> are diminished , and the mere attention being left comparatively <unk> , what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior <unk> .
to be less abstract  let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings , and where , of course , no oversight is to be expected .
it is obvious that here the victory can be decided ( the players being at all equal ) only by some <unk> movement , the result of some strong exertion of the intellect .
deprived of ordinary resources , the <unk> throws himself into the spirit of his opponent , <unk> himself therewith , and not unfrequently sees thus , at a glance , the sole methods ( sometime indeed absurdly simple ones ) by which he may <unk> into error or hurry into <unk> .
whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power ; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it , while <unk> chess as frivolous .
beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly <unk> the faculty of analysis .
the best chess-player in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess ; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind .
when i say proficiency , i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived .
these are not only manifold but multiform , and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding .
to observe attentively is to remember distinctly ; and , so far , the <unk> chess-player <name> do very well at whist ; while the rules of <unk> ( themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game ) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible .
thus to have a <unk> memory , and to proceed by " the book , " are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing .
but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the <unk> is evinced .
he makes , in silence , a host of observations and inferences .
so , perhaps , do his companions ; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained , lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation .
the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe .
our player confines himself not at all ; nor , because the game is the object , does he reject deductions from things external to the game .
he examines the countenance of his partner , comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents .
he considers the mode of <unk> the cards in each hand ; often counting trump by trump , and honor by honor , through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each .
he notes every variation of face as the play progresses , gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty , of surprise , of triumph , or of chagrin .
from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit .
he <unk> what is played through <unk> , by the air with which it is thrown upon the table .
a casual or <unk> word ; the accidental dropping or turning of a card , with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment ; the counting of the tricks , with the order of their arrangement ; embarrassment , hesitation , eagerness or trepidation  all afford , to his apparently <unk> perception , indications of the true state of affairs .
the first two or three rounds having been played , he is in full possession of the contents of each hand , and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own .
the analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity ; for while the <unk> is necessarily ingenious , the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis .
the constructive or combining power , by which ingenuity is usually manifested , and to which the <unk> ( i believe erroneously ) have assigned a separate organ , supposing it a primitive faculty , has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon <unk> , as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals .
between ingenuity and the <unk> ability there exists a difference far greater , indeed , than that between the fancy and the imagination , but of a character very strictly analogous .
it <name> be found , in fact , that the ingenious are always fanciful , and the truly imaginative never otherwise than <unk> .
the narrative which follows <name> appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced .
residing in <name> during the spring and part of the summer of 18  , i there became acquainted with a monsieur c. auguste dupin .
this young gentleman was of an excellent  indeed of an illustrious family , but , by a variety of untoward events , had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it , and he ceased to <unk> himself in the world , or to care for the <unk> of his fortunes .
by courtesy of his creditors , there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his <unk> ; and , upon the income arising from this , he managed , by means of a rigorous economy , to procure the necessaries of life , without troubling himself about its <unk> .
books , indeed , were his sole luxuries , and in <name> these are easily obtained .
our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue <unk> , where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume , brought us into closer communion .
we saw each other again and again .
i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a frenchman <unk> whenever mere self is his theme .
i was astonished , too , at the vast extent of his reading ; and , above all , i felt my soul <unk> within me by the wild fervor , and the vivid freshness of his imagination .
seeking in <name> the objects i then sought , i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price ; and this feeling i frankly confided to him .
it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city ; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own , i was permitted to be at the expense of <unk> , and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper , a <unk> and grotesque mansion , long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire , and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the <unk> st. germain .
had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world , we should have been regarded as madmen  although , perhaps , as madmen of a harmless nature .
our seclusion was perfect .
we admitted no visitors .
indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates ; and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in <name> .
we existed within ourselves alone .
it was a freak of fancy in my friend ( for what else shall i call it ? )
to be <unk> of the night for her own sake ; and into this <unk> , as into all his others , i quietly fell ; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon .
the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always ; but we could counterfeit her presence .
at the first <name> of the morning we closed all the <unk> shutters of our old building ; lighting a couple of tapers which , strongly perfumed , threw out only the <unk> and feeblest of rays .
by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams  reading , writing , or conversing , until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness .
then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm , continuing the topics of the day , or roaming far and wide until a late hour , seeking , amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city , that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford .
at such times i could not help remarking and admiring ( although from his <name> <unk> i had been prepared to expect it ) a peculiar <unk> ability in dupin .
he seemed , too , to take an eager delight in its exercise  if not exactly in its display  and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived .
he boasted to me , with a low chuckling laugh , that most men , in respect to himself , wore windows in their bosoms , and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own .
his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract ; his eyes were vacant in expression ; while his voice , usually a <name> tenor , rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the <unk> and entire distinctness of the enunciation .
observing him in these moods , i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the <unk> soul , and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupin  the creative and the <unk> .
let it not be supposed , from what i have just said , that i am <unk> any mystery , or <unk> any romance .
what i have described in the frenchman , was merely the result of an excited , or perhaps of a diseased intelligence .
but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example <name> best convey the idea .
we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the <unk> <name> .
being both , apparently , occupied with thought , neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least .
all at once dupin broke forth with these words : " he is a very little fellow , that 's true , and would do better for the <unk> des <unk> . "
" there can be no doubt of that , " i replied unwittingly , and not at first observing ( so much had i been absorbed in reflection ) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations .
in an instant afterward i recollected myself , and my astonishment was profound .
" dupin , " said i , gravely , " this is beyond my comprehension .
i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed , and can scarcely credit my senses .
how was it possible you should know i was thinking of    ? "
here i paused , to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought .
 " of <unk> , " said he , " why do you pause ?
you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure <unk> him for tragedy . "
this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections .
<unk> was a <unk> cobbler of the rue st. <name> , who , becoming <unk> , had attempted the <unk> of xerxes , in <unk> 's tragedy so called , and been notoriously <unk> for his pains .
" tell me , for heaven 's sake , " i exclaimed , " the method  if method there is  by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter . "
in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express .
" it was the <unk> , " replied my friend , " who brought you to the conclusion that the <unk> of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes et <unk> genus <unk> . "
" the <unk> !  you astonish me  i know no <unk> <unk> . "
" the man who ran up against you as we entered the street  it may have been fifteen minutes ago . "
i now remembered that , in fact , a <unk> , carrying upon his head a large basket of apples , had nearly thrown me down , by accident , as we passed from the rue c   into the thoroughfare where we stood ; but what this had to do with <unk> i could not possibly understand .
there was not a particle of <unk> about dupin .
" i <name> explain , " he said , " and that you may comprehend all clearly , we <name> first retrace the course of your meditations , from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the <unk> with the <unk> in question .
the larger links of the chain run thus  <unk> , orion , dr. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the street stones , the <unk> . "
there are few persons who have not , at some period of their lives , amused themselves in <unk> the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained .
the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and <unk> between the <unk> and the goal .
what , then , must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken , and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth .
he continued : " we had been talking of horses , if i remember aright , just before leaving the rue c   .
this was the last subject we discussed .
as we crossed into this street , a <unk> , with a large basket upon his head , brushing quickly past us , thrust you upon a pile of <unk> stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair .
you stepped upon one of the loose fragments , slipped , slightly strained your ankle , appeared vexed or sulky , muttered a few words , turned to look at the pile , and then proceeded in silence .
i was not particularly attentive to what you did ; but observation has become with me , of late , a species of necessity .
" you kept your eyes upon the ground  glancing , with a <unk> expression , at the holes and ruts in the pavement , ( so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones , ) until we reached the little alley called <unk> , which has been paved , by way of experiment , with the overlapping and riveted blocks .
here your countenance brightened up , and , perceiving your lips move , i could not doubt that you murmured the word <unk> , ' a term very <unk> applied to this species of pavement .
i knew that you could not say to yourself <unk> ' without being brought to think of <unk> , and thus of the theories of <unk> ; and since , when we discussed this subject not very long ago , i mentioned to you how singularly , yet with how little notice , the vague guesses of that <name> greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular <unk> , i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great <unk> in orion , and i certainly expected that you would do so .
you did look up ; and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps .
but in that bitter <unk> upon <unk> , which appeared in yesterday 's <unk> , ' the <unk> , making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler s change of name upon assuming the <unk> , quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed .
i mean the line <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" i had told you that this was in reference to orion , formerly written <unk> ; and , from certain <unk> connected with this explanation , i was aware that you could not have forgotten it .
it was clear , therefore , that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and <unk> .
that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips .
you thought of the poor cobbler 's <unk> .
so far , you had been stooping in your gait ; but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height .
i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of <unk> .
at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as , in fact , he was a very little fellow  that <unk>  he would do better at the <unk> des <unk> . "
not long after this , we were looking over an evening edition of the " gazette des <unk> , " when the following paragraphs arrested our attention .
" extraordinary <unk>  this morning , about three o'clock , the inhabitants of the <unk> st. <unk> were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks , issuing , apparently , from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue , known to be in the sole <unk> of one madame l'espanaye , and her daughter mademoiselle <name> l'espanaye .
after some delay , occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner , the gateway was broken in with a crowbar , and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two <unk> .
by this time the cries had ceased ; but , as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs , two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house .
as the second landing was reached , these sounds , also , had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet .
the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room .
upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story , ( the door of which , being found locked , with the key inside , was forced open , ) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment .
" the apartment was in the wildest disorder  the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions .
there was only one bedstead ; and from this the bed had been removed , and thrown into the middle of the floor .
on a chair lay a razor , <unk> with blood .
on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair , also <unk> in blood , and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots .
upon the floor were found four <unk> , an <unk> of <unk> , three large silver spoons , three smaller of <unk> <unk> , and two bags , containing nearly four thousand francs in gold .
the drawers of a bureau , which stood in one corner were open , and had been , apparently , rifled , although many articles still remained in them .
a small iron safe was discovered under the bed ( not under the bedstead ) .
it was open , with the key still in the door .
it had no contents beyond a few old letters , and other papers of little consequence .
" of madame l'espanaye no traces were here seen ; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place , a search was made in the chimney , and ( horrible to relate ! )
the corpse of the daughter , head downward , was dragged therefrom ; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance .
the body was quite warm .
upon examining it , many <unk> were perceived , no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged .
upon the face were many severe scratches , and , upon the throat , dark bruises , and deep indentations of finger nails , as if the deceased had been <unk> to death .
" after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house , without farther discovery , the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building , where lay the corpse of the old <name> , with her throat so entirely cut that , upon an attempt to raise her , the head fell off .
the body , as well as the head , was fearfully mutilated  the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity .
" to this horrible mystery there is not as yet , we believe , the slightest clew . "
the next day 's paper had these additional particulars .
" the tragedy in the rue <unk> many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair .
[ the word <unk> ' has not yet , in <name> , that levity of import which it conveys with us , ] " but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it .
we give below all the material testimony elicited .

" many other persons , neighbors , gave evidence to the same effect .
no one was spoken of as frequenting the house .

" isidore <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that he was called to the house about three o'clock in the morning , and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway , endeavoring to gain admittance .
forced it open , at length , with a bayonet  not with a crowbar .
had but little difficulty in getting it open , on account of its being a double or folding gate , and bolted neither at bottom not top .
the shrieks were continued until the gate was forced  and then suddenly ceased .
they seemed to be screams of some person ( or persons ) in great agony  were loud and drawn out , not short and quick .

upon reaching the first landing , heard two voices in loud and angry contention  the one a gruff voice , the other much <unk>  a very strange voice .

had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year  ( eight years previously ) .
made frequent deposits in small sums .
had checked for nothing until the third day before her death , when she took out in person the sum of <unk> francs .
this sum was paid in gold , and a clerk went home with the money .
" <unk> <name> bon , clerk to <unk> et <unk> , <unk> that on the day in question , about noon , he accompanied madame l'espanaye to her residence with the <unk> francs , put up in two bags .

might have been a woman 's voice .
does not understand <name> .
" four of the above-named witnesses , being recalled , deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of mademoiselle l. was locked on the inside when the party reached it .
every thing was perfectly silent  no groans or noises of any kind .
upon forcing the door no person was seen .
the windows , both of the back and front room , were down and firmly fastened from within .
a door between the two rooms was closed , but not locked .
the door leading from the front room into the passage was locked , with the key on the inside .
a small room in the front of the house , on the fourth story , at the head of the passage was open , the door being ajar .
this room was crowded with old beds , boxes , and so forth .
these were carefully removed and searched .
there was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched .
sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys .
the house was a four story one , with <unk> ( <unk> ) a trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely  did not appear to have been opened for years .

" several witnesses , recalled , here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being .
by <unk> ' were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes , such as are employed by those who clean chimneys .
these brushes were passed up and down every <unk> in the house .
there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs .
the body of mademoiselle l'espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength .
" <name> <unk> , physician , <unk> that he was called to view the bodies about <unk> .
they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l. was found .
the corpse of the young <name> was much bruised and <unk> .
the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances .
the throat was greatly chafed .
there were several deep scratches just below the <name> , together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers .
the face was fearfully discolored , and the <unk> protruded .
the tongue had been partially bitten through .
a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach , produced , apparently , by the pressure of a knee .
in the opinion of m. <unk> , mademoiselle l'espanaye had been <unk> to death by some person or persons unknown .
the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated .
all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered .
the left tibia much splintered , as well as all the ribs of the left side .
whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored .
it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted .
a heavy club of wood , or a broad bar of iron  a chair  any large , heavy , and obtuse weapon would have produced such results , if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man .
no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon .
the head of the deceased , when seen by witness , was entirely separated from the body , and was also greatly shattered .
the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument  probably with a razor .
" <unk> <unk> , surgeon , was called with m. <unk> to view the bodies .
corroborated the testimony , and the opinions of m. <unk> .
" nothing farther of importance was elicited , although several other persons were examined .
a murder so mysterious , and so perplexing in all its particulars , was never before committed in <name>  if indeed a murder has been committed at all .
the police are entirely at fault  an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature .
there is not , however , the shadow of a clew apparent . "
the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the <unk> st. <unk>  that the premises in question had been carefully <unk> , and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted , but all to no purpose .
a postscript , however , mentioned that <unk> <name> bon had been arrested and imprisoned  although nothing appeared to <unk> him , beyond the facts already detailed .
dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair  at least so i judged from his manner , for he made no comments .
it was only after the announcement that <name> bon had been imprisoned , that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders .
i could merely agree with all <name> in considering them an insoluble mystery .
i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer .
" we must not judge of the means , " said dupin , " by this shell of an examination .
the parisian police , so much <unk> for <unk> , are cunning , but no more .
there is no method in their proceedings , beyond the method of the moment .
they make a vast parade of measures ; but , not unfrequently , these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed , as to put us in mind of monsieur <unk> 's calling for his <unk>  pour <unk> <unk> la <unk> the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising , but , for the most part , are brought about by simple diligence and activity .
when these qualities are unavailing , their schemes fail .
<unk> , for example , was a good <unk> and a persevering man .
but , without educated thought , he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations .
he impaired his vision by holding the object too close .
he might see , perhaps , one or two points with unusual clearness , but in so doing he , necessarily , lost sight of the matter as a whole .
thus there is such a thing as being too profound .
truth is not always in a well .
in fact , as regards the more important knowledge , i do believe that she is invariably superficial .
the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her , and not upon the <unk> where she is found .
the modes and sources of this kind of error are well <unk> in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies .
to look at a <name> by glances  to view it in a <unk> way , by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina ( more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior ) , is to behold the <name> distinctly  is to have the best appreciation of its lustre  a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it .
a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case , but , in the former , there is the more refined capacity for comprehension .
by undue profundity we perplex and <unk> thought ; and it is possible to make even <name> herself vanish from the <unk> by a scrutiny too sustained , too concentrated , or too direct .
" as for these murders , let us enter into some examinations for ourselves , before we make up an opinion respecting them .
an inquiry <name> afford us amusement , " [ i thought this an odd term , so applied , but said nothing ] " and , besides , <name> bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful .
we <name> go and see the premises with our own eyes .
i know g   , the prefect of police , and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission . "
the permission was obtained , and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue .
this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue <unk> and the rue st. <unk> .
it was late in the afternoon when we reached it ; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided .
the house was readily found ; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters , with an <unk> curiosity , from the opposite side of the way .
it was an ordinary parisian house , with a gateway , on one side of which was a glazed <unk> , with a sliding panel in the window , indicating a <unk> de <unk> before going in we walked up the street , turned down an alley , and then , again turning , passed in the rear of the building  dupin , meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood , as well as the house , with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object .
<unk> our steps , we came again to the front of the dwelling , rang , and , having shown our credentials , were admitted by the agents in charge .
we went up stairs  into the chamber where the body of mademoiselle l'espanaye had been found , and where both the deceased still lay .
the <unk> of the room had , as usual , been suffered to exist .
i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the " gazette des <unk> . "
dupin scrutinized every thing  not excepting the bodies of the victims .
we then went into the other rooms , and into the yard ; a <unk> accompanying us throughout .
the examination occupied us until dark , when we took our departure .
on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers .
i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold , and that je <name> <unk> :  for this phrase there is no english equivalent .
it was his humor , now , to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder , until about noon the next day .
he then asked me , suddenly , if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity .
there was something in his manner of <unk> the word " peculiar , " which caused me to shudder , without knowing why .
" no , nothing peculiar , " i said ; " nothing more , at least , than we both saw stated in the paper . "
" the <unk> , ' " he replied , " has not entered , i fear , into the unusual horror of the thing .
but dismiss the idle opinions of this print .
it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble , for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution  i mean for the <unk> character of its features .
the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive  not for the murder itself  but for the atrocity of the murder .
they are puzzled , too , by the seeming impossibility of <unk> the voices heard in contention , with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated mademoiselle l'espanaye , and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending .
the wild disorder of the room ; the corpse thrust , with the head downward , up the chimney ; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old <name> ; these considerations , with those just mentioned , and others which i need not mention , have sufficed to <unk> the powers , by putting completely at fault the boasted <unk> , of the government agents .
they have fallen into the gross but common error of <unk> the unusual with the abstruse .
but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary , that reason feels its way , if at all , in its search for the true .
in investigations such as we are now pursuing , it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred , ' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before . '
in fact , the facility with which i shall arrive , or have arrived , at the solution of this mystery , is in the direct ratio of its apparent <unk> in the eyes of the police . "
i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment .
" i am now awaiting , " continued he , looking toward the door of our apartment  " i am now awaiting a person who , although perhaps not the <unk> of these <unk> , must have been in some measure implicated in their <unk> .
of the worst portion of the crimes committed , it is probable that he is innocent .
i <name> that i am right in this supposition ; for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle .
i look for the man here  in this room  every moment .
it is true that he may not arrive ; but the probability is that he <name> .
should he come , it <name> be necessary to detain him .
here are pistols ; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use . "
i took the pistols , scarcely knowing what i did , or believing what i heard , while dupin went on , very much as if in a soliloquy .
i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times .
his discourse was addressed to myself ; but his voice , although by no means loud , had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance .
his eyes , vacant in expression , regarded only the wall .
" that the voices heard in contention , " he said , " by the party upon the stairs , were not the voices of the women themselves , was fully proved by the evidence .
this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old <name> could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide .
i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method ; for the strength of madame l'espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter 's corpse up the chimney as it was found ; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely <unk> the idea of <unk> .
murder , then , has been committed by some third party ; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention .
let me now <unk>  not to the whole testimony respecting these voices  but to what was peculiar in that testimony .
did you observe any thing peculiar about it ? "
i remarked that , while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman , there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill , or , as one individual termed it , the harsh voice .
" that was the evidence itself , " said dupin , " but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence .
you have observed nothing distinctive .
yet there was something to be observed .
the witnesses , as you remark , agreed about the gruff voice ; they were here unanimous .
but in regard to the shrill voice , the peculiarity is  not that they disagreed  but that , while an italian , an englishman , a spaniard , a <unk> , and a frenchman attempted to describe it , each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner .
each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen .
each <unk> it  not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant  but the converse .
the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard , and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the <unk> ' the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman ; but we find it stated that <unk> understanding french this witness was examined through an <unk> ' the englishman thinks it the voice of a <name> , and <unk> not understand <unk> ' the spaniard 'is sure ' that it was that of an englishman , but <unk> by the intonation ' altogether , <unk> he has no knowledge of the <unk> ' the italian believes it the voice of a russian , but <unk> never conversed with a native of <unk> ' a second frenchman differs , moreover , with the first , and is positive that the voice was that of an italian ; but , not being cognizant of that tongue , is , like the spaniard , <unk> by the intonation . '
now , how strangely unusual must that voice have really been , about which such testimony as this could have been elicited !  in whose tones , even , <unk> of the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing familiar !
you <name> say that it might have been the voice of an asiatic  of an african .
neither <unk> nor <unk> abound in <name> ; but , without denying the inference , i <name> now merely call your attention to three points .
the voice is termed by one witness <unk> rather than shrill . '
it is represented by two others to have been <unk> and <unk> ' no words  no sounds resembling words  were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable .
" i know not , " continued dupin , " what impression i may have made , so far , upon your own understanding ; but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony  the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices  are in themselves sufficient to <unk> a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery .
i said <unk> deductions ; ' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed .
i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones , and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result .
what the suspicion is , however , i <name> not say just yet .
i merely wish you to bear in mind that , with myself , it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form  a certain tendency  to my inquiries in the chamber .
" let us now transport ourselves , in fancy , to this chamber .
what shall we first seek here ?
the means of egress employed by the murderers .
it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in <unk> events .
madame and mademoiselle l'espanaye were not destroyed by spirits .
the <unk> of the deed were material , and escaped materially .
then how ?
fortunately , there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point , and that mode must lead us to a definite <unk>  let us examine , each by each , the possible means of egress .
it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle l'espanaye was found , or at least in the room adjoining , when the party ascended the stairs .
it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues .
the police have laid bare the floors , the ceilings , and the masonry of the walls , in every direction .
no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance .
but , not trusting to their eyes , i examined with my own .
there were , then , no secret issues .
both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked , with the keys inside .
let us turn to the chimneys .
these , although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the <unk> , <name> not admit , throughout their extent , the body of a large cat .
the impossibility of egress , by means already stated , being thus absolute , we are reduced to the windows .
through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street .
the murderers must have passed , then , through those of the back room .
now , brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are , it is not our part , as <unk> , to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities .
it is only left for us to prove that these apparent <unk> ' are , in reality , not such .
" there are two windows in the chamber .
one of them is unobstructed by furniture , and is wholly visible .
the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it .
the former was found securely fastened from within .
it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it .
a large <unk> had been pierced in its frame to the left , and a very stout nail was found fitted therein , nearly to the head .
upon examining the other window , a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it ; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash , failed also .
the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions .
and , therefore , it was thought a matter of <unk> to withdraw the nails and open the windows .
" my own examination was somewhat more particular , and was so for the reason i have just given  because here it was , i knew , that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality .
" i proceeded to think thus  à <unk> .
the murderers did escape from one of these windows .
this being so , they could not have <unk> the sashes from the inside , as they were found fastened ;  the consideration which put a stop , through its <unk> , to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter .
yet the sashes were fastened .
they must , then , have the power of fastening themselves .
there was no escape from this conclusion .
i stepped to the unobstructed casement , withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash .
it resisted all my efforts , as i had anticipated .
a concealed spring must , i now know , exist ; and this <unk> of my idea convinced me that my premises at least , were correct , however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails .
a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring .
i pressed it , and , satisfied with the discovery , forbore to <unk> the sash .
" i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively .
a person passing out through this window might have <unk> it , and the spring would have caught  but the nail could not have been replaced .
the conclusion was plain , and again narrowed in the field of my investigations .
the assassins must have escaped through the other window .
supposing , then , the springs upon each sash to be the same , as was probable , there must be found a difference between the nails , or at least between the modes of their fixture .
getting upon the sacking of the bedstead , i looked over the <unk> minutely at the second casement .
passing my hand down behind the board , i readily discovered and pressed the spring , which was , as i had supposed , identical in character with its neighbor .
i now looked at the nail .
it was as stout as the other , and apparently fitted in the same manner  driven in nearly up to the head .
" you <name> say that i was puzzled ; but , if you think so , you must have misunderstood the nature of the <unk> .
to use a sporting phrase , i had not been once 'at fault . '
the scent had never for an instant been lost .
there was no flaw in any link of the chain .
i had traced the secret to its ultimate result ,  and that result was the <unk> it had , i say , in every respect , the appearance of its fellow in the other window ; but this fact was an absolute <unk> ( conclusive us it might seem to be ) when compared with the consideration that here , at this point , terminated the clew .
'there must be something wrong , ' i said , <unk> the nail . '
i touched it ; and the head , with about a quarter of an inch of the <unk> , came off in my fingers .
the rest of the <unk> was in the <unk> where it had been broken off .
the fracture was an old one ( for its edges were <unk> with rust ) , and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer , which had partially imbedded , in the top of the bottom sash , the head portion of the nail .
i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it , and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete  the fissure was invisible .
pressing the spring , i gently raised the sash for a few inches ; the head went up with it , remaining firm in its bed .
i closed the window , and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect .
" the riddle , so far , was now <unk> .
the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed .
dropping of its own accord upon his exit ( or perhaps purposely closed ) , it had become fastened by the spring ; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail ,  farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary .
" the next question is that of the mode of descent .
upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building .
about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod .
from this <name> it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself , to say nothing of entering it .
i observed , however , that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters <unk>  a kind rarely employed at the present day , but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and <unk> .
they are in the form of an ordinary door , ( a single , not a folding door ) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis  thus affording an excellent hold for the hands .
in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad .
when we saw them from the rear of the house , they were both about half open  that is to say , they stood off at right angles from the wall .
it is probable that the police , as well as myself , examined the back of the tenement ; but , if so , in looking at these <unk> in the line of their breadth ( as they must have done ) , they did not perceive this great breadth itself , or , at all events , failed to take it into due consideration .
in fact , having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter , they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination .
it was clear to me , however , that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed , would , if swung fully back to the wall , reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod .
it was also evident that , by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage , an entrance into the window , from the <name> , might have been thus <unk>  by reaching to the distance of two feet and a half ( we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent ) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the <unk> .
letting go , then , his hold upon the <name> , placing his feet securely against the wall , and springing boldly from it , he might have swung the shutter so as to close it , and , if we imagine the window open at the time , might even have swung himself into the room .
" i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat .
it is my design to show you , first , that the thing might possibly have been accomplished :  but , secondly and chiefly , i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary  the almost <unk> character of that agility which could have accomplished it .
" you <name> say , no doubt , using the language of the law , that 'to make out my case , ' i should rather <unk> , than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter .
this may be the practice in law , but it is not the usage of reason .
my ultimate object is only the truth .
my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in <unk> , that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill ( or harsh ) and unequal voice , about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree , and in whose utterance no <unk> could be detected . "
at these words a vague and <unk> <name> of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind .
i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend  men , at times , find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able , in the end , to remember .
my friend went on with his discourse .
" you <name> see , " he said , " that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress .
it was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner , at the same point .
let us now revert to the interior of the room .
let us survey the appearances here .
the drawers of the bureau , it is said , had been rifled , although many articles of apparel still remained within them .
the conclusion here is absurd .
it is a mere guess  a very silly one  and no more .
how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained ?
madame l'espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life  saw no company  seldom went out  had little use for numerous changes of <unk> .
those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies .
if a thief had taken any , why did he not take the best  why did he not take all ?
in a word , why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to <unk> himself with a bundle of linen ?
the gold was abandoned .
nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur <unk> , the banker , was discovered , in bags , upon the floor .
i wish you , therefore , to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive , engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house .
coincidences ten times as remarkable as this ( the delivery of the money , and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it ) , happen to all of us every hour of our lives , without attracting even momentary notice .
coincidences , in general , are great <unk> in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities  that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration .
in the present instance , had the gold been gone , the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence .
it would have been <unk> of this idea of motive .
but , under the real circumstances of the case , if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage , we must also imagine the <unk> so <unk> an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together .
" keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attention  that peculiar voice , that unusual agility , and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this  let us glance at the butchery itself .
here is a woman strangled to death by <name> strength , and thrust up a chimney , head downward .
ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this .
least of all , do they thus dispose of the murdered .
in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney , you <name> admit that there was something excessively <unk>  something altogether <unk> with our common notions of human action , even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men .
think , too , how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down !  " turn , now , to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous .
on the hearth were thick tresses  very thick tresses  of grey human hair .
these had been torn out by the roots .
you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together .
you saw the locks in question as well as myself .
their roots ( a hideous sight ! )
were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp  sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in <unk> perhaps half a million of hairs at a time .
the throat of the old <name> was not merely cut , but the head absolutely severed from the body : the instrument was a mere razor .
i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds .
of the bruises upon the body of madame l'espanaye i do not speak .
monsieur <unk> , and his worthy <unk> monsieur <unk> , have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument ; and so far these gentlemen are very correct .
the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard , upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed .
this idea , however simple it may now seem , escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them  because , by the affair of the nails , their perceptions had been <unk> sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all .
" if now , in addition to all these things , you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber , we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding , a strength superhuman , a ferocity brutal , a butchery without motive , a <unk> in horror absolutely alien from humanity , and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations , and devoid of all distinct or intelligible <unk> .
what result , then , has ensued ?
what impression have i made upon your fancy ? "
i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question .
" a madman , " i said , " has done this deed  some raving maniac , escaped from a neighboring <unk> de <unk> " " in some respects , " he replied , " your idea is not irrelevant .
but the voices of madmen , even in their wildest paroxysms , are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs .
madmen are of some nation , and their language , however incoherent in its words , has always the <unk> of <unk> .
besides , the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand .
i <unk> this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame l'espanaye .
tell me what you can make of it . "
" dupin ! "
i said , completely unnerved ; " this hair is most unusual  this is no human hair . "
" i have not asserted that it is , " said he ; " but , before we decide this point , i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper .
it is a <unk> drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as <unk> bruises , and deep indentations of finger nails , ' upon the throat of mademoiselle l'espanaye , and in another , ( by messrs. <unk> and <unk> , ) as a <unk> of livid spots , evidently the impression of fingers . '
" you <name> perceive , " continued my friend , spreading out the paper upon the table before us , " that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold .
there is no slipping apparent .
each finger has retained  possibly until the death of the victim  the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself .
attempt , now , to place all your fingers , at the same time , in the respective impressions as you see them . "
i made the attempt in vain .
" we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial , " he said .
" the paper is spread out upon a plane surface ; but the human throat is cylindrical .
here is a billet of wood , the circumference of which is about that of the throat .
wrap the drawing around it , and try the experiment again . "
i did so ; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before .
" this , " i said , " is the <name> of no human hand . "
" read now , " replied dupin , " this passage from cuvier . "
it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourang-outang of the east indian islands .
the gigantic stature , the prodigious strength and activity , the wild ferocity , and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all .
i understood the full horrors of the murder at once .
" the description of the digits , " said i , as i made an end of reading , " is in exact accordance with this drawing .
i see that no animal but an ourang-outang , of the species here mentioned , could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them .
this tuft of <name> hair , too , is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier .
but i can not possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery .
besides , there were two voices heard in contention , and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman . "
" true ; and you <name> remember an expression attributed almost unanimously , by the evidence , to this voice ,  the expression , <unk> dieu !  ' this , under the circumstances , has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses ( <unk> , the <unk> , ) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation .
upon these two words , therefore , i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle .
a frenchman was cognizant of the murder .
it is possible  indeed it is far more than probable  that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place .
the ourang-outang may have escaped from him .
he may have traced it to the chamber ; but , under the agitating circumstances which ensued , he could never have <unk> it .
it is still at large .
i <name> not pursue these guesses  for i have no right to call them more  since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect , and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another .
we <name> call them guesses then , and speak of them as such .
if the frenchman in question is indeed , as i suppose , innocent of this atrocity , this advertisement which i left last night , upon our return home , at the office of <unk> <unk> , ' ( a paper devoted to the shipping interest , and much sought by sailors , ) <name> bring him to our residence . "
he handed me a paper , and i read thus : caught  in the bois de boulogne , early in the morning of the  inst. ,  ( the morning of the murder , ) a very large , <name> ourang-outang of the <unk> species .
the owner , ( who is ascertained to be a sailor , belonging to a maltese vessel , ) may have the animal again , upon identifying it satisfactorily , and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping .
call at no .
  , rue   , <unk> st. germain  au <unk> " how was it possible , " i asked , " that you should know the man to be a sailor , and belonging to a maltese vessel ? "
" i do not know it , " said dupin .
" i am not sure of it .
here , however , is a small piece of ribbon , which from its form , and from its greasy appearance , has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long <unk> of which sailors are so fond .
moreover , this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie , and is peculiar to the maltese .
i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod .
it could not have belonged to either of the deceased .
now if , after all , i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon , that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel , still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement .
if i am in error , he <name> merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he <name> not take the trouble to inquire .
but if i am right , a great point is gained .
cognizant although innocent of the murder , the frenchman <name> naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement  about demanding the ourang-outang .
he <name> reason thus :  'i am innocent ; i am poor ; my ourang-outang is of great value  to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself  why should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger ?
here it is , within my grasp .
it was found in the bois de boulogne  at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery .
how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed ?
the police are at fault  they have failed to procure the slightest clew .
should they even trace the animal , it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder , or to <unk> me in guilt on account of that cognizance .
above all , i am <unk> the <unk> <unk> me as the possessor of the beast .
i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend .
should i avoid claiming a property of so great value , which it is known that i possess , i <name> render the animal at least , liable to suspicion .
it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast .
i <name> answer the advertisement , get the ourang-outang , and keep it close until this matter has blown over . ' "
at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs .
" be ready , " said dupin , " with your pistols , but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself . "
the front door of the house had been left open , and the visiter had entered , without ringing , and advanced several steps upon the staircase .
now , however , he seemed to hesitate .
presently we heard him descending .
dupin was moving quickly to the door , when we again heard him coming up .
he did not turn back a second time , but stepped up with decision , and rapped at the door of our chamber .
" come in , " said dupin , in a cheerful and hearty tone .
a man entered .
he was a sailor , evidently ,  a tall , stout , and <unk> person , with a certain <unk> expression of countenance , not altogether <unk> .
his face , greatly <unk> , was more than half hidden by <unk> and <unk> he had with him a huge oaken <unk> , but appeared to be otherwise unarmed .
he bowed awkwardly , and bade us " good evening , " in french accents , which , although somewhat <unk> , were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin .
" sit down , my friend , " said dupin .
" i suppose you have called about the ourang-outang .
upon my word , i almost envy you the possession of him ; a remarkably fine , and no doubt a very valuable animal .
how old do you suppose him to be ? "
the sailor <name> a long breath , with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden , and then replied , in an assured tone : " i have no way of telling  but he ca n't be more than four or five years old .
have you got him here ? "
" oh no , we had no conveniences for keeping him here .
he is at a livery stable in the rue <unk> , just by .
you can get him in the morning .
of course you are prepared to identify the property ? "
" to be sure i am , sir . "
" i shall be sorry to part with him , " said dupin .
" i do n't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing , sir , " said the man .
" could n't expect it .
am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal  that is to say , any thing in reason . "
" well , " replied my friend , " that is all very fair , to be sure .
let me think !  what should i have ?
oh !
i <name> tell you .
my reward shall be this .
you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue . "
dupin said the last words in a very low tone , and very quietly .
just as quietly , too , he walked toward the door , locked it and put the key in his pocket .
he then <name> a pistol from his bosom and placed it , without the least flurry , upon the table .
the sailor 's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation .
he started to his feet and grasped his <unk> , but the next moment he fell back into his seat , trembling violently , and with the countenance of death itself .
he spoke not a word .
i pitied him from the bottom of my heart .
" my friend , " said dupin , in a kind tone , " you are alarming yourself unnecessarily  you are indeed .
we mean you no harm whatever .
i pledge you the honor of a gentleman , and of a frenchman , that we intend you no injury .
i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue .
it <name> not do , however , to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them .
from what i have already said , you must know that i have had means of information about this matter  means of which you could never have dreamed .
now the thing stands thus .
you have done nothing which you could have avoided  nothing , certainly , which renders you <unk> .
you were not even guilty of robbery , when you might have robbed with impunity .
you have nothing to conceal .
you have no reason for concealment .
on the other hand , you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know .
an innocent man is now imprisoned , charged with that crime of which you can point out the <unk> . "
the sailor had recovered his presence of mind , in a great measure , while dupin uttered these words ; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone .
" so help me god , " said he , after a brief pause , " i <name> tell you all i know about this affair ;  but i do not expect you to believe one half i say  i would be a fool indeed if i did .
still , i am innocent , and i <name> make a clean breast if i die for it . "
what he stated was , in substance , this .
he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago .
a party , of which he formed one , landed at borneo , and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure .
himself and a companion had captured the ourang-outang .
this companion dying , the animal fell into his own exclusive possession .
after great trouble , occasioned by the <unk> ferocity of his captive during the home voyage , he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in <name> , where , not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors , he kept it carefully secluded , until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot , received from a splinter on board ship .
his ultimate design was to sell it .
returning home from some sailors ' frolic the night , or rather in the morning of the murder , he found the beast occupying his own <unk> , into which it had broken from a closet adjoining , where it had been , as was thought , securely confined .
razor in hand , and fully <unk> , it was sitting before a looking-glass , attempting the operation of shaving , in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet .
terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious , and so well able to use it , the man , for some moments , was at a loss what to do .
he had been accustomed , however , to quiet the creature , even in its <unk> moods , by the use of a whip , and to this he now resorted .
upon sight of it , the ourang-outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber , down the stairs , and thence , through a window , unfortunately open , into the street .
the frenchman followed in despair ; the ape , razor still in hand , occasionally stopping to look back and <unk> at its pursuer , until the latter had nearly come up with it .
it then again made off .
in this manner the <name> continued for a long time .
the streets were profoundly quiet , as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning .
in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue , the fugitive 's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame <unk> chamber , in the fourth story of her house .
rushing to the building , it perceived the lightning <name> , clambered up with inconceivable agility , grasped the shutter , which was thrown fully back against the wall , and , by its means , swung itself directly upon the <unk> of the bed .
the whole feat did not occupy a minute .
the shutter was kicked open again by the ourang-outang as it entered the room .
the sailor , in the meantime , was both rejoiced and perplexed .
he had strong hopes of now <unk> the brute , as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured , except by the <name> , where it might be intercepted as it came down .
on the other hand , there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house .
this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive .
a lightning <name> is ascended without difficulty , especially by a sailor ; but , when he had arrived as high as the window , which lay far to his left , his career was stopped ; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room .
at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror .
now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night , which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue .
madame l'espanaye and her daughter , <unk> in their night clothes , had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned , which had been wheeled into the middle of the room .
it was open , and its contents lay beside it on the floor .
the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window ; and , from the time <unk> between the ingress of the beast and the screams , it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived .
the <unk> of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind .
as the sailor looked in , the gigantic animal had seized madame l'espanaye by the hair , ( which was loose , as she had been <unk> it , ) and was flourishing the razor about her face , in imitation of the motions of a barber .
the daughter lay prostrate and motionless ; she had swooned .
the screams and struggles of the old <name> ( during which the hair was torn from her head ) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourang-outang into those of wrath .
with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body .
the sight of blood inflamed its anger into <unk> .
<unk> its teeth , and flashing fire from its eyes , it flew upon the body of the girl , and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat , retaining its grasp until she expired .
its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed , over which the face of its master , rigid with horror , was just discernible .
the fury of the beast , who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip , was instantly converted into fear .
conscious of having deserved punishment , it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds , and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation ; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved , and dragging the bed from the bedstead .
in conclusion , it seized first the corpse of the daughter , and thrust it up the chimney , as it was found ; then that of the old <name> , which it immediately hurled through the window headlong .
as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden , the sailor shrank aghast to the <name> , and , rather gliding than clambering down it , hurried at once home  dreading the consequences of the butchery , and gladly abandoning , in his terror , all solicitude about the fate of the ourang-outang .
the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchman 's exclamations of horror and affright , commingled with the fiendish <unk> of the brute .
i have scarcely anything to add .
the ourang-outang must have escaped from the chamber , by the <name> , just before the break of the door .
it must have closed the window as it passed through it .
it was subsequently caught by the owner himself , who obtained for it a very large sum at the <unk> des <unk> <name> <name> was instantly released , upon our narration of the circumstances ( with some comments from dupin ) at the bureau of the prefect of police .
this <unk> , however well disposed to my friend , could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken , and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two , about the propriety of every person minding his own business .
" let him talk , " said dupin , who had not thought it necessary to reply .
" let him discourse ; it <name> ease his conscience , i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle .
nevertheless , that he failed in the solution of this mystery , is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it ; for , in truth , our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound .
in his wisdom is no <unk> it is all head and no body , like the pictures of the goddess <name> ,  or , at best , all head and shoulders , like a codfish .
but he is a good creature after all .
i like him especially for one master stroke of cant , by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity .
i mean the way he has <unk> <unk> ce qui est , et <unk> ce qui <unk> <unk> ' " ( * ) ( * ) <unk>  <unk> heloise .
the mystery of <name> <unk> .
( *1 ) a sequel to " the murders in the rue morgue . "
es <unk> eine <unk> <unk> <unk> , die der <unk> parallel <unk> .

<unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk> , so dass sie <unk> <unk> , und <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sind .
so bei der reformation ; <unk> des <unk> <name> das <unk> <unk> .
there are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real ones .
they rarely coincide .
men and circumstances generally modify the ideal train of events , so that it seems imperfect , and its consequences are equally imperfect .
thus with the reformation ; instead of <unk> came <unk> .
 <unk> .
( <unk> ) moral <unk> .
there are few persons , even among the <unk> thinkers , who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling <unk> in the supernatural , by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that , as mere coincidences , the intellect has been unable to receive them .
such sentiments  for the <unk> of which i speak have never the full force of thought  such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance , or , as it is technically termed , the <unk> of probabilities .
now this <unk> is , in its essence , purely mathematical ; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and <unk> of the most <unk> in speculation .
the extraordinary details which i am now called upon to make public , <name> be found to form , as regards sequence of time , the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences , whose secondary or concluding branch <name> be recognized by all readers in the late murder of <name> <name> rogers , at new york .
when , in an article entitled " the murders in the rue morgue , " i endeavored , about a year ago , to <unk> some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend , the <unk> c. auguste dupin , it did not occur to me that i should ever resume the subject .
this <unk> of character constituted my design ; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance dupin 's <unk> .
i might have adduced other examples , but i should have proven no more .
late events , however , in their surprising development , have startled me into some farther details , which <name> <name> with them the air of extorted confession .
hearing what i have lately heard , it would be indeed strange should i remain silent in regard to what i both heard and saw so long ago .
upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of madame l'espanaye and her daughter , the <unk> dismissed the affair at once from his attention , and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie .
prone , at all times , to abstraction , i readily fell in with his humor ; and , continuing to occupy our chambers in the <unk> saint germain , we gave the future to the winds , and slumbered tranquilly in the present , weaving the dull world around us into dreams .
but these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted .
it may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend , in the drama at the rue morgue , had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the parisian police .
with its emissaries , the name of dupin had grown into a household word .
the simple character of those <unk> by which he had <unk> the mystery never having been explained even to the prefect , or to any other individual than myself , of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous , or that the <unk> 's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition .
his frankness would have led him to <unk> every inquirer of such prejudice ; but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased .
it thus happened that he found himself the <unk> of the political eyes ; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the prefecture .
one of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named <name> rogêt .
this event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the rue morgue .
<name> , whose <name> and family name <name> at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate " <unk> , " was the only daughter of the widow <name> rogêt .
the father had died during the child 's infancy , and from the period of his death , until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative , the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the rue <unk> saint <unk> ; ( <unk> ) madame there keeping a pension , assisted by <name> .
affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year , when her great beauty attracted the notice of a <unk> , who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the <unk> <name> , and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers <unk> that neighborhood .
monsieur <name> blanc ( <unk> ) was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair <name> in his <unk> ; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl , although with somewhat more of hesitation by madame .
the anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized , and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the <unk> <unk> .
she had been in his employ about a year , when her admirers were thrown <unk> confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop .
monsieur <name> blanc was unable to account for her absence , and madame rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror .
the public papers immediately took up the theme , and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations , when , one fine morning , after the lapse of a week , <name> , in good health , but with a somewhat saddened air , made her <unk> at her usual counter in the <unk> .
all inquiry , except that of a private character , was of course immediately hushed .
monsieur <name> blanc professed total ignorance , as before .
<name> , with madame , replied to all questions , that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country .
thus the affair died away , and was generally forgotten ; for the girl , ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity , soon bade a final adieu to the <unk> , and sought the shelter of her mother 's residence in the rue <unk> saint <unk> .
it was about five months after this return home , that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time .
three days elapsed , and nothing was heard of her .
on the fourth her corpse was found floating in the seine , * near the shore which is opposite the <unk> of the rue saint <name> , and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the barrière du roule .
( <unk> ) the atrocity of this murder , ( for it was at once evident that murder had been committed , ) the youth and beauty of the victim , and , above all , her previous notoriety , conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive <unk> .
i can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect .
for several weeks , in the discussion of this one absorbing theme , even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten .
the prefect made unusual exertions ; and the powers of the whole parisian police were , of course , <unk> to the utmost extent .
upon the first discovery of the corpse , it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude , for more than a very brief period , the inquisition which was immediately set on foot .
it was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward ; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs .
in the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor , if not always with judgment , and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose ; while , owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery , the popular excitement greatly increased .
at the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed ; and , at length , the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries , and the prejudice which always exists in <name> against the police having given vent to itself in several serious <unk> , the prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs " for the conviction of the assassin , " or , if more than one should prove to have been implicated , " for the conviction of any one of the assassins . "
in the proclamation setting forth this reward , a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow ; and to the whole was appended , wherever it appeared , the private placard of a committee of citizens , offering ten thousand francs , in addition to the amount proposed by the prefecture .
the entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs , which <name> be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl , and the great frequency , in large cities , of such atrocities as the one described .
no one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light .
but although , in one or two instances , arrests were made which promised <unk> , yet nothing was elicited which could <unk> the parties suspected ; and they were discharged forthwith .
strange as it may appear , the third week from the discovery of the body had passed , and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject , before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind , reached the ears of dupin and myself .
engaged in researches which absorbed our whole attention , it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad , or received a visiter , or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers .
the first intelligence of the murder was brought us by g   , in person .
he called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of july , 18  , and remained with us until late in the night .
he had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins .
his reputation  so he said with a peculiarly parisian air  was at stake .
even his honor was concerned .
the eyes of the public were upon him ; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery .
he concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of dupin , and made him a direct , and certainly a liberal proposition , the precise nature of which i do not feel myself at <name> to disclose , but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative .
the compliment my friend <unk> as best he could , but the proposition he accepted at once , although its advantages were altogether provisional .
this point being settled , the prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views , <unk> them with long comments upon the evidence ; of which latter we were not yet in possession .
he discoursed much , and beyond doubt , <unk> ; while i hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away .
dupin , sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair , was the embodiment of respectful attention .
he wore spectacles , during the whole interview ; and an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses , sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly , because silently , throughout the seven or eight <unk> hours which immediately preceded the departure of the prefect .
in the morning , i procured , at the prefecture , a full report of all the evidence elicited , and , at the various newspaper offices , a copy of every paper in which , from first to last , had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair .
freed from all that was positively <unk> , this mass of information stood thus : <name> rogêt left the residence of her mother , in the rue <unk> st. <unk> , about nine o'clock in the morning of <name> <name> the twenty-second , 18  .
in going out , she gave notice to a monsieur <name> st. eustache , ( <unk> ) and to him only , of her intent intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the rue des <unk> .
the rue des <unk> is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare , not far from the banks of the river , and at a distance of some two miles , in the most direct course possible , from the pension of madame rogêt .
st. eustache was the accepted suitor of <name> , and lodged , as well as took his meals , at the pension .
he was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk , and to have escorted her home .
in the afternoon , however , it came on to rain heavily ; and , supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt 's , ( as she had done under similar circumstances before , ) he did not think it necessary to keep his promise .
as night <name> on , madame rogêt ( who was an infirm old <name> , seventy years of age , ) was heard to express a fear " that she should never see <name> again ; " but this observation attracted little attention at the time .
on monday , it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the rue des <unk> ; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her , a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city , and its environs .
it was not , however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her .
on this day , ( wednesday , the <unk> of <name> , ) a monsieur beauvais , ( <unk> ) who , with a friend , had been making inquiries for <name> near the barrière du roule , on the shore of the seine which is opposite the rue <unk> st. <unk> , was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen , who had found it floating in the river .
upon seeing the body , beauvais , after some hesitation , identified it as that of the <unk> .
his friend recognized it more promptly .
the face was suffused with dark blood , some of which issued from the mouth .
no foam was seen , as in the case of the merely drowned .
there was no <unk> in the cellular tissue .
about the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers .
the arms were bent over on the chest and were rigid .
the right hand was clenched ; the left partially open .
on the left wrist were two circular <unk> , apparently the effect of ropes , or of a rope in more than one <unk> .
a part of the right wrist , also , was much chafed , as well as the back throughout its extent , but more especially at the shoulder-blades .
in bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope ; but none of the <unk> had been effected by this .
the flesh of the neck was much swollen .
there were no cuts apparent , or bruises which appeared the effect of blows .
a piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight ; it was completely buried in the flesh , and was <unk> by a knot which lay just under the left ear .
this alone would have sufficed to produce death .
the medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased .
she had been subjected , it said , to brutal violence .
the corpse was in such condition when found , that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends .
the dress was much torn and otherwise disordered .
in the outer garment , a slip , about a foot wide , had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist , but not torn off .
it was wound three times around the waist , and secured by a sort of hitch in the back .
the dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin ; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out  torn very evenly and with great care .
it was found around her neck , fitting loosely , and secured with a hard knot .
over this muslin slip and the slip of lace , the strings of a bonnet were attached ; the bonnet being appended .
the knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened , was not a <name> 's , but a slip or sailor 's knot .
after the recognition of the corpse , it was not , as usual , taken to the morgue , ( this formality being superfluous , ) but hastily interred not far front the spot at which it was brought ashore .
through the exertions of beauvais , the matter was industriously hushed up , as far as possible ; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted .
a weekly paper , ( <unk> ) however , at length took up the theme ; the corpse was <unk> , and a <unk> instituted ; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted .
the clothes , however , were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased , and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home .
meantime , the excitement increased hourly .
several individuals were arrested and discharged .
st. eustache fell especially under suspicion ; and he failed , at first , to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the <name> on which <name> left home .
subsequently , however , he submitted to monsieur g   , <unk> , accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question .
as time passed and no discovery ensued , a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated , and <unk> busied themselves in suggestions .
among these , the one which attracted the most notice , was the idea that <name> rogêt still lived  that the corpse found in the seine was that of some other unfortunate .
it <name> be proper that i submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to .
these passages are literal translations from l'etoile , ( <unk> ) a paper conducted , in general , with much ability .
" mademoiselle rogêt left her mother 's house on <name> morning , <name> the twenty-second , 18  , with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt , or some other connexion , in the rue des <unk> .
from that hour , nobody is proved to have seen her .
there is no trace or tidings of her at all ... .
there has no person , whatever , come forward , so far , who saw her at all , on that day , after she left her mother 's door ... . now , though we have no evidence that <name> rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on <name> , <name> the twenty-second , we have proof that , up to that hour , she was alive .
on wednesday noon , at twelve , a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the barrière de roule .
this was , even if we presume that <name> rogêt was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother 's house , only three days from the time she left her home  three days to an hour .
but it is folly to suppose that the murder , if murder was committed on her body , could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight .
those who are guilty of such horrid crimes , choose darkness rather the light ... .
thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of <name> rogêt , it could only have been in the water two and a half days , or three at the outside .
all experience has shown that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even where a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again , if let alone .
now , we ask , what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature ? ...
if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night , some trace would be found on shore of the murderers .
it is a doubtful point , also , whether the body would be so soon afloat , even were it thrown in after having been dead two days .
and , furthermore , it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed , would have throw the body in without weight to sink it , when such a precaution could have so easily been taken . "
the editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water " not three days merely , but , at least , five times three days , " because it was so far decomposed that beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it .
this latter point , however , was fully <unk> .
i continue the translation : " what , then , are the facts on which m. beauvais says that he has no doubt the body was that of <name> rogêt ?
he ripped up the gown sleeve , and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity .
the public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars .
he rubbed the arm and found hair upon it  something as indefinite , we think , as can readily be imagined  as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve .
m. beauvais did not return that night , but sent word to madame rogêt , at seven o'clock , on wednesday evening , that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter .
if we allow that madame rogêt , from her age and grief , could not go over , ( which is allowing a great deal , ) there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation , if they thought the body was that of <name> .
nobody went over .
there was nothing said or heard about the matter in the rue <unk> st. <unk> , that reached even the occupants of the same building .
m. st. eustache , the lover and intended husband of <name> , who boarded in her mother 's house , <unk> that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning , when m. beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it .
for an item of news like this , it strikes us it was very coolly received . "
in this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of <name> , inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers .
its insinuations amount to this :  that <name> , with the <unk> of her friends , had <unk> herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her <name> ; and that these friends , upon the discovery of a corpse in the seine , somewhat resembling that of the girl , had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress press the public with the belief of her death .
but l'etoile was again <unk> .
it was distinctly proved that no apathy , such as was imagined , existed ; that the old <name> was exceedingly feeble , and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty , that st. eustache , so far from receiving the news coolly , was distracted with grief , and bore himself so frantically , that m. beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him , and prevent his attending the examination at the <unk> .
moreover , although it was stated by l'etoile , that the corpse was <unk> at the public expense  that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely declined by the family  and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial :  although , i say , all this was asserted by l'etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey  yet all this was satisfactorily <unk> .
in a subsequent number of the paper , an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon beauvais himself .
the editor says : " now , then , a change comes over the matter .
we are told that on one occasion , while a madame b   was at madame rogêt 's house , m. beauvais , who was going out , told her that a <unk> was expected there , and she , madame b. , must not say anything to the <unk> until he returned , but let the matter be for him ... .
in the present posture of affairs , m. beauvais appears to have the whole matter looked up in his head .
a single step can not be taken without m. beauvais ; for , go which way you <name> , you run against him ... . for some reason , he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself , and he has <unk> the male relatives out of the way , according to their representations , in a very singular manner .
he seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body . "
by the following fact , some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon beauvais .
a visiter at his office , a few days prior to the girl's disappearance , and during the absence of its occupant , had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door , and the name " <name> " inscribed upon a slate which <name> near at hand .
the general impression , so far as we were enabled to <unk> it from the newspapers , seemed to be , that <name> had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes  that by these she had been borne across the river , <unk> and murdered .
<name> <unk> , ( <unk> ) however , a print of extensive influence , was <name> in <unk> this popular idea .
i quote a passage or two from its columns : " we are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent , so far as it has been directed to the barrière du roule .
it is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was , should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her ; and any one who saw her would have remembered it , for she interested all who knew her .
it was when the streets were full of people , when she went out ... .
it is impossible that she could have gone to the barrière du roule , or to the rue des <unk> , without being recognized by a dozen persons ; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother 's door , and there is no evidence , except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions , that she did go out at all .
her gown was torn , bound round her , and tied ; and by that the body was carried as a bundle .
if the murder had been committed at the barrière du roule , there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement .
the fact that the body was found floating near the barrière , is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water ... .. a piece of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats , two feet long and one foot wide , was torn out and tied under her <name> around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief . "
a day or two before the prefect called upon us , however , some important information reached the police , which seemed to overthrow , at least , the chief portion of <name> <unk> 's argument .
two small boys , sons of a madame deluc , while roaming among the woods near the barrière du roule , chanced to penetrate a close thicket , within which were three or four large stones , forming a kind of seat , with a back and footstool .
on the upper stone lay a white petticoat ; on the second a silk scarf .
a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found .
the handkerchief bore the name " <name> rogêt . "
fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around .
the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , and there was every evidence of a struggle .
between the thicket and the river , the fences were found taken down , and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it .
a weekly paper , <name> <unk> , ( <unk> ) had the following comments upon this discovery  comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole parisian press : " the things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks ; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew .
the grass had grown around and over some of them .
the silk on the parasol was strong , but the threads of it were run together within .
the upper part , where it had been doubled and folded , was all mildewed and rotten , and tore on its being opened ... ..
the pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long .
one part was the hem of the frock , and it had been mended ; the other piece was part of the skirt , not the hem .
they looked like strips torn off , and were on the thorn bush , about a foot from the ground ... ..
there can be no doubt , therefore , that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered . "
consequent upon this discovery , new evidence appeared .
madame deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river , opposite the barrière du roule .
the neighborhood is secluded  particularly so .
it is the usual <name> resort of blackguards from the city , who cross the river in boats .
about three o'clock , in the afternoon of the <name> in question , a young girl arrived at the inn , accompanied by a young man of dark complexion .
the two remained here for some time .
on their departure , they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity .
madame deluc 's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl , on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative .
a scarf was particularly noticed .
soon after the departure of the couple , a gang of <unk> made their appearance , behaved <unk> , ate and drank without making payment , followed in the route of the young man and girl , returned to the inn about dusk , and <unk> the river as if in great haste .
it was soon after dark , upon this same evening , that madame deluc , as well as her eldest son , heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn .
the screams were violent but brief .
madame d. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket , but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse .
an omnibus driver , <unk> , ( <unk> ) now also testified that he saw <name> rogêt cross a ferry on the seine , on the <name> in question , in company with a young man of dark complexion .
he , <unk> , knew <name> , and could not be mistaken in her identity .
the articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of <name> .
the items of evidence and information thus collected by myself , from the newspapers , at the suggestion of dupin , embraced only one more point  but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence .
it appears that , immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described , the lifeless , or nearly lifeless body of st. eustache , <unk> betrothed , was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage .
a phial labelled " <unk> , " and emptied , was found near him .
his breath gave evidence of the poison .
he died without speaking .
upon his person was found a letter , briefly stating his love for <name> , with his design of <unk> .
" i need scarcely tell you , " said dupin , as he finished the perusal of my notes , " that this is a far more intricate case than that of the rue morgue ; from which it differs in one important respect .
this is an ordinary , although an atrocious instance of crime .
there is nothing peculiarly <unk> about it .
you <name> observe that , for this reason , the mystery has been considered easy , when , for this reason , it should have been considered difficult , of solution .
thus ; at first , it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward .
the <unk> of g   were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed .
they could picture to their imaginations a mode  many modes  and a motive  many motives ; and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one , they have taken it for granted that one of them must .
but the case with which these variable fancies were entertained , and the very plausibility which each assumed , should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend <unk> .
i have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary , that reason feels her way , if at all , in her search for the true , and that the proper question in cases such as this , is not so much 'what has occurred ? '
as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before ? '
in the investigations at the house of madame l'espanaye , ( <unk> ) the agents of g   were discouraged and confounded by that very <unk> which , to a properly regulated intellect , would have afforded the surest omen of success ; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the <unk> , and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the <unk> of the prefecture .
" in the case of madame l'espanaye and her daughter there was , even at the beginning of our investigation , no doubt that murder had been committed .
the idea of suicide was excluded at once .
here , too , we are freed , at the commencement , from all supposition of <unk> .
the body found at the barrière du roule , was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point .
but it has been suggested that the corpse discovered , is not that of the <name> rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin , or assassins , the reward is offered , and respecting whom , solely , our agreement has been arranged with the prefect .
we both know this gentleman well .
it <name> not do to trust him too far .
if , <unk> our inquiries from the body found , and thence tracing a murderer , we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than <name> ; or , if starting from the living <name> , we find her , yet find her <unk>  in either case we lose our labor ; since it is monsieur g   with whom we have to deal .
for our own purpose , therefore , if not for the purpose of justice , it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the <name> rogêt who is missing .
" with the public the arguments of l'etoile have had weight ; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject  <unk> of the morning papers of the day , ' it says , 'speak of the conclusive article in monday 's <unk> . '
to me , this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its <unk> .
we should bear in mind that , in general , it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation  to make a point  than to further the cause of truth .
the latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former .
the print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion ( however well founded this opinion may be ) earns for itself no credit with the mob .
the mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea .
in <unk> , not less than in literature , it is the <unk> which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated .
in both , it is of the lowest order of merit .
" what i mean to say is , that it is the mingled <unk> and <unk> of the idea , that <name> rogêt still lives , rather than any true plausibility in this idea , which have suggested it to l'etoile , and secured it a favorable reception with the public .
let us examine the heads of this journal 's argument ; endeavoring to avoid the <unk> with which it is originally set forth .
" the first aim of the writer is to show , from the brevity of the interval between <name> 's disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse , that this corpse can not be that of <name> .
the reduction of this interval to its smallest possible <unk> , becomes thus , at once , an object with the <unk> .
in the rash pursuit of this object , he rushes into mere assumption at the outset .
'it is folly to suppose , ' he says , 'that the murder , if murder was committed on her body , could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight . '
we demand at once , and very naturally , why ?
why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl 's quitting her mother 's house ?
why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day ?
there have been <unk> at all hours .
but , had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of <name> , and a quarter before midnight , there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight . '
this assumption , then , amounts precisely to this  that the murder was not committed on <name> at all  and , if we allow l'etoile to assume this , we may permit it any liberties whatever .
the paragraph beginning 'it is folly to suppose that the murder , etc. , ' however it appears as printed in l'etoile , may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the <name> of its <unk>  'it is folly to suppose that the murder , if murder was committed on the body , could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight ; it is folly , we say , to suppose all this , and to suppose at the same time , ( as we are resolved to suppose , ) that the body was not thrown in until after midnight '  a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself , but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed .
" were it my purpose , " continued dupin , " merely to make out a case against this passage of l'etoile 's argument , i might safely leave it where it is .
it is not , however , with l'etoile that we have to do , but with the truth .
the sentence in question has but one meaning , as it stands ; and this meaning i have fairly stated : but it is material that we go behind the mere words , for an idea which these words have obviously intended , and failed to convey .
it was the design of the journalist to say that , at whatever period of the day or night of <name> this murder was committed , it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight .
and herein lies , really , the assumption of which i complain .
it is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position , and under such circumstances , that the bearing it to the river became necessary .
now , the assassination might have taken place upon the river 's brink , or on the river itself ; and , thus , the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to , at any period of the day or night , as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal .
you <name> understand that i suggest nothing here as probable , or as <unk> with my own opinion .
my design , so far , has no reference to the facts of the case .
i wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of l'etoile 's suggestion , by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset .
" having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions ; having assumed that , if this were the body of <name> , it could have been in the water but a very brief time ; the journal goes on to say : 'all experience has shown that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even when a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again if let alone . '
" these assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in <name> , with the exception of <name> <unk> .
( <unk> ) this latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to <unk> bodies ' only , by <unk> some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by l'etoile .
but there is something excessively <unk> in the attempt on the part of <name> <unk> , to <unk> the general assertion of l'etoile , by a <unk> of particular instances <unk> against that assertion .
had it been possible to <unk> fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days , these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to l'etoile 's rule , until such time as the rule itself should be <unk> .
admitting the rule , ( and this <name> <unk> does not deny , insisting merely upon its exceptions , ) the argument of l'etoile is suffered to remain in full force ; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days ; and this probability <name> be in favor of l'etoile 's position until the instances so <unk> adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an <unk> rule .
" you <name> see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged , if at all , against the rule itself ; and for this end we must examine the <unk> of the rule .
now the human body , in general , is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the seine ; that is to say , the specific gravity of the human body , in its natural condition , is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it <unk> .
the bodies of fat and fleshy persons , with small bones , and of women generally , are lighter than those of the <name> and <unk> , and of men ; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea .
but , leaving this tide out of question , it may be said that very few human bodies <name> sink at all , even in fresh water , of their own accord .
almost any one , falling into a river , <name> be enabled to float , if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own  that is to say , if he suffer his whole person to be immersed , with as little exception as possible .
the proper position for one who can not swim , is the upright position of the <name> on land , with the head thrown fully back , and immersed ; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface .
thus circumstanced , we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion .
it is evident , however , that the <unk> of the body , and of the bulk of water displaced , are very nicely balanced , and that a trifle <name> cause either to preponderate .
an arm , for instance , uplifted from the water , and thus deprived of its support , is an additional weight sufficient to <unk> the whole head , while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber <name> enable us to elevate the head so as to look about .
now , in the struggles of one unused to swimming , the arms are invariably thrown upwards , while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position .
the result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils , and the <unk> , during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface , of water into the lungs .
much is also received into the stomach , and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally <unk> these cavities , and that of the fluid which now fills them .
this difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink , as a general rule ; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter .
such individuals float even after drowning .
" the corpse , being supposed at the bottom of the river , <name> there remain until , by some means , its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it <unk> .
this effect is brought about by decomposition , or otherwise .
the result of decomposition is the generation of gas , <unk> the cellular tissues and all the cavities , and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible .
when this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight , its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced , and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface .
but decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances  is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies ; for example , by the heat or cold of the season , by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water , by its depth or <unk> , by its currency or <unk> , by the temperament of the body , by its infection or freedom from disease before death .
thus it is evident that we can assign no period , with any thing like accuracy , at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition .
under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour ; under others , it might not take place at all .
there are chemical <unk> by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption ; the <unk> of mercury is one .
but , apart from decomposition , there may be , and very usually is , a generation of gas within the stomach , from the <unk> <unk> of vegetable matter ( or within other cavities from other causes ) sufficient to induce a distension which <name> bring the body to the surface .
the effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration .
this may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded , thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing ; or it may overcome the tenacity of some <unk> portions of the cellular tissue ; allowing the cavities to <unk> under the influence of the gas .
" having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject , we can easily test by it the assertions of l'etoile .
'all experience shows , ' says this paper , 'that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even when a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again if let alone . '
" the whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of <unk> and <unk> .
all experience does not show that <unk> <unk> require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface .
both science and experience show that the period of their rising is , and necessarily must be , indeterminate .
if , moreover , a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon , it <name> not <unk> again if let alone , ' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas .
but i wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between <unk> bodies , ' and <unk> thrown into the water immediately after death by violence . '
although the writer admits the distinction , he yet includes them all in the same category .
i have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water , and that he would not sink at all , except for the struggles by which he <unk> his arms above the surface , and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface  gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs .
but these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body <unk> into the water immediately after death by violence . '
thus , in the latter instance , the body , as a general rule , would not sink at all  a fact of which l'etoile is evidently ignorant .
when decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent  when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones  then , indeed , but not till then , should we lose sight of the corpse .
" and now what are we to make of the argument , that the body found could not be that of <name> rogêt , because , three days only having elapsed , this body was found floating ?
if drowned , being a woman , she might never have sunk ; or having sunk , might have reappeared in twenty-four hours , or less .
but no one supposes her to have been drowned ; and , dying before being thrown into the river , she might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever .
" 'but , ' says l'etoile , 'if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night , some trace would be found on shore of the murderers . '
here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the <unk> .
he means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory  viz : that the body was kept on shore two days , suffering rapid decomposition  more rapid than if immersed in water .
he supposes that , had this been the case , it might have appeared at the surface on the wednesday , and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared .
he is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore ; for , if so , 'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers . '
i presume you smile at the <unk> .
you can not be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins .
nor can i .
" 'and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable , ' continues our journal , 'that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed , would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it , when such a precaution could have so easily been taken . '
observe , here , the laughable confusion of thought !
no one  not even l'etoile  disputes the murder committed on the body found .
the marks of violence are too obvious .
it is our <unk> 's object merely to show that this body is not <name> 's .
he wishes to prove that <name> is not assassinated  not that the corpse was not .
yet his observation proves only the latter point .
here is a corpse without weight attached .
murderers , casting it in , would not have failed to attach a weight .
therefore it was not thrown in by murderers .
this is all which is proved , if any thing is .
the question of identity is not even approached , and l'etoile has been at great pains merely to <unk> now what it has admitted only a moment before .
'we are perfectly convinced , ' it says , 'that the body found was that of a murdered female . '
" nor is this the sole instance , even in this division of his subject , where our <unk> unwittingly reasons against himself .
his evident object , i have already said , is to reduce , us much as possible , the interval between <name> 's disappearance and the finding of the corpse .
yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother 's house .
'we have no evidence , ' he says , 'that <name> rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on <name> , <name> the twenty-second . '
as his argument is obviously an ex parte one , he should , at least , have left this matter out of sight ; for had any one been known to see <name> , say on monday , or on tuesday , the interval in question would have been much reduced , and , by his own <unk> , the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the <unk> .
it is , nevertheless , amusing to observe that l'etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its <unk> its general argument .
" <unk> now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by beauvais .
in regard to the hair upon the arm , l'etoile has been obviously <unk> .
m. beauvais , not being an idiot , could never have urged , in identification of the corpse , simply hair upon its arm .
no arm is without hair .
the generality of the expression of l'etoile is a mere perversion of the witness ' phraseology .
he must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair .
it must have been a peculiarity of color , of quantity , of length , or of situation .
" 'her foot , ' says the journal , 'was small  so are thousands of feet .
her garter is no proof whatever  nor is her shoe  for shoes and <unk> are sold in packages .
the same may be said of the flowers in her hat .
one thing upon which m. beauvais strongly insists is , that the clasp on the garter found , had been set back to take it in .
this amounts to nothing ; for most women find it proper to take a pair of <unk> home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to <unk> , rather than to try them in the store where they purchase . '
here it is difficult to suppose the <unk> in <name> .
had m. beauvais , in his search for the body of <name> , discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl , he would have been warranted ( without reference to the question of <unk> at all ) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful .
if , in addition to the point of general size and contour , he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living <name> , his opinion might have been justly strengthened ; and the increase of <unk> might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity , or <unk> , of the hairy <name> .
if , the feet of <name> being small , those of the corpse were also small , the increase of probability that the body was that of <name> would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical , but in one highly geometrical , or accumulative .
add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance , and , although these shoes may be <unk> in packages , ' you so far <unk> the probability as to verge upon the certain .
what , of itself , would be no evidence of identity , becomes through its <unk> position , proof most sure .
give us , then , flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl , and we seek for nothing farther .
if only one flower , we seek for nothing farther  what then if two or three , or more ?
each successive one is multiple evidence  proof not added to proof , but multiplied by hundreds or thousands .
let us now discover , upon the deceased , <unk> such as the living used , and it is almost folly to proceed .
but these <unk> are found to be tightened , by the setting back of a clasp , in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by <name> , shortly previous to her leaving home .
it is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt .
what l'etoile says in respect to this <unk> of the garter 's being an usual occurrence , shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error .
the elastic nature of the <unk> is <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what is made to adjust itself , must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely .
it must have been by an accident , in its strictest sense , that these <unk> of <name> needed the tightening described .
they alone would have amply established her identity .
but it is not that the corpse was found to have the <unk> of the missing girl , or found to have her shoes , or her bonnet , or the flowers of her bonnet , or her feet , or a peculiar <name> upon the arm , or her general size and appearance  it is that the corpse had each , and all collectively .
could it be proved that the editor of l'etoile really entertained a doubt , under the circumstances , there would be no need , in his case , of a commission de <unk> <unk> .
he has thought it sagacious to <name> the small talk of the lawyers , who , for the most part , content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts .
i would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court , is the best of evidence to the intellect .
for the court , guiding itself by the general principles of evidence  the recognized and booked principles  is averse from <unk> at particular instances .
and this steadfast <unk> to principle , with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception , is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth , in any long sequence of time .
the practice , in mass , is therefore philosophical ; but it is not the less certain that it <unk> vast individual error .
( <unk> ) " in respect to the insinuations levelled at beauvais , you <name> be willing to dismiss them in a breath .
you have already <unk> the true character of this good gentleman .
he is a <unk> , with much of romance and little of wit .
any one so constituted <name> readily so conduct himself , upon occasion of real excitement , as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over acute , or the <unk> .
m. beauvais ( as it appears from your notes ) had some personal interviews with the editor of l'etoile , and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse , notwithstanding the theory of the editor , was , in sober fact , that of <name> .
'he <unk> , ' says the paper , 'in asserting the corpse to be that of <name> , but can not give a circumstance , in addition to those which we have commented upon , to make others believe . '
now , without <unk> to the fact that stronger evidence 'to make others believe , ' could never have been adduced , it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe , in a case of this kind , without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party .
nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity .
each man recognizes his neighbor , yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition .
the editor of l'etoile had no right to be offended at m. beauvais ' unreasoning belief .
" the suspicious circumstances which invest him , <name> be found to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic <unk> , than with the <unk> 's suggestion of guilt .
once adopting the more charitable interpretation , we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the key-hole ; the <unk> ' upon the slate ; the <unk> the male relatives out of the way ; ' the <unk> to permitting them to see the body ; ' the caution given to madame b   , that she must hold no conversation with the <unk> until his return ( beauvais ' ) ; and , lastly , his apparent determination 'that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself . '
it seems to me unquestionable that beauvais was a suitor of <name> 's ; that she <unk> with him ; and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence .
i shall say nothing more upon this point ; and , as the evidence fully <unk> the assertion of l'etoile , touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives  an apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the <unk>  we shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction . "
" and what , " i here demanded , " do you think of the opinions of <name> <unk> ? "
" that , in spirit , they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been <unk> upon the subject .
the deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute ; but the premises , in two instances , at least , are founded in imperfect observation .
<name> <unk> wishes to intimate that <name> was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mother 's door .
'it is impossible , ' it urges , 'that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was , should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her . '
this is the idea of a man long resident in <name>  a public man  and one whose walks to and fro in the city , have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices .
he is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau , without being recognized and accosted .
and , knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others , and of others with him , he compares his notoriety with that of the <unk> , finds no great difference between them , and reaches at once the conclusion that she , in her walks , would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his .
this could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying , methodical character , and within the same species of limited region as are his own .
he passes to and fro , at regular intervals , within a confined <unk> , abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own .
but the walks of <name> may , in general , be supposed <unk> .
in this particular instance , it <name> be understood as most probable , that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones .
the parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of <name> <unk> would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals ' traversing the whole city .
in this case , granting the personal acquaintances to be equal , the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal <unk> would be made .
for my own part , i should hold it not only as possible , but as very far more than probable , that <name> might have proceeded , at any given period , by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt , without meeting a single individual whom she knew , or by whom she was known .
in viewing this question in its full and proper light , we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in <name> , and the entire population of <name> itself .
" but whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of <name> <unk> , <name> be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad .
'it was when the streets were full of people , ' says <name> <unk> , 'that she went out . '
but not so .
it was at nine o'clock in the morning .
now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week , with the exception of <name> , the streets of the city are , it is true , thronged with people .
at nine on <name> , the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church .
no observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town , from about eight until ten on the morning of every sabbath .
between ten and eleven the streets are thronged , but not at so early a period as that designated .
" there is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of <name> <unk> .
'a piece , ' it says , 'of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats , two feet long , and one foot wide , was torn out and tied under her <name> , and around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done , by fellows who had no <unk> . '
whether this idea is , or is not well founded , we <name> endeavor to see hereafter ; but by <unk> who have no <unk> ' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians .
these , however , are the very description of people who <name> always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts .
you must have had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable , of late years , to the thorough blackguard , has become the pocket-handkerchief . "
" and what are we to think , " i asked , " of the article in <name> <unk> ? "
" that it is a vast pity its <unk> was not born a parrot  in which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race .
he has merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion ; collecting them , with a laudable industry , from this paper and from that .
'the things had all evidently been there , ' he says , 'at least , three or four weeks , and there can be no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered . '
the facts here <unk> by <name> <unk> , are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject , and we <name> examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with another division of the theme .
" at present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations you can not fail to have remarked the extreme <unk> of the examination of the corpse .
to be sure , the question of identity was readily determined , or should have been ; but there were other points to be ascertained .
had the body been in any respect <unk> ?
had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home ?
if so , had she any when found ?
these are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence ; and there are others of equal moment , which have met with no attention .
we must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry .
the case of st. eustache must be <unk> .
i have no suspicion of this person ; but let us proceed methodically .
we <name> ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the <unk> in regard to his whereabouts on the <name> .
<unk> of this character are readily made matter of <unk> .
should there be nothing wrong here , however , we <name> dismiss st. eustache from our investigations .
his suicide , however <unk> of suspicion , were there found to be deceit in the <unk> , is , without such deceit , in no respect an unaccountable circumstance , or one which need cause us to <unk> from the line of ordinary analysis .
" in that which i now propose , we <name> discard the interior points of this tragedy , and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts .
not the least usual error , in investigations such as this , is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate , with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events .
it is the <unk> of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy .
yet experience has shown , and a true philosophy <name> always show , that a vast , perhaps the larger portion of truth , arises from the seemingly irrelevant .
it is through the spirit of this principle , if not precisely through its letter , that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen .
but perhaps you do not comprehend me .
the history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral , or incidental , or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries , that it has at length become necessary , in any prospective view of improvement , to make not only large , but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance , and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation .
it is no longer philosophical to base , upon what has been , a vision of what is to be .
accident is admitted as a portion of the <unk> .
we make chance a matter of absolute calculation .
we subject the <unk> for and <unk> , to the mathematical <unk> of the schools .
" i repeat that it is no more than fact , that the larger portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral ; and it is but in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact , that i would divert inquiry , in the present case , from the trodden and hitherto <unk> ground of the event itself , to the contemporary circumstances which surround it .
while you ascertain the validity of the <unk> , i <name> examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done .
so far , we have only <unk> the field of investigation ; but it <name> be strange indeed if a comprehensive survey , such as i propose , of the public prints , <name> not afford us some minute points which shall establish a direction for inquiry . "
in pursuance of dupin 's suggestion , i made scrupulous examination of the affair of the <unk> .
the result was a firm conviction of their validity , and of the consequent innocence of st. eustache .
in the mean time my friend occupied himself , with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether <unk> , in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files .
at the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts : " about three years and a half ago , a disturbance very similar to the present , was caused by the disappearance of this same <name> rogêt , from the <unk> of monsieur <name> blanc , in the <unk> <name> .
at the end of a week , however , she <unk> at her customary <unk> , as well as ever , with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual .
it was given out by monsieur <name> blanc and her mother , that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country ; and the affair was speedily hushed up .
we presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature , and that , at the expiration of a week , or perhaps of a month , we shall have her among us again . "
 evening paper  monday <name> 23 .
( <unk> ) " an evening journal of yesterday , refers to a former mysterious disappearance of mademoiselle rogêt .
it is well known that , during the week of her absence from <name> blanc 's <unk> , she was in the company of a young naval officer , much noted for his <unk> .
a quarrel , it is supposed , <unk> led to her return home .
we have the name of the <unk> in question , who is , at present , stationed in <name> , but , for obvious reasons , forbear to make it public . "
 <name> <unk>  tuesday morning , <name> 24 .
( <unk> ) " an outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this city the day before yesterday .
a gentleman , with his wife and daughter , engaged , about dusk , the services of six young men , who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the seine , to convey him across the river .
upon reaching the opposite shore , the three passengers stepped out , and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat , when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol .
she returned for it , was seized by the gang , carried out into the stream , gagged , brutally treated , and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents .
the villains have escaped for the time , but the police are upon their trail , and some of them <name> soon be taken . "
 morning paper  <name> 25 .
( <unk> ) " we have received one or two communications , the object of which is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon <unk> ; ( <unk> ) but as this gentleman has been fully <unk> by a loyal inquiry , and as the arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than profound , we do not think it advisable to make them public . "
 morning paper  <name> 28 .
( <unk> ) " we have received several forcibly written communications , apparently from various sources , and which go far to render it a matter of certainty that the unfortunate <name> rogêt has become a victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city upon <name> .
our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this supposition .
we shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments hereafter . "
 evening paper  tuesday , <name> 31 .
( <unk> ) " on monday , one of the <unk> connected with the revenue service , saw a empty boat floating down the seine .
sails were lying in the bottom of the boat .
the <unk> towed it under the barge office .
the next morning it was taken from thence , without the knowledge of any of the officers .
the rudder is now at the barge office . "
 <name> diligence  thursday , <name> 26 .
upon reading these various extracts , they not only seemed to me irrelevant , but i could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand .
i waited for some explanation from dupin .
" it is not my present design , " he said , " to dwell upon the first and second of those extracts .
i have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme <unk> of the police , who , as far as i can understand from the prefect , have not troubled themselves , in any respect , with an examination of the naval officer alluded to .
yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of <name> , there is no <unk> connection .
let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers , and the return home of the betrayed .
we are now prepared to view a second elopement ( if we know that an elopement has again taken place ) as indicating a renewal of the <unk> 's advances , rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual  we are prepared to regard it as a <unk> up ' of the old <unk> , rather than as the commencement of a new one .
the chances are ten to one , that he who had once <unk> with <name> , would again propose an elopement , rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual , should have them made to her by another .
and here let me call your attention to the fact , that the time <unk> between the first ascertained , and the second supposed elopement , is a few months more than the general period of the <unk> of our men-of-war .
had the lover been interrupted in his first <unk> by the necessity of departure to sea , and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished  or not yet altogether accomplished by him ?  of all these things we know nothing .
" you <name> say , however , that , in the second instance , there was no elopement as imagined .
certainly not  but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design ?
beyond st. eustache , and perhaps beauvais , we find no recognized , no open , no honorable suitors of <name> .
of none other is there any thing said .
who , then , is the secret lover , of whom the relatives ( at least most of them ) know nothing , but whom <name> meets upon the morning of <name> , and who is so deeply in her confidence , that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend , amid the solitary groves of the barrière du roule ?
who is that secret lover , i ask , of whom , at least , most of the relatives know nothing ?
and what means the singular prophecy of madame rogêt on the morning of <name> 's departure ?  'i fear that i shall never see <name> again . '
" but if we can not imagine madame rogêt privy to the design of elopement , may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl ?
upon quitting home , she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the rue des <unk> and st. eustache was requested to call for her at dark .
now , at first glance , this fact strongly <unk> against my suggestion ;  but let us reflect .
that she did meet some companion , and proceed with him across the river , reaching the barrière du roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon , is known .
but in consenting so to accompany this individual , ( for whatever purpose  to her mother known or unknown ,  ) she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home , and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her <unk> suitor , st. eustache , when , calling for her , at the hour appointed , in the rue des <unk> , he should find that she had not been there , and when , moreover , upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence , he should become aware of her continued absence from home .
she must have thought of these things , i say .
she must have foreseen the chagrin of st. eustache , the suspicion of all .
she could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion ; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her , if we suppose her not intending to return .
" we may imagine her thinking thus  'i am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement , or for certain other purposes known only to myself .
it is necessary that there be no chance of interruption  there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit  i <name> give it to be understood that i shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the rue des <unk>  i well tell st. eustache not to call for me until dark  in this way , my absence from home for the longest possible period , without causing suspicion or anxiety , <name> be accounted for , and i shall gain more time than in any other manner .
if i bid st. eustache call for me at dark , he <name> be sure not to call before ; but , if i wholly neglect to bid him call , my time for escape <name> be diminished , since it <name> be expected that i return the earlier , and my absence <name> the sooner excite anxiety .
now , if it were my design to return at all  if i had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question  it would not be my policy to bid st. eustache call ; for , calling , he <name> be sure to ascertain that i have played him false  a fact of which i might keep him for ever in ignorance , by leaving home without <unk> him of my intention , by returning before dark , and by then stating that i had been to visit my aunt in the rue des <unk> .
but , as it is my design never to return  or not for some weeks  or not until certain <unk> are effected  the gaining of time is the only point about which i need give myself any concern . '
" you have observed , in your notes , that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is , and was from the first , that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards .
now , the popular opinion , under certain conditions , is not to be disregarded .
when arising of itself  when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner  we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the <unk> of the individual man of genius .
in ninety-nine cases from the hundred i would abide by its decision .
but it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion .
the opinion must be rigorously the public 's own ; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain .
in the present instance , it appears to me that this <unk> opinion ' in respect to a gang , has been <unk> by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts .
all <name> is excited by the discovered corpse of <name> , a girl young , beautiful and notorious .
this corpse is found , bearing marks of violence , and floating in the river .
but it is now made known that , at the very period , or about the very period , in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated , an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased , although less in extent , was perpetuated , by a gang of young ruffians , upon the person of a second young female .
is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown ?
this judgment awaited direction , and the known outrage seemed so <unk> to afford it !
<name> , too , was found in the river ; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed .
the connexion of the two events had about it so much of the palpable , that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it .
but , in fact , the one atrocity , known to be so committed , is , if any thing , evidence that the other , committed at a time nearly coincident , was not so committed .
it would have been a miracle indeed , if , while a gang of ruffians were <unk> , at a given locality , a most unheard-of wrong , there should have been another similar gang , in a similar locality , in the same city , under the same circumstances , with the same means and appliances , engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect , at precisely the same period of time !
yet in what , if not in this marvellous train of coincidence , does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe ?
" before proceeding farther , let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination , in the thicket at the barrière du roule .
this thicket , although dense , was in the close vicinity of a public road .
within were three or four large stones , forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool .
on the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat ; on the second , a silk scarf .
a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief , were also here found .
the handkerchief bore the name , <unk> rogêt . '
fragments of dress were seen on the branches around .
the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , and there was every evidence of a violent struggle .
" notwithstanding the <unk> with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press , and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage , it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt .
that it was the scene , i may or i may not believe  but there was excellent reason for doubt .
had the true scene been , as <name> <unk> suggested , in the neighborhood of the rue <unk> st. <unk> , the <unk> of the crime , supposing them still resident in <name> , would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel ; and , in certain classes of minds , there would have arisen , at once , a sense of the necessity of some exertion to <unk> this attention .
and thus , the thicket of the barrière du roule having been already suspected , the idea of placing the articles where they were found , might have been naturally entertained .
there is no real evidence , although <name> <unk> so supposes , that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket ; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there , without attracting attention , during the twenty days <unk> between the fatal <name> and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys .
'they were all mildewed down hard , ' says <name> <unk> , adopting the opinions of its predecessors , 'with the action of the rain , and stuck together from mildew .
the grass had grown around and over some of them .
the silk of the parasol was strong , but the threads of it were run together within .
the upper part , where it bad been doubled and folded , was all mildewed and rotten , and tore on being opened . '
in respect to the grass having <unk> around and over some of them , ' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words , and thus from the recollections , of two small boys ; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party .
but grass <name> grow , especially in warm and damp weather , ( such as was that of the period of the murder , ) as much as two or three inches in a single day .
a parasol lying upon a newly <unk> ground , might , in a single week , be entirely concealed from sight by the <unk> grass .
and touching that mildew upon which the editor of <name> <unk> so pertinaciously insists , that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted , is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew ?
is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus , of which the most ordinary feature is its <unk> and <unk> within twenty-four hours ?
" thus we see , at a glance , that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles bad been 'for at least three or four weeks ' in the thicket , is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact .
on the other hand , it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified , for a longer period than a single week  for a longer period than from one <name> to the next .
those who know any thing of the vicinity of <name> , know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great distance from its suburbs .
such a thing as an unexplored , or even an unfrequently visited recess , amid its woods or groves , is not for a moment to be imagined .
let any one who , being at heart a lover of nature , is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis  let any such one attempt , even during the <unk> , to <unk> his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us .
at every second step , he <name> find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards .
he <name> seek privacy amid the <unk> foliage , all in vain .
here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound  here are the temples most <unk> .
with sickness of the heart the wanderer <name> flee back to the polluted <name> as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution .
but if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week , how much more so on the sabbath !
it is now especially that , released from the claims of labor , or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime , the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town , not through love of the rural , which in his heart he despises , but by way of escape from the restraints and <unk> of society .
he desires less the fresh air and the green trees , than the utter license of the country .
here , at the road-side inn , or beneath the foliage of the woods , he <unk> , <unk> by any eye except those of his boon companions , in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity  the joint offspring of <name> and of rum .
i say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer , when i repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered , for a longer period  than from one <name> to another , in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of <name> , is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous .
" but there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of <unk> attention from the real scene of the outrage .
and , first , let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles .
<unk> this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers .
you <name> find that the discovery followed , almost immediately , the urgent communications sent to the evening paper .
these communications , although various and apparently from various sources , tended all to the same point  viz. , the directing of attention to a gang as the <unk> of the outrage , and to the neighborhood of the barrière du roule as its scene .
now here , of course , the suspicion is not that , in consequence of these communications , or of the public attention by them directed , the articles were found by the boys ; but the suspicion might and may well have been , that the articles were not before found by the boys , for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket ; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date , or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves .
" this thicket was a singular  an exceedingly singular one .
it was unusually dense .
within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones , forming a seat with a back and footstool .
and this thicket , so full of a natural <name> , was in the immediate vicinity , within a few rods , of the dwelling of madame deluc , whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the <unk> about them in search of the bark of the <unk> .
would it be a rash wager  a wager of one thousand to one  that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them <unk> in the <unk> hall , and <unk> upon its natural throne ?
those who would hesitate at such a wager , have either never been boys themselves , or have forgotten the boyish nature .
i repeat  it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered , for a longer period than one or two days ; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion , in spite of the <unk> ignorance of <name> <unk> , that they were , at a comparatively late date , deposited where found .
" but there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited , than any which i have as yet urged .
and , now , let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles .
on the upper stone lay a white petticoat ; on the second a silk scarf ; scattered around , were a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name , <unk> rogêt . '
here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not <unk> person wishing to dispose the articles naturally .
but it is by no means a really natural arrangement .
i should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot .
in the narrow limits of that bower , it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones , when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons .
'there was evidence , ' it is said , 'of a struggle ; and the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , '  but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves .
'the pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long .
one part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended .
they looked like strips torn off . '
here , <unk> , <name> <unk> has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase .
the pieces , as described , do indeed 'look like strips torn off ; ' but purposely and by hand .
it is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is <unk> off , ' from any garment such as is now in question , by the agency of a thorn .
from the very nature of such fabrics , a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them , tears them rectangularly  divides them into two longitudinal rents , at right angles with each other , and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters  but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece <unk> off . '
i never so knew it , nor did you .
to tear a piece off from such fabric , two distinct forces , in different directions , <name> be , in almost every case , required .
if there be two edges to the fabric  if , for example , it be a pocket-handkerchief , and it is desired to tear from it a slip , then , and then only , <name> the one force serve the purpose .
but in the present case the question is of a dress , presenting but one edge .
to tear a piece from the interior , where no edge is presented , could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns , and no one thorn could accomplish it .
but , even where an edge is presented , two thorns <name> be necessary , operating , the one in two distinct directions , and the other in one .
and this in the supposition that the edge is <unk> .
if hemmed , the matter is nearly out of the question .
we thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being <unk> off ' through the simple agency of <unk> ; ' yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn .
'and one part , ' too , 'was the hem of the frock ! '
another piece was <unk> of the skirt , not the hem , '  that is to say , was torn completely out through the agency of thorns , from the <unk> interior of the dress !
these , i say , are things which one may well be pardoned for <unk> ; yet , taken <unk> , they form , perhaps , less of reasonable ground for suspicion , than the one startling circumstance of the articles ' having been left in this thicket at all , by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse .
you <name> not have apprehended me rightly , however , if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage .
there might have been a wrong here , or , more possibly , an accident at madame deluc 's .
but , in fact , this is a point of minor importance .
we are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene , but to produce the <unk> of the murder .
what i have adduced , notwithstanding the minuteness with which i have adduced it , has been with the view , first , to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of <name> <unk> , but secondly and chiefly , to bring you , by the most natural route , to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has , or has not been , the work of a gang .
" we <name> resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest .
it is only necessary to say that is published inferences , in regard to the number of ruffians , have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally <unk> , by all the reputable anatomists of <name> .
not that the matter might not have been as inferred , but that there was no ground for the inference :  was there not much for another ?
" let us reflect now upon 'the traces of a struggle ; ' and let me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate .
a gang .
but do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang ?
what struggle could have taken place  what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its <unk> ' in all directions  between a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined ?
the silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over .
the victim must have been absolutely passive at their <name> .
you <name> here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene , are applicable in chief part , only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual .
if we imagine but one <unk> , we can conceive , and thus only conceive , the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the <unk> ' apparent .
" and again .
i have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered .
it seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found .
there was sufficient presence of mind ( it is supposed ) to remove the corpse ; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself ( whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay , ) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage  i allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased .
if this was accident , it was not the accident of a gang .
we can imagine it only the accident of an individual .
let us see .
an individual has committed the murder .
he is alone with the ghost of the departed .
he is appalled by what lies motionless before him .
the fury of his passion is over , and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed .
his is none of that confidence which the presence of <name> inevitably inspires .
he is alone with the dead .
he trembles and is bewildered .
yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse .
he bears it to the river , but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt ; for it is difficult , if not impossible to <name> all the burthen at once , and it <name> be easy to return for what is left .
but in his <unk> journey to the water his fears <unk> within him .
the sounds of life <unk> his path .
a dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer .
even the very lights from the city bewilder him .
yet , in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony , he reaches the river 's brink , and disposes of his ghastly charge  perhaps through the medium of a boat .
but now what treasure does the world hold  what threat of vengeance could it hold out  which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that <unk> and perilous path , to the thicket and its blood chilling recollections ?
he returns not , let the consequences be what they may .
he could not return if he would .
his sole thought is immediate escape .
he turns his back forever upon those dreadful <unk> and <unk> as from the wrath to come .
" but how with a gang ?
their number would have inspired them with confidence ; if , indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the <unk> blackguard ; and of <unk> blackguards alone are the supposed gangs ever constituted .
their number , i say , would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which i have imagined to <unk> the single man .
could we suppose an oversight in one , or two , or three , this oversight would have been remedied by a fourth .
they would have left nothing behind them ; for their number would have enabled them to <name> all at once .
there would have been no need of return .
" consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse when found , 'a slip , about a foot wide had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist , and secured by a sort of hitch in the back . '
this was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to <name> the body .
but would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient ?
to three or four , the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient , but the best possible hold .
the device is that of a single individual ; and this brings us to the fact that <unk> the thicket and the river , the rails of the fences were found taken down , and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it ! '
but would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence , for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant ?
would a number of men have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging ?
" and here we must refer to an observation of <name> <unk> ; an observation upon which i have already , in some measure , commented .
'a piece , ' says this journal , 'of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats was torn out and tied under her <name> , and around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done by fellows who had no <unk> . '
" i have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pocket-handkerchief .
but it is not to this fact that i now especially <unk> .
that it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by <name> <unk> , that this bandage was employed , is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket ; and that the object was not 'to prevent screams ' appears , also , from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose .
but the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as <unk> around the neck , fitting loosely , and secured with a hard knot . '
these words are sufficiently vague , but differ materially from those of <name> <unk> .
the slip was eighteen inches wide , and therefore , although of muslin , would form a strong band when folded or <unk> longitudinally .
and thus <unk> it was discovered .
my inference is this .
the solitary murderer , having borne the corpse , for some distance , ( whether from the thicket or elsewhere ) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle , found the weight , in this mode of procedure , too much for his strength .
he resolved to drag the burthen  the evidence goes to show that it was dragged .
with this object in view , it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities .
it could be best attached about the neck , where the head would prevent its slipping off .
and , now , the murderer bethought him , unquestionably , of the bandage about the loins .
he would have used this , but for its <unk> about the corpse , the hitch which embarrassed it , and the reflection that it had not been <unk> off ' from the garment .
it was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat .
he tore it , made it fast about the neck , and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river .
that this <unk> , ' only attainable with trouble and delay , and but imperfectly answering its purpose  that this bandage was employed at all , <unk> that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainable  that is to say , arising , as we have imagined , after quitting the thicket , ( if the thicket it was ) , and on the road between the thicket and the river .
" but the evidence , you <name> say , of madame deluc , ( ! )
points especially to the presence of a gang , in the vicinity of the thicket , at or about the epoch of the murder .
this i <name> .
i doubt if there were not a dozen gangs , such as described by madame deluc , in and about the vicinity of the barrière du roule at or about the period of this tragedy .
but the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed <unk> , although the somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of madame deluc , is the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old <name> as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her <name> , without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment .
et <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
" but what is the precise evidence of madame deluc ?
'a gang of <unk> made their appearance , behaved <unk> , ate and drank without making payment , followed in the route of the young man and girl , returned to the inn about dusk , and recrossed the river as if in great haste . '
" now this 'great haste ' very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of madame deluc , since she dwelt <unk> and <unk> upon her violated cakes and ale  cakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint <name> of compensation .
why , otherwise , since it was about dusk , should she make a point of the haste ?
it is no cause for wonder , surely , that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home , when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats , when storm <unk> , and when night approaches .
" i say approaches ; for the night had not yet arrived .
it was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these <unk> ' offended the sober eyes of madame deluc .
but we are told that it was upon this very evening that madame deluc , as well as her eldest son , <unk> the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn . '
and in what words does madame deluc designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard ?
'it was soon after dark , ' she says .
but <unk> after dark , ' is , at least , dark ; and <unk> dusk ' is as certainly daylight .
thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the barrière du roule prior to the screams overheard ( ? )
by madame deluc .
and although , in all the many reports of the evidence , the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as i have employed them in this conversation with yourself , no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has , as yet , been taken by any of the public journals , or by any of the <unk> of police .
" i shall add but one to the arguments against a gang ; but this one has , to my own understanding at least , a weight altogether irresistible .
under the circumstances of large reward offered , and full pardon to any king 's evidence , it is not to be imagined , for a moment , that some member of a gang of low ruffians , or of any body of men , would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices .
each one of a gang so placed , is not so much greedy of reward , or anxious for escape , as fearful of betrayal .
he betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed .
that the secret has not been <unk> , is the very best of proof that it is , in fact , a secret .
the horrors of this dark deed are known only to one , or two , living human beings , and to god .
" let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis .
we have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of madame deluc , or of a murder perpetrated , in the thicket at the barrière du roule , by a lover , or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased .
this associate is of swarthy complexion .
this complexion , the <unk> ' in the bandage , and the <unk> 's knot , ' with which the <unk> is tied , point to a seaman .
his companionship with the deceased , a <name> , but not an abject young girl , <unk> him as above the grade of the common sailor .
here the well written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of <unk> .
the circumstance of the first elopement , as mentioned by <name> <unk> , tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the <unk> officer ' who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime .
" and here , most <unk> , comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion .
let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy ; it was no common <unk> which constituted the sole point of remembrance , both as regards <unk> and madame deluc .
but why is this man absent ?
was he murdered by the gang ?
if so , why are there only traces of the assassinated girl ?
the scene of the two outrages <name> naturally be supposed identical .
and where is his corpse ?
the assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way .
but it may be said that this man lives , and is deterred from making himself known , through dread of being charged with the murder .
this consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now  at this late period  since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with <name>  but it would have had no force at the period of the deed .
the first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage , and to aid in identifying the ruffians .
this policy would have suggested .
he had been seen with the girl .
he had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat .
the <unk> of the assassins would have appeared , even to an idiot , the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion .
we can not suppose him , on the night of the fatal <name> , both innocent himself and <unk> of an outrage committed .
yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed , if alive , in the <unk> of the assassins .
" and what means are ours , of attaining the truth ?
we shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed .
let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement .
let us know the full history of 'the officer , ' with his present circumstances , and his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder .
let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper , in which the object was to <unk> a gang .
this done , let us compare these communications , both as regards style and ms. , with those sent to the morning paper , at a previous period , and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of <unk> .
and , all this done , let us again compare these various communications with the known <unk> .
of the officer .
let us endeavor to ascertain , by repeated <unk> of madame deluc and her boys , as well as of the omnibus driver , <unk> , something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the 'man of dark complexion . '
queries , skilfully directed , <name> not fail to <unk> , from some of these parties , information on this particular point ( or upon others )  information which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing .
and let us now trace the boat picked up by the <unk> on the morning of monday the twenty-third of <name> , and which was removed from the <unk> , without the cognizance of the officer in attendance , and without the rudder , at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse .
with a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat ; for not only can the <unk> who picked it up identify it , but the rudder is at hand .
the rudder of a <unk> would not have been abandoned , without inquiry , by one altogether at ease in heart .
and here let me pause to insinuate a question .
there was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat .
it was silently taken to the <unk> , and as silently removed .
but its owner or employer  how happened he , at so early a period as tuesday morning , to be informed , without the agency of advertisement , of the locality of the boat taken up on monday , unless we imagine some connexion with the navy  some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in interests  its petty local news ?
" in speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore , i have already suggested the probability of his <unk> himself of a boat .
now we are to understand that <name> rogêt was precipitated from a boat .
this would naturally have been the case .
the corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore .
the peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat .
that the body was found without weight is also <unk> of the idea .
if thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached .
we can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off .
in the act of <unk> the corpse to the water , he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight ; but then no remedy would have been at hand .
any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore .
having rid himself of his ghastly charge , the murderer would have hastened to the city .
there , at some obscure wharf , he would have leaped on land .
but the boat  would he have secured it ?
he would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat .
moreover , in fastening it to the wharf , he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself .
his natural thought would have been to cast from him , as far as possible , all that had held connection with his crime .
he would not only have fled from the wharf , but he would not have permitted the boat to remain .
assuredly he would have cast it adrift .
let us pursue our <unk>  in the morning , the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting  at a locality , perhaps , which his duty compels him to frequent .
the next night , without daring to ask for the rudder , he removes it .
now where is that <unk> boat ?
let it be one of our first purposes to discover .
with the first glimpse we obtain of it , the <name> of our success shall begin .
this boat shall guide us , with a rapidity which <name> surprise even ourselves , to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal sabbath .
<unk> <name> rise upon <unk> , and the murderer <name> be traced . "
[ for reasons which we shall not specify , but which to many readers <name> appear obvious , we have taken the <name> of here omitting , from the <unk> .
placed in our hands , such portion as details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained by dupin .
we feel it advisable only to state , in brief , that the result desired was brought to pass ; and that the prefect fulfilled punctually , although with reluctance , the terms of his compact with the <unk> .
mr. poe 's article concludes with the following <unk>  <unk> .
( <unk> ) ] it <name> be understood that i speak of coincidences and no more .
what i have said above upon this topic must suffice .
in my own heart there dwells no <name> in <unk> .
that nature and its god are two , no man who thinks , <name> deny .
that the latter , creating the former , can , at <name> , control or modify it , is also unquestionable .
i say " at <name> ; " for the question is of <name> , and not , as the insanity of logic has assumed , of power .
it is not that the deity can not modify his laws , but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification .
in their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the future .
with god all is now .
i repeat , then , that i speak of these things only as of coincidences .
and farther : in what i relate it <name> be seen that between the fate of the unhappy <name> <name> rogers , so far as that fate is known , and the fate of one <name> rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history , there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful <unk> the reason becomes embarrassed .
i say all this <name> be seen .
but let it not for a moment be supposed that , in proceeding with the sad narrative of <name> from the epoch just mentioned , and in tracing to its <unk> the mystery which enshrouded her , it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel , or even to suggest that the measures adopted in <name> for the discovery of the assassin of a <unk> , or measures founded in any similar <unk> , would produce any similar result .
for , in respect to the latter branch of the supposition , it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important <unk> , by <unk> thoroughly the two courses of events ; very much as , in arithmetic , an error which , in its own individuality , may be inappreciable , produces , at length , by dint of multiplication at all points of the process , a result enormously at variance with truth .
and , in regard to the former branch , we must not fail to hold in view that the very <unk> of probabilities to which i have referred , forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel :  forbids it with a <unk> strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been long-drawn and exact .
this is one of those anomalous propositions which , seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical , is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain .
nothing , for example , is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of <unk> having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice , is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that <unk> <name> not be thrown in the third attempt .
a suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once .
it does not appear that the two throws which have been completed , and which lie now absolutely in the past , can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the future .
the chance for throwing <unk> seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time  that is to say , subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice .
and this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to <unk> it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention .
the error here involved  a gross error <unk> of mischief  i can not pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present ; and with the philosophical it needs no exposure .
it may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path or reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail .
footnotes  <name> rogêt ( *1 ) upon the original publication of " <name> <unk> , " the <unk> now appended were considered unnecessary ; but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based , renders it expedient to give them , and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design .
a young girl , <name> <name> rogers , was murdered in the vicinity of new york ; and , although her death occasioned an intense and <unk> excitement , the mystery attending it had remained <unk> at the period when the present paper was written and published ( november , 1842 ) .
herein , under pretence of relating the fate of a parisian <unk> , the author has followed in minute detail , the essential , while merely <unk> the <unk> facts of the real murder of <name> rogers .
thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth : and the investigation of the truth was the object .
the " mystery of <name> <unk> " was composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity , and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded .
thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot , and visited the localities .
it may not be improper to record , nevertheless , that the confessions of two persons , ( one of them the madame deluc of the narrative ) made , at different periods , long subsequent to the publication , confirmed , in full , not only the general conclusion , but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained .

by the energy of an agent at charleston , <unk> , we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage , which was performed between saturday , the 6th instant , at 11 , a.m. , and 2 , p.m. , on tuesday , the 9th instant , by sir <unk> <unk> ; mr. osborne , a nephew of lord <unk> 's ; mr. <unk> <name> and mr. <name> holland , the well-known <unk> ; mr. <name> ainsworth , author of " <name> <unk> , " & c. ; and mr. <unk> , the <unk> of the late unsuccessful flying machine  with two seamen from <unk>  in all , eight persons .
the particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect , as , with a slight exception , they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of mr. <unk> <name> and mr. <name> ainsworth , to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself , its construction , and other matters of interest .
the only alteration in the ms. received , has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent , mr. forsyth , into a connected and intelligible form .
" the balloon .
" two very decided failures , of late  those of mr. <unk> and sir <name> <unk>  had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation .
mr. <unk> 's scheme ( which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science , ) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane , started from an eminence by an <unk> force , applied and continued by the revolution of <unk> vanes , in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill .
but , in all the experiments made with models at the <name> gallery , it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not <unk> the machine , but actually impeded its flight .
the only propelling force it ever exhibited , was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane ; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest , than when they were in motion  a fact which sufficiently <unk> their <unk> ; and in the absence of the propelling , which was also the sustaining power , the whole fabric would necessarily descend .
this consideration led sir <name> <unk> to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support  in a word , to a balloon ; the idea , however , being novel , or original , with sir <name> , only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice .
he exhibited a model of his invention at the <unk> institution .
the propelling principle , or power , was here , also , applied to interrupted surfaces , or vanes , put in revolution .
these vanes were four in number , but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon , or in aiding its ascending power .
the whole project was thus a complete failure .
" it was at this juncture that mr. <unk> <name> ( whose voyage from dover to <unk> in the balloon , " nassau , " occasioned so much excitement in 1837 , ) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the <unk> screw for the purpose of <unk> through the air  rightly attributing the failure of mr. <unk> 's scheme , and of sir <name> <unk> 's , to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes .
he made the first public experiment at <name> 's rooms , but afterward removed his model to the <name> gallery .
" like sir <name> <unk> 's balloon , his own was an <unk> .
its length was thirteen feet six inches  height , six feet eight inches .
it contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas , which , if pure hydrogen , would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation , before the gas has time to <unk> or escape .
the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds  leaving about four pounds to spare .
beneath the centre of the balloon , was a frame of light wood , about nine feet long , and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner .
from this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car .
" the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube , eighteen inches in length , through which , upon a <unk> inclined at fifteen degrees , pass a series of steel wire radii , two feet long , and thus projecting a foot on either side .
these radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wire  the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw , which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into <unk> , and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface .
at each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop .
in the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the <unk> of the axis revolve .
from the end of the axis which is next the car , proceeds a shaft of steel , connecting the screw with the <unk> of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car .
by the operation of this spring , the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity , communicating a progressive motion to the whole .
by means of the rudder , the machine was readily turned in any direction .
the spring was of great power , compared with its dimensions , being capable of raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter , after the first turn , and gradually increasing as it was wound up .
it weighed , altogether , eight pounds six ounces .
the rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk , shaped somewhat like a <unk> , and was about three feet long , and at the widest , one foot .
its weight was about two ounces .
it could be turned flat , and directed upwards or downwards , as well as to the right or left ; and thus enabled the <unk> to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage , to any side upon which he might <name> to act ; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction .
" this model ( which , through want of time , we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner , ) was put in action at the <name> gallery , where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour ; although , strange to say , it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr. <unk>  so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity .
to accomplish the great <unk> of <unk> navigation , it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in <unk> .
" so well satisfied , however , was mr. <name> of the ultimate success of his invention , that he determined to construct immediately , if possible , a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent  the original design being to cross the british channel , as before , in the nassau balloon .
to <name> out his views , he <unk> and obtained the patronage of sir <unk> <unk> and mr. osborne , two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement , and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of <unk> .
the project , at the <name> of mr. osborne , was kept a profound secret from the public  the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine , which was built ( under the superintendence of mr. <name> , mr. holland , sir <unk> <unk> , and mr. osborne , ) at the seat of the latter gentleman near <unk> , in wales .
mr. <unk> , accompanied by his friend mr. ainsworth , was admitted to a private view of the balloon , on saturday last  when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure .
we are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party  but , in the course of a day or two , we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage .
" the balloon is composed of silk , varnished with the liquid gum <unk> .
it is of vast dimensions , containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas ; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen , the supporting power of the machine , when fully inflated , and immediately after inflation , is not more than about <unk> pounds .
the coal gas is not only much less costly , but is easily procured and managed .
" for its introduction into common use for purposes of <unk> , we are indebted to mr. <name> green .
up to his discovery , the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive , but uncertain .
two , and even three days , have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon , from which it had great tendency to escape , owing to its extreme <unk> , and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere .
in a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of <unk> unaltered , in quantity or amount , for six months , an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks .
" the supporting power being estimated at <unk> pounds , and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200 , there was left a surplus of <unk> , of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast , arranged in bags of different sizes , with their respective weights marked upon them  by cordage , <unk> , telescopes , barrels containing provision for a fortnight , <unk> , cloaks , <unk> , and various other indispensable matters , including a <unk> , contrived for warming coffee by means of <unk> , so as to dispense altogether with fire , if it should be judged prudent to do so .
all these articles , with the exception of the ballast , and a few trifles , were suspended from the hoop overhead .
the car is much smaller and lighter , in proportion , than the one appended to the model .
it is formed of a light wicker , and is wonderfully strong , for so frail looking a machine .
its rim is about four feet deep .
the rudder is also very much larger , in proportion , than that of the model ; and the screw is considerably smaller .
the balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel , and a <unk> ; which latter is of the most indispensable importance .
a few words , in explanation , <name> here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of <unk> .
" as soon as the balloon quits the earth , it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight ; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power .
for example , there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk , to the extent , even , of several hundred pounds ; ballast has then to be thrown out , or the machine may descend .
this ballast being discarded , and a clear <name> <unk> the dew , and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk , the whole <name> again rapidly ascend .
to check this ascent , the only recourse is , ( or rather was , until mr. green 's invention of the <unk> , ) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve ; but , in the loss of gas , is a proportionate general loss of ascending power ; so that , in a comparatively brief period , the <unk> balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources , and come to the earth .
this was the great obstacle to voyages of length .
" the <unk> remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable .
it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car , and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree .
if , for example , there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk , and the machine begins to descend in consequence , there <name> be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight , for it is remedied , or counteracted , in an exactly just proportion , by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary .
if , on the other hand , any circumstances should cause undue levity , and consequent ascent , this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth .
thus , the balloon can neither ascend or descend , except within very narrow limits , and its resources , either in gas or ballast , remain comparatively unimpaired .
when passing over an expanse of water , it becomes necessary to employ small <unk> of copper or wood , filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water .
these float , and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land .
another most important office of the <unk> , is to point out the direction of the balloon .
the rope drags , either on land or sea , while the balloon is free ; the latter , consequently , is always in advance , when any progress whatever is made : a comparison , therefore , by means of the compass , of the relative positions of the two objects , <name> always indicate the course .
in the same way , the <name> formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine , indicates the velocity .
when there is no <name>  in other words , when the rope hangs perpendicularly , the whole apparatus is stationary ; but the larger the <name> , that is to say , the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope , the greater the velocity ; and the converse .
" as the original design was to cross the british channel , and alight as near <name> as possible , the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the continent , <unk> the nature of the expedition , as in the case of the nassau voyage , and <unk> the adventurers to <unk> from the usual formalities of office : unexpected events , however , rendered these passports superfluous .
" the inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak , on saturday morning , the 6th instant , in the court-yard of <unk> house , mr. osborne 's seat , about a mile from <unk> , in north wales ; and at 7 minutes past 11 , every thing being ready for departure , the balloon was set free , rising gently but steadily , in a direction nearly south ; no use being made , for the first half hour , of either the screw or the rudder .
we proceed now with the journal , as <unk> by mr. forsyth from the joint <unk> .
of mr. <unk> <name> , and mr. ainsworth .
the body of the journal , as given , is in the <unk> of mr. <name> , and a p. s. is appended , each day , by mr. ainsworth , who has in preparation , and <name> shortly give the public a more minute , and no doubt , a <unk> interesting account of the voyage .

" saturday , <name> the <unk>  every preparation likely to embarrass us , having been made over night , we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak ; but owing to a thick fog , which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable , we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock .
cut loose , then , in high spirits , and rose gently but steadily , with a light breeze at north , which bore us in the direction of the british channel .
found the ascending force greater than we had expected ; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs , and more in the sun 's rays , our ascent became very rapid .
i did not wish , however , to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure , and so concluded to ascend for the present .
we soon ran out our <unk> ; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth , we still went up very rapidly .
the balloon was unusually steady , and looked beautifully .
in about ten minutes after starting , the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet .
the weather was remarkably fine , and the view of the subjacent country  a most romantic one when seen from any point ,  was now especially sublime .
the numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes , on account of the dense <unk> with which they were filled , and the pinnacles and crags to the south east , piled in inextricable confusion , resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable .
we were rapidly approaching the mountains in the south ; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety .
in a few minutes we soared over them in fine style ; and mr. ainsworth , with the seamen , was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car , the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below , to nearly a dead level .
at half-past eleven still proceeding nearly south , we obtained our first view of the bristol channel ; and , in fifteen minutes afterward , the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us , and we were fairly out at sea .
we now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our <unk> , with the buoys affixed , into the water .
this was immediately done , and we commenced a gradual descent .
in about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped , and at the touch of the second soon afterwards , we remained stationary as to elevation .
we were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw , and we put them both into requisition forthwith , for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward , and in a line for <name> .
by means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction , and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind ; when we set in motion the spring of the screw , and were rejoiced to find it <unk> us readily as desired .
upon this we gave nine hearty cheers , and dropped in the sea a bottle , enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention .
hardly , however , had we done with our rejoicings , when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree .
the steel <name> connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place , at the car end , ( by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up , ) and in an instant <name> dangling out of reach , from the pivot of the axis of the screw .
while we were endeavoring to regain it , our attention being completely absorbed , we became involved in a strong current of wind from the east , which bore us , with rapidly increasing force , towards the atlantic .
we soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less , certainly , than fifty or sixty miles an hour , so that we came up with cape clear , at some forty miles to our north , before we had secured the <name> , and had time to think what we were about .
it was now that mr. ainsworth made an extraordinary , but to my fancy , a by no means unreasonable or <unk> proposition , in which he was instantly seconded by mr .
holland  viz .
: that we should take advantage of the strong <name> which bore us on , and in place of beating back to <name> , make an attempt to reach the coast of north <name> .
after slight reflection i gave a willing assent to this bold proposition , which ( strange to say ) met with objection from the two seamen only .
as the stronger party , however , we overruled their fears , and kept resolutely upon our course .
we steered due west ; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress , and we had the balloon abundantly at command , either for ascent or descent , we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast , and then wound up ( by means of a windlass ) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea .
we perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately , in a vastly increased rate of progress ; and , as the <name> freshened , we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable ; the <unk> flying out behind the car , like a <unk> from a vessel .
it is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast .
we passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds , a few of which were endeavoring to beat up , but the most of them lying to .
we occasioned the greatest excitement on board all  an excitement greatly <unk> by ourselves , and especially by our two men , who , now under the influence of a <unk> of <name> , seemed resolved to give all scruple , or fear , to the wind .
many of the vessels fired signal guns ; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers ( which we heard with surprising distinctness ) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs .
we kept on in this manner throughout the day , with no material incident , and , as the shades of night closed around us , we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed .
it could not have been less than five hundred miles , and was probably much more .
the propeller was kept in constant operation , and , no doubt , aided our progress materially .
as the sun went down , the <name> freshened into an absolute hurricane , and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its <unk> .
the wind was from the east all night , and gave us the brightest omen of success .
we suffered no little from cold , and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant ; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down , and by means of cloaks and a few blankets , we did sufficiently well .
" p.s .
( by mr .
ainsworth . )
the last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life .
i can conceive nothing more <unk> than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this .
may god <name> that we succeed !
i ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person , but for the sake of human knowledge and  for the vastness of the triumph .
and yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have <unk> to attempt it before .
one single <name> such as now <unk> us  let such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for four or five days ( these gales often last longer ) and the voyager <name> be easily borne , in that period , from coast to coast .
in view of such a <name> the broad atlantic becomes a mere lake .
i am more struck , just now , with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us , notwithstanding its agitation , than with any other phenomenon presenting itself .
the waters give up no voice to the heavens .
the immense flaming ocean <unk> and is tortured <unk> .
the mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony .
in a night such as is this to me , a man lives  lives a whole century of ordinary life  nor would i forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence .
" <name> , the seventh .
[ mr. <name> 's ms. ] this morning the <name> , by 10 , had subsided to an eight or nine  knot breeze , ( for a vessel at sea , ) and bears us , perhaps , thirty miles per hour , or more .
it has <unk> , however , very considerably to the north ; and now , at sundown , we are holding our course due west , principally by the screw and rudder , which answer their purposes to admiration .
i regard the project as thoroughly successful , and the easy navigation of the air in any direction ( not exactly in the teeth of a <name> ) as no longer <unk> .
we could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday ; but , by ascending , we might have got out of its influence , if requisite .
against a pretty stiff breeze , i feel convinced , we can make our way with the propeller .
at noon , to-day , ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet , by discharging ballast .
did this to search for a more direct current , but found none so favorable as the one we are now in .
we have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond , even should the voyage last three weeks .
i have not the slightest fear for the result .
the difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and <unk> .
i can choose my current , and should i find all currents against me , i can make very tolerable headway with the propeller .
we have had no incidents worth recording .
the night promises fair .
p.s .
[ by mr .
ainsworth . ]
i have little to record , except the fact ( to me quite a surprising one ) that , at an elevation equal to that of <unk> , i experienced neither very intense cold , nor headache , nor difficulty of breathing ; neither , i find , did mr. <name> , nor mr. holland , nor sir <unk> .
mr. osborne complained of <unk> of the chest  but this soon wore off .
we have flown at a great rate during the day , and we must be more than half way across the atlantic .
we have passed over some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds , and all seem to be delightfully astonished .
crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all .
<unk> <unk> pro <unk> .
mem :  at 25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black , and the stars are distinctly visible ; while the sea does not seem convex ( as one might suppose ) but absolutely and most unequivocally concave .
( *1 ) " monday , the 8th .
[ mr. <name> 's ms. ] this morning we had again some little trouble with the <name> of the propeller , which must be entirely <unk> , for fear of serious accident  i mean the steel <name>  not the vanes .
the latter could not be improved .
the wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune seems bent upon <unk> us .
just before day , we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and <unk> in the balloon , accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine .
these phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas , through increase of heat in the atmosphere , and the consequent <unk> of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night .
threw down several bottles to the vessels below .
saw one of them picked up by a large ship  seemingly one of the new york line packets .
endeavored to make out her name , but could not be sure of it .
mr. osborne 's telescope made it out something like " <unk> . "
it is now 12 , at night , and we are still going nearly west , at a rapid pace .
the sea is peculiarly phosphorescent .
" p.s .
[ by mr .
ainsworth . ]
it is now 2 , a.m. , and nearly calm , as well as i can judge  but it is very difficult to determine this point , since we move with the air so completely .
i have not slept since quitting <unk> , but can stand it no longer , and must take a nap .
we can not be far from the american coast .
" tuesday , the <unk> .
[ mr. ainsworth 's ms. ] one , p.m. we are in full view of the low coast of south <name> .
the great problem is accomplished .
we have crossed the atlantic  fairly and easily crossed it in a balloon !
god be praised !
who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter ? "
the journal here ceases .
some particulars of the descent were communicated , however , by mr. ainsworth to mr. forsyth .
it was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast , which was immediately recognized by both the seamen , and by mr. osborne .
the latter gentleman having acquaintances at fort moultrie , it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity .
the balloon was brought over the beach ( the tide being out and the sand hard , smooth , and admirably adapted for a descent , ) and the grapnel let go , which took firm hold at once .
the inhabitants of the island , and of the fort , thronged out , of course , to see the balloon ; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage  the crossing of the atlantic .
the grapnel caught at 2 , p.m. , precisely ; and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventy-five hours ; or rather less , counting from shore to shore .
no serious accident occurred .
no real danger was at any time apprehended .
the balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble ; and when the ms. from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from charleston , the party were still at fort moultrie .
their farther intentions were not ascertained ; but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on monday or in the course of the next day , at farthest .
this is unquestionably the most stupendous , the most interesting , and the most important undertaking , ever accomplished or even attempted by man .
what magnificent events may ensue , it would be useless now to think of determining .
( *1 ) <unk>  mr .
ainsworth has not attempted to account for this phenomenon , which , however , is quite susceptible of explanation .
a line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet , perpendicularly to the surface of the earth ( or sea ) , would form the perpendicular of a <unk> triangle , of which the base would extend from the right <name> to the horizon , and the <unk> from the horizon to the balloon .
but the 25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing , in comparison with the extent of the prospect .
in other words , the base and <unk> of the supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular , that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel .
in this manner the horizon of the <unk> would appear to be on a level with the car .
but , as the point immediately beneath him seems , and is , at a great distance below him , it seems , of course , also , at a great distance below the horizon .
hence the impression of concavity ; and this impression must remain , until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to the extent of prospect , that the apparent parallelism of the base and <unk> disappears  when the earth 's real <unk> must become apparent .
ms. found in a bottle qui <unk> plus <unk> moment a <unk> <unk> plus <unk> a <unk> .
 <unk>  <unk> .
of my country and of my family i have little to say .
ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one , and <unk> me from the other .
hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order , and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to <unk> the stores which early study very diligently garnered <unk>  beyond all things , the study of the <name> <unk> gave me great delight ; not from any <unk> admiration of their eloquent madness , but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their <unk> .
i have often been reproached with the <unk> of my genius ; a deficiency of imagination has been <unk> to me as a crime ; and the <unk> of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious .
indeed , a strong relish for physical philosophy has , i fear , <unk> my mind with a very common error of this age  i mean the habit of referring occurrences , even the least susceptible of such reference , to the principles of that science .
upon the whole , no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the <unk> <unk> of superstition .
i have thought proper to premise thus much , lest the incredible tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination , than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a <unk> .
after many years spent in foreign travel , i sailed in the year 18  , from the port of <unk> , in the <name> and populous island of java , on a voyage to the archipelago of the <unk> islands .
i went as passenger  having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend .
our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons , <unk> , and built at bombay of <unk> teak .
she was freighted with <unk> and oil , from the <unk> islands .
we had also on board <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a few cases of opium .
the stowage was clumsily done , and the vessel consequently crank .
we got under way with a mere breath of wind , and for many days stood along the eastern coast of java , without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small <unk> of the archipelago to which we were bound .
one evening , leaning over the <unk> , i observed a very singular , isolated cloud , to the n.w .
it was remarkable , as well for its color , as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from <unk> .
i watched it attentively until sunset , when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward , <unk> in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor , and looking like a long line of low beach .
my notice was soon afterwards attracted by the <unk> appearance of the moon , and the peculiar character of the sea .
the latter was undergoing a rapid change , and the water seemed more than usually transparent .
although i could distinctly see the bottom , yet , heaving the lead , i found the ship in fifteen fathoms .
the air now became intolerably hot , and was loaded with spiral <unk> similar to those arising from heat iron .
as night came on , every breath of wind died away , an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive .
the flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion , and a long hair , held between the finger and thumb , <name> without the possibility of detecting a vibration .
however , as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger , and as we were drifting in bodily to shore , he ordered the sails to be furled , and the anchor let go .
no watch was set , and the crew , consisting principally of malays , stretched themselves deliberately upon deck .
i went below  not without a full presentiment of evil .
indeed , every appearance warranted me in <unk> a <unk> .
i told the captain my fears ; but he paid no attention to what i said , and left me without <unk> to give a reply .
my uneasiness , however , prevented me from sleeping , and about midnight i went upon <unk>  as i placed my foot upon the upper step of the <unk> , i was startled by a loud , humming noise , like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a <unk> , and before i could ascertain its meaning , i found the ship quivering to its centre .
in the next instant , a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our <unk> , and , rushing over us fore and aft , swept the entire decks from stem to stern .
the extreme fury of the blast proved , in a great measure , the salvation of the ship .
although completely <unk> , yet , as her masts had gone by the board , she rose , after a minute , heavily from the sea , and , staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest , finally righted .
by what miracle i escaped destruction , it is impossible to say .
stunned by the shock of the water , i found myself , upon recovery , jammed in between the <unk> and rudder .
with great difficulty i gained my feet , and looking dizzily around , was , at first , struck with the idea of our being among breakers ; so terrific , beyond the wildest imagination , was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed .
after a while , i heard the voice of an old swede , who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port .
i <unk> to him with all my strength , and presently he came reeling aft .
we soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident .
all on deck , with the exception of ourselves , had been swept overboard ;  the captain and mates must have perished as they slept , for the cabins were <unk> with water .
without assistance , we could expect to do little for the security of the ship , and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down .
our cable had , of course , parted like <unk> , at the first breath of the hurricane , or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed .
we <unk> with frightful velocity before the sea , and the water made clear breaches over us .
the <unk> of our stern was shattered excessively , and , in almost every respect , we had received considerable injury ; but to our extreme <name> we found the pumps <unk> , and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast .
the main fury of the blast had already blown over , and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind ; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay ; well believing , that , in our shattered condition , we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue .
but this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified .
for five entire days and nights  during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of <unk> , procured with great difficulty from the forecastle  the hulk flew at a rate defying <unk> , before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind , which , without equalling the first violence of the <unk> , were still more terrific than any tempest i had before encountered .
our course for the first four days was , with trifling variations , s.e .
and by s. ; and we must have run down the coast of new <unk>  on the fifth day the cold became extreme , although the wind had hauled round a point more to the <unk>  the sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre , and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon  emitting no decisive <unk>  there were no clouds apparent , yet the wind was upon the increase , and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury .
about noon , as nearly as we could guess , our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun .
it gave out no light , properly so called , but a dull and sullen glow without reflection , as if all its rays were polarized .
just before sinking within the <unk> sea , its central fires suddenly went out , as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power .
it was a dim , <unk> rim , alone , as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean .
we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day  that day to me has not arrived  to the swede , never did arrive .
thenceforward we were enshrouded in <unk> darkness , so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship .
eternal night continued to envelop us , all <unk> by the phosphoric <unk> to which we had been accustomed in the tropics .
we observed too , that , although the tempest continued to rage with <unk> violence , there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf , or foam , which had hitherto attended us .
all around were horror , and thick gloom , and a black sweltering desert of <unk>  superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old swede , and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder .
we neglected all care of the ship , as worse than useless , and securing ourselves , as well as possible , to the stump of the <unk> , looked out bitterly into the world of ocean .
we had no means of calculating time , nor could we form any guess of our situation .
we were , however , well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators , and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual <unk> of ice .
in the meantime every moment threatened to be our last  every mountainous <unk> hurried to overwhelm us .
the swell surpassed anything i had imagined possible , and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle .
my companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo , and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship ; but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of <name> itself , and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i thought nothing could defer beyond an hour , as , with every knot of way the ship made , the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling .
at times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross  at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell , where the air grew stagnant , and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the <unk> .
we were at the bottom of one of these abysses , when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night .
" see !
see ! "
cried he , shrieking in my ears , " almighty god !
see !
see ! "
as he spoke , i became aware of a dull , sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay , and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck .
casting my eyes upwards , i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood .
at a terrific height directly above us , and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent , hovered a gigantic ship of , perhaps , four thousand tons .
although <unk> upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude , her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or east <unk> in existence .
her huge hull was of a deep dingy black , <unk> by any of the customary carvings of a ship .
a single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports , and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable <unk> , which swung to and fro about her rigging .
but what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment , was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea , and of that ungovernable hurricane .
when we first discovered her , her bows were alone to be seen , as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her .
for a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle , as if in contemplation of her own sublimity , then trembled and tottered , and  came down .
at this instant , i know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit .
staggering as far aft as i could , i awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm .
our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles , and sinking with her head to the sea .
the shock of the descending mass struck her , consequently , in that portion of her frame which was already under water , and the inevitable result was to hurl me , with irresistible violence , upon the rigging of the stranger .
as i fell , the ship hove in stays , and went about ; and to the confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the crew .
with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the main hatchway , which was partially open , and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold .
why i did so i can hardly tell .
an indefinite sense of awe , which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind , was perhaps the principle of my concealment .
i was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered , to the cursory glance i had taken , so many points of vague novelty , doubt , and apprehension .
i therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold .
this i did by removing a small portion of the <unk> , in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship .
i had scarcely completed my work , when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it .
a man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait .
i could not see his face , but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance .
there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity .
his knees tottered beneath a load of years , and his entire frame quivered under the burthen .
he muttered to himself , in a low broken tone , some words of a language which i could not understand , and groped in a corner among a pile of <unk> instruments , and decayed charts of navigation .
his manner was a wild mixture of the <unk> of second childhood , and the solemn dignity of a god .
he at length went on deck , and i saw him no more .
* * * * * a feeling , for which i have no name , has taken possession of my soul  a sensation which <name> admit of no analysis , to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate , and for which i fear futurity itself <name> offer me no key .
to a mind constituted like my own , the latter consideration is an evil .
i shall never  i know that i shall never  be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions .
yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite , since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel .
a new sense  a new entity is added to my soul .
* * * * * it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship , and the rays of my <name> are , i think , gathering to a focus .
incomprehensible men !
wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i can not divine , they pass me by unnoticed .
concealment is utter folly on my part , for the people <name> not see .
it was but just now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mate  it was no long while ago that i ventured into the captain 's own private cabin , and took thence the materials with which i write , and have written .
i shall from time to time continue this journal .
it is true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world , but i <name> not fall to make the endeavour .
at the last moment i <name> enclose the ms. in a bottle , and cast it within the sea .
* * * * * an incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation .
are such things the operation of <unk> chance ?
i had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down , without attracting any notice , among a pile of <unk> and old sails in the bottom of the yawl .
while musing upon the <unk> of my fate , i unwittingly <unk> with a <unk> the edges of a <unk> <unk> which lay near me on a barrel .
the <unk> is now bent upon the ship , and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery .
i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel .
although well armed , she is not , i think , a ship of war .
her rigging , build , and general equipment , all negative a supposition of this kind .
what she is not , i can easily perceive  what she is i fear it is impossible to say .
i know not how it is , but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars , her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas , her severely simple bow and <unk> stern , there <name> occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things , and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection , an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago .
* * * * * i have been looking at the timbers of the ship .
she is built of a material to which i am a stranger .
there is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied .
i mean its extreme <unk> , considered independently by the <unk> condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas , and apart from the <unk> attendant upon age .
it <name> appear perhaps an observation somewhat <unk> , but this wood would have every characteristic of spanish oak , if spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means .
in reading the above sentence a curious <unk> of an old weather-beaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection .
" it is as sure , " he was wont to say , when any doubt was entertained of his veracity , " as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself <name> grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman . "
* * * * * about an hour ago , i made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew .
they paid me no manner of attention , and , although i stood in the very midst of them all , seemed utterly unconscious of my presence .
like the one i had at first seen in the hold , they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age .
their knees trembled with infirmity ; their shoulders were bent double with <unk> ; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind ; their voices were low , tremulous and broken ; their eyes glistened with the <unk> of years ; and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest .
around them , on every part of the deck , lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction .
* * * * * i mentioned some time ago the bending of a <unk> .
from that period the ship , being thrown dead off the wind , has continued her terrific course due south , with every rag of canvas packed upon her , from her trucks to her lower <unk> booms , and rolling every moment her <unk> <unk> into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine .
i have just left the deck , where i find it impossible to maintain a footing , although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience .
it appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever .
we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity , without taking a final plunge into the abyss .
from billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever seen , we glide away with the facility of the <unk> <unk> ; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep , but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy .
i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such <unk>  i must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current , or impetuous <unk> .
* * * * * i have seen the captain face to face , and in his own cabin  but , as i expected , he paid me no attention .
although in his appearance there is , to a casual observer , nothing which might <unk> him more or less than <unk> a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which i regarded him .
in stature he is nearly my own height ; that is , about five feet eight inches .
he is of a <unk> and compact frame of body , neither robust nor remarkably otherwise .
but it is the <unk> of the expression which reigns upon the face  it is the intense , the wonderful , the thrilling evidence of old age , so utter , so extreme , which excites within my spirit a sense  a sentiment ineffable .
his forehead , although little wrinkled , seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of <unk>  his gray hairs are records of the past , and his <unk> eyes are <unk> of the future .
the cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange , <unk> <unk> , and mouldering instruments of science , and obsolete long-forgotten charts .
his head was bowed down upon his hands , and he <unk> , with a fiery unquiet eye , over a paper which i took to be a commission , and which , at all events , bore the signature of a monarch .
he muttered to himself , as did the first seaman whom i saw in the hold , some low <unk> syllables of a foreign tongue , and although the speaker was close at my elbow , his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile .
* * * * * the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of <unk> .
the crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries ; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning ; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the <unk> , i feel as i have never felt before , although i have been all my life a dealer in antiquities , and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , until my very soul has become a ruin .
* * * * * when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions .
if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us , shall i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean , to convey any idea of which the words tornado and <unk> are trivial and <unk> ?
all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night , and a chaos of <unk> water ; but , about a league on either side of us , may be seen , indistinctly and at intervals , stupendous ramparts of ice , towering away into the desolate sky , and looking like the walls of the universe .
* * * * * as i imagined , the ship proves to be in a current ; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which , howling and shrieking by the white ice , thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract .
* * * * * to conceive the horror of my sensations is , i presume , utterly impossible ; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions , <unk> even over my despair , and <name> reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death .
it is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge  some <unk> secret , whose attainment is destruction .
perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself .
it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor .
* * * * * the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step ; but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of <name> than of the apathy of despair .
in the meantime the wind is still in our poop , and , as we <name> a crowd of canvas , the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea  oh , horror upon horror !
the ice opens suddenly to the right , and to the left , and we are whirling dizzily , in immense concentric circles , round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre , the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance .
but little time <name> be left me to ponder upon my <name>  the circles rapidly grow small  we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool  and amid a roaring , and bellowing , and thundering of ocean and of tempest , the ship is quivering , oh god !
and  going down .
note.  the " ms. found in a bottle , " was originally published in 1831 , and it was not until many years afterwards that i became acquainted with the maps of <unk> , in which the ocean is represented as rushing , by four mouths , into the ( northern ) polar gulf , to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth ; the pole itself being represented by a black rock , towering to a prodigious height .
the oval portrait the chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance , rather than permit me , in my desperately wounded condition , to pass a night in the open air , was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the <unk> , not less in fact than in the fancy of mrs. <unk> .
to all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned .
we established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments .
it lay in a remote turret of the building .
its decorations were <name> , yet tattered and antique .
its walls were <name> with tapestry and <unk> with manifold and multiform <unk> trophies , together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of <name> golden <unk> .
in these paintings , which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces , but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary  in these paintings my incipient delirium , perhaps , had caused me to take deep interest ; so that i bade <name> to close the heavy shutters of the room  since it was already night  to light the tongues of a tall <unk> which stood by the head of my bed  and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black <name> which enveloped the bed itself .
i wished all this done that i might resign myself , if not to sleep , at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures , and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow , and which <unk> to criticise and describe them .
long  long i read  and devoutly , <unk> i gazed .
rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came .
the position of the <unk> displeased me , and <unk> my hand with difficulty , rather than disturb my slumbering valet , i placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book .
but the action produced an effect altogether <unk> .
the rays of the numerous candles ( for there were many ) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the <unk> .
i thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before .
it was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood .
i glanced at the painting hurriedly , and then closed my eyes .
why i did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception .
but while my lids remained thus shut , i ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them .
it was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought  to make sure that my vision had not deceived me  to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze .
in a very few moments i again looked fixedly at the painting .
that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt ; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to <unk> the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses , and to startle me at once into waking life .
the portrait , i have already said , was that of a young girl .
it was a mere head and shoulders , done in what is technically termed a <unk> manner ; much in the style of the favorite heads of sully .
the arms , the bosom , and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the <unk> of the whole .
the frame was oval , richly gilded and <unk> in <unk> .
as a thing of <name> nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself .
but it could have been neither the execution of the work , nor the immortal beauty of the countenance , which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me .
least of all , could it have been that my fancy , shaken from its half slumber , had mistaken the head for that of a living person .
i saw at once that the peculiarities of the design , of the <unk> , and of the frame , must have instantly dispelled such idea  must have prevented even its momentary entertainment .
thinking earnestly upon these points , i remained , for an hour perhaps , half sitting , half reclining , with my vision riveted upon the portrait .
at length , satisfied with the true secret of its effect , i fell back within the bed .
i had found the spell of the picture in an absolute <unk> of expression , which , at first startling , finally confounded , subdued , and appalled me .
with deep and reverent awe i replaced the <unk> in its former position .
the cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view , i sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories .
turning to the number which designated the oval portrait , i there read the vague and quaint words which follow : " she was a maiden of rarest beauty , and not more lovely than full of glee .
and evil was the hour when she saw , and loved , and wedded the painter .
he , passionate , studious , austere , and having already a bride in his <name> ; she a maiden of rarest beauty , and not more lovely than full of glee ; all light and smiles , and <unk> as the young <name> ; loving and <unk> all things ; hating only the <name> which was her rival ; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover .
it was thus a terrible thing for this <name> to hear the painter speak of his <name> to portray even his young bride .
but she was humble and obedient , and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark , high <unk> where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead .
but he , the painter , took <name> in his work , which went on from hour to hour , and from day to day .
and he was a passionate , and wild , and moody man , who became lost in reveries ; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride , who pined visibly to all but him .
yet she smiled on and still on , <unk> , because she saw that the painter ( who had high renown ) took a <unk> and burning pleasure in his task , and wrought day and night to <unk> her who so loved him , yet who grew daily more <unk> and weak .
and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words , as of a mighty <name> , and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so <unk> well .
but at length , as the labor <name> nearer to its conclusion , there were admitted none into the turret ; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work , and turned his eyes from canvas merely , even to regard the countenance of his wife .
and he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him .
and when many weeks had passed , and but little remained to do , save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye , the spirit of the <name> again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp .
and then the brush was given , and then the tint was placed ; and , for one moment , the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought ; but in the next , while he yet gazed , he grew tremulous and very pallid , and aghast , and crying with a loud voice , 'this is indeed life itself ! '
turned suddenly to regard his beloved :  she was dead ! "

seneca .
at <name> , just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18 , i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a <unk> , in company with my friend c. auguste dupin , in his little back library , or <unk> , au <unk> , no .
33 , rue <unk> , <unk> st. germain .
for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence ; while each , to any casual observer , might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber .
for myself , however , i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening ; i mean the affair of the rue morgue , and the mystery attending the murder of <name> rogêt .
i looked upon it , therefore , as something of a coincidence , when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance , monsieur g  , the prefect of the parisian police .
we gave him a hearty welcome ; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man , and we had not seen him for several years .
we had been sitting in the dark , and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp , but sat down again , without doing so , upon g. 's saying that he had called to consult us , or rather to ask the opinion of my friend , about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble .
" if it is any point requiring reflection , " observed dupin , as he <unk> to <unk> the wick , " we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark . "
" that is another of your odd notions , " said the prefect , who had a fashion of calling every thing " odd " that was beyond his comprehension , and thus lived amid an absolute legion of " oddities . "
" very true , " said dupin , as he supplied his visiter with a pipe , and rolled towards him a comfortable chair .
" and what is the difficulty now ? "
i asked .
" nothing more in the assassination way , i <name> ? "
" oh no ; nothing of that nature .
the fact is , the business is very simple indeed , and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves ; but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it , because it is so excessively odd . "
" simple and odd , " said dupin .
" why , yes ; and not exactly that , either .
the fact is , we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple , and yet <unk> us altogether . "
" perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault , " said my friend .
" what nonsense you do talk ! "
replied the prefect , laughing heartily .
" perhaps the mystery is a little too plain , " said dupin .
" oh , good heavens !
who ever heard of such an idea ? "
" a little too self-evident . "
" <name> !
<name> !
<name>  <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  ho !
ho !
ho ! "
roared our visiter , profoundly amused , " oh , dupin , you <name> be the death of me yet ! "
" and what , after all , is the matter on hand ? "
i asked .
" why , i <name> tell you , " replied the prefect , as he gave a long , steady and contemplative puff , and settled himself in his chair .
" i <name> tell you in a few words ; but , before i begin , let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy , and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold , were it known that i confided it to any one . "
" proceed , " said i .
" or not , " said dupin .
" well , then ; i have received personal information , from a very high quarter , that a certain document of the last importance , has been <unk> from the <name> apartments .
the individual who <unk> it is known ; this beyond a doubt ; he was seen to take it .
it is known , also , that it still remains in his possession . "
" how is this known ? "
asked dupin .
" it is clearly inferred , " replied the prefect , " from the nature of the document , and from the <unk> of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber 's possession ; that is to say , from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it . "
" be a little more explicit , " i said .
" well , i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable . "
the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy .
" still i do not quite understand , " said dupin .
" no ?
well ; the disclosure of the document to a third person , who shall be nameless , would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station ; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so <unk> . "
" but this ascendancy , " i interposed , " would depend upon the <unk> knowledge of the loser 's knowledge of the robber .
who would dare  " " the thief , " said g. , " is the minister d  , who dares all things , those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man .
the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold .
the document in question  a letter , to be <name>  had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the <name> boudoir .
during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it .
after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer , she was forced to place it , open as it was , upon a table .
the address , however , was uppermost , and , the contents thus <unk> , the letter escaped notice .
at this juncture enters the minister d  .
his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper , <unk> the handwriting of the address , observes the confusion of the personage addressed , and fathoms her secret .
after some business transactions , hurried through in his ordinary manner , he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question , opens it , pretends to read it , and then places it in close <unk> to the other .
again he <unk> , for some fifteen minutes , upon the public affairs .
at length , in taking leave , he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim .
its rightful owner saw , but , of course , dared not call attention to the act , in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow .
the minister <unk> ; leaving his own letter  one of no importance  upon the table . "
" here , then , " said dupin to me , " you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete  the robber 's knowledge of the <unk> knowledge of the robber . "
" yes , " replied the prefect ; " and the power thus attained has , for some months past , been wielded , for political purposes , to a very dangerous extent .
the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced , every day , of the necessity of <unk> her letter .
but this , of course , can not be done openly .
in fine , driven to despair , she has committed the matter to me . "
" than whom , " said dupin , amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke , " no more sagacious agent could , i suppose , be desired , or even imagined . "
" you flatter me , " replied the prefect ; " but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained . "
" it is clear , " said i , " as you observe , that the letter is still in possession of the minister ; since it is this possession , and not any employment of the letter , which <unk> the power .
with the employment the power departs . "
" true , " said g. ; " and upon this conviction i proceeded .
my first care was to make thorough search of the minister 's hotel ; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge .
beyond all things , i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design . "
" but , " said i , " you are quite au fait in these investigations .
the parisian police have done this thing often before . "
" o yes ; and for this reason i did not despair .
the habits of the minister gave me , too , a great advantage .
he is frequently absent from home all night .
his servants are by no means numerous .
they sleep at a distance from their master 's apartment , and , being chiefly <unk> , are readily made drunk .
i have keys , as you know , with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in <name> .
for three months a night has not passed , during the greater part of which i have not been engaged , personally , in <unk> the d  hotel .
my honor is interested , and , to mention a great secret , the reward is enormous .
so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself .
i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed . "
" but is it not possible , " i suggested , " that although the letter may be in possession of the minister , as it unquestionably is , he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises ? "
" this is barely possible , " said dupin .
" the present peculiar condition of affairs at court , and especially of those intrigues in which d  is known to be involved , would render the instant <unk> of the document  its susceptibility of being produced at a moment 's notice  a point of nearly equal importance with its possession . "
" its susceptibility of being produced ? "
said i .
" that is to say , of being destroyed , " said dupin .
" true , " i observed ; " the paper is clearly then upon the premises .
as for its being upon the person of the minister , we may consider that as out of the question . "
" entirely , " said the prefect .
" he has been twice waylaid , as if by <unk> , and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection . "
" you might have spared yourself this trouble , " said dupin .
" d  , i presume , is not altogether a fool , and , if not , must have anticipated these <unk> , as a matter of course . "
" not altogether a fool , " said g. , " but then he 's a poet , which i take to be only one remove from a fool . "
" true , " said dupin , after a long and thoughtful whiff from his <unk> , " although i have been guilty of certain <unk> myself . "
" suppose you detail , " said i , " the particulars of your search . "
" why the fact is , we took our time , and we searched every where .
i have had long experience in these affairs .
i took the entire building , room by room ; devoting the nights of a whole week to each .
we examined , first , the furniture of each apartment .
we opened every possible drawer ; and i presume you know that , to a properly trained police agent , such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible .
any man is a dolt who permits a <unk> ' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind .
the thing is so plain .
there is a certain amount of bulk  of space  to be accounted for in every cabinet .
then we have accurate rules .
the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us .
after the cabinets we took the chairs .
the cushions we <unk> with the fine long needles you have seen me employ .
from the tables we removed the tops . "
" why so ? "
" sometimes the top of a table , or other similarly arranged piece of furniture , is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article ; then the leg is excavated , the article deposited within the cavity , and the top replaced .
the bottoms and tops of <unk> are employed in the same way . "
" but could not the cavity be detected by sounding ? "
i asked .
" by no means , if , when the article is deposited , a sufficient <unk> of cotton be placed around it .
besides , in our case , we were obliged to proceed without noise . "
" but you could not have removed  you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention .
a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll , not differing much in shape or bulk from a large <unk> , and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair , for example .
you did not take to pieces all the chairs ? "
" certainly not ; but we did better  we examined the <unk> of every chair in the hotel , and , indeed the <unk> of every description of furniture , by the aid of a most powerful microscope .
had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly .
a single grain of <unk> , for example , would have been as obvious as an apple .
any disorder in the <unk>  any unusual gaping in the joints  would have sufficed to insure detection . "
" i presume you looked to the mirrors , between the boards and the plates , and you <unk> the beds and the <unk> , as well as the curtains and carpets . "
" that of course ; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way , then we examined the house itself .
we divided its entire surface into compartments , which we numbered , so that none might be missed ; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises , including the two houses immediately adjoining , with the microscope , as before . "
" the two houses adjoining ! "
i exclaimed ; " you must have had a great deal of trouble . "
" we had ; but the reward offered is prodigious ! "
" you include the grounds about the houses ? "
" all the grounds are paved with brick .
they gave us comparatively little trouble .
we examined the moss between the bricks , and found it undisturbed . "
" you looked among d  's papers , of course , and into the books of the library ? "
" certainly ; we opened every package and parcel ; we not only opened every book , but we turned over every leaf in each volume , not contenting ourselves with a mere shake , according to the fashion of some of our police officers .
we also measured the thickness of every <unk> , with the most accurate <unk> , and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope .
had any of the <unk> been recently meddled with , it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation .
some five or six volumes , just from the hands of the <unk> , we carefully <unk> , longitudinally , with the needles . "
" you explored the floors beneath the carpets ? "
" beyond doubt .
we removed every carpet , and examined the boards with the microscope . "
" and the paper on the walls ? "
" yes . "
" you looked into the cellars ? "
" we did . "
" then , " i said , " you have been making a <unk> , and the letter is not upon the premises , as you suppose . "
" i fear you are right there , " said the prefect .
" and now , dupin , what would you advise me to do ? "
" to make a thorough <unk> of the premises . "
" that is absolutely needless , " replied g  .
" i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel . "
" i have no better advice to give you , " said dupin .
" you have , of course , an accurate description of the letter ? "
" oh yes ! "
 and here the prefect , producing a <unk> proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal , and especially of the external appearance of the missing document .
soon after finishing the perusal of this description , he took his departure , more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before .
in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit , and found us occupied very nearly as before .
he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation .
at length i said ,  " well , but g  , what of the <unk> letter ?
i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as <unk> the minister ? "
" confound him , say i  yes ; i made the <unk> , however , as dupin suggested  but it was all labor lost , as i knew it would be . "
" how much was the reward offered , did you say ? "
asked dupin .
" why , a very great deal  a very liberal reward  i do n't like to say how much , precisely ; but one thing i <name> say , that i would n't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter .
the fact is , it is becoming of more and more importance every day ; and the reward has been lately doubled .
if it were <unk> , however , i could do no more than i have done . "
" why , yes , " said dupin , <unk> , between the whiffs of his <unk> , " i really  think , g  , you have not exerted yourself  to the utmost in this matter .
you might  do a little more , i think , eh ? "
" how ?  in what way ? '
" why  puff , puff  you might  puff , puff  employ counsel in the matter , eh ?  puff , puff , puff .
do you remember the story they tell of <unk> ? "
" no ; <name> <unk> ! "
" to be sure !
<name> him and welcome .
but , once upon a time , a certain <name> miser conceived the design of <unk> upon this <unk> for a medical opinion .
getting up , for this purpose , an ordinary conversation in a private company , he <unk> his case to the physician , as that of an imaginary individual .
" 'we <name> suppose , ' said the miser , 'that his symptoms are such and such ; now , doctor , what would you have directed him to take ? '
" 'take ! '
said <unk> , 'why , take advice , to be sure . ' "
" but , " said the prefect , a little <unk> , " i am perfectly willing to take advice , and to pay for it .
i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter . "
" in that case , " replied dupin , opening a drawer , and producing a <unk> , " you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned .
when you have signed it , i <name> hand you the letter . "
i was astounded .
the prefect appeared absolutely <unk> .
for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless , looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth , and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets ; then , apparently recovering himself in some measure , he seized a pen , and after several pauses and vacant stares , finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs , and handed it across the table to dupin .
the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book ; then , <unk> an <unk> , took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect .
this <unk> grasped it in a perfect agony of <name> , opened it with a trembling hand , cast a rapid glance at its contents , and then , scrambling and struggling to the door , rushed at length <unk> from the room and from the house , without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check .
when he had gone , my friend entered into some explanations .
" the parisian police , " he said , " are exceedingly able in their way .
they are persevering , ingenious , cunning , and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand .
thus , when g  detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d  , i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation  so far as his labors extended . "
" so far as his labors extended ? "
said i .
" yes , " said dupin .
" the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind , but carried out to absolute perfection .
had the letter been deposited within the range of their search , these fellows would , beyond a question , have found it . "
i merely laughed  but he seemed quite serious in all that he said .
" the measures , then , " he continued , " were good in their kind , and well executed ; their defect lay in their being <unk> to the case , and to the man .
a certain set of highly ingenious resources are , with the prefect , a sort of <unk> bed , to which he forcibly <unk> his designs .
but he perpetually <unk> by being too deep or too shallow , for the matter in hand ; and many a schoolboy is a better <unk> than he .
i knew one about eight years of age , whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd ' attracted universal admiration .
this game is simple , and is played with marbles .
one player holds in his hand a number of these toys , and demands of another whether that number is even or odd .
if the guess is right , the <unk> wins one ; if wrong , he loses one .
the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school .
of course he had some principle of guessing ; and this lay in mere observation and <unk> of the astuteness of his opponents .
for example , an <unk> simpleton is his opponent , and , holding up his closed hand , asks , 'are they even or odd ? '
our schoolboy replies , <unk> , ' and loses ; but upon the second trial he wins , for he then says to himself , 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial , and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second ; i <name> therefore guess odd ; '  he guesses odd , and wins .
now , with a simpleton a degree above the first , he would have reasoned thus : 'this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd , and , in the second , he <name> propose to himself , upon the first impulse , a simple variation from even to odd , as did the first simpleton ; but then a second thought <name> suggest that this is too simple a variation , and finally he <name> decide upon putting it even as before .
i <name> therefore guess even ; '  he guesses even , and wins .
now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy , whom his fellows termed <unk> , '  what , in its last analysis , is it ? "
" it is merely , " i said , " an identification of the <unk> 's intellect with that of his opponent . "
" it is , " said dupin ; " and , upon inquiring , of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted , i received answer as follows : 'when i wish to find out how wise , or how stupid , or how good , or how wicked is any one , or what are his thoughts at the moment , i fashion the expression of my face , as accurately as possible , in accordance with the expression of his , and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart , as if to match or correspond with the expression . '
this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the <unk> profundity which has been attributed to <unk> , to la <unk> , to machiavelli , and to <unk> . "
" and the identification , " i said , " of the <unk> 's intellect with that of his opponent , depends , if i understand you aright , upon the accuracy with which the opponent 's intellect is <unk> . "
" for its practical value it depends upon this , " replied dupin ; " and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently , first , by default of this identification , and , secondly , by <unk> , or rather through <unk> , of the intellect with which they are engaged .
they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity ; and , in searching for anything hidden , <unk> only to the modes in which they would have hidden it .
they are right in this much  that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass ; but when the cunning of the individual <unk> is diverse in character from their own , the <unk> <unk> them , of course .
this always happens when it is above their own , and very usually when it is below .
they have no variation of principle in their investigations ; at best , when urged by some unusual emergency  by some extraordinary reward  they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice , without touching their principles .
what , for example , in this case of d  , has been done to vary the principle of action ?
what is all this boring , and <unk> , and sounding , and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches  what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search , which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity , to which the prefect , in the long routine of his duty , has been accustomed ?
do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter ,  not exactly in a <unk> hole bored in a <unk>  but , at least , in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a <unk> bored in a <unk> ?
and do you not see also , that such <unk> nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions , and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects ; for , in all cases of concealment , a disposal of the article concealed  a disposal of it in this <unk> manner ,  is , in the very first instance , <unk> and presumed ; and thus its discovery depends , not at all upon the <unk> , but altogether upon the mere care , <name> , and determination of the seekers ; and where the case is of importance  or , what amounts to the same thing in the <unk> eyes , when the reward is of magnitude ,  the qualities in question have never been known to fail .
you <name> now understand what i meant in suggesting that , had the <unk> letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefect 's examination  in other words , had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect  its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question .
this <unk> , however , has been thoroughly mystified ; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool , because he has acquired renown as a poet .
all fools are poets ; this the prefect feels ; and he is merely guilty of a non <unk> <unk> in thence <unk> that all poets are fools . "
" but is this really the poet ? "
i asked .
" there are two brothers , i know ; and both have attained reputation in letters .
the minister i believe has written <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
he is a mathematician , and no poet . "
" you are mistaken ; i know him well ; he is both .
as poet and mathematician , he would reason well ; as mere mathematician , he could not have reasoned at all , and thus would have been at the <name> of the prefect . "
" you surprise me , " i said , " by these opinions , which have been contradicted by the voice of the world .
you do not mean to set at naught the <unk> idea of centuries .
the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence . "
" <unk> y a à <unk> , ' " replied dupin , quoting from <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> convention <unk> est une <unk> , car elle a <unk> au plus grand <unk> . '
the mathematicians , i <name> you , have done their best to <unk> the popular error to which you allude , and which is none the less an error for its <unk> as truth .
with an <name> worthy a better cause , for example , they have <unk> the term <unk> ' into application to algebra .
the french are the <unk> of this particular deception ; but if a term is of any importance  if words derive any value from <unk>  then <unk> ' conveys <unk> ' about as much as , in latin , <unk> ' implies <unk> , ' <unk> ' <unk> , ' or <unk> <unk> , ' a set of <unk> . "
" you have a quarrel on hand , i see , " said i , " with some of the <unk> of <name> ; but proceed . "
" i dispute the <unk> , and thus the value , of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the <unk> logical .
i dispute , in particular , the reason <unk> by mathematical study .
the mathematics are the science of form and quantity ; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity .
the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra , are abstract or general truths .
and this error is so <unk> that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received .
mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth .
what is true of relation  of form and quantity  is often grossly false in regard to morals , for example .
in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole .
in chemistry also the axiom fails .
in the consideration of motive it fails ; for two motives , each of a given value , have not , necessarily , a value when united , equal to the sum of their values apart .
there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation .
but the mathematician argues , from his finite truths , through habit , as if they were of an absolutely general <unk>  as the world indeed imagines them to be .
<name> , in his very learned <unk> , ' mentions an analogous source of error , when he says that <unk> the pagan fables are not believed , yet we forget ourselves continually , and make inferences from them as existing realities . '
with the <unk> , however , who are pagans themselves , the <unk> fables ' are believed , and the inferences are made , not so much through lapse of memory , as through an unaccountable <unk> of the brains .
in short , i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots , or one who did not <unk> hold it as a point of his <name> that <unk> was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q .
say to one of these gentlemen , by way of experiment , if you please , that you believe occasions may occur where <unk> is not altogether equal to q , and , having made him understand what you mean , get out of his reach as speedily as convenient , for , beyond doubt , he <name> endeavor to knock you down .
" i mean to say , " continued dupin , while i merely laughed at his last observations , " that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician , the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check .
i know him , however , as both mathematician and poet , and my measures were adapted to his capacity , with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded .
i knew him as a courtier , too , and as a bold <unk> .
such a man , i considered , could not fail to be aware of the ordinary <unk> modes of action .
he could not have failed to anticipate  and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate  the <unk> to which he was subjected .
he must have foreseen , i reflected , the secret investigations of his premises .
his frequent <unk> from home at night , which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success , i regarded only as <unk> , to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police , and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g  , in fact , did finally arrive  the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises .
i felt , also , that the whole train of thought , which i was at some pains in <unk> to you just now , concerning the invariable principle of <unk> action in searches for articles concealed  i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister .
it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment .
he could not , i reflected , be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes , to the <unk> , to the <unk> , and to the <unk> of the prefect .
i saw , in fine , that he would be driven , as a matter of course , to simplicity , if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice .
you <name> remember , perhaps , how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested , upon our first interview , that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident . "
" yes , " said i , " i remember his merriment well .
i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions . "
" the material world , " continued dupin , " abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial ; and thus some color of truth has been given to the <unk> dogma , that metaphor , or simile , may be made to strengthen an argument , as well as to embellish a description .
the principle of the vis <unk> , for example , seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics .
it is not more true in the former , that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one , and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty , than it is , in the latter , that intellects of the vaster capacity , while more forcible , more constant , and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade , are yet the less readily moved , and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress .
again : have you ever noticed which of the street signs , over the <unk> , are the most attractive of attention ? "
" i have never given the matter a thought , " i said .
" there is a game of puzzles , " he resumed , " which is played upon a map .
one party playing requires another to find a given word  the name of town , river , state or empire  any word , in short , upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart .
a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names ; but the <unk> selects such words as stretch , in large characters , from one end of the chart to the other .
these , like the <unk> lettered signs and <unk> of the street , escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious ; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral <unk> by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too <unk> and too palpably self-evident .
but this is a point , it appears , somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect .
he never once thought it probable , or possible , that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world , by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it .
" but the more i reflected upon the daring , dashing , and discriminating ingenuity of d  ; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand , if he intended to use it to good purpose ; and upon the decisive evidence , obtained by the prefect , that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary 's ordinary search  the more satisfied i became that , to conceal this letter , the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all .
" full of these ideas , i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles , and called one fine morning , quite by accident , at the <unk> hotel .
i found d  at home , yawning , lounging , and <unk> , as usual , and pretending to be in the last extremity of <unk> .
he is , perhaps , the most really energetic human being now alive  but that is only when nobody sees him .
" to be even with him , i complained of my weak eyes , and lamented the necessity of the spectacles , under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment , while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host .
" i paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat , and upon which lay confusedly , some miscellaneous letters and other papers , with one or two musical instruments and a few books .
here , however , after a long and very deliberate scrutiny , i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion .
" at length my eyes , in going the circuit of the room , fell upon a trumpery <unk> <unk> of pasteboard , that <name> dangling by a dirty blue ribbon , from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the <unk> .
in this rack , which had three or four compartments , were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter .
this last was much soiled and crumpled .
it was torn nearly in two , across the middle  as if a design , in the first instance , to tear it entirely up as worthless , had been altered , or stayed , in the second .
it had a large black seal , bearing the d  cipher very conspicuously , and was addressed , in a diminutive female hand , to d  , the minister , himself .
it was thrust carelessly , and even , as it seemed , contemptuously , into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack .
" no sooner had i glanced at this letter , than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search .
to be sure , it was , to all appearance , radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description .
here the seal was large and black , with the d  cipher ; there it was small and red , with the ducal arms of the s  family .
here , the address , to the minister , diminutive and feminine ; there the <unk> , to a certain <name> personage , was <unk> bold and decided ; the size alone formed a point of correspondence .
but , then , the <unk> of these differences , which was excessive ; the dirt ; the soiled and torn condition of the paper , so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d  , and so suggestive of a design to <unk> the beholder into an idea of the <unk> of the document ; these things , together with the <unk> situation of this document , full in the view of every visiter , and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived ; these things , i say , were strongly <unk> of suspicion , in one who came with the intention to suspect .
" i protracted my visit as long as possible , and , while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him , i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter .
in this examination , i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack ; and also fell , at length , upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained .
in scrutinizing the edges of the paper , i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary .
they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper , having been once folded and pressed with a <unk> , is <unk> in a reversed direction , in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold .
this discovery was sufficient .
it was clear to me that the letter had been turned , as a glove , inside out , <unk> , and <unk> .
i bade the minister good morning , and took my departure at once , leaving a gold <unk> upon the table .
" the next morning i called for the <unk> , when we resumed , quite eagerly , the conversation of the preceding day .
while thus engaged , however , a loud report , as if of a pistol , was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel , and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams , and the shoutings of a terrified mob .
d  rushed to a casement , threw it open , and looked out .
in the meantime , i stepped to the <unk> took the letter , put it in my pocket , and replaced it by a <unk> , ( so far as regards <unk> , ) which i had carefully prepared at my lodgings  imitating the d  cipher , very readily , by means of a seal formed of bread .
" the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket .
he had fired it among a crowd of women and children .
it proved , however , to have been without ball , and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard .
when he had gone , d  came from the window , whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view .
soon afterwards i bade him farewell .
the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay . "
" but what purpose had you , " i asked , " in replacing the letter by a <unk> ?
would it not have been better , at the first visit , to have seized it openly , and departed ? "
" d  , " replied dupin , " is a desperate man , and a man of nerve .
his hotel , too , is not without attendants devoted to his interests .
had i made the wild attempt you suggest , i might never have left the <unk> presence alive .
the good people of <name> might have heard of me no more .
but i had an object apart from these considerations .
you know my political <unk> .
in this matter , i act as a partisan of the <name> concerned .
for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power .
she has now him in hers  since , being unaware that the letter is not in his possession , he <name> proceed with his exactions as if it was .
thus <name> he inevitably commit himself , at once , to his political destruction .
his downfall , too , <name> not be more precipitate than awkward .
it is all very well to talk about the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; but in all kinds of climbing , as <unk> said of singing , it is far more easy to get up than to come down .
in the present instance i have no sympathy  at least no pity  for him who descends .
he is that <unk> <unk> , an unprincipled man of genius .
i confess , however , that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts , when , being defied by her whom the prefect terms 'a certain <unk> he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the <unk> . "
" how ?
did you put any thing particular in it ? "
" why  it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank  that would have been insulting .
d  , at vienna once , did me an evil turn , which i told him , quite <unk> , that i should remember .
so , as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him , i thought it a pity not to give him a clue .
he is well acquainted with my ms. , and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words  " '   <name> <unk> si <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , est <unk> de <unk> .
they are to be found in <unk> 's <unk> . ' "
the <unk> tale of scheherazade truth is stranger than fiction .
old saying .
having had occasion , lately , in the course of some oriental investigations , to consult the <unk> <unk> , a work which ( like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ) is scarcely known at all , even in europe ; and which has never been quoted , to my knowledge , by any american  if we except , perhaps , the author of the " curiosities of american literature " ;  having had occasion , i say , to turn over some pages of the first  mentioned very remarkable work , i was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier 's daughter , scheherazade , as that fate is depicted in the " arabian nights " ; and that the <unk> there given , if not altogether inaccurate , as far as it goes , is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther .
for full information on this interesting topic , i must refer the inquisitive reader to the " <unk> " itself , but in the meantime , i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered .
it <name> be remembered , that , in the usual version of the tales , a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his <name> , not only puts her to death , but makes a vow , by his beard and the prophet , to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions , and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner .
having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter , and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense , he was interrupted one afternoon ( no doubt at his prayers ) by a visit from his grand vizier , to whose daughter , it appears , there had occurred an idea .
her name was scheherazade , and her idea was , that she would either redeem the land from the <unk> tax upon its beauty , or perish , after the approved fashion of all <unk> , in the attempt .
accordingly , and although we do not find it to be <unk> ( which makes the sacrifice more <unk> ) , she <unk> her father , the grand vizier , to make an offer to the king of her hand .
this hand the king eagerly accepts  ( he had intended to take it at all events , and had put off the matter from day to day , only through fear of the vizier ) ,  but , in accepting it now , he gives all parties very distinctly to understand , that , grand vizier or no grand vizier , he has not the slightest design of giving up one <unk> of his vow or of his privileges .
when , therefore , the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king , and did actually marry him despite her father 's excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind  when she would and did marry him , i say , <name> i , <unk> i , it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow .
it seems , however , that this politic damsel ( who had been reading machiavelli , beyond doubt ) , had a very ingenious little plot in her mind .
on the night of the wedding , she contrived , upon i forget what <unk> pretence , to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the <name> pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed ; and , a little before <unk> , she took care to awaken the good monarch , her husband ( who bore her none the worse <name> because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow ) ,  she managed to awaken him , i say , ( although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion , he slept well ) by the profound interest of a story ( about a rat and a black cat , i think ) which she was <unk> ( all in an undertone , of course ) to her sister .
when the day broke , it so happened that this history was not altogether finished , and that scheherazade , in the nature of things could not finish it just then , since it was high time for her to get up and be <unk>  a thing very little more pleasant than hanging , only a trifle more genteel .
the king 's curiosity , however , prevailing , i am sorry to say , even over his sound religious principles , induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning , for the purpose and with the <name> of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat ( a black cat , i think it was ) and the rat .
the night having arrived , however , the <name> scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat ( the rat was blue ) but before she well knew what she was about , found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration , having reference ( if i am not altogether mistaken ) to a pink horse ( with green wings ) that went , in a violent manner , by clockwork , and was wound up with an indigo key .
with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other  and , as the day broke before its conclusion ( notwithstanding all the <name> 's endeavors to get through with it in time for the <unk> ) , there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before , for twenty-four hours .
the next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result ; and then the next  and then again the next ; so that , in the end , the good monarch , having been <unk> deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights , either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time , or gets himself <unk> of it in the regular way , or ( what is more probable ) breaks it outright , as well as the head of his father <unk> .
at all events , scheherazade , who , being <unk> descended from <name> , fell heir , perhaps , to the whole seven baskets of talk , which the latter <name> , we all know , picked up from under the trees in the garden of <unk> , i say , finally triumphed , and the tariff upon beauty was <unk> .
now , this conclusion ( which is that of the story as we have it upon record ) is , no doubt , excessively proper and pleasant  but alas !
like a great many pleasant things , is more pleasant than true , and i am indebted altogether to the " <unk> " for the means of correcting the error .
" <name> <unk> , " says a french proverb , " est <unk> du bien , " and , in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk , i should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to <unk> .
" my dear sister , " said she , on the <unk> night , ( i quote the language of the " <unk> " at this point , verbatim ) " my dear sister , " said she , " now that all this little difficulty about the <unk> has blown over , and that this odious tax is so happily <unk> , i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king ( who i am sorry to say , snores  a thing no gentleman would do ) the full conclusion of <unk> the sailor .
this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which i related ; but the truth is , i felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration , and so was seduced into cutting them short  a grievous piece of misconduct , for which i only trust that allah <name> forgive me .
but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect  and as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise , i <name> forthwith entertain you ( and him if he pleases ) with the sequel of this very remarkable story . "
hereupon the sister of scheherazade , as i have it from the " <unk> , " expressed no very particular intensity of gratification ; but the king , having been sufficiently pinched , at length ceased snoring , and finally said , " hum ! "
and then " hoo ! "
when the <name> , understanding these words ( which are no doubt arabic ) to signify that he was all attention , and would do his best not to snore any more  the <name> , i say , having arranged these matters to her satisfaction , re-entered thus , at once , into the history of <unk> the sailor : " 'at length , in my old age , [ these are the words of <unk> himself , as <unk> by scheherazade ]  'at length , in my old age , and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home , i became once more possessed of a <name> of visiting foreign countries ; and one day , without <unk> any of my family with my design , i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky , and , engaged a <name> to <name> them , went with him down to the sea-shore , to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explored .
" <unk> deposited the packages upon the sands , we sat down beneath some trees , and looked out into the ocean in the <name> of perceiving a ship , but during several hours we saw none whatever .
at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound ; and the <name> , after listening awhile , declared that he also could distinguish it .
presently it grew louder , and then still louder , so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us .
at length , on the edge of the horizon , we discovered a black speck , which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster , swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea .
it came toward us with inconceivable swiftness , throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast , and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed , with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance .
" 'as the thing <name> near we saw it very distinctly .
its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow , and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace , o most sublime and <unk> of the <unk> .
its body , which was unlike that of ordinary fishes , was as solid as a rock , and of a <unk> blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water , with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak that completely <unk> it .
the belly , which floated beneath the surface , and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows , was entirely covered with metallic scales , of a color like that of the moon in <name> weather .
the back was flat and nearly white , and from it there extended upwards of six spines , about half the length of the whole body .
" 'the horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive , but , as if to make up for this deficiency , it was provided with at least four score of eyes , that protruded from their sockets like those of the green <unk> , and were arranged all around the body in two rows , one above the other , and parallel to the blood-red streak , which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow .
two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others , and had the appearance of solid gold .
" <unk> this beast approached us , as i have before said , with the greatest rapidity , it must have been moved altogether by <unk>  for it had neither fins like a fish nor <unk> like a duck , nor wings like the <unk> which is blown along in the manner of a vessel ; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels .
its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike , only , not far from the latter , were two small holes that served for nostrils , and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence , and with a shrieking , disagreeable noise .
" 'our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great , but it was even surpassed by our astonishment , when upon getting a nearer look , we perceived upon the creature 's back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men , and altogether much resembling them , except that they wore no garments ( as men do ) , being supplied ( by nature , no doubt ) with an ugly uncomfortable covering , a good deal like cloth , but fitting so tight to the skin , as to render the poor wretches <unk> awkward , and put them apparently to severe pain .
on the very tips of their heads were certain <unk> boxes , which , at first sight , i thought might have been intended to answer as turbans , but i soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid , and i therefore concluded they were contrivances designed , by their great weight , to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders .
around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars , ( badges of <unk> , no doubt , ) such as we keep on our dogs , only much wider and infinitely <unk> , so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time ; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses  a view <unk> and <unk> in a wonderful , if not positively in an awful degree .
" 'when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood , it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent , and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire , accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke , and a noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder .
as the smoke cleared away , we saw one of the odd <unk> standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand , through which ( putting it to his mouth ) he presently addressed us in loud , harsh , and disagreeable accents , that , perhaps , we should have mistaken for language , had they not come altogether through the nose .
" <unk> thus evidently spoken to , i was at a loss how to reply , as i could in no manner understand what was said ; and in this difficulty i turned to the <name> , who was near <unk> through affright , and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was , what it wanted , and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back .
to this the <name> replied , as well as he could for trepidation , that he had once before heard of this <unk> ; that it was a cruel demon , with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire , created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind ; that the things upon its back were vermin , such as sometimes infest cats and dogs , only a little larger and more savage ; and that these vermin had their uses , however evil  for , through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and <unk> , it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill , and so fulfil the <unk> and malicious designs of the wicked genii .
" this account determined me to take to my heels , and , without once even looking behind me , i ran at full speed up into the hills , while the <name> ran equally fast , although nearly in an opposite direction , so that , by these means , he finally made his escape with my bundles , of which i have no doubt he took excellent care  although this is a point i can not determine , as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again .
" 'for myself , i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the <unk> ( who had come to the shore in boats ) that i was very soon overtaken , bound hand and foot , and conveyed to the beast , which immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea .
" 'i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this ; but regret being useless , i made the best of my condition , and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the <unk> that owned the trumpet , and who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows .
i succeeded so well in this endeavor that , in a few days , the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor , and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to <unk> its language ; so that , at length , i was enabled to converse with it readily , and came to make it comprehend the ardent <name> i had of seeing the world .
" <unk> <unk> squeak , <unk> , <unk> diddle , grunt <unk> grumble , hiss , <unk> , <unk> , ' said he to me , one day after dinner  but i beg a thousand pardons , i had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the <unk> ( so the <unk> were called ; i presume because their language formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of the rooster ) .
with your permission , i <name> translate .
<unk> <unk> , ' and so forth :  that is to say , 'i am happy to find , my dear <unk> , that you are really a very excellent fellow ; we are now about doing a thing which is called <unk> the globe ; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world , i <name> strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the beast . ' "
when the <name> scheherazade had proceeded thus far , relates the " <unk> , " the king turned over from his left side to his right , and said : " it is , in fact , very surprising , my dear <name> , that you omitted , hitherto , these latter adventures of <unk> .
do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange ? "
the king having thus expressed himself , we are told , the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the following words : " <unk> went on in this manner with his narrative to the <unk>  'i thanked the <unk> for its kindness , and soon found myself very much at home on the beast , which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean ; although the surface of the latter is , in that part of the world , by no means flat , but round like a <unk> , so that we went  so to say  either up hill or down hill all the time . '
" that i think , was very singular , " interrupted the king .
" nevertheless , it is quite true , " replied scheherazade .
" i have my doubts , " rejoined the king ; " but , pray , be so good as to go on with the story . "
" i <name> , " said the <name> .
" 'the beast , ' continued <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , as i have related , up hill and down hill until , at length , we arrived at an island , many hundreds of miles in circumference , but which , nevertheless , had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars ' " ( *1 ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this island , ' said <unk>  ( for scheherazade , it must be understood , took no notice of her husband 's <unk> ejaculation ) <unk> this island , we came to another where the forests were of solid stone , and so hard that they shivered to pieces the <unk> axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down . " '
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king , again ; but scheherazade , paying him no attention , continued in the language of <unk> .
" <unk> beyond this last island , we reached a country where there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth , and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad .
from the roofs of these palaces there <name> myriads of gems , liked diamonds , but larger than men ; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids and temples , there flowed immense rivers as black as <name> , and swarming with fish that had no eyes . ' "
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" 'we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty mountain , down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal , some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long ( <unk> ) ; while from an abyss on the summit , issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens , and it became darker than the darkest midnight ; so that when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain , it was impossible to see the whitest object , however close we held it to our eyes . ' "
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" 'after quitting this coast , the beast continued his voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed  for we here saw a great lake , at the bottom of which , more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water , there flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees . ' "
( <unk> ) " hoo ! "
said the king .
" some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel , just as our own does feather . ' "
( <unk> ) " fiddle de <name> , " said the king .
" proceeding still in the same direction , we presently arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole world .
through it there <unk> a glorious river for several thousands of miles .
this river was of unspeakable depth , and of a transparency richer than that of <name> .
it was from three to six miles in width ; and its banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height , were crowned with <unk> trees and perpetual <unk> flowers , that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden ; but the name of this luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror , and to enter it was inevitable death ' " ( <unk> ) " humph ! "
said the king .
" 'we left this kingdom in great haste , and , after some days , came to another , where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling <unk> upon their heads .
these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil , of a funnel shape , and line the sides of them with , rocks , so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly , when trodden upon by other animals , thus <unk> them into the monster 's dens , where their blood is immediately sucked , and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from " the caverns of death . " ' "
( <unk> ) " pooh ! "
said the king .
" <unk> our progress , we perceived a district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air .
( <unk> ) there were others that sprang from the substance of other vegetables ; ( <unk> ) others that derived their substance from the bodies of living animals ; ( <unk> ) and then again , there were others that glowed all over with intense fire ; ( <unk> ) others that moved from place to place at pleasure , ( <unk> ) and what was still more wonderful , we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs at <name> and had , moreover , the detestable passion of mankind for <unk> other creatures , and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks . ' "
( <unk> ) " pshaw ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this land , we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition , that they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the empire .
the king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult problems , they were solved upon the spot  the one by the bees , and the other by the birds ; but the king keeping their solution a secret , it was only after the most profound researches and labor , and the writing of an infinity of big books , during a long series of years , that the <unk> at length arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the birds . ' "
( <unk> ) " oh my ! "
said the king .
" 'we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close upon another , from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth , and two hundred and forty miles long ; so that , although they flew a mile during every minute , it required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us  in which there were several millions of millions of fowl . ' "
( <unk> ) " oh <unk> ! "
said the king .
" 'no sooner had we got rid of these birds , which occasioned us great annoyance , than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another kind , and infinitely larger than even the <unk> which i met in my former voyages ; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your <unk> , oh , most <unk> of <unk> .
this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive , but was fashioned entirely of belly , which was of a prodigious <unk> and <unk> , of a <unk> substance , smooth , shining and striped with various colors .
in its talons , the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens , a house from which it had knocked off the roof , and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings , who , beyond doubt , were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them .
we shouted with all our might , in the <name> of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey , but it merely gave a snort or puff , as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand ! ' "
" stuff ! "
said the king .
" 'it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity , but which , nevertheless , was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns . ' "
( <unk> ) " that , now , i believe , " said the king , " because i have read something of the kind before , in a book . "
" 'we passed immediately beneath this continent , ( swimming in between the legs of the cow ) , and , after some hours , found ourselves in a wonderful country indeed , which , i was informed by the <unk> , was his own native land , inhabited by things of his own species .
this elevated the <unk> very much in my esteem , and in fact , i now began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him ; for i found that the <unk> in general were a nation of the most powerful magicians , who lived with worms in their <name> , ( <unk> ) which , no doubt , served to stimulate them by their painful <unk> and <unk> to the most miraculous efforts of imagination ! ' "
" nonsense ! "
said the king .
" <unk> the magicians , were domesticated several animals of very singular kinds ; for example , there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water .
in place of corn , he had black stones for his usual food ; and yet , in spite of so hard a diet , he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest <name> in this city , at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds . ' "
( <unk> ) " <unk> ! "
said the king .
" 'i saw , also , among these people a hen without feathers , but bigger than a camel ; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick ; her blood , like that of the horse , ( to whom , in fact , she was nearly related , ) was boiling water ; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones .
this hen brought forth very frequently , a hundred chickens in the day ; and , after birth , they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of their mother . ' "
( <unk> ) " <unk> !
lal ! "
said the king .
" 'one of this nation of mighty <unk> created a man out of brass and wood , and leather , and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess , all the race of mankind with the exception of the great <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> ) another of these magi constructed ( of like material ) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it ; for so great were its reasoning powers that , in a second , it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year .
( <unk> ) but a still more wonderful <unk> fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor beast , but which had brains of lead , <unk> with a black matter like pitch , and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour , and this with so exquisite a precision , that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair .
this thing was of prodigious strength , so that it erected or <unk> the mightiest empires at a breath ; but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good . ' "
" ridiculous ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this nation of <unk> there was also one who had in his veins the blood of the <unk> ; for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his <unk> in a red-hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor .
( <unk> ) another had the faculty of converting the common metals into gold , without even looking at them during the process .
( <unk> ) another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible .
( <unk> ) another had such quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic body , while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times in a second . ' "
( <unk> ) " absurd ! "
said the king .
" <unk> of these magicians , by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet saw , could make the corpses of his friends <unk> their arms , kick out their legs , fight , or even get up and dance at his <name> .
( <unk> ) another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other .
( <unk> ) another had so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and <unk> a letter at bagdad  or indeed at any distance whatsoever .
( <unk> ) another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens , and it came at his call ; and served him for a plaything when it came .
another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence .
another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights .
( <unk> ) another made ice in a red-hot furnace .
( <unk> ) another directed the sun to paint his portrait , and the sun did .
( <unk> ) another took this <unk> with the moon and the planets , and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy , <unk> into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made .
but the whole nation is , indeed , of so surprising a <unk> ability , that not even their infants , nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all , or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of creation . " '
( <unk> ) analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results .
" preposterous ! "
said the king .
" 'the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi , ' " continued scheherazade , without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most <unk> interruptions on the part of her husband  " 'the wives and daughters of these eminent <unk> are every thing that is accomplished and refined ; and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful , but for an unhappy <unk> that <unk> them , and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has , hitherto , been adequate to save .
some <unk> come in certain shapes , and some in others  but this of which i speak has come in the shape of a <unk> . ' "
" a what ? "
said the king .
" 'a <unk> ' " said scheherazade .
" 'one of the evil genii , who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill , has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the small of the back .
perfection of loveliness , they say , is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump .
having been long possessed of this idea , and <unk> being cheap in that country , the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary ' " " stop ! "
said the king  " i ca n't stand that , and i wo n't .
you have already given me a dreadful headache with your lies .
the day , too , i perceive , is beginning to break .
how long have we been married ?  my conscience is getting to be troublesome again .
and then that dromedary touch  do you take me for a fool ?
upon the whole , you might as well get up and be <unk> . "
these words , as i learn from the " <unk> , " both grieved and astonished scheherazade ; but , as she knew the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity , and quite unlikely to forfeit his word , she submitted to her fate with a good <name> .
she derived , however , great consolation , ( during the tightening of the <unk> , ) from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold , and that the <unk> of her brute of a husband had <unk> for him a most righteous reward , in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures .
a descent into the <unk> .
the ways of god in nature , as in providence , are not as our ways ; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness , profundity , and <unk> of his works , which have a depth in them greater than the well of <unk> .
<name> <unk> .
we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag .
for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak .
" not long ago , " said he at length , " and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons ; but , about three years past , there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man  or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of  and the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul .
you suppose me a very old man  but i am not .
it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a <unk> black to white , to weaken my limbs , and to <unk> my nerves , so that i tremble at the least exertion , and am frightened at a shadow .
do you know i can scarcely look over this little <name> without getting giddy ? "
the " little <name> , " upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the <unk> portion of his body <name> over it , while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge  this " little <name> " arose , a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock , some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us .
nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink .
in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion , that i fell at full length upon the ground , clung to the shrubs around me , and dared not even glance upward at the sky  while i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds .
it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance .
" you must get over these fancies , " said the guide , " for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentioned  and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye . "
" we are now , " he continued , in that <unk> manner which distinguished him  " we are now close upon the norwegian coast  in the <unk> degree of latitude  in the great province of <unk>  and in the dreary district of <unk> .
the mountain upon whose top we sit is <unk> , the cloudy .
now raise yourself up a little higher  hold on to the grass if you feel giddy  so  and look out , beyond the belt of vapor beneath us , into the sea . "
i looked dizzily , and beheld a wide expanse of ocean , whose waters wore so inky a <name> as to bring at once to my mind the <unk> <unk> account of the mare <unk> .
a panorama more <unk> desolate no human imagination can conceive .
to the right and left , as far as the eye could reach , there lay outstretched , like ramparts of the world , lines of <unk> black and <unk> <name> , whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest , howling and shrieking forever .
just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed , and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea , there was visible a small , <unk> island ; or , more properly , its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped .
about two miles nearer the land , arose another of smaller size , hideously <unk> and barren , and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks .
the appearance of the ocean , in the space between the more distant island and the shore , had something very unusual about it .
although , at the time , so strong a <name> was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a <unk> <unk> , and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight , still there was here nothing like a regular swell , but only a short , quick , angry cross dashing of water in every direction  as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise .
of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks .
" the island in the distance , " resumed the old man , " is called by the <unk> <unk> .
the one midway is <unk> .
that a mile to the northward is <unk> .
yonder are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
farther off  between <unk> and <unk>  are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
these are the true names of the places  but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all , is more than either you or i can understand .
do you hear anything ?
do you see any change in the water ? "
we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of <unk> , to which we had ascended from the interior of <unk> , so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit .
as the old man spoke , i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound , like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie ; and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us , was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward .
even while i gazed , this current acquired a monstrous velocity .
each moment added to its speed  to its headlong impetuosity .
in five minutes the whole sea , as far as <unk> , was lashed into ungovernable fury ; but it was between <unk> and the coast that the main uproar held its sway .
here the vast bed of the waters , seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels , burst suddenly into <unk> convulsion  heaving , boiling , hissing  <unk> in gigantic and innumerable <unk> , and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous <unk> .
in a few minutes more , there came over the scene another radical alteration .
the general surface grew somewhat more smooth , and the <unk> , one by one , disappeared , while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before .
these streaks , at length , spreading out to a great distance , and entering into combination , took unto themselves the <unk> motion of the subsided <unk> , and seemed to form the germ of another more vast .
suddenly  very suddenly  this assumed a distinct and definite existence , in a circle of more than a mile in diameter .
the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray ; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel , whose interior , as far as the eye could fathom it , was a smooth , shining , and <unk> wall of water , inclined to the horizon at an <name> of some forty-five degrees , speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion , and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice , half shriek , half roar , such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven .
the mountain trembled to its very base , and the rock rocked .
i threw myself upon my face , and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation .
" this , " said i at length , to the old man  " this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the <unk> . "
" so it is sometimes termed , " said he .
" we <unk> call it the <unk> , from the island of <unk> in the midway . "
the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw .
that of <name> ramus , which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any , can not impart the faintest <name> either of the magnificence , or of the horror of the scene  or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which <unk> the beholder .
i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it , nor at what time ; but it could neither have been from the summit of <unk> , nor during a storm .
there are some passages of his description , nevertheless , which may be quoted for their details , although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle .
" between <unk> and <unk> , " he says , " the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms ; but on the other side , toward ver ( <unk> ) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel , without the risk of splitting on the rocks , which happens even in the <unk> weather .
when it is flood , the stream runs up the country between <unk> and <unk> with a boisterous rapidity ; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts ; the noise being heard several leagues off , and the <unk> or pits are of such an extent and depth , that if a ship comes within its attraction , it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom , and there beat to pieces against the rocks ; and when the water <unk> , the fragments thereof are thrown up again .
but these intervals of <unk> are only at the turn of the ebb and flood , and in calm weather , and last but a quarter of an hour , its violence gradually returning .
when the stream is most boisterous , and its fury heightened by a storm , it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it .
boats , yachts , and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach .
it likewise happens frequently , that whales come too near the stream , and are overpowered by its violence ; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and <unk> in their fruitless struggles to <unk> themselves .
a bear once , attempting to swim from <unk> to <unk> , was caught by the stream and borne down , while he roared terribly , so as to be heard on shore .
large stocks of firs and pine trees , after being absorbed by the current , rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them .
this plainly shows the bottom to consist of <unk> rocks , among which they are whirled to and fro .
this stream is regulated by the flux and <unk> of the sea  it being constantly high and low water every six hours .
in the year <unk> , early in the morning of <unk> <name> , it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground . "
in regard to the depth of the water , i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex .
the " forty fathoms " must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of <unk> or <unk> .
the depth in the centre of the <unk> must be immeasurably greater ; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the <unk> glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of <unk> .
looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling <unk> below , i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest <name> ramus records , as a matter difficult of belief , the anecdotes of the whales and the bears ; for it appeared to me , in fact , a self-evident thing , that the largest ship of the line in existence , coming within the influence of that deadly attraction , could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane , and must disappear bodily and at once .
the attempts to account for the phenomenon  some of which , i remember , seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal  now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect .
the idea generally received is that this , as well as three smaller <unk> among the <unk> islands , " have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling , at flux and <unk> , against a ridge of rocks and shelves , which confines the water so that it <unk> itself like a cataract ; and thus the higher the flood rises , the deeper must the fall be , and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex , the prodigious <unk> of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments . "
 these are the words of the <unk> britannica .
<unk> and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the <unk> is an abyss penetrating the globe , and issuing in some very remote part  the gulf of <unk> being somewhat decidedly named in one instance .
this opinion , idle in itself , was the one to which , as i gazed , my imagination most readily assented ; and , mentioning it to the guide , i was rather surprised to hear him say that , although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the <unk> , it nevertheless was not his own .
as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it ; and here i agreed with him  for , however conclusive on paper , it becomes altogether unintelligible , and even absurd , amid the thunder of the abyss .
" you have had a good look at the whirl now , " said the old man , " and if you <name> creep round this crag , so as to get in its <name> , and <unk> the roar of the water , i <name> tell you a story that <name> convince you i ought to know something of the <unk> . "
i placed myself as desired , and he proceeded .
" myself and my two brothers once owned a <unk> smack of about seventy tons burthen , with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond <unk> , nearly to <unk> .
in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing , at proper opportunities , if one has only the courage to attempt it ; but among the whole of the <unk> <unk> , we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands , as i tell you .
the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward .
there fish can be got at all hours , without much risk , and therefore these places are preferred .
the choice spots over here among the rocks , however , not only yield the finest variety , but in far greater abundance ; so that we often got in a single day , what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week .
in fact , we made it a matter of desperate speculation  the risk of life standing instead of labor , and courage answering for capital .
" we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this ; and it was our practice , in fine weather , to take advantage of the fifteen minutes ' slack to push across the main channel of the <unk> , far above the pool , and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near <unk> , or <unk> , where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere .
here we used to remain until nearly time for <unk> again , when we weighed and made for home .
we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming  one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return  and we seldom made a <unk> upon this point .
twice , during six years , we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm , which is a rare thing indeed just about here ; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week , starving to death , owing to a <name> which blew up shortly after our arrival , and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of .
upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything , ( for the <unk> threw us round and round so violently , that , at length , we fouled our anchor and dragged it ) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents  here to-day and gone to-morrow  which drove us under the <name> of <unk> , where , by good luck , we brought up .
" i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the grounds '  it is a bad spot to be in , even in good weather  but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the <unk> itself without accident ; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack .
the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting , and then we made rather less way than we could wish , while the current rendered the smack unmanageable .
my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old , and i had two stout boys of my own .
these would have been of great assistance at such times , in using the sweeps , as well as afterward in fishing  but , somehow , although we ran the risk ourselves , we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger  for , after all is said and done , it was a horrible danger , and that is the truth .
" it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred .
it was on the tenth day of july , 18 , a day which the people of this part of the world <name> never forget  for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens .
and yet all the morning , and indeed until late in the afternoon , there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west , while the sun shone brightly , so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow .
" the three of us  my two brothers and myself  had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock p. m. , and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish , which , we all remarked , were more plenty that day than we had ever known them .
it was just seven , by my watch , when we weighed and started for home , so as to make the worst of the <unk> at slack water , which we knew would be at eight .
" we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter , and for some time spanked along at a great rate , never dreaming of danger , for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it .
all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over <unk> .
this was most unusual  something that had never happened to us before  and i began to feel a little uneasy , without exactly knowing why .
we put the boat on the wind , but could make no headway at all for the eddies , and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage , when , looking astern , we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular <unk> cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity .
" in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away , and we were dead <unk> , drifting about in every direction .
this state of things , however , did not last long enough to give us time to think about it .
in less than a minute the storm was upon us  in less than two the sky was entirely overcast  and what with this and the driving spray , it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack .
" such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing .
the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it .
we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us ; but , at the first puff , both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off  the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother , who had lashed himself to it for safety .
" our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water .
it had a complete flush deck , with only a small hatch near the bow , and this hatch it had always been our custom to <unk> down when about to cross the <unk> , by way of precaution against the chopping seas .
but for this circumstance we should have <unk> at once  for we lay entirely buried for some moments .
how my elder brother escaped destruction i can not say , for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining .
for my part , as soon as i had let the foresail run , i threw myself flat on deck , with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow , and with my hands grasping a <unk> near the foot of the <unk> .
it was mere instinct that prompted me to do this  which was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have done  for i was too much <unk> to think .
" for some moments we were completely <unk> , as i say , and all this time i held my breath , and clung to the bolt .
when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees , still keeping hold with my hands , and thus got my head clear .
presently our little boat gave herself a shake , just as a dog does in coming out of the water , and thus rid herself , in some measure , of the seas .
i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me , and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done , when i felt somebody grasp my arm .
it was my elder brother , and my heart leaped for <name> , for i had made sure that he was overboard  but the next moment all this <name> was turned into horror  for he put his mouth close to my ear , and screamed out the word <unk> ! ' " no one ever <name> know what my feelings were at that moment .
i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague .
i knew what he meant by that one word well enough  i knew what he wished to make me understand .
with the wind that now drove us on , we were bound for the whirl of the <unk> , and nothing could save us !
" you perceive that in crossing the <unk> channel , we always went a long way up above the whirl , even in the <unk> weather , and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack  but now we were driving right upon the pool itself , and in such a hurricane as this !
'to be sure , ' i thought , 'we shall get there just about the slack  there is some little <name> in that '  but in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of <name> at all .
i knew very well that we were doomed , had we been ten times a <unk> ship .
" by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself , or perhaps we did not feel it so much , as we <unk> before it , but at all events the seas , which at first had been kept down by the wind , and lay flat and frothing , now got up into absolute mountains .
a singular change , too , had come over the heavens .
around in every direction it was still as black as pitch , but nearly overhead there burst out , all at once , a circular rift of clear sky  as clear as i ever saw  and of a deep bright blue  and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear .
she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness  but , oh god , what a scene it was to light up !
" i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother  but , in some manner which i could not understand , the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word , although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear .
presently he shook his head , looking as pale as death , and held up one of his finger , as if to say 'listen !
' " at first i could not make out what he meant  but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me .
i dragged my watch from its <unk> .
it was not going .
i glanced at its face by the moonlight , and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean .
it had run down at seven o'clock !
we were behind the time of the slack , and the whirl of the <unk> was in full fury !  " when a boat is well built , properly trimmed , and not deep laden , the waves in a strong <name> , when she is going large , seem always to slip from beneath her  which appears very strange to a landsman  and this is what is called riding , in sea phrase .
well , so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly ; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter , and bore us with it as it rose  up  up  as if into the sky .
i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high .
and then down we came with a sweep , a slide , and a plunge , that made me feel sick and dizzy , as if i was falling from some lofty <unk> in a dream .
but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance around  and that one glance was all sufficient .
i saw our exact position in an instant .
the <unk> whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead  but no more like the every-day <unk> , than the whirl as you now see it is like a <unk> .
if i had not known where we were , and what we had to expect , i should not have recognised the place at all .
as it was , i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror .
the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm .
" it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside , and were enveloped in foam .
the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard , and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt .
at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek  such a sound as you might imagine given out by the <unk> of many thousand <unk> , letting off their steam all together .
we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl ; and i thought , of course , that another moment would plunge us into the abyss  down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along .
the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all , but to skim like an <unk> upon the surface of the surge .
her starboard side was next the whirl , and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left .
it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon .
" it may appear strange , but now , when we were in the very jaws of the gulf , i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it .
having made up my mind to <name> no more , i got rid of a great deal of that terror which <unk> me at first .
i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves .
" it may look like boasting  but what i tell you is truth  i began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner , and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life , in view of so wonderful a manifestation of god 's power .
i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind .
after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself .
i positively felt a wish to explore its depths , even at the sacrifice i was going to make ; and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see .
these , no doubt , were singular fancies to occupy a man 's mind in such extremity  and i have often thought since , that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little <unk> .
" there was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession ; and this was the cessation of the wind , which could not reach us in our present situation  for , as you saw yourself , the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean , and this latter now towered above us , a high , black , mountainous ridge .
if you have never been at sea in a heavy <name> , you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together .
they blind , <unk> , and strangle you , and take away all power of action or reflection .
but we were now , in a great measure , rid of these annoyances  just as <unk> <unk> in prison are allowed petty indulgences , forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain .
" how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say .
we <unk> round and round for perhaps an hour , flying rather than floating , getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge , and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge .
all this time i had never let go of the <unk> .
my brother was at the stern , holding on to a small empty <unk> which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter , and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the <name> first took us .
as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this , and made for the ring , from which , in the agony of his terror , he endeavored to force my hands , as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp .
i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this act  although i knew he was a madman when he did it  a raving maniac through sheer fright .
i did not care , however , to contest the point with him .
i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all ; so i let him have the bolt , and went astern to the cask .
this there was no great difficulty in doing ; for the smack flew round steadily enough , and upon an even keel  only swaying to and fro , with the immense sweeps and <unk> of the whirl .
scarcely had i secured myself in my new position , when we gave a wild lurch to starboard , and rushed headlong into the abyss .
i muttered a hurried prayer to god , and thought all was over .
" as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent , i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel , and closed my eyes .
for some seconds i dared not open them  while i expected instant destruction , and wondered that i was not already in my <unk> with the water .
but moment after moment elapsed .
i still lived .
the sense of falling had ceased ; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before , while in the belt of foam , with the exception that she now lay more along .
i took courage , and looked once again upon the scene .
" never shall i forget the sensations of awe , horror , and admiration with which i gazed about me .
the boat appeared to be hanging , as if by magic , midway down , upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference , prodigious in depth , and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for <name> , but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around , and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth , as the rays of the full moon , from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described , streamed in a flood of golden <name> along the black walls , and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss .
" at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately .
the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld .
when i recovered myself a little , however , my gaze fell instinctively downward .
in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view , from the manner in which the smack <name> on the inclined surface of the pool .
she was quite upon an even keel  that is to say , her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water  but this latter sloped at an <name> of more than forty-five degrees , so that we seemed to be lying upon our <unk> .
i could not help observing , nevertheless , that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation , than if we had been upon a dead level ; and this , i suppose , was owing to the speed at which we revolved .
" the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf ; but still i could make out nothing distinctly , on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped , and over which there <name> a magnificent rainbow , like that narrow and tottering bridge which <unk> say is the only pathway between time and eternity .
this mist , or spray , was no doubt occasioned by the <unk> of the great walls of the funnel , as they all met together at the bottom  but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist , i dare not attempt to describe .
" our first slide into the abyss itself , from the belt of foam above , had carried us a great distance down the slope ; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate .
round and round we swept  not with any uniform movement  but in <unk> swings and jerks , that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards  sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl .
our progress downward , at each revolution , was slow , but very perceptible .
" looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid <name> on which we were thus borne , i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl .
both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels , large masses of building timber and trunks of trees , with many smaller articles , such as pieces of house furniture , broken boxes , barrels and staves .
i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors .
it appeared to grow upon me as i <name> nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom .
i now began to watch , with a strange interest , the numerous things that floated in our company .
i must have been delirious  for i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative <unk> of their several <unk> toward the foam below .
'this fir tree , ' i found myself at one time saying , 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears , '  and then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before .
at length , after making several guesses of this nature , and being deceived in all  this fact  the fact of my invariable <unk>  set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble , and my heart beat heavily once more .
" it was not a new terror that thus affected me , but the <name> of a more exciting <name> .
this <name> arose partly from memory , and partly from present observation .
i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of <unk> , having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the <unk> .
by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way  so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters  but then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all .
now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed  that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide , or , for some reason , had descended so slowly after entering , that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came , or of the ebb , as the case might be .
i conceived it possible , in either instance , that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean , without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early , or absorbed more rapidly .
i made , also , three important observations .
the first was , that , as a general rule , the larger the bodies were , the more rapid their descent  the second , that , between two masses of equal extent , the one spherical , and the other of any other shape , the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere  the third , that , between two masses of equal size , the one cylindrical , and the other of any other shape , the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly .
since my escape , i have had several conversations on this subject with an old <unk> of the district ; and it was from him that i learned the use of the words <unk> ' and <unk> . '
he explained to me  although i have forgotten the explanation  how what i observed was , in fact , the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments  and showed me how it happened that a cylinder , swimming in a vortex , offered more resistance to its <unk> , and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body , of any form whatever .
( *1 ) " there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations , and rendering me anxious to turn them to account , and this was that , at every revolution , we passed something like a barrel , or else the yard or the mast of a vessel , while many of these things , which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool , were now high up above us , and seemed to have moved but little from their original station .
" i no longer hesitated what to do .
i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held , to cut it loose from the counter , and to throw myself with it into the water .
i attracted my brother's attention by signs , pointed to the floating barrels that came near us , and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do .
i thought at length that he comprehended my design  but , whether this was the case or not , he shook his head despairingly , and refused to move from his station by the <unk> .
it was impossible to reach him ; the emergency admitted of no delay ; and so , with a bitter struggle , i resigned him to his fate , fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter , and precipitated myself with it into the sea , without another moment 's hesitation .
" the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be .
as it is myself who now tell you this tale  as you see that i did escape  and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected , and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to say  i <name> bring my story quickly to conclusion .
it might have been an hour , or <unk> , after my quitting the smack , when , having descended to a vast distance beneath me , it made three or four wild <unk> in rapid succession , and , bearing my loved brother with it , plunged headlong , at once and forever , into the chaos of foam below .
the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard , before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool .
the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep .
the <unk> of the whirl grew , gradually , less and less violent .
by degrees , the froth and the rainbow disappeared , and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to <unk> .
the sky was clear , the winds had gone down , and the full moon was setting <unk> in the west , when i found myself on the surface of the ocean , in full view of the shores of <unk> , and above the spot where the pool of the <unk> had been .
it was the hour of the slack  but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane .
i was borne violently into the channel of the <unk> , and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the <unk> ' of the fishermen .
a boat picked me up  exhausted from fatigue  and ( now that the danger was removed ) speechless from the memory of its horror .
those who <name> me on board were my old mates and daily companions  but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the <unk> .
my hair which had been <unk> the day before , was as white as you see it now .
they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed .
i told them my story  they did not believe it .
i now tell it to you  and i can scarcely expect you to put more <name> in it than did the <name> fishermen of <unk> . "
<name> kempelen and his discovery after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago , to say nothing of the summary in <unk> 's journal , ' with the detailed statement just published by lieutenant <unk> , it <name> not be supposed , of course , that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to <name> <unk> discovery , i have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view .
my object is simply , in the first place , to say a few words of <name> kempelen himself ( with whom , some years ago , i had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance ) , since every thing which concerns him must necessarily , at this moment , be of interest ; and , in the second place , to look in a general way , and <unk> , at the results of the discovery .
it may be as well , however , to premise the cursory observations which i have to offer , by denying , very decidedly , what seems to be a general impression ( <unk> , as usual in a case of this kind , from the newspapers ) , viz .
: that this discovery , astounding as it unquestionably is , is <unk> .
by reference to the <unk> of sir humphrey davy ' ( <unk> and <unk> , london , pp .
150 ) , it <name> be seen at pp .
53 and 82 , that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question , but had actually made no inconsiderable progress , experimentally , in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by <name> kempelen , who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it , is , without doubt ( i say it unhesitatingly , and can prove it , if required ) , indebted to the <unk> ' for at least the first hint of his own undertaking .
the paragraph from the <unk> and <unk> , ' which is now going the rounds of the press , and which <unk> to claim the invention for a mr. <unk> , of <unk> , maine , appears to me , i confess , a little <unk> , for several reasons ; although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made .
i need not go into details .
my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner .
it does not look true .
persons who are <unk> facts , are seldom so particular as mr. <unk> seems to be , about day and date and precise location .
besides , if mr. <unk> actually did come upon the discovery he says he did , at the period designated  nearly eight years ago  how happens it that he took no steps , on the instant , to reap the immense benefits which the merest <unk> must have known would have resulted to him individually , if not to the world at large , from the discovery ?
it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what mr. <unk> says he did , and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby  so like an owl  as mr. <unk> admits that he did .
<unk> , who is mr. <unk> ?
and is not the whole paragraph in the <unk> and <unk> ' a <unk> got up to 'make a talk ' ?
it must be confessed that it has an amazingly <unk> .
very little dependence is to be placed upon it , in my humble opinion ; and if i were not well aware , from experience , how very easily men of science are mystified , on points out of their usual range of inquiry , i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as professor <unk> , discussing mr. <unk> 's ( or is it mr .
<unk> 's ? )
pretensions to the discovery , in so serious a tone .
but to return to the <unk> ' of sir humphrey davy .
this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye , even upon the decease of the writer , as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style .
at <name> 13 , for example , near the middle , we read , in reference to his researches about the protoxide of <unk> : 'in less than half a minute the respiration being continued , diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles . '
that the respiration was not <unk> , ' is not only clear by the subsequent <unk> , but by the use of the plural , 'were . '
the sentence , no doubt , was thus intended : 'in less than half a minute , the respiration [ being continued , these feelings ] diminished gradually , and were succeeded by [ a sensation ] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles . '
a hundred similar instances go to show that the ms. so <unk> published , was merely a rough note-book , meant only for the writer 's own eye , but an inspection of the pamphlet <name> convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion .
the fact is , sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics .
not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to <unk> , but he was <unk> afraid of appearing <unk> ; so that , however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question , he would never have spoken out , until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration .
i verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched , could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this <unk> ' ( full of crude speculations ) would have been unattended to ; as , it seems , they were .
i say 'his wishes , ' for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed 'to be burnt , ' i think there can be no manner of doubt .
whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad , yet remains to be seen .
that the passages quoted above , with the other similar ones referred to , gave <name> kempelen the hint , i do not in the slightest degree question ; but i repeat , it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself ( momentous under any circumstances ) <name> be of service or <unk> to mankind at large .
that <name> kempelen and his immediate friends <name> reap a <name> harvest , it would be folly to doubt for a moment .
they <name> scarcely be so weak as not to <unk> , ' in time , by large purchases of houses and land , with other property of intrinsic value .
in the brief account of <name> kempelen which appeared in the <unk> journal , ' and has since been extensively copied , several <unk> of the <name> original seem to have been made by the translator , who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the <unk> <unk> . '
<unk> ' has evidently been <unk> ( as it often is ) , and what the translator renders by <unk> , ' is probably <unk> , ' which , in its true version , <unk> , ' would give a totally different complexion to the whole account ; but , of course , much of this is merely guess , on my part .
<name> kempelen , however , is by no means 'a <unk> , ' in appearance , at least , whatever he may be in fact .
my acquaintance with him was casual altogether ; and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know him at all ; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained , or <name> attain in a few days , is not a small matter , as times go .
'the literary world ' speaks of him , confidently , as a native of <unk> ( misled , perhaps , by the account in 'the home journal ' ) but i am pleased in being able to state positively , since i have it from his own lips , that he was born in <unk> , in the state of new york , although both his parents , i believe , are of <unk> descent .
the family is connected , in some way , with maelzel , of <unk> memory .
in person , he is short and stout , with large , fat , blue eyes , <name> hair and whiskers , a wide but pleasing mouth , fine teeth , and i think a <name> nose .
there is some defect in one of his feet .
his address is <name> , and his whole manner noticeable for <unk> .
altogether , he looks , speaks , and acts as little like 'a <unk> ' as any man i ever saw .
we were <unk> for a week about six years ago , at <name> 's hotel , in providence , rhode island ; and i presume that i conversed with him , at various times , for some three or four hours altogether .
his principal topics were those of the day , and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments .
he left the hotel before me , intending to go to new york , and thence to <unk> ; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public ; or , rather , it was there that he was first suspected of having made it .
this is about all that i personally know of the now immortal <name> kempelen ; but i have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public .
there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions , entitled to about as much credit as the story of aladdin 's lamp ; and yet , in a case of this kind , as in the case of the discoveries in california , it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction .
the following anecdote , at least , is so well authenticated , that we may receive it implicitly .
<name> kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at <unk> ; and often , it was well known , he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums .
when the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of <unk> & co. , suspicion was directed toward <name> kempelen , on account of his having purchased a considerable property in <unk> <name> , and his refusing , when questioned , to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money .
he was at length arrested , but nothing decisive appearing against him , was in the end set at <name> .
the police , however , kept a strict watch upon his movements , and thus discovered that he left home frequently , taking always the same road , and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the <unk> . '
finally , by dint of great perseverance , they traced him to a <name> in an old house of seven stories , in an alley called <unk> ,  and , coming upon him suddenly , found him , as they imagined , in the midst of his <unk> operations .
his agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt .
after <unk> him , they searched his room , or rather rooms , for it appears he occupied all the <unk> .
opening into the <name> where they caught him , was a closet , ten feet by eight , fitted up with some chemical apparatus , of which the object has not yet been ascertained .
in one corner of the closet was a very small furnace , with a glowing fire in it , and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible  two <unk> connected by a tube .
one of these <unk> was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion , but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube , which was close to the brim .
the other crucible had some liquid in it , which , as the officers entered , seemed to be furiously <unk> in vapor .
they relate that , on finding himself taken , kempelen seized the <unk> with both hands ( which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be <unk> ) , and threw the contents on the tiled floor .
it was now that they <unk> him ; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person , but nothing unusual was found about him , excepting a paper parcel , in his <unk> , containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance , in nearly , but not quite , equal proportions .
all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have , so far , failed , but that it <name> ultimately be analyzed , is not to be doubted .
passing out of the closet with their prisoner , the officers went through a sort of <unk> , in which nothing material was found , to the chemist 's <unk> .
they here rummaged some drawers and boxes , but discovered only a few papers , of no importance , and some good coin , silver and gold .
at length , looking under the bed , they saw a large , common hair trunk , without hinges , <unk> , or lock , and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion .
upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed , they found that , with their united strength ( there were three of them , all powerful men ) , they 'could not stir it one inch . '
much astonished at this , one of them crawled under the bed , and looking into the trunk , said : 'no wonder we could n't move it  why it 's full to the brim of old bits of brass ! '
putting his feet , now , against the wall so as to get a good purchase , and pushing with all his force , while his companions pulled with all theirs , the trunk , with much difficulty , was slid out from under the bed , and its contents examined .
the supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small , smooth pieces , varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar ; but the pieces were irregular in shape , although more or less <unk> , upon the whole , 'very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state , and there suffered to grow cool . '
now , not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be any thing but brass .
the idea of its being gold never entered their brains , of course ; how could such a wild fancy have entered it ?
and their astonishment may be well conceived , when the next day it became known , all over <unk> , that the <unk> of brass ' which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office , without putting themselves to the trouble of <unk> the smallest scrap , was not only gold  real gold  but gold far finer than any employed in <unk> , in fact , absolutely pure , virgin , without the slightest appreciable alloy .
i need not go over the details of <name> kempelen 's confession ( as far as it went ) and release , for these are familiar to the public .
that he has actually realized , in spirit and in effect , if not to the letter , the old <unk> of the philosopher 's stone , no sane person is at <name> to doubt .
the opinions of arago are , of course , entitled to the greatest consideration ; but he is by no means infallible ; and what he says of <unk> , in his report to the academy , must be taken cum <unk> <unk> .
the simple truth is , that up to this period all analysis has failed ; and until <name> kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma , it is more than probable that the matter <name> remain , for years , in <unk> quo .
all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is , that <unk> gold can be made at <name> , and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances , in kind and in proportions , unknown . '
speculation , of course , is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery  a discovery which few thinking persons <name> hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally , by the late developments in california ; and this reflection brings us inevitably to another  the exceeding <unk> of <name> <unk> analysis .
if many were prevented from <unk> to california , by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value , on account of its <unk> in the mines there , as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one  what impression <name> be wrought now , upon the minds of those about to emigrate , and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region , by the announcement of this astounding discovery of <name> kempelen ?
a discovery which declares , in so many words , that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes ( whatever that worth may be ) , gold now is , or at least soon <name> be ( for it can not be supposed that <name> kempelen can long retain his secret ) , of no greater value than lead , and of far inferior value to silver .
it is , indeed , exceedingly difficult to speculate <unk> upon the consequences of the discovery , but one thing may be positively maintained  that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of california .
in europe , as yet , the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent .
in the price of lead , and nearly twenty-five per cent .
that of silver .
mesmeric revelation whatever doubt may still envelop the <unk> of mesmerism , its startling facts are now almost universally admitted .
of these latter , those who doubt , are your mere <unk> by profession  an unprofitable and disreputable tribe .
there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove , at the present day , that man , by mere exercise of <name> , can so impress his fellow , as to cast him into an abnormal condition , of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death , or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance ; that , while in this state , the person so impressed employs only with effort , and then feebly , the external organs of sense , yet perceives , with keenly refined perception , and through channels supposed unknown , matters beyond the scope of the physical organs ; that , moreover , his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and <unk> ; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound ; and , finally , that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency , while , in the same proportion , the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced .
i say that these  which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features  it would be <unk> to demonstrate ; nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration ; to-day .
my purpose at present is a very different one indeed .
i am impelled , even in the teeth of a world of prejudice , to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy , occurring between a <unk> and myself .
i had been long in the habit of <unk> the person in question , ( mr. <unk> , ) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened .
for many months he had been laboring under confirmed <unk> , the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my <unk> ; and on the night of wednesday , the fifteenth instant , i was summoned to his bedside .
the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart , and breathed with great difficulty , having all the ordinary symptoms of <unk> .
in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres , but to-night this had been attempted in vain .
as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile , and although evidently in much bodily pain , appeared to be , mentally , quite at ease .
" i sent for you to-night , " he said , " not so much to administer to my bodily ailment , as to satisfy me concerning certain <unk> impressions which , of late , have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise .
i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul 's immortality .
i can not deny that there has always existed , as if in that very soul which i have been denying , a vague <unk> of its own existence .
but this <unk> at no time amounted to conviction .
with it my reason had nothing to do .
all attempts at logical inquiry resulted , indeed , in leaving me more sceptical than before .
i had been advised to study cousin .
i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes .
the <unk> <name> ' of mr. <unk> , for example , was placed in my hands .
i read it with profound attention .
throughout i found it logical , but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the <unk> hero of the book .
in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the <unk> had not even succeeded in convincing himself .
