1601 conversation as it was by the social fireside in the time of the <unk> by <name> twain introduction " born irreverent , " scrawled <name> twain on a scratch pad , "  like all other people i have ever known or heard of  i am hoping to remain so while there are any reverent <unk> left to make fun of . "
 [ <unk> manuscript of <name> l. clemens , in the collection of the f. j. meine ] <name> twain was just as irreverent as he dared be , and 1601 reveals his richest expression of sovereign contempt for <unk> language , genteel literature , and conventional <unk> .
later , when a magazine editor <unk> , " o that we had a <unk> ! "
<name> <unk> and <unk>  submitted 1601 ; and that same editor , a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> abused it and the <unk> .
in this episode , as in many others , <name> twain , the " bad boy " of american literature , revealed his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy .
too , there was always the spirit of <name> sawyer <unk> in <name> 's make-up that prompted him , as he himself boasted , to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world .
who wrote 1601 ?
the correct and complete title of 1601 , as first issued , was : [ date , 1601 . ]
<unk> , as it was by the social fireside , in the time of the <unk> . '
for many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880 , its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed .
in boston , <name> t. ball , one of the leading theatrical critics during the late 90 's , asserted that it was originally written by an english actor ( name not <unk> ) who gave it to him .
ball 's original , it was said , looked like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed , and may indeed have been a proof pulled in some newspaper office .
in st. <name> , <name> <name> <unk> , editor of the st. <name> mirror , had seen this famous tour de force circulated in the early 80 's in <unk> form ; he first learned from <name> field that it was from the pen of <name> twain .
" many people , " said <unk> , " thought the thing was done by field and attributed , as a joke , to <name> twain .
field had a perfect genius for that sort of thing , as many extant specimens attest , and for that sort of practical joke ; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too mellow  not hard and bright and bitter  to be <name> field 's . "
<unk> opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great <unk> ; one half suspects that <unk> was thinking of field 's french crisis .
but twain first claimed his <unk> from the fog of <unk> in 1906 , in a letter addressed to mr. <name> <unk> , librarian of case library , <name> .
said clemens , in the course of his letter , dated july 30 , 1906 , from dublin , new hampshire : " the title of the piece is 1601 .
the piece is a <unk> conversation which takes place in <name> <name> 's closet in that year , between the <name> , <name> jonson , beaumont , sir <name> <name> , the duchess of bilgewater , and one or two others , and is not , as <name> hay <unk> supposes , a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste <name> 's time ; if there is a decent word <unk> in it , it is because i overlooked it .
i hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings . "
<unk> the rev .
<name> twichell the circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been officially revealed by <name> <unk> paine in 'mark twain , a <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and in the publication of <name> twain 's notebook ( <unk> ) .
1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the clemens family had retreated to quarry farm in <name> county , new york .
here mrs. clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations , the children romped over the countryside , and <name> retired to his octagonal study , which , perched high on the hill , looked out upon the valley below .
it was in the famous summer of 1876 , too , that <name> was putting the finishing touches to <name> sawyer .
before the close of the same year he had already begun work on 'the adventures of huckleberry finn ' , published in 1885 .
it is interesting to note the use of the title , the " duke of bilgewater , " in huck finn when the " duchess of bilgewater " had already made her appearance in 1601 .
<unk> between his two great <unk> , <name> sawyer and huck finn , the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude .
during this prolific period <name> wrote many minor items , most of them rejected by howells , and read extensively in one of his favorite books , <unk> ' diary .
like many another writer <name> was captivated by <unk> style and spirit , and " he determined , " says <name> <unk> paine in his 'mark twain , a biography ' , " to try his hand on an imaginary record of conversation and court manners of a bygone day , written in the phrase of the period .
the result was <unk> conversation in the time of <name> <name> ' , or as he later called it , <unk> ' .
the <unk> recorded by a supposed <unk> of that period , was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day , when fireside <unk> were limited only to the loosened fancy , vocabulary , and physical performance , and not by any bounds of convention . "
" it was written as a letter , " continues paine , " to that robust divine , rev .
<name> twichell , who , unlike howells , had no scruples about <unk> <unk> breadth of <unk> . ' "
the rev .
<name> twichell , <name> 's most intimate friend for over forty years , was pastor of the asylum hill <unk> church of hartford , which <name> <unk> called the " church of the holy speculators , " because of its wealthy parishioners .
here <name> had first met " <name> " at a social , and their meeting ripened into a glorious , life long friendship .
twichell was a man of about <name> 's own age , a profound scholar , a devout <name> , " yet a man with an <unk> sense of humor , and a profound understanding of the <unk> of mankind . "
the rev .
mr. twichell performed the marriage ceremony for <name> twain and <unk> the births of his children ; " <name> , " his friend , counseled him on literary as well as personal matters for the remainder of <name> 's life .
it is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written , for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which 1601 was written , or the keen enjoyment which <name> and " <name> " derived from it .
" save me one . "
the story of the first issue of 1601 is one of <unk> , state diplomacy , and <unk> printing .
the rev .
" <name> " twichell , for whose <unk> the piece had been written , apparently had pocketed the document for four long years .
then , in 1880 , it came into the hands of <name> hay , later secretary of state , presumably sent to him by <name> twain .
hay pronounced the sketch a masterpiece , and wrote immediately to his old <name> friend , <name> <unk> , <name> of <unk> in <name> and literature .
the following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name of <name> hay known throughout the world .
department of state washington , <name> 21 , 1880 .
dear <unk> : are you in <name> for all this week ?
if you <name> say yes by return mail , i have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only in my hands for a few days .
yours , very much <unk> by the depravity of christendom , hay the second letter <unk> hay 's own high opinion of the effort and his deep concern for its safety .
<name> 24 , 1880 my dear <unk> : here it is .
it was written by <name> twain in a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste elizabethan standard .
but the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic .
he has not yet been able even to find a publisher .
the globe has not yet recovered from <unk> 's <unk> , and they wo n't touch it .
i send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics , who know a good thing when they see it .
read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me ; for <name> is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring .
yours , hay .
in his third letter one can almost hear hay 's chuckle in the certainty that his diplomatic , if somewhat wicked , suggestion would bear fruit .
washington , d. <unk> 7 , 1880 my dear <unk> : i have your letter , and the proposition which you make to pull a few proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive , and of course highly immoral .
i can not properly consent to it , and i am afraid the great many would think i was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence .
please send back the document as soon as you can , and if , in spite of my prohibition , you take these proofs , save me one .
very truly yours , <name> hay .
thus was this elizabethan dialogue poured into the moulds of cold type .
according to <name> <name> , <name> twain 's <unk> , it was issued in pamphlet form , without wrappers or covers ; there were 8 pages of text and the pamphlet measured 7 by 8 1/2 inches .
only four copies are believed to have been printed , one for hay , one for <unk> , and two for twain .
" in the matter of humor , " wrote clemens , referring to hay 's delicious notes , " what an <unk> touch <name> hay had ! "
humor at west point the first printing of 1601 in actual book form was " donne at ye <unk> press , " in 1882 , west point , new york , under the supervision of <unk> .
c. e. s. wood , then adjutant of the u. s. military academy .
in 1882 <name> twain and <name> twichell visited their friend <unk> .
wood at west point , where they learned that wood , as adjutant , had under his control a small printing establishment .
on <name> 's return to hartford , wood received a letter asking if he would do <name> a great favor by printing something he had written , which he did not care to <unk> to the ordinary printer .
wood replied that he would be glad to oblige .
on <name> 3 , 1882 , <name> sent the manuscript : " i enclose the original of <unk> [ sic ] as you suggest .
i am afraid there are errors in it , also , <unk> in <unk> spelling  e 's stuck on often at end of words where they are not strictly necessary , etc ... ..
i would go through the manuscript but i am too much driven just now , and it is not important anyway .
i wish you would do me the kindness to make any and all corrections that suggest themselves to you .
" sincerely yours , " s. l .
clemens . "
<name> erskine <name> wood recalled in a <unk> , which he wrote for the limited edition of 1601 issued by the <unk> press , how he felt when he first saw the original manuscript .
" when i read it , " writes wood , " i felt that the character of it would be carried a little better by a printing which pretended to the eye that it was contemporaneous with the pretended <unk> . '
" i wrote <name> that for literary effect i thought there should be a species of forgery , though of course there was no effort to actually deceive a scholar .
<name> answered that i might do as i liked ;  that his only object was to secure a number of copies , as the demand for it was becoming burdensome , but he would be very grateful for any interest i brought to the doing .
" well , tucker [ foreman of the printing shop ] and i soaked some <unk> linen paper in weak coffee , put it as a wet bundle into a warm room to mildew , dried it to a dampness approved by tucker and he printed the <unk> ' on a hand press .
i had special <unk> cut for such elizabethan <unk> as the a , e , o and u , when followed by m or n  and for the ( commonly and stupidly pronounced ye ) .
" the only <unk> i did was as to the spelling and a few old english words introduced .
the spelling , if i remember correctly , is mine , but the text is exactly as written by <name> .
i wrote asking his view of making the spelling of the period and he was enthusiastic  telling me to do whatever i thought best and he was greatly pleased with the result . "
thus was printed in a de <unk> edition of fifty copies the most curious masterpiece of american humor , at one of <name> 's most dignified institutions , the united states military academy at west point .
" 1601 was so <unk> by the <unk> scholars of a quarter of a century ago , " wrote clemens in his letter to <name> <unk> , " that i was rather inordinately vain of it .
at that time it had been privately printed in several countries , among them japan .
a sumptuous edition on large paper , <unk> , was made by <unk> .
c. e. s. wood at west point  an edition of 50 copies  and distributed among popes and kings and such people .
in england copies of that issue were worth twenty guineas when i was there six years ago , and none to be had . "
from the depths <name> twain 's irreverence should not be <unk> : it was an irreverence which bubbled up from a deep , passionate insight into the <unk> of human nature .
in 1601 , as in 'the man that corrupted hadleyburg , ' and in 'the mysterious stranger , ' he tore the masks off human beings and left them cringing before the public view .
with the <unk> of a master surgeon clemens dealt with human emotions and delighted in exposing human nature in the raw .
the spirit and the language of the fireside conversation were rooted deep in <name> twain 's nature and in his life , as c. e. s. wood , who printed 1601 at west point , has <unk> observed , " if i made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601 rose i would say that <name> 's intellectual structure and <unk> <unk> was from anglo-saxons as primitive as the common man of the tudor period .
he came from the banks of the mississippi  from the <unk> , pilots , <unk> , farmers and village folk of a rude , primitive people  as <name> did .
" he was finished in the mining camps of the west among stage drivers , gamblers and the men of <unk> .
the simple roughness of a frontier people was in his blood and <name> .
" words vulgar and offensive to other ears were a common language to him .
anyone who ever knew <name> heard him use them freely , forcibly , picturesquely in his unrestrained conversation .
such language is forcible as all primitive words are .
refinement seems to make for weakness  or let us say a cutting edge  but the old vulgar <unk> words bit like the blow of a pioneer 's ax  and <name> was like that .
then i think 1601 came out of <name> 's instinctive humor , satire and hatred of <unk> .
but there is more than this ; with all its humor there is a sense of real delight in what may be called <unk> for its own sake .
<unk> and the bible are no more obscene than nature herself  no more obscene than a manure pile , out of which come roses and cherries .
every word used in 1601 was used by our own rude pioneers as a part of their vocabulary  and no word was ever invented by man with obscene intent , but only as language to express his meaning .
no act of nature is obscene in itself  but when such words and acts are dragged in for an ulterior purpose they become offensive , as everything out of place is offensive .
i think he delighted , too , in shocking  giving resounding <unk> on what chaucer would quite simply call 'the bare <unk> . ' "
quite aside from this <unk> " <unk> " slapping , clemens had also a <unk> purpose , that of <unk> a past time as he saw it in shakespeare , <unk> , jonson , and other writers of the elizabethan <name> .
fireside conversation was an exercise in <unk> illumined by a keen sense of character .
it was made especially effective by the artistic arrangement of <unk> material into a compressed picture of a phase of the manners and even the minds of the men and women " in the spacious times of great <name> . "
<name> twain made of 1601 a very smart and fascinating performance , carried over almost to <unk> just to show it was not done for mere delight in the <name> <unk> of the functions with which it deals .
that <name> twain had made considerable study of this frankness is apparent from chapter four of 'a yankee at king <name> 's court , ' where he refers to the conversation at the famous round table thus : " many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen of the land would have made a comanche blush .
<unk> is too mild a term to convey the idea .
however , i had read <name> jones and <name> random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk , and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies , clear up to one hundred years ago ; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century  in which century , broadly speaking , the earliest samples of the real <name> and the real gentleman discoverable in english history ,  or in european history , for that matter  may be said to have made their appearance .
suppose sir <name> [ <name> ] instead of putting the conversation into the mouths of his characters , had allowed the characters to speak for themselves ?
we should have had talk from <name> and <unk> and the soft <name> <name> which would embarrass a tramp in our day .
however , to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate . "
<name> twain 's interest in history and in the <unk> of historical periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical reading in preference to fiction , and through his other historical writings .
even in the hilarious , youthful days in san <name> , paine reports that " clemens , however , was never quite ready for sleep .
then , as ever , he would prop himself up in bed , light his pipe , and lose himself in english or french history until his sleep conquered . "
paine tells us , too , that lecky 's <unk> morals ' was an old favorite .
the notes to 'the <name> and the pauper ' show again how carefully clemens examined his historical background , and his interest in these materials .
some of the more important sources are noted : hume 's 'history of england ' , <unk> ' <unk> of london ' , j. hammond <unk> 's <unk> laws , true and false ' .
apparently <name> twain <unk> it , for as <name> <unk> points out , " the book is always <name> twain .
its <unk> of tudor speech lapse sometimes into a callow satisfaction in that <unk>  <name> hugely enjoys his <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . "
the writing of 1601 <unk> his fondness for this treatment .
" do you suppose the liberties and the <unk> of these states have to do only with delicate <unk> ?
with gloved gentleman words " walt <unk> , 'an american <unk> ' .
although 1601 was not matched by any similar sketch in his published works , it was representative of <name> twain the man .
he was no emaciated literary <unk> .
bronzed and <unk> son of the west , <name> was a man 's man , and that significant fact is emphasized by the several phases of <name> 's <name> life as steamboat pilot , printer , miner , and frontier journalist .
on the <name> city enterprise <name> learned from editor r. m. <unk> that " when it was necessary to call a man names , there were no <unk> too long or too expressive to be hurled in rapid succession to emphasize the utter want of character of the man assailed ... .
there were <unk> there who could hurl <unk> at bad copy which would have frightened a bengal tiger .
the news editor could damn a mutilated dispatch in twenty-four languages . "
in san <name> in the <unk> <unk> we catch a glimpse of <name> twain and his <name> , <name> gillis , pausing in doorways to sing " the doleful ballad of the neglected lover , " an old piece of <unk> <unk> .
one morning , when a dog began to howl , <name> awoke " to find his <unk> standing in the door that opened out into a back garden , holding a big revolver , his hand shaking with cold and excitement , " relates paine in his biography .
" 'come here , <name> , ' he said .
'i 'm so chilled through i ca n't get a bead on him . '
" <unk> , ' said <name> , 'do n't shoot him .
just swear at him .
you can easily kill him at any range with your profanity . '
" <name> gillis declares that <name> twain let go such a scorching , <unk> blast that the brute 's owner sold him the next day for a mexican hairless dog . "
nor did <name> 's " geysers of profanity " cease spouting after these <name> and youthful days in san <name> .
with clemens it may truly be said that profanity was an <name>  a <unk> <name> that entertained nations .
" it was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts , " recalled <name> <unk> , life-long housekeeper and friend in the clemens <unk> , " and he'd swear something terrible if i did n't .
if he found a shirt in his drawer without a button on , he 'd take every single shirt out of that drawer and throw them right out of the window , rain or shine  out of the bathroom window they 'd go .
i used to look out every morning to see the <unk>  anything white .
out they 'd fly ... . oh !
he 'd swear at anything when he was on a <unk> .
he 'd swear at his razor if it didn't cut right , and mrs. clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter .
well , i 'd go and knock ; i 'd say , <unk> .
clemens wants to know what 's the matter . '
and then he 'd say to me ( kind of low ) in a whisper like , 'did she hear me <name> ? '
'yes , ' i 'd say , 'every word . '
oh , well , he was ashamed then , he was afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that , because mrs. clemens hated swearing . "
but his swearing never seemed really bad to <name> <unk> , " it was sort of funny , and a part of him , somehow , " she said .
" sort of amusing it was  and <name>  not like real swearing , 'cause he swore like an <name> . "
in his later years at stormfield <name> loved to play his favorite billiards .
" it was sometimes a wonderful and <unk> thing to watch mr. clemens play billiards , " relates <name> <name> .
" he loved the game , and he loved to win , but he occasionally made a very bad stroke , and then the varied , picturesque , and <unk> vocabulary , acquired in his more youthful years , was the only thing that gave him comfort .
gently , slowly , with no profane <unk> of voice , but irresistibly as though they had the <unk> of the mississippi for their source , came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice <unk> . "
<name> 's vocabulary ran the whole <unk> of life itself .
in <name> , in his appearance in 1879 before the stomach club , a jolly lot of <name> wags , <name> 's address , reports paine , " obtained a wide celebrity among the clubs of the world , though no line of it , not even its title , has ever found its way into published literature . "
it is <unk> to have been called " some remarks on the science of <unk> . "
in berlin , <name> asked <name> w. fisher to accompany him on an exploration of the berlin <name> library , where the librarian , having learned that clemens had been the kaiser 's guest at dinner , opened the secret treasure chests for the famous visitor .
one of these guarded treasures was a volume of grossly indecent verses by voltaire , addressed to <name> the great .
" too much is enough , " <name> is reported to have said , when fisher translated some of the verses , " i would blush to remember any of these stanzas except to tell <unk> about them when i get to vienna . "
when fisher had finished copying a verse for him <name> put it into his pocket , saying , " livy [ <name> 's wife , <name> ] is so busy <unk> <name> these days she ca n't even attempt to get at this . "
in his letters , too , howells observed , " he had the southwestern , the <unk> , the elizabethan breadth of <unk> , which i suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling one 's self <unk> ; and i was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion ; i could not bear to burn them , and i could not , after the first reading , quite bear to look at them .
i shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was <unk> . "
" with a nigger squat on her <unk> " <name> hay , pike county ballads .
" is there any other explanation , " asks van <unk> <name> , " 'of his elizabethan breadth of <unk> ? '
mr. howells confesses that he sometimes blushed over <name> twain 's letters , that there were some which , to the very day when he wrote his <unk> on his dead friend , he could not bear to <unk> .
perhaps if he had not so insisted , in former years , while going over <name> twain 's proofs , upon <unk> that swearing out in an instant , ' he would never had had cause to suffer from his having <unk> his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion . '
<name> twain 's verbal <unk> was obviously the expression of that vital sap which , not having been permitted to inform his work , had been driven inward and left there to ferment .
no wonder he was always indulging in orgies of forbidden words .
consider the famous book , 1601 , that fireside conversation in the time of <name> <name> : is there any obsolete verbal <unk> in the english language that <name> twain has not <unk> <unk> and assembled there ?
he , whose blood was in constant ferment and who could not contain within the narrow bonds that had been set for him the riotous exuberance of his nature , had to have an <unk> , and he poured through it a fetid stream of meaningless <unk>  the waste of a priceless <unk> material ! "
thus , <name> lumps 1601 with <name> twain 's " <unk> , " and <unk> it simply as another indication of <unk> .
figs for fig leaves !
of course , the writing of such a piece as 1601 raised the question of freedom of expression for the creative artist .
although little discussed at that time , it was a question which intensely interested <name> , and for a fuller appreciation of <unk> position one must keep in mind the year in which 1601 was written , 1876 .
there had been nothing like it before in american literature ; there had appeared no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> .
victorian england was gushing tennyson .
in the united states polite letters was a cult of the brahmins of boston , with <name> <name> howells at the helm of the atlantic .
<name> may <unk> published little women in <unk> , and little men in 1871 .
in 1873 <name> twain led the van of the <unk> , scraping the gilt off the <name> in the gilded age .
in 1880 <name> took a few pot shots at license in <name> and literature in his tramp abroad , " i wonder why some things are ?
for instance , <name> is allowed as much indecent license to-day as in earlier times  but the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply <unk> within the past eighty or ninety years .
<unk> and <unk> could portray the <unk> of their day in the <unk> language ; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day , but we are not allowed to approach them very near , even with nice and guarded forms of speech .
but not so with <name> .
the brush may still deal freely with any subject ; however revolting or indelicate .
it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore , to go about rome and <name> and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues .
these works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages , are all <unk> now .
yes , every one of them .
nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps ; nobody can help noticing it now , the <unk> makes it so conspicuous .
but the comical thing about it all , is , that the <unk> is confined to cold and pallid marble , which would be still cold and <unk> without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty , whereas <unk> paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it .
" at the door of the <unk> , in <name> , one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman , <unk> , battered , black with accumulated <unk>  they hardly suggest human beings  yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously <unk> by this fastidious generation .
you enter , and proceed to that <unk> little gallery that exists in the world ... . and there , against the wall , without obstructing rag or leaf , you may look your fill upon the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> picture the world possesses  titian 's <name> .
it is n't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed  no , it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand .
if i ventured to describe the attitude , there would be a fine howl  but there the <name> lies , for anybody to gloat over that wants to  and there she has a right to lie , for she is a work of <name> , and <name> has its privileges .
i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her ; i saw young men gaze long and <unk> at her ; i saw aged , infirm men <name> upon her charms with a pathetic interest .
how i should like to describe her  just to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the world  just to hear the <unk> average man deliver himself about my <unk> and coarseness , and all that .
" in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood , carnage , oozing brains , <unk>  pictures <unk> intolerable suffering  pictures alive with every conceivable horror , wrought out in dreadful detail  and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited  without a growl from anybody  for they are innocent , they are inoffensive , being works of <name> .
but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things  the critics would skin him alive .
well , let it go , it can not be helped ; <name> retains her privileges , literature has lost hers .
somebody else may cipher out the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of it  i have n't got time . "
professor scents <unk> unfortunately , 1601 has recently been <unk> by professor <name> <unk> as " the most famous piece of <unk> in american literature . "
like many another <unk> , prof. w. is like the little boy who is shocked to see " naughty " words chalked on the back fence , and thinks they are <unk> .
the initiated , after years of wading through the mire , <name> recognize instantly the significant difference between filthy filth and funny " filth . "
dirt for dirt 's sake is something else again .
<unk> , an eminent american <unk> has pointed out , is distinguished by the " leer of the <unk> . "
" the words which are criticised as dirty , " observed justice <name> m. <unk> in the united states district court of new york , lifting the ban on <name> by <name> <name> , " are old saxon words known to almost all men and , i venture , to many women , and are such words as would be naturally and habitually used , i believe , by the types of folk whose life , physical and mental , <name> is seeking to describe . "
neither was there " <unk> intent , " according to justice <unk> , nor was <name> obscene within the legal definition of that word .
" the meaning of the word <unk> , ' " the justice indicated , " as legally defined by the courts is : tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and <unk> thoughts .
" whether a particular book would tend to excite such impulses and thoughts must be tested by the court 's opinion as to its effect on a person with average sex instincts  what the french would call <unk> <unk> <unk> '  who plays , in this branch of legal inquiry , the same role of hypothetical <unk> as does the <unk> man ' in the law of <unk> and 'the learned man in the <name> ' on questions of invention in patent law . "
obviously , it is ridiculous to say that the " leer of the <unk> " <unk> in the pages of <name> twain 's 1601 .
droll story " in a way , " observed <name> <name> <unk> , " 1601 is to twain 's whole works what the <unk> stories ' are to <unk> 's .
it is better than the privately circulated <unk> and vulgarity of <name> field ; is , indeed , an essay in a sort of primordial humor such as we find in <unk> , or in the plays of some of the lesser stars that <name> their light from shakespeare 's urn .
it is humor or fun such as one expects , let us say , from the peasants of <name> hardy , outside of hardy 's books .
and , though it be filthy , it yet hath a splendor of mere <unk> of good spirits ...
i would say it is <unk> rather than <unk> , save for one touch toward the end .
indeed , it seems more of <unk> than of <unk> or <unk> or <unk>  is brutally british rather than <unk> <unk> , as to the subjects , but sumptuous as regards the language . "
immediately upon first reading , <name> hay , later secretary of state , had proclaimed 1601 a masterpiece .
<name> <unk> paine , <name> twain's biographer , likewise acknowledged its greatness , when he said , " 1601 is a genuine classic , as classics of that sort go .
it is better than the gross <unk> of <unk> , and perhaps in some day to come , the taste that justified <unk> and the <unk> <name> give this literary <unk> shelter and setting among the more conventional writing of <name> twain .
human taste is a curious thing ; delicacy is purely a matter of environment and point of view . "
" it depends on who writes a thing whether it is coarse or not , " wrote clemens in his notebook in 1879 .
" i built a conversation which could have happened  i used words such as were used at that time  1601 .
i sent it <unk> to a magazine , and how the editor abused it and the <unk> ! "
" but that man was a <unk> of <unk> and had been saying , 'o that we had a <unk> ! '
i judged that i could furnish him one . "
" then i took it to one of the greatest , best and most learned of <unk> [ rev .

he came within an ace of killing himself with laughter ( for between you and me the thing was dreadfully funny .
i do n't often write anything that i laugh at myself , but i can hardly think of that thing without laughing ) .

ye <unk>  what saith ye worshipful master <unk> ?

though ye <unk> hosts of heaven had foretold ye coming of this most desolating breath , proclaiming it a work of <unk> man , its quaking thunders , its <unk> <unk> his own achievement in due course of nature , yet had not i believed it ; but had said the pit itself hath furnished forth the stink , and <unk> artillery hath shook the globe in admiration of it .
[ then was there a silence , and each did turn him toward the worshipful <unk> <name> <unk> , that browned , <unk> , bloody <unk> , who rising up did smile , and <unk> say , ] <unk> w.  most gracious <unk> , 't was i that did it , but indeed it was so poor and frail a note , compared with such as i am wont to furnish , yt in sooth i was ashamed to call the <unk> mine in so <name> a presence .

then fell they to talk about ye manners and customs of many peoples , and master <unk> spake of ye <unk> of ye sieur <name> de <unk> , wherein was mention of ye custom of widows of <unk> to wear <unk> ye <unk> , in sign of <unk> , a <name> in ye <unk> of a man's member wilted and limber , whereat ye <unk> did laugh and say widows in england doe wear <unk> too , but betwixt the thighs , and not wilted neither , till <unk> hath done that office for them .
master <unk> did likewise observe how yt ye sieur de <unk> hath also spoken of a certain emperor of such mighty prowess that he did take ten <unk> in ye compass of a single night , ye while his empress did entertain two and twenty <unk> knights between her <unk> , yet was not satisfied ; whereat ye <name> countess <unk> saith a ram is yet ye <unk> superior , sith he <unk> <unk> above a hundred <unk> 'twixt sun and sun ; and after , if he can have none more to <unk> , <name> <unk> until he hath enrich 'd whole acres with his seed .

with such a tongue as thine , lad , thou'lt spread the <name> thighs of many a willing <unk> in thy good time , an ' thy <unk> be as handy as thy <unk> .
then spake ye <unk> of how she met old <unk> when she was turned of fifteen , and he did tell her of a man his father knew that had a double pair of <unk> , whereon a controversy followed as concerning the most just way to spell the word , ye contention running high betwixt ye learned bacon and ye ingenious jonson , until at last ye old <name> <name> , wearying of it all , saith , <unk> , what <unk> it how ye shall spell the word ?
i warrant ye when ye use your <unk> ye shall not think of it ; and my <name> <unk> , be ye content ; let the spelling be , ye shall enjoy the beating of them on your <unk> just the same , i trow .
before i had gained my fourteenth year i had learnt that them that would explore a <unk> stop 'd not to consider the spelling <unk> . '

<unk> hath a story of a priest that did beguile a maid into his cell , then knelt him in a corner to pray for <name> to be rightly thankful for this tender <unk> ye lord had sent him ; but ye abbot , spying through ye key-hole , did see a tuft of brownish hair with fair white flesh about it , wherefore when ye priest 's prayer was done , his chance was gone , <unk> as ye little maid had but ye one <unk> , and that was already occupied to her content .
then conversed they of religion , and ye <unk> work ye old dead <name> did doe by ye <name> of god .
then next about poetry , and master <unk> did <unk> a part of his king <name> iv. , ye which , it <unk> unto me , is not of ye value of an <unk> of ashes , yet they praised it bravely , one and all .
ye same did <unk> a portion of his " <name> and adonis , " to their prodigious admiration , whereas i , being sleepy and fatigued withal , did <unk> it but paltry stuff , and was the more <unk> in that ye <unk> <unk> had got his wind again , and did turn his mind to <unk> with such villain zeal that presently i was like to choke once more .
god damn this <name> ruffian and all his breed .
i <unk> that hell <unk> get him .
they talked about ye wonderful defense which old <unk> <name> <unk> did make for himself before ye judges in ye time of <name> ; which was unlucky matter to <unk> , sith it fetched out ye <unk> with a <unk> yt he , having so much wit , had yet not enough to save his <unk> <unk> sound for her <unk> . '
and ye <unk> did give ye <unk> <unk> <name> a look yt made <unk> wince  for she hath not forgot he was her own lover it yt <unk> day .
there was silent <unk> now ; 't was not a good turn for talk to take , sith if ye <unk> must find offense in a little harmless <unk> , when <unk> were stiff and <unk> not <unk> to take ye stiffness out of them , who of this company was <unk> ; behold , was not ye wife of master <unk> four months gone with child when she stood <unk> before ye altar ?

in time came they to discourse of <unk> , and of the new painter , <unk> , that is beginning to be heard of .
fine words and <unk> phrases from the ladies now , one or two of them being , in other days , pupils of that poor ass , <unk> , himself ; and i marked how that jonson and <unk> did <unk> to discharge some venom of sarcasm , yet dared they not in the presence , the <unk> 's <name> being ye very flower of ye <unk> herself .
but behold , these be they yt , having a specialty , and admiring it in themselves , be jealous when a neighbor doth <unk> it , nor can abide it in them long .
wherefore 't was observable yt ye <unk> waxed <unk> ; and in time labor 'd <unk> <unk> out of ye mouth of <name> <name> , who manifestly did mightily pride herself thereon , did quite <unk> ye <unk> 's endurance , who listened till ye gaudy <unk> was done , then lifted up her brows , and with <unk> irony , mincing saith 'o <unk> !

whereat they <unk> did <unk> , but not ye <name> <name> , yt <unk> foolish <unk> .
now was <unk> <name> minded of a tale he once did hear ye ingenious <unk> of <unk> relate , about a maid , which being like to suffer rape by an <unk> <unk> , did <unk> contrive a device to save her <unk> , and said to him , first , my lord , i prithee , take out thy holy tool and <unk> before me ; which doing , lo his member <unk> , and would not rise again .
footnotes to frivolity the historical consistency of 1601 indicates that twain must have given the subject considerable thought .
the author was careful to speak only of men who <unk> might have been in the virgin <name> 's closet and engaged in discourse with her .
the characters at this time ( 1601 ) <name> <name> was 68 years old .
she speaks of having talked to " old <unk> " in her youth .
this might have been possible as <unk> died in <unk> , when the <name> was 19 years old .
among those in the party were shakespeare , at that time 37 years old ; <name> jonson , 27 ; and sir <name> <name> , 49 .
beaumont at the time was 17 , not 16 .
he was admitted as a member of the inner <name> in 1600 , and his first translations , those from <unk> , were first published in <unk> .
therefore , if one were holding strictly to the year date , neither by age nor by fame would beaumont have been eligible to attend such a gathering of <name> personages in the year 1601 ; but the point is unimportant .
the elizabethan writers in the conversation shakespeare speaks of montaigne 's essays .
these were first published in <unk> and successive editions were issued in the years following , the third volume being published in <unk> .
" in england montaigne was early popular .
it was long supposed that the autograph of shakespeare in a copy of <unk> 's translation showed his study of the essays .
the autograph has been disputed , but divers passages , and especially one in the tempest , show that at first or second hand the poet was acquainted with the <unk> . "
( encyclopedia <unk> . )
the company at the <name> 's fireside discoursed of <name> ( or <unk> ) , english dramatist and novelist of the elizabethan <name> , whose novel , <unk> , published in two parts , <unk> ' , or the 'anatomy of <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> and his england ' ( <unk> ) was a literary sensation .
it is said to have influenced literary style for more than a quarter of a century , and traces of its influence are found in shakespeare .
( columbia encyclopedia ) .
the introduction of <name> jonson into the party was wholly appropriate , if one may call to witness some of jonson 's writings .
the subject under discussion was one that jonson was acquainted with , in the <unk> : act .

good old english custom that certain types of english society have not changed materially in their freedom toward breaking wind in public can be noticed in some comparatively recent literature .
<name> <name> in my life , vol .
2 , ch .
xiii , tells of <name> <unk> , wife of a judge advocate general , being compelled to leave her own table , at which she was entertaining sir <name> fowler , then the lord mayor of london , because of the suffocating and <unk> odors there .
he also tells of an instance in parliament , and of a rather brilliant bon <unk> spoken upon that occasion .
" while fowler was speaking <unk> had shewn signs of restlessness ; towards the end of the speech he had moved some three yards away from the <unk> .
as soon as fowler sat down <unk> sprang up holding his handkerchief to his nose : " 'mr .
speaker , ' he began , and was at once acknowledged by the speaker , for it was a maiden speech , and as such was entitled to precedence by the courteous custom of the house , 'i know why the right honourable member from the city did not conclude his speech with a proposal .
the only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be with a motion ! ' "
<unk> <unk> but society had apparently <unk> sadly in modern times , and even in the <name> of <name> , for at an earlier date it was a serious  nay , capital  offense to break wind in the presence of majesty .
the emperor claudius , hearing that one who had suppressed the urge while paying him court had suffered greatly thereby , " intended to issue an edict , allowing to all people the <name> of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by <unk> : " martial , too ( book xii , <unk> <unk> ) , tells of the embarrassment of one who broke wind while praying in the capitol , " one day , while standing upright , addressing his prayers to jupiter , <unk> <unk> in the capitol .
men laughed , but the father of the gods , offended , condemned the guilty one to dine at home for three nights .
since that time , miserable <unk> , when he wishes to enter the capitol , goes first to <unk> ' <unk> and <unk> ten or twenty times .
yet , in spite of this <unk> <unk> , he salutes jove with constricted <unk> . "
martial also ( book iv , <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> a woman who was subject to the habit , saying , " your <unk> , <unk> , has always a child at her side , calling it her darling and her plaything ; and yet  more wonder  she does not care for children .
what is the reason then .
<unk> is apt to <unk> .
( for which she could blame the unsuspecting infant . ) "
the tale is told , too , of a certain woman who performed an <unk> <unk> at a dinner attended by the witty <unk> <unk> , bishop of orleans , and that when , to cover up her lapse , she began to scrape her feet upon the floor , and to make similar noises , the bishop said , " do not trouble to find a rhyme , madam ! "
nay , worthier names than those of any yet mentioned have discussed the matter .
herodotus tells of one such which was the <unk> to the fall of an empire and a change of dynasty  that which amasis discharges while on horseback , and bids the <unk> of <unk> , king of egypt , catch and deliver to his <name> master .
even the exact manner and posture of amasis , author of this insult , is described .
st. <name> ( the city of god , <unk> ) <unk> the instance of a man who could command his rear trumpet to sound at <name> , which his learned <unk> <unk> with the example of one who could do so in tune !
<name> <name> , in his " letter to the <name> academy of brussels " has <unk> suggested remedies for <unk> the stench attendant upon these discharges : " my prize question therefore should be : to discover some drug , wholesome and  not disagreeable , to be mixed with our common food , or <unk> , that shall render the natural discharges of wind from our bodies not only inoffensive , but agreeable as perfumes .
" that this is not a <unk> project & altogether impossible , may appear from these considerations .
that we already have some knowledge of means capable of varying that smell .
he that <unk> on stale flesh , especially with much addition of onions , shall be able to afford a stink that no company can tolerate ; while he that has lived for some time on vegetables only , shall have that breath so pure as to be insensible of the most delicate noses ; and if he can manage so as to avoid the report , he may anywhere give vent to his griefs , unnoticed .
but as there are many to whom an entire vegetable diet would be inconvenient , & as a little quick lime thrown into a <unk> <name> correct the amazing quantity of fetid air arising from the vast mass of putrid matter contained in such places , and render it pleasing to the smell , who knows but that a little powder of lime ( or some other equivalent ) taken in our food , or perhaps a glass of lime water drank at dinner , may have the same effect on the air produced in and issuing from our bowels ? "
one curious commentary on the text is that <name> should be so fond of investigating into the authorship of the <unk> in question , when she was inordinately fond of strong and sweet perfumes ; in fact , she was responsible for the tremendous increase in <unk> of scents into england during her reign .
" ye <unk> of ye sieur <name> de <unk> " there is a curious <unk> of error and misunderstanding in this part of the sketch .
in the first place , the story is borrowed from montaigne , where it is told <unk> , and then further corrupted in the telling .
it was not the good widows of <unk> who wore the <unk> upon their <unk> ; it was the young married women , of the district near <unk> home , who paraded it to view upon their foreheads , as a symbol , says our <unk> , " of the <name> they derived therefrom . "
if they became widows , they reversed its position , and covered it up with the rest of their <unk> .
the " emperor " mentioned was not an emperor ; he was <unk> , a native of <unk> , on the genoese coast , who , with <unk> , led the unsuccessful rebellion in gaul against emperor <unk> .
even so keen a <unk> as cotton has failed to note the error .
the empress ( montaigne does not say " his empress " ) was messalina , third wife of the emperor claudius , who was uncle of caligula and <unk> to nero .
furthermore , in her case the charge is that she <unk> with twenty-five in a single night , and not twenty-two , as appears in the text .
montaigne is right in his statistics , if original sources are correct , whereas the author erred in <unk> the incident .
as for proculus , it has been noted that he was associated with <unk> , who was as renowned in the field of <unk> as was proculus in that of <name> ( gibbon , decline and fall of the <name> empire ) .
the feat of proculus is told in his own words , in <unk> , ( hist .
<name> , p. 246 ) where he <unk> having captured one hundred <unk> virgins , and <unk> ten of them in one night , together with the happenings subsequent thereto .
concerning messalina , there appears to be no question but that she was a <unk> , and that , while empress of rome , she participated in some fearful <unk> .
the question is what to believe , for much that we have heard about her is almost certainly <unk> .
the author from whom montaigne took his facts is the elder pliny , who , in his natural history , book x , chapter 83 , says , " other animals become <unk> with <unk> pleasures ; man hardly knows any <unk> .
messalina , the wife of claudius caesar , thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress , selected for the purpose of deciding the question , one of the most notorious women who followed the profession of a hired <unk> ; and the empress <unk> her , after continuous intercourse , night and day , at the <unk> embrace . "
but pliny , notwithstanding his great attainments , was often a <unk> of stale gossip , and in like case was aurelius <name> , another writer who heaped much <unk> on her name .
again , there is a great <unk> in the annals of <unk> , a true historian , at the period covering the earlier days of the empress ; while <unk> , bitter as he may be , is little more than an <unk> .
<unk> , another of her <unk> , is a prejudiced witness , for he started out to <unk> female vice , and naturally aimed at high places .
<unk> also tells of messalina 's misdeeds , but his work is under the same limitations as that of <unk> .
furthermore , none but pliny mentions the excess under consideration .
however , " where there is much smoke there must be a little fire , " and based upon the superimposed testimony of the writers of the period , there appears little doubt but that messalina was a <unk> , that she <unk> herself in the public <unk> , naked , and with gilded nipples , and that she did actually marry her chief <unk> , silius , while claudius was absent at ostia , and that the wedding was consummated in the presence of a concourse of witnesses .
this was " the straw that broke the camel 's back . "
claudius hastened back to rome , silius was dispatched , and messalina , lacking the <unk> to destroy herself , was killed when an officer ran a sword through her abdomen , just as it appeared that claudius was about to <unk> .
" then spake ye damned windmill , sir <name> " <name> is thoroughly in character here ; this observation is quite in keeping with the general veracity of his account of his travels in guiana , one of the most <unk> accounts of adventure ever told .
naturally , the scholarly researches of <unk> have failed to discover this people ; perhaps <name> <name> might best be protected among the <unk> of <unk> , where the men marry when approaching forty .
<name> jonson in his conversations observed " that <unk> w. <unk> esteemed more of fame than of conscience . "
ye virgin <unk> grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of <name> to the title , " the virgin <name> , " and it is utterly impossible to dispose of the issue in a note .
however , the weight of opinion appears to be in the negative .
many and great were the difficulties attending the marriage of a protestant <name> in those <unk> times , and <name> finally announced that she would become wedded to the english nation , and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death .
however , more or less open <unk> with essex and leicester , as well as a host of lesser courtiers , her ardent temperament , and her imperious temper , are indications that can not be denied in determining any estimate upon the point in question .
<name> jonson in his conversations with <name> <unk> of <unk> says , " <name> <name> never saw herself after she became old in a true glass ; they painted her , and <unk> would vermillion her nose .
she had <unk> about <unk> <unk> set dice that threw <unk> or five , and she knew not they were other , to make her win and <unk> herself fortunate .
that she had a <unk> on her , which made her <unk> of man , though for her delight she tried many .
at the coming over of monsieur , there was a french <unk> who took in hand to cut it , <unk> fear stayed her , and his death . "
it was a subject which again <unk> clemens when he was abroad with w. h. fisher , whom <name> employed to " nose up " everything pertaining to <name> <name> 's manly character .
" <unk> hath a story " the author does not pay any great compliment to <name> 's memory here .
there is no such tale in all <unk> .
the nearest related incident forms the subject matter of <unk> 's novel ( the fourth ) of the first day of the <unk> .
old <unk> <name> <unk> the incident referred to appears to be sir <name> <unk> 's trial for <unk> in the attempt to make <name> <name> grey <name> of england , a charge of which he was acquitted .
this so angered <name> <name> that she imprisoned him in the tower , and fined the <unk> from one to two thousand pounds each .
her action terrified succeeding <unk> , so that sir <name> 's brother was condemned on no stronger evidence than that which had failed to prevail before .
while sir <name> 's defense may have been brilliant , it must be admitted that the evidence was weak .
he was later released from the tower , and under <name> was one of a group of commissioners sent by that <name> into scotland , to <unk> trouble with <name> , <name> of scots .
when the attempt became known , <name> repudiated the acts of her agents , but sir <name> , having anticipated this possibility , had sufficient foresight to secure <unk> of his plan by the council , and so outwitted <name> , who was playing a <unk> role , and <name> , one of the greatest statesmen who ever held the post of principal minister .
perhaps it was this incident to which the company referred , which might in part explain <name> 's rejoinder .
however , he had been restored to confidence ere this , and had served as ambassador to <name> .
" to save his <unk> 's <unk> " <name> <unk> ( or <unk> ) , daughter of sir <name> , was one of <name> 's maids of honor .
when it was learned that she had been <unk> by <name> , sir <name> was recalled from his command at sea by the <name> , and compelled to marry the girl .
this was not " in that <unk> <unk> , " as the text has it , for it happened only eight years before the date of this <unk> " conversation , " when <name> was sixty years old .
partial <unk> the various <unk> of 1601 reveal how <name> twain 's <unk> conversation ' has become a part of the american printer 's <name> .
but more important , its many <unk> indicate that it has become a popular bit of american <unk> , particularly for men and women who have a feeling for <name> twain .
apparently it appeals to the <unk> , who <unk> to it his worthy <name> , as well as to the job printer , who may pull a <unk> printed proof .
the <name> procession of curious <unk> of 1601 is unique in the history of american printing .
indeed , the story of the various <unk> of 1601 is almost <unk> .

two or three persons having at different times intimated that if i would write an autobiography they would read it , when they got leisure , i yield at last to this frenzied public demand , and herewith tender my history : ours is a <name> old house , and stretches a long way back into antiquity .
the earliest ancestor the <unk> have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of higgins .
this was in the eleventh century , when our people were living in <unk> , county of cork , england .
why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name ( except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness ) , instead of higgins , is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much <name> to stir .
it is a kind of vague , pretty romance , and we leave it alone .
all the old families do that way .
<unk> twain was a man of considerable note  a solicitor on the highway in <name> <name> ' time .
at about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old english places of resort called <unk> , to see about something , and never returned again .
while there he died suddenly .
<name> twain , seems to have made something of a stir about the year <unk> .
he was as full of fun as he could be , and used to take his old sabre and sharpen it up , and get in a convenient place on a dark night , and stick it through people as they went by , to see them jump .
he was a born humorist .
but he got to going too far with it ; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties , the authorities removed one end of him , and put it up on a nice high place on <name> bar , where it could contemplate the people and have a good time .
he never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long .
then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers  <name> , <unk> fellows , who always went into battle singing ; right behind the army , and always went out <unk> , right ahead of it .
this is a <unk> rebuke to old dead <unk> 's poor <unk> that our family tree never had but one limb to it , and that that one stuck out at right angles , and bore fruit <name> , and summer .
<unk> || | || | || o || / || \ || || || || || || || our family tree early in the fifteenth century we have <name> twain , called " the scholar . "
he wrote a beautiful , beautiful hand .
and he could imitate <unk> hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it .
he had infinite sport with his talent .
but by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road , and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand .
still , he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business , which , with inconsiderable intervals , was some forty-two years .
in fact , he died in harness .
during all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till government gave him another .
he was a perfect pet .
and he was always a favorite with his <unk> , and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society , called the chain gang .
he always wore his hair short , had a preference for striped clothes , and died lamented by the government .
he was a sore loss to his country .
for he was so regular .
some years later we have the illustrious <name> <name> twain .
he came over to this country with <name> in <unk> , as a passenger .
he appears to have been of a <unk> , uncomfortable disposition .
he complained of the food all the way over , and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change .
he wanted fresh <name> .
hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air , sneering about the commander , and saying he did not believe <name> knew where he was going to or had ever been there before .
the memorable cry of " land ho ! "
thrilled every heart in the ship but his .
he gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the <unk> line lying on the distant water , and then said : " land be hanged ,  it 's a raft ! "
when this questionable passenger came on board the ship , he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked " b. g. , " one cotton sock marked " l. w. c. " one woollen one marked " d. f. " and a <unk> marked " o. m. r. " and yet during the voyage he worried more about his " trunk , " and gave himself more airs about it , than all the rest of the passengers put together .
if the ship was " down by the head , " and would not steer , he would go and move his " trunk " farther aft , and then watch the effect .
if the ship was " by the stern , " he would suggest to <name> to detail some men to " shift that baggage . "
in storms he had to be gagged , because his <unk> about his " trunk " made it impossible for the men to hear the orders .
the man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing , but it is noted in the ship 's log as a " curious circumstance " that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper , he took it ashore in four trunks , a <unk> crate , and a couple of champagne baskets .
but when he came back insinuating in an insolent , swaggering way , that some of his things were missing , and was going to search the other passengers ' baggage , it was too much , and they threw him overboard .
they watched long and wonderingly for him to come up , but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide .
but while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side , and the interest was momentarily increasing , it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow .
then in the ship 's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note : " in time it was <unk> yt ye <unk> passenger <unk> <unk> <unk> and got ye anchor , and <unk> ye same and <unk> it to ye dam <unk> from ye interior , saying yt he <unk> <unk> it , ye <unk> of a <unk> ! "
yet this ancestor had good and <name> instincts , and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and <unk> our indians .
he built a commodious jail and put up a gallows , and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them .
at this point the chronicle becomes less <name> and <unk> , and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in <name> , and while there received injuries which terminated in his death .
the great grandson of the " reformer " flourished in sixteen hundred and something , and was known in our annals as , " the old admiral , " though in history he had other titles .
he was long in command of fleets of swift vessels , well armed and manned , and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen .
vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on , always made good fair time across the ocean .
but if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do , his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer  and then he would take that ship home where he lived and , keep it there carefully , expecting the owners to come for it , but they never did .
and he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take <unk> exercise and a bath .
he called it " walking a plank . "
all the pupils liked it .
at any rate , they never found any fault with it after trying it .
when the owners were late coming for their ships , the admiral always burned them , so that the insurance money should not be lost .
at last this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors .
and to her dying day , his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been <unk> .
<name> <name> twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century , and was a zealous and distinguished missionary .
he converted sixteen thousand south sea islanders , and taught them that a <unk> necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in .
his poor flock loved him very , very dearly ; and when his funeral was over , they got up in a body ( and came out of the restaurant ) with tears in their eyes , and saying , one to another , that he was a good tender missionary , and they wished they had some more of him .
<unk> ( <unk> ) twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century , and aided gen. braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor washington .
it was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our washington from behind a tree .
so far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral <unk> is correct ; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the great spirit for some mighty mission , and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again , the narrative seriously <unk> the integrity of history .
what he did say was : " it ai n't no ( <unk> ! )
no use .
'at man 's so drunk he ca n't <name> ' still long enough for a man to hit him .
i ( <unk> ! )
i ca n't <unk> to fool away any more <unk> on him ! "
that was why he stopped at the seventeenth round , and it was , a good plain matter-of-fact reason , too , and one that easily <unk> itself to us by the eloquent , persuasive flavor of probability there is about it .
i always enjoyed the <unk> narrative , but i felt a <unk> misgiving that every indian at braddock 's defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times ( two easily grows to seventeen in a century ) , and missed him , jumped to the conclusion that the great spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission ; and so i somehow feared that the only reason why washington 's case is remembered and the others forgotten is , that in his the prophecy came true , and in that of the others it did n't .
there are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies indians and other <unk> parties have made ; but one may <name> in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled .
i <name> remark here , in passing , that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well known in history by their <unk> , that i have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them , or even mention them in the order of their birth .
among these may be mentioned <name> <unk> twain , alias <name> <unk> ; <name> wentworth twain , alias <unk> <name> ; <name> <unk> twain , alias <name> <unk> ; <unk> twain , alias baron <unk> ; <name> <name> twain , alias capt .
<unk> ; and then there are <name> <name> train , <name> pepper , <unk> and <unk> ass  they all belong to our family , but to a branch of it somewhat distantly removed from the honorable direct line  in fact , a collateral branch , whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that , in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and <unk> for , they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged .
it is not well , when writing an autobiography , to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time  it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather , and then skip from there to yourself , which i now do .
i was born without teeth  and there <name> iii had the advantage of me ; but i was born without a <unk> , likewise , and there i had the advantage of him .
my parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest .
but now a thought occurs to me .
my own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors , that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until i am hanged .
if some other biographies i have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred , it would have been a felicitous thing , for the reading public .
how does it strike you ?
awful , terrible medieval romance chapter i .
the secret revealed .
it was night .
stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of <unk> .
the year <unk> was drawing to a close .
far away up in the tallest of the castle 's towers a single light glimmered .
a secret council was being held there .
the stern old lord of <unk> sat in a chair of state meditating .
presently he said , with a tender accent : " my daughter ! "
a young man of <name> presence , clad from head to heel in knightly mail , answered : " speak , father ! "
" my daughter , the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young life .
know , then , that it had its birth in the matters which i shall now unfold .
my brother ulrich is the great duke of <unk> .
our father , on his <unk> , decreed that if no son were born to ulrich , the succession should pass to my house , provided a son were born to me .
and further , in case no son were born to either , but only daughters , then the succession should pass to <unk> daughter , if she proved <unk> ; if she did not , my daughter should succeed , if she retained a blameless name .
and so i , and my old wife here , prayed fervently for the good boon of a son , but the prayer was vain .
you were born to us .
i was in despair .
i saw the mighty prize slipping from my grasp , the splendid dream vanishing away .
and i had been so hopeful !
five years had ulrich lived in <unk> , and yet his wife had borne no heir of either sex .
" 'but hold , ' i said , 'all is not lost . '
a saving scheme had shot athwart my <name> .
you were born at midnight .
only the leech , the nurse , and six <unk> knew your sex .
i hanged them every one before an hour had sped .
next morning all the <unk> went mad with rejoicing over the proclamation that a son was born to <unk> , an heir to mighty <unk> !
and well the secret has been kept .
your mother 's own sister nursed your infancy , and from that time forward we feared nothing .
" when you were ten years old , a daughter was born to ulrich .
we grieved , but hoped for good results from measles , or physicians , or other natural enemies of infancy , but were always disappointed .
she lived , she throve  heaven 's <unk> upon her !
but it is nothing .
we are safe .
for , <unk> !
have we not a son ?
and is not our son the future duke ?
our well-beloved <name> , is it not so ?  for , woman of <unk> years  as you are , my child , none other name than that hath ever fallen to you !
" now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother , and he <unk> feeble .
the cares of state do tax him sore .
therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already duke  in act , though not yet in name .
your <unk> are ready  you journey forth to-night .
" now listen well .
remember every word i say .
there is a law as old as germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people , she shall die !
so heed my words .
pretend humility .
pronounce your judgments from the premier 's chair , which stands at the foot of the throne .
do this until you are crowned and safe .
it is not likely that your sex <name> ever be discovered ; but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life . "
" oh ; my father , is it for this my life hath been a lie !
was it that i might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights ?
spare me , father , spare your child ! "
" what , <unk> !
is this my reward for the <name> fortune my <name> has wrought for thee ?
by the bones of my father , this <unk> sentiment of thine but ill accords with my humor .
" <unk> thee to the duke , instantly !
and beware how thou <unk> with my purpose ! "
let this suffice , of the conversation .
it is enough for us to know that the prayers , the entreaties and the tears of the <unk> girl availed nothing .
they nor anything could move the stout old lord of <unk> .
and so , at last , with a heavy heart , the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her , and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants .
the old baron sat silent for many minutes after his <unk> departure , and then he turned to his sad wife and said : " dame , our matters seem speeding fairly .
it is full three months since i sent the shrewd and handsome count <unk> on his devilish mission to my brother 's daughter <name> .
if he fail , we are not wholly safe ; but if he do succeed , no power can bar our girl from being duchess e'en though <unk> should decree she never should be duke ! "
" my heart is full of <unk> , yet all may still be well . "
" <unk> , woman !
leave the owls to croak .
to bed with ye , and dream of <unk> and grandeur ! "
chapter ii .
festivity and tears six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter , the brilliant capital of the duchy of <unk> was resplendent with military pageantry , and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes ; for <name> , the young heir to the crown , was come .
the old duke 's heart was full of happiness , for <name> 's handsome person and graceful bearing had won his love at once .
the great halls of the palace were thronged with nobles , who welcomed <name> bravely ; and so bright and happy did all things seem , that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving place to a comforting contentment .
but in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature was <unk> .
by a window stood the duke 's only child , the <name> <name> .
her eyes were red and swollen , and full of tears .
she was alone .
presently she fell to weeping anew , and said aloud : " the villain <unk> is gone  has fled the dukedom !
i could not believe it at first , but alas !
it is too true .
and i loved him so .
i dared to love him though i knew the duke my father would never let me wed him .
i loved him  but now i hate him !
with all my soul i hate him !
oh , what is to become of me !
i am lost , lost , lost !
i shall go mad ! "
chapter iii .
the plot <unk> .
a few months drifted by .
all men published the praises of the young <name> 's government and <unk> the wisdom of his judgments , the <unk> of his sentences , and the modesty with which he bore himself in his great office .
the old duke soon gave everything into his hands , and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier .
it seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as <name> was , could not be otherwise than happy .
but strange enough , he was not .
for he saw with dismay that the <name> <name> had begun to love him !
the love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him , but this was freighted with danger !
and he saw , moreover , that the delighted duke had discovered his daughter 's passion likewise , and was already dreaming of a marriage .
every day somewhat of the deep sadness that had been in the <name> ' face faded away ; every day <name> and animation beamed brighter from her eye ; and by and by even vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so troubled .
<name> was appalled .
he bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own sex when he was new and a stranger in the palace  when he was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel .
he now began to avoid , his cousin .
but this only made matters worse , for , naturally enough , the more he avoided her , the more she cast herself in his way .
he marvelled at this at first ; and next it startled him .
the girl haunted him ; she hunted him ; she happened upon him at all times and in all places , in the night as well as in the day .
she seemed singularly anxious .
there was surely a mystery somewhere .
this could not go on forever .
all the world was talking about it .
the duke was beginning to look perplexed .
poor <name> was becoming a very ghost through dread and dire distress .
one day as he was emerging from a private ante-room attached to the picture gallery , <name> confronted him , and seizing both his hands , in hers , exclaimed : " oh , why , do you avoid me ?
what have i done  what have i said , to lose your kind opinion of me  for , surely i had it once ?
<name> , do not despise me , but pity a tortured heart ?
i can not  can not hold the words unspoken longer , lest they kill me  i love you , <name> !
there , despise me if you must , but they would be uttered ! "
<name> was speechless .
<name> hesitated a moment , and then , <unk> his silence , a wild gladness flamed in her eyes , and she flung her arms about his neck and said : " you <unk> !
you <unk> !
you can love me  you <name> love me !
oh , say you <name> , my own , my worshipped <name> ! "
<name> groaned aloud .
a sickly pallor overspread his countenance , and he trembled like an <unk> .
presently , in desperation , he thrust the poor girl from him , and cried : " you know not what you ask !
it is forever and ever impossible ! "
and then he fled like a criminal and left the <name> stupefied with amazement .
a minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there , and <name> was crying and sobbing in his chamber .
both were in despair .
both saw ruin staring them in the face .
by and by <name> rose slowly to her feet and moved away , saying : " to think that he was <unk> my love at the very moment that i thought it was melting his cruel heart !
i hate him !
he spurned me  did this man  he spurned me from him like a dog ! "
chapter iv .
the awful revelation .
time passed on .
a settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance of the good duke 's daughter .
she and <name> were seen together no more now .
the duke grieved at this .
but as the weeks wore away , <unk> color came back to his cheeks and his old-time vivacity to his eye , and he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom .
presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace .
it grew louder ; it spread farther .
the <unk> of the city got hold of it .
it swept the dukedom .
and this is what the whisper said : " the <name> <name> hath given birth to a child ! "
when the lord of <unk> heard it , he swung his plumed helmet thrice around his head and shouted : " long live duke <name> !  for lo , his crown is sure , from this day forward !
<unk> has done his errand well , and the good scoundrel shall be rewarded ! "
and he spread the tidings far and wide , and for <unk> hours no soul in all the <unk> but did dance and sing , <unk> and illuminate , to celebrate the great event , and all at proud and happy old <unk> 's expense .
chapter v. the frightful catastrophe .
the trial was at hand .
all the great lords and barons of <unk> were assembled in the hall of justice in the ducal palace .
no space was left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit .
<name> , clad in purple and <unk> , sat in the premier 's chair , and on either side sat the great judges of the realm .
the old duke had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed , without favor , and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted .
his days were numbered .
poor <name> had begged , as for his very life , that he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin 's crime , but it did not avail .
the saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in <name> 's breast .
the <unk> was in his father 's .
for , unknown to his daughter " <name> , " the old baron <unk> was come , and was among the crowd of nobles , triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house .
after the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries had followed , the venerable lord chief justice said : " prisoner , stand forth ! "
the unhappy <name> rose and stood <unk> before the vast multitude .
the lord chief justice continued : " most <name> <name> , before the great judges of this realm it hath been charged and proven that out of holy <unk> your <name> hath given birth unto a child ; and by our ancient law the penalty is death , excepting in one sole contingency , whereof his <name> the acting duke , our good lord <name> , <name> advertise you in his solemn sentence now ; wherefore , give heed . "
<name> stretched forth the reluctant sceptre , and in the self-same moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned <unk> toward the doomed prisoner , and the tears came into his eyes .
he opened his lips to speak , but the lord chief justice said quickly : " not there , your <name> , not there !
it is not lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal line save from the ducal throne ! "
a shudder went to the heart of poor <name> , and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise .
<name> had not been crowned  dared he profane the throne ?
he hesitated and turned pale with fear .
but it must be done .
wondering eyes were already upon him .
they would be suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer .
he ascended the throne .
presently he stretched forth the sceptre again , and said : " prisoner , in the name of our sovereign lord , ulrich , duke of <unk> , i proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me .
give heed to my words .
by the ancient law of the land , except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner , you must surely die .
embrace this opportunity  save yourself while yet you may .
name the father of your child ! "
a solemn hush fell upon the great court  a silence so profound that men could hear their own hearts beat .
then the <name> slowly turned , with eyes gleaming with hate , and pointing her finger straight at <name> , said : " thou <name> the man ! "
an appalling conviction of his helpless , hopeless peril struck a chill to <name> 's heart like the chill of death itself .
what power on earth could save him !
to <unk> the charge , he must reveal that he was a woman ; and for an <unk> woman to sit in the ducal chair was death !
at one and the same moment , he and his grim old father swooned and fell to , the ground .

the truth is , i have got my hero ( or heroine ) into such a particularly close place , that i do not see how i am ever going to get him ( or her ) out of it again  and therefore i <name> wash my hands of the whole business , and leave that person to get out the best way that offers  or else stay there .
i thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty , but it looks different now .

<name> twain
a connecticut yankee in king <name> 's court by <name> twain ( <name> l. clemens ) preface the <unk> laws and customs touched upon in this tale are historical , and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also historical .
it is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in england in the sixth century ; no , it is only pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the english and other <unk> of far later times , it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also .
one is quite justified in <unk> that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that remote time , its place was <unk> filled by a worse one .
the question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of kings is not settled in this book .
it was found too difficult .
that the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary ability , was manifest and indisputable ; that none but the deity could select that head <unk> , was also manifest and indisputable ; that the deity ought to make that selection , then , was likewise manifest and indisputable ; consequently , that he does make it , as claimed , was an unavoidable deduction .
i mean , until the author of this book encountered the <unk> , and <name> castlemaine , and some other executive heads of that kind ; these were found so difficult to work into the scheme , that it was judged better to take the other tack in this book ( which must be issued this fall ) , and then go into training and settle the question in another book .
it is , of course , a thing which ought to be settled , and i am not going to have anything particular to do next <name> anyway .
<name> twain hartford , july 21 , 1889 a connecticut yankee in king <name> 's court a word of explanation it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about .
he attracted me by three things : his candid simplicity , his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor , and the <unk> of his company  for he did all the talking .
we fell together , as modest people <name> , in the tail of the herd that was being shown through , and he at once began to say things which interested me .
as he talked along , softly , pleasantly , <unk> , he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time , and into some remote <name> and old forgotten country ; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed to move among the <unk> and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity , holding speech with a relic of it !
exactly as i would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies , or my most familiar neighbors , he spoke of sir <unk> , sir <unk> de <unk> , sir launcelot of the lake , sir <unk> , and all the other great names of the table round  and how old , old , unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on !
presently he turned to me and said , just as one might speak of the weather , or any other common matter  " you know about <unk> of souls ; do you know about <unk> of epochs  and bodies ? "
i said i had not heard of it .
he was so little interested  just as when people speak of the weather  that he did not notice whether i made him any answer or not .
there was half a moment of silence , immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the <unk> <unk> : " ancient <unk> , date of the sixth century , time of king <name> and the round table ; said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramor <name> desirous ; observe the round hole through the <unk> in the left breast ; ca n't be accounted for ; supposed to have been done with a bullet since invention of firearms  perhaps maliciously by cromwell 's soldiers . "
my acquaintance smiled  not a modern smile , but one that must have gone out of general use many , many centuries ago  and muttered apparently to himself : " wit ye well , i saw it done . "
then , after a pause , added : " i did it myself . "
by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark , he was gone .
all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms , steeped in a dream of the olden time , while the rain beat upon the windows , and the wind roared about the eaves and corners .
from time to time i dipped into old sir <name> <unk> 's enchanting book , and fed at its <name> feast of prodigies and adventures , breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete names , and dreamed again .
midnight being come at length , i read another tale , for a <unk>  this which here follows , to wit : how sir launcelot slew two giants , and made a castle free anon withal came there upon him two great giants , well armed , all save the heads , with two horrible clubs in their hands .
sir launcelot put his shield afore him , and put the stroke away of the one giant , and with his sword he <unk> his head asunder .
when his fellow saw that , he ran away as he were wood [ <unk> ] , for fear of the horrible strokes , and sir launcelot after him with all his might , and smote him on the shoulder , and <unk> him to the middle .
then sir launcelot went into the hall , and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels , and all kneeled unto him , and thanked god and him of their deliverance .
for , sir , said they , the most part of us have been here this seven year their prisoners , and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat , and we are all great <unk> born , and blessed be the time , knight , that ever thou wert born ; for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world , that <name> we bear record , and we all pray you to tell us your name , that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison .
fair damsels , he said , my name is sir launcelot du lake .
and so he departed from them and <unk> them unto god .
and then he mounted upon his horse , and rode into many strange and wild countries , and through many waters and valleys , and evil was he lodged .
and at the last by fortune him happened against a night to come to a fair <unk> , and therein he found an old <unk> that lodged him with a good-will , and there he had good cheer for him and his horse .
and when time was , his host brought him into a fair <name> over the gate to his bed .
there sir launcelot unarmed him , and set his harness by him , and went to bed , and anon he fell on sleep .
so , soon after there came one on horseback , and knocked at the gate in great haste .
and when sir launcelot heard this he rose up , and looked out at the window , and saw by the moonlight three knights come riding after that one man , and all three lashed on him at once with swords , and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended him .
truly , said sir launcelot , yonder one knight shall i help , for it were shame for me to see three knights on one , and if he be slain i am partner of his death .
and therewith he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four knights , and then sir launcelot said on high , turn you knights unto me , and leave your fighting with that knight .
and then they all three left sir <name> , and turned unto sir launcelot , and there began great battle , for they alight all three , and <unk> many strokes at sir launcelot , and assailed him on every side .
then sir <name> dressed him for to have <unk> sir launcelot .
nay , sir , said he , i <name> none of your help , therefore as ye <name> have my help let me alone with them .
sir <name> for the pleasure of the knight suffered him for to do his <name> , and so stood aside .
and then anon within six strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth .
and then they all three cried , sir knight , we yield us unto you as man of might matchless .
as to that , said sir launcelot , i <name> not take your yielding unto me , but so that ye yield you unto sir <name> the <unk> , on that covenant i <name> save your lives and else not .
fair knight , said they , that were we loath to do ; for as for sir <name> we chased him hither , and had overcome him had ye not been ; therefore , to yield us unto him it were no reason .
well , as to that , said sir launcelot , advise you well , for ye may choose whether ye <name> die or live , for an ye be <unk> , it shall be unto sir <name> .
fair knight , then they said , in saving our lives we <name> do as thou <unk> us .
then shall ye , said sir launcelot , on <unk> next coming go unto the court of king <name> , and there shall ye yield you unto <name> <unk> , and put you all three in her <name> and <name> , and say that sir <name> sent you thither to be her prisoners .
on the morn sir launcelot arose early , and left sir <name> sleeping ; and sir launcelot took sir <name> 's armor and his shield and armed him , and so he went to the stable and took his horse , and took his leave of his host , and so he departed .
then soon after arose sir <name> and missed sir launcelot ; and then he espied that he had his armor and his horse .
now by my <name> i know well that he <name> grieve some of the court of king <name> ; for on him knights <name> be bold , and deem that it is i , and that <name> beguile them ; and because of his armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace .
and then soon after departed sir <name> , and thanked his host .
as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door , and my stranger came in .
i gave him a pipe and a chair , and made him welcome .
i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky ; gave him another one ; then still another  hoping always for his story .
after a fourth <unk> , he drifted into it himself , in a quite simple and natural way : the stranger 's history i am an american .
i was born and reared in hartford , in the state of connecticut  anyway , just over the river , in the country .
so i am a yankee of the yankees  and practical ; yes , and nearly barren of sentiment , i suppose  or poetry , in other words .
my father was a blacksmith , my uncle was a horse doctor , and i was both , along at first .
then i went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade ; learned all there was to it ; learned to make everything : guns , revolvers , cannon , boilers , engines , all sorts of <unk> machinery .
why , i could make anything a body wanted  anything in the world , it did n't make any difference what ; and if there was n't any quick <unk> way to make a thing , i could invent one  and do it as easy as rolling off a log .
i became head superintendent ; had a couple of thousand men under me .
well , a man like that is a man that is full of fight  that goes without saying .
with a couple of thousand rough men under one , one has plenty of that sort of amusement .
i had , anyway .
at last i met my match , and i got my dose .
it was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules .
he laid me out with a <unk> alongside the head that made everything crack , and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor .
then the world went out in darkness , and i did n't feel anything more , and did n't know anything at all  at least for a while .
when i came to again , i was sitting under an oak tree , on the grass , with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself  nearly .
not entirely ; for there was a fellow on a horse , looking down at me  a fellow fresh out of a picture-book .
he was in old-time iron armor from head to heel , with a helmet on his head the shape of a <unk> with slits in it ; and he had a shield , and a sword , and a prodigious spear ; and his horse had armor on , too , and a steel horn projecting from his forehead , and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that <name> down all around him like a <unk> , nearly to the ground .
" fair sir , <name> ye just ? "
said this fellow .
" <name> i which ? "
" <name> ye try a passage of arms for land or <name> or for  " " what are you giving me ? "
i said .
" get along back to your circus , or i 'll report you . "
now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear , with his <unk> bent down nearly to his horse 's neck and his long spear pointed straight ahead .
i saw he meant business , so i was up the tree when he arrived .
he allowed that i was his property , the captive of his spear .
there was argument on his side  and the bulk of the advantage  so i judged it best to humor him .
we fixed up an agreement whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me .
i came down , and we started away , i walking by the side of his horse .
we marched comfortably along , through <unk> and over <name> which i could not remember to have seen before  which puzzled me and made me wonder  and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus .
so i gave up the idea of a circus , and concluded he was from an asylum .
but we never came to an asylum  so i was up a stump , as you may say .
i asked him how far we were from hartford .
he said he had never heard of the place ; which i took to be a lie , but allowed it to go at that .
at the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river ; and beyond it on a hill , a vast gray fortress , with towers and turrets , the first i had ever seen out of a picture .
" <unk> ? "
said i , pointing .
" camelot , " said he .
my stranger had been showing signs of <unk> .
he caught himself nodding , now , and smiled one of those pathetic , obsolete smiles of his , and said : " i find i ca n't go on ; but come with me , i 've got it all written out , and you can read it if you like . "
in his chamber , he said : " first , i kept a journal ; then by and by , after years , i took the journal and turned it into a book .
how long ago that was ! "
he handed me his manuscript , and pointed out the place where i should begin : " begin here  i 've already told you what goes before . "
he was steeped in drowsiness by this time .
as i went out at his door i heard him murmur sleepily : " give you good den , fair sir . "
i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure .
the first part of it  the great bulk of it  was parchment , and yellow with age .
i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a <unk> .
under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces of a <unk> which was older and <unk> still  latin words and sentences : fragments from old <unk> legends , evidently .
i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read  as follows : the tale of the lost land chapter i camelot " camelot  camelot , " said i to myself .
" i do n't seem to remember hearing of it before .
name of the asylum , likely . "
it was a soft , reposeful summer landscape , as lovely as a dream , and as lonesome as <name> .
the air was full of the smell of flowers , and the buzzing of insects , and the <unk> of birds , and there were no people , no wagons , there was no stir of life , nothing going on .
the road was mainly a winding path with <unk> in it , and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass  wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one 's hand .
presently a fair slip of a girl , about ten years old , with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders , came along .
around her head she wore a hoop of <unk> poppies .
it was as sweet an outfit as ever i saw , what there was of it .
she walked <unk> along , with a mind at rest , its peace reflected in her innocent face .
the circus man paid no attention to her ; didn't even seem to see her .
and she  she was no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of her life .
she was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows ; but when she happened to notice me , then there was a change !
up went her hands , and she was turned to stone ; her mouth dropped open , her eyes stared wide and <unk> , she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear .
and there she stood gazing , in a sort of stupefied fascination , till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view .
that she should be startled at me instead of at the other man , was too many for me ; i could n't make head or tail of it .
and that she should seem to consider me a spectacle , and totally overlook her own merits in that respect , was another puzzling thing , and a display of magnanimity , too , that was surprising in one so young .
there was food for thought here .
i moved along as one in a dream .
as we approached the town , signs of life began to appear .
at intervals we passed a wretched cabin , with a thatched roof , and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation .
there were people , too ; brawny men , with long , coarse , <unk> hair that <name> down over their faces and made them look like animals .
they and the women , as a rule , wore a coarse <unk> robe that came well below the knee , and a rude sort of <unk> , and many wore an iron collar .
the small boys and girls were always naked ; but nobody seemed to know it .
all of these people stared at me , talked about me , ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me ; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow , except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains .
in the town were some substantial <unk> houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins ; the streets were mere crooked alleys , and <unk> ; troops of dogs and <unk> children played in the sun and made life and noise ; hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about , and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and <unk> her family .
presently there was a distant blare of military music ; it came nearer , still nearer , and soon a <name> cavalcade wound into view , glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and <unk> banners and <name> <unk> and <unk> and gilded <unk> ; and through the muck and swine , and naked brats , and joyous dogs , and shabby huts , it took its gallant way , and in its wake we followed .
followed through one winding alley and then another ,  and climbing , always climbing  till at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood .
there was an exchange of bugle blasts ; then a parley from the walls , where men-at-arms , in <unk> and <unk> , marched back and forth with <unk> at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them ; and then the great gates were flung open , the drawbridge was lowered , and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches ; and we , following , soon found ourselves in a great paved court , with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides ; and all about us the dismount was going on , and much greeting and ceremony , and running to and fro , and a <name> display of moving and <unk> colors , and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion .
chapter ii king <name> 's court the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said , in an insinuating , confidential way : " friend , do me a kindness .
do you belong to the asylum , or are you just on a visit or something like that ? "
he looked me over stupidly , and said : " marry , fair sir , me <unk>  " " that <name> do , " i said ; " i reckon you are a patient . "
i moved away , <unk> , and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light .
i judged i had found one , presently ; so i <name> him aside and said in his ear : " if i could see the head keeper a minute  only just a minute  " " prithee do not let me . "
" let you what ? "
" hinder me , then , if the word please thee better .
then he went on to say he was an <unk> and could not stop to gossip , though he would like it another time ; for it would comfort his very liver to know where i got my clothes .
as he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose , and was seeking me besides , no doubt .
this was an airy slim boy in <unk> tights that made him look like a forked carrot , the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles ; and he had long yellow curls , and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear .
by his look , he was good-natured ; by his gait , he was satisfied with himself .
he was pretty enough to frame .
he arrived , looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity ; said he had come for me , and informed me that he was a <name> .
" go 'long , " i said ; " you ai n't more than a paragraph . "
it was pretty severe , but i was nettled .
however , it never <unk> him ; he did n't appear to know he was hurt .
he began to talk and laugh , in happy , thoughtless , boyish fashion , as we walked along , and made himself old friends with me at once ; asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes , but never waited for an answer  always chattered straight ahead , as if he didn't know he had asked a question and was n't expecting any reply , until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513 .
it made the cold chills creep over me !
i stopped and said , a little faintly : " maybe i did n't hear you just right .
say it again  and say it slow .
what year was it ? "
" 513 . "
" 513 !
you do n't look it !
come , my boy , i am a stranger and friendless ; be honest and honorable with me .
are you in your right mind ? "
he said he was .
" are these other people in their right minds ? "
he said they were .
" and this is n't an asylum ?
i mean , it is n't a place where they cure crazy people ? "
he said it was n't .
" well , then , " i said , " either i am a lunatic , or something just as awful has happened .
now tell me , honest and true , where am i ? "
" in king <name> 's court . "
i waited a minute , to let that idea shudder its way home , and then said : " and according to your notions , what year is it now ? "
" <unk>  nineteenth of <name> . "
i felt a mournful sinking at the heart , and muttered : " i shall never see my friends again  never , never again .
they <name> not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet . "
i seemed to believe the boy , i did n't know why .
something in me seemed to believe him  my consciousness , as you may say ; but my reason did n't .
my reason straightway began to clamor ; that was natural .
i did n't know how to go about satisfying it , because i knew that the testimony of men would n't serve  my reason would say they were lunatics , and throw out their evidence .
but all of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing , just by luck .
i knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the 21st of <name> , a.d. <unk> , <unk> , and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon .
i also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year  i.e. , 1879 .
so , if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours , i should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not .
wherefore , being a practical connecticut man , i now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come , in order that i might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment , and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made .
one thing at a time , is my motto  and just play that thing for all it is worth , even if it 's only two pair and a <name> .
i made up my mind to two things : if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunatics and could n't get away , i would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why ; and if , on the other hand , it was really the sixth century , all right , i did n't want any softer thing : i would boss the whole country inside of three months ; for i judged i would have the start of the <unk> man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward .
i 'm not a man to waste time after my mind 's made up and there 's work on hand ; so i said to the <name> : " now , <name> , my boy  if that might happen to be your name  i 'll get you to post me up a little if you do n't mind .
what is the name of that apparition that brought me here ? "
" my master and thine ?
that is the good knight and great lord sir <name> the <unk> , <name> brother to our liege the king . "
" very good ; go on , tell me everything . "
he made a long story of it ; but the part that had immediate interest for me was this : he said i was sir <name> 's prisoner , and that in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends <unk> me  unless i chanced to rot , first .
i saw that the last chance had the best show , but i did n't waste any bother about that ; time was too precious .
the <name> said , further , that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time , and that as soon as the <unk> and the heavy drinking should begin , sir <name> would have me in and exhibit me before king <name> and his illustrious knights seated at the table round , and would brag about his exploit in capturing me , and would probably exaggerate the facts a little , but it would n't be good form for me to correct him , and not over safe , either ; and when i was done being exhibited , then ho for the dungeon ; but he , <name> , would find a way to come and see me every now and then , and cheer me up , and help me get word to my friends .
get word to my friends !
i thanked him ; i could n't do less ; and about this time a <unk> came to say i was wanted ; so <name> led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me .
well , it was a curious kind of spectacle , and interesting .
it was an immense place , and rather naked  yes , and full of loud contrasts .
it was very , very lofty ; so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight ; there was a <unk> gallery at each end , high up , with musicians in the one , and women , clothed in stunning colors , in the other .
the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares , rather battered by age and use , and needing repair .
as to ornament , there was n't any , strictly speaking ; though on the walls <name> some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of <name> ; <unk> , they were , with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread ; with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holes  so that the man 's coat looks as if it had been done with a <unk> .
there was a fireplace big enough to camp in ; and its projecting sides and hood , of carved and pillared <unk> , had the look of a cathedral door .
along the walls stood men-at-arms , in breastplate and <unk> , with <unk> for their only weapon  rigid as statues ; and that is what they looked like .
in the middle of this <unk> and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the table round .
it was as large as a circus ring ; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one 's eyes to look at them .
they wore their plumed hats , right along , except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king , he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark .
mainly they were drinking  from entire ox horns ; but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones .
there was about an average of two dogs to one man ; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them , and then they went for it by brigades and divisions , with a rush , and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails , and the storm of howlings and <unk> <unk> all speech for the time ; but that was no matter , for the <unk> was always a bigger interest anyway ; the men rose , sometimes , to observe it the better and bet on it , and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their <unk> with the same object ; and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time .
in the end , the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws , and proceeded to growl over it , and gnaw it , and grease the floor with it , just as fifty others were already doing ; and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments .
as a rule , the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly ; and i noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anything  i mean in a <unk> interval .
and plainly , too , they were a childlike and innocent lot ; telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning <unk> , and ready and willing to listen to anybody <unk> lie , and believe it , too .
it was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful ; and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder .
i was not the only prisoner present .
there were twenty or more .
poor devils , many of them were maimed , hacked , carved , in a frightful way ; and their hair , their faces , their clothing , were caked with black and stiffened <unk> of blood .
they were suffering sharp physical pain , of course ; and weariness , and hunger and thirst , no doubt ; and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash , or even the poor <name> of a <unk> for their wounds ; yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan , or saw them show any sign of restlessness , or any disposition to complain .
the thought was forced upon me : " the rascals  they have served other people so in their day ; it being their own turn , now , they were not expecting any better treatment than this ; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training , intellectual fortitude , reasoning ; it is mere animal training ; they are white indians . "
chapter iii knights of the table round mainly the round table talk was <unk>  narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and <unk> killed and stripped of their steeds and armor .
as a general thing  as far as i could make out  these murderous adventures were not <unk> undertaken to avenge injuries , nor to settle old disputes or sudden <unk> out ; no , as a rule they were simply duels between strangers  duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other , and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever .
many a time i had seen a couple of boys , strangers , meet by chance , and say simultaneously , " i can lick you , " and go at it on the spot ; but i had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only , and was a sign and <name> of childhood ; but here were these big <unk> sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond .
yet there was something very engaging about these great <unk> creatures , something attractive and lovable .
there did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery , so to speak , to bait a <unk> with ; but you did n't seem to mind that , after a little , because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that , and indeed would have marred it , hindered it , spoiled its symmetry  perhaps rendered its existence impossible .
there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face ; and in some a certain <unk> and sweetness that rebuked your <unk> criticisms and stilled them .
a most <name> <unk> and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir <unk> , and likewise in the king 's also ; and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake .
there was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this sir launcelot .
at a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies , six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies ' gallery and begged the <name> of a word with the <name> .
the most conspicuously situated <name> in that massed <unk> of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent , and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon , ransom , captivity , or death , as she in her good pleasure might elect ; and this , as he said , he was doing by command of sir <name> the <unk> , whose prisoners they were , he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field .
surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house ; the <name> 's gratified smile faded out at the name of sir <name> , and she looked disappointed ; and the <name> whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision  " sir <name> , forsooth !
oh , call me pet names , dearest , call me a <name> !
in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to <unk> the fellow to this majestic lie ! "
every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir <name> .
but he was equal to the occasion .
he got up and played his hand like a <name>  and took every trick .
he said he would state the case exactly according to the facts ; he would tell the simple straightforward tale , without comment of his own ; " and then , " said he , " if ye find <name> and honor due , ye <name> give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or <unk> with sword in the ranks of <name> battle  even him that <unk> there ! "
and he pointed to sir launcelot .
ah , he fetched them ; it was a rattling good stroke .
then he went on and told how sir launcelot , seeking adventures , some brief time gone by , killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword , and set a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free ; and then went further , still seeking adventures , and found him ( sir <name> ) fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights , and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands , and conquered the nine ; and that night sir launcelot rose quietly , and dressed him in sir <name> 's armor and took sir <name> 's horse and <unk> him away into distant lands , and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another ; and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about <unk> they would ride to <name> 's court and yield them to <name> <unk> 's hands as captives of sir <name> the <unk> , spoil of his knightly prowess ; and now here were these half dozen , and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds .
well , it was touching to see the <name> blush and smile , and look embarrassed and happy , and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot that would have got him shot in arkansas , to a dead certainty .
everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot ; and as for me , i was perfectly amazed , that one man , all by himself , should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters .
i said as much to <name> ; but this mocking <unk> only said : " an sir <name> had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him , ye had seen the <unk> doubled . "
i looked at the boy in sorrow ; and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance .
i followed the direction of his eye , and saw that a very old and <unk> man , clothed in a flowing black gown , had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs , and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye .
the same suffering look that was in the <name> 's face was observable in all the faces around  the look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan .
" marry , we shall have it again , " sighed the boy ; " that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words , and that he <name> tell till he <unk> , every time he hath gotten his barrel full and <unk> his <unk> <unk> .
would god i had died or i saw this day ! "
" who is it ? "
" <name> , the mighty liar and magician , perdition <unk> him for the weariness he <unk> with his one tale !
but that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call , they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and <unk> it .
he <unk> it always in the third person , making believe he is too modest to <unk> himself  <unk> light upon him , misfortune be his dole !
good friend , prithee call me for <unk> . "
the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep .
the old man began his tale ; and presently the lad was asleep in reality ; so also were the dogs , and the court , the <unk> , and the files of men-at-arms .
the droning voice <unk> on ; a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments .
some heads were bowed upon folded arms , some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music ; the flies <unk> and bit , unmolested , the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes , and <unk> about , and made themselves at home everywhere ; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king 's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it , and <unk> the crumbs in the king 's face with naive and impudent irreverence .
it was a tranquil scene , and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit .
this was the old man 's tale .
he said : " right so the king and <name> departed , and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech .
so the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good <unk> ; so the king was there three days , and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go , and so departed .
and as they rode , <name> said , i have no sword .
no force , * [ <unk> from m.t .
: no matter . ]
said <name> , hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may .
so they rode till they came to a lake , the which was a fair water and broad , and in the midst of the lake <name> was ware of an arm clothed in white <unk> , that held a fair sword in that hand .
lo , said <name> , yonder is that sword that i spake of .
with that they saw a damsel going upon the lake .
what damsel is that ?
said <name> .
that is the <name> of the lake , said <name> ; and within that lake is a rock , and therein is as fair a place as any on earth , and richly <unk> , and this damsel <name> come to you anon , and then speak ye fair to her that she <name> give you that sword .
anon withal came the damsel unto <name> and saluted him , and he her again .
damsel , said <name> , what sword is that , that yonder the arm <unk> above the water ?
i would it were mine , for i have no sword .
sir <name> king , said the damsel , that sword is mine , and if ye <name> give me a gift when i ask it you , ye shall have it .
by my <name> , said <name> , i <name> give you what gift ye <name> ask .
well , said the damsel , go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword , and take it and the scabbard with you , and i <name> ask my gift when i see my time .
so sir <name> and <name> alight , and tied their horses to two trees , and so they went into the ship , and when they came to the sword that the hand held , sir <name> took it up by the handles , and took it with him .
and the arm and the hand went under the water ; and so they came unto the land and rode forth .
and then sir <name> saw a <name> pavilion .
what <unk> yonder pavilion ?
it is the knight 's pavilion , said <name> , that ye fought with last , sir <unk> , but he is out , he is not there ; he hath ado with a knight of yours , that <unk> <unk> , and they have fought together , but at the last <unk> fled , and else he had been dead , and he hath chased him even to <unk> , and we shall meet with him anon in the highway .
that is well said , said <name> , now have i a sword , now <name> i wage battle with him , and be avenged on him .
sir , ye shall not so , said <name> , for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing , so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him ; also , he <name> not lightly be matched of one knight living ; and therefore it is my counsel , let him pass , for he shall do you good service in short time , and his sons , after his days .
also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed .
when i see him , i <name> do as ye advise me , said <name> .
then sir <name> looked on the sword , and liked it passing well .
whether <unk> you better , said <name> , the sword or the scabbard ?
me <unk> better the sword , said <name> .
ye are more unwise , said <name> , for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword , for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood , be ye never so sore wounded ; therefore , keep well the scabbard always with you .
so they rode into <unk> , and by the way they met with sir <unk> ; but <name> had done such a craft that <unk> saw not <name> , and he passed by without any words .
i <name> , said <name> , that the knight would not speak .
sir , said <name> , he saw you not ; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed .
so they came unto <unk> , whereof his knights were passing glad .
and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would <unk> his person so alone .
but all men of worship said it was <name> to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did . "
chapter iv sir <unk> the humorist it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told ; but then i had heard it only once , and that makes a difference ; it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh , no doubt .
sir <unk> the humorist was the first to awake , and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality .
he tied some metal <unk> to a dog 's tail and turned him loose , and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright , with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil ; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed , and some fell out of their chairs and <unk> on the floor in ecstasy .
it was just like so many children .
sir <unk> was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again , to weariness , how the immortal idea happened to occur to him ; and as is the way with <unk> of his breed , he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through .
he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech  of course a humorous speech .
i think i never heard so many old <unk> jokes strung together in my life .
he was worse than the minstrels , worse than the clown in the circus .
it seemed peculiarly sad to sit here , thirteen hundred years before i was born , and listen again to poor , flat , <unk> jokes that had given me the dry <unk> when i was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards .
it about convinced me that there is n't any such thing as a new joke possible .
everybody laughed at these antiquities  but then they always do ; i had noticed that , centuries later .
however , of course the <unk> did n't laugh  i mean the boy .
no , he scoffed ; there was n't anything he would n't scoff at .
he said the most of sir <unk> 's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified .
i said " petrified " was good ; as i believed , myself , that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by <unk> periods .
but that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place , for geology had n't been invented yet .
however , i made a note of the remark , and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through .
it is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market is n't ripe yet .
now sir <name> arose and began to fire up on his <unk> with me for fuel .
it was time for me to feel serious , and i did .
sir <name> told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians , who all wore the same ridiculous garb that i did  a garb that was a work of enchantment , and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands .
however he had <unk> the force of the enchantment by prayer , and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours ' battle , and taken me prisoner , sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court .
he spoke of me all the time , in the <unk> way , as " this prodigious giant , " and " this horrible <unk> monster , " and " this <unk> and <unk> <unk> ogre " , and everybody took in all this bosh in the <unk> way , and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me .
he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top of a tree two hundred <unk> high at a single bound , but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow , which " <unk> <unk> " the most of my bones , and then swore me to appear at <name> 's court for sentence .
he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st ; and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date .
i was in a dismal state by this time ; indeed , i was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how i had better be killed , the possibility of the killing being doubted by some , because of the enchantment in my clothes .
and yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of <unk> <unk> .
still , i was sane enough to notice this detail , to wit : many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a comanche blush .
<unk> is too mild a term to convey the idea .
however , i had read " <name> jones , " and " <name> random , " and other books of that kind , and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk , and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies , clear up to a hundred years ago ; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century  in which century , broadly speaking , the earliest samples of the real <name> and real gentleman discoverable in english history  or in european history , for that matter  may be said to have made their appearance .
suppose sir <name> , instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters , had allowed the characters to speak for themselves ?
we should have had talk from <name> and <unk> and the soft <name> <name> which would embarrass a tramp in our day .
however , to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate .
king <unk> people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence of mind enough not to mention it .
they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved , at last , when old <name> swept the difficulty away for them with a common-sense hint .
he asked them why they were so dull  why did n't it occur to them to strip me .
in half a minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs !
and dear , dear , to think of it : i was the only embarrassed person there .
everybody discussed me ; and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage .
<name> <unk> was as naively interested as the rest , and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before .
it was the only compliment i got  if it was a compliment .
finally i was carried off in one direction , and my perilous clothes in another .
i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon , with some scant remnants for dinner , some <unk> straw for a bed , and no end of rats for company .
chapter v an inspiration i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long .
when i next came to myself , i seemed to have been asleep a very long time .
my first thought was , " well , what an astonishing dream i 've had !
i reckon i 've waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something ... .
i 'll nap again till the whistle blows , and then i 'll go down to the arms factory and have it out with hercules . "
but just then i heard the harsh music of <name> chains and bolts , a light flashed in my eyes , and that butterfly , <name> , stood before me !
i gasped with surprise ; my breath almost got away from me .
" what ! "
i said , " you here yet ?
go along with the rest of the dream !
scatter ! "
but he only laughed , in his light-hearted way , and fell to making fun of my sorry plight .
" all right , " i said resignedly , " let the dream go on ; i 'm in no hurry . "
" prithee what dream ? "
" what dream ?
why , the dream that i am in <name> 's court  a person who never existed ; and that i am talking to you , who are nothing but a work of the imagination . "
" oh , la , indeed !
and is it a dream that you 're to be burned to-morrow ?
<unk>  answer me that ! "
the shock that went through me was distressing .
i now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious , dream or no dream ; for i knew by past experience of the <unk> intensity of dreams , that to be burned to death , even in a dream , would be very far from being a jest , and was a thing to be avoided , by any means , fair or foul , that i could contrive .
so i said <unk> : " ah , <name> , good boy , only friend i 've got ,  for you are my friend , are n't you ?  do n't fail me ; help me to devise some way of escaping from this place ! "
" now do but hear thyself !
escape ?
why , man , the corridors are in guard and keep of men-at-arms . "
" no doubt , no doubt .
but how many , <name> ?
not many , i <name> ? "
" full a score .
one may not <name> to escape . "
after a pause  hesitatingly : " and there be other reasons  and <unk> . "
" other ones ?
what are they ? "
" well , they say  oh , but i dare n't , indeed dare n't ! "
" why , poor lad , what is the matter ?
why do you <unk> ?
why do you tremble so ? "
" oh , in sooth , there is need !
i do want to tell you , but  " " come , come , be brave , be a man  speak out , there 's a good lad ! "
he hesitated , pulled one way by <name> , the other way by fear ; then he stole to the door and peeped out , listening ; and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper , and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death .
" <name> , in his malice , has woven a spell about this dungeon , and there <unk> not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you !
now god pity me , i have told it !
ah , be kind to me , be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well ; for an thou betray me i am lost ! "
i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time ; and shouted : " <name> has wrought a spell !
<name> , forsooth !
that cheap old humbug , that <unk> old ass ?
bosh , pure bosh , the <unk> bosh in the world !
why , it does seem to me that of all the childish , idiotic , <unk> , <unk> superstitions that <unk>  oh , damn <name> ! "
but <name> had <unk> to his knees before i had half finished , and he was like to go out of his mind with fright .
" oh , beware !
these are awful words !
any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things .
oh call them back before it is too late ! "
now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking .
if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of <name> 's pretended magic as <name> was , certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things .
i went on thinking , and worked out a plan .
then i said : " get up .
pull yourself together ; look me in the eye .
do you know why i laughed ? "
" no  but for our blessed <name> 's sake , do it no more . "
" well , i 'll tell you why i laughed .
because i 'm a magician myself . "
" thou ! "
the boy recoiled a step , and caught his breath , for the thing hit him rather sudden ; but the aspect which he took on was very , very respectful .
i took quick note of that ; it indicated that a humbug did n't need to have a reputation in this asylum ; people stood ready to take him at his word , without that .
i resumed .
" i 've known <name> seven hundred years , and he  " " seven hun  " " do n't interrupt me .
he has died and come alive again thirteen times , and traveled under a new name every time : smith , jones , robinson , <name> , peters , <unk> , <name>  a new alias every time he turns up .
i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago ; i knew him in <name> five hundred years ago  he is always <unk> around in my way , everywhere i go ; he makes me tired .
he don't amount to shucks , as a magician ; knows some of the old common tricks , but has never got beyond the rudiments , and never <name> .
he is well enough for the provinces  <unk> stands and that sort of thing , you know  but dear me , he ought n't to set up for an expert  anyway not where there 's a real artist .
now look here , <name> , i am going to stand your friend , right along , and in return you must be mine .
i want you to do me a favor .
i want you to get word to the king that i am a magician myself  and the supreme grand <unk> and head of the tribe , at that ; and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that <name> make the fur fly in these realms if sir <name> 's project is carried out and any harm comes to me .
<name> you get that to the king for me ? "
the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me .
it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified , so unnerved , so demoralized .
but he promised everything ; and on my side he made me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend , and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him .
then he worked his way out , staying himself with his hand along the wall , like a sick person .
presently this thought occurred to me : how heedless i have been !
when the boy gets calm , he <name> wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place ; he <name> put this and that together , and <name> see that i am a humbug .
i worried over that heedless blunder for an hour , and called myself a great many hard names , meantime .
but finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals did n't reason ; that they never put this and that together ; that all their talk showed that they did n't know a discrepancy when they saw it .
i was at rest , then .
but as soon as one is at rest , in this world , off he goes on something else to worry about .
it occurred to me that i had made another blunder : i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat  i intending to invent a calamity at my leisure ; now the people who are the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to swallow miracles are the very ones who are <unk> to see you perform them ; suppose i should be called on for a sample ?
suppose i should be asked to name my calamity ?
yes , i had made a blunder ; i ought to have invented my calamity first .
" what shall i do ?
what can i say , to gain a little time ? "
i was in trouble again ; in the deepest kind of trouble ... " there 's a footstep !  they 're coming .
if i had only just a moment to think ... . good , i 've got it .
i 'm all right . "
you see , it was the eclipse .
it came into my mind in the <name> of time , how <name> , or <name> , or one of those people , played an eclipse as a saving trump once , on some savages , and i saw my chance .
i could play it myself , now , and it would n't be any plagiarism , either , because i should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties .
<name> came in , subdued , distressed , and said : " i <unk> the message to our liege the king , and straightway he had me to his presence .
he was <unk> even to the marrow , and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement , and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great ; but then came <name> and spoiled all ; for he persuaded the king that you are mad , and know not whereof you speak ; and said your threat is but foolishness and idle <unk> .
they disputed long , but in the end , <name> , <unk> , said , <unk> hath he not named his brave calamity ?
verily it is because he can not . '
this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king's mouth , and he could offer naught to turn the argument ; and so , reluctant , and full loth to do you the discourtesy , he yet <unk> you to consider his perplexed case , as noting how the matter stands , and name the calamity  if so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming .
oh , prithee delay not ; to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about .
oh , be thou wise  name the calamity ! "
i allowed silence to accumulate while i got my impressiveness together , and then said : " how long have i been shut up in this hole ? "
" ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent .
it is 9 of the morning now . "
" no !
then i have slept well , sure enough .
nine in the morning now !
and yet it is the very complexion of midnight , to a shade .
this is the 20th , then ? "
" the 20th  yes . "
" and i am to be burned alive to-morrow . "
the boy shuddered .
" at what hour ? "
" at high noon . "
" now then , i <name> tell you what to say . "
i paused , and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence ; then , in a voice deep , measured , charged with doom , i began , and rose by dramatically <unk> stages to my colossal climax , which i delivered in as sublime and <name> a way as ever i did such a thing in my life : " go back and tell the king that at that hour i <name> smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight ; i <name> blot out the sun , and he shall never shine again ; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth , and the peoples of the earth shall <unk> and die , to the last man ! "
i had to <name> the boy out myself , he sunk into such a collapse .
i handed him over to the soldiers , and went back .
chapter <name> the eclipse in the stillness and the darkness , realization soon began to supplement knowledge .
the mere knowledge of a fact is pale ; but when you come to realize your fact , it takes on color .
it is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart , and seeing it done .
in the stillness and the darkness , the knowledge that i was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time ; a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold .
but it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these , as soon as a man 's mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion , and he <unk> .
<name> springs up , and cheerfulness along with it , and then he is in good shape to do something for himself , if anything can be done .
when my rally came , it came with a bound .
i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me , and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides ; and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube , and my <unk> all vanished .
i was as happy a man as there was in the world .
i was even impatient for to-morrow to come , i so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation 's wonder and reverence .
besides , in a business way it would be the making of me ; i knew that .
meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind .
that was the <unk> that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people , it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise .
so , by and by when i heard footsteps coming , that thought was recalled to me , and i said to myself , " as sure as anything , it 's the compromise .
well , if it is good , all right , i <name> accept ; but if it is n't , i mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth . "
the door opened , and some men-at-arms appeared .
the leader said : " the stake is ready .
come ! "
the stake !
the strength went out of me , and i almost fell down .
it is hard to get one 's breath at such a time , such lumps come into one 's throat , and such <unk> ; but as soon as i could speak , i said : " but this is a mistake  the execution is to-morrow . "
" order changed ; been set forward a day .
haste thee ! "
i was lost .
there was no help for me .
i was dazed , stupefied ; i had no command over myself , i only wandered purposely about , like one out of his mind ; so the soldiers took hold of me , and pulled me along with them , out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors , and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world .
as we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle i got a shock ; for the first thing i saw was the stake , standing in the center , and near it the piled fagots and a monk .
on all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank , forming sloping terraces that were <name> with color .
the king and the <name> sat in their thrones , the most conspicuous figures there , of course .
to note all this , occupied but a second .
the next second <name> had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear , his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness .
he said : " tis through me the change was wrought !
and main hard have i worked to do it , too .
but when i revealed to them the calamity in store , and saw how mighty was the terror it did <unk> , then saw i also that this was the time to strike !
wherefore i diligently pretended , unto this and that and the other one , that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow ; and so if any would save the sun and the world , you must be slain to-day , while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack <unk> .
<unk> , it was but a dull lie , a most indifferent invention , but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it , in the frenzy of their fright , as it were salvation sent from heaven ; and all the while was i laughing in my sleeve the one moment , to see them so cheaply deceived , and <unk> god the next , that he was content to let the meanest of his creatures be his instrument to the saving of thy life .
ah how happy has the matter sped !
you <name> not need to do the sun a real hurt  ah , forget not that , on your soul forget it not !
only make a little darkness  only the littlest little darkness , mind , and cease with that .
it <name> be sufficient .
they <name> see that i spoke falsely ,  being ignorant , as they <name> fancy  and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear ; and they <name> set you free and make you great !
go to thy triumph , now !
but remember  ah , good friend , i implore thee remember my supplication , and do the blessed sun no hurt .
for my sake , thy true friend . "
i choked out some words through my grief and misery ; as much as to say i would spare the sun ; for which the lad 's eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death .
as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if i had been blindfold i should have supposed i was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people .
there was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity ; they were as rigid as stone images , and as pale ; and dread sat upon every countenance .
this hush continued while i was being chained to the stake ; it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles , my knees , my thighs , my body .
then there was a pause , and a deeper hush , if possible , and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch ; the multitude strained forward , gazing , and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it ; the monk raised his hands above my head , and his eyes toward the blue sky , and began some words in latin ; in this attitude he <unk> on and on , a little while , and then stopped .
i waited two or three moments ; then looked up ; he was standing there petrified .
with a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky .
i followed their eyes , as sure as guns , there was my eclipse beginning !
the life went boiling through my veins ; i was a new man !
the rim of black spread slowly into the sun 's disk , my heart beat higher and higher , and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky , motionless .
i knew that this gaze would be turned upon me , next .
when it was , i was ready .
i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck , with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun .
it was a <name> effect .
you could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave .
two shouts rang out , one close upon the heels of the other : " apply the torch ! "
" i forbid it ! "
the one was from <name> , the other from the king .
<name> started from his place  to apply the torch himself , i judged .
i said : " stay where you are .
if any man moves  even the king  before i give him leave , i <name> blast him with thunder , i <name> consume him with lightnings ! "
the multitude sank meekly into their seats , and i was just expecting they would .
<name> hesitated a moment or two , and i was on pins and needles during that little while .
then he sat down , and i took a good breath ; for i knew i was master of the situation now .
the king said : " be merciful , fair sir , and essay no further in this perilous matter , lest disaster follow .
it was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow ; but  " " your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie ?
it was a lie . "
that made an immense effect ; up went appealing hands everywhere , and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that i might be bought off at any price , and the calamity stayed .
the king was eager to comply .
he said : " name any terms , reverend sir , even to the <unk> of my kingdom ; but banish this calamity , spare the sun ! "
my fortune was made .
i would have taken him up in a minute , but i could n't stop an eclipse ; the thing was out of the question .
so i asked time to consider .
the king said : " how long  ah , how long , good sir ?
be merciful ; look , it <unk> darker , moment by moment .
prithee how long ? "
" not long .
half an hour  maybe an hour . "
there were a thousand pathetic protests , but i could n't shorten up any , for i could n't remember how long a total eclipse lasts .
i was in a puzzled condition , anyway , and wanted to think .
something was wrong about that eclipse , and the fact was very <unk> .
if this was n't the one i was after , how was i to tell whether this was the sixth century , or nothing but a dream ?
dear me , if i could only prove it was the latter !
here was a glad new <name> .
if the boy was right about the date , and this was surely the 20th , it wasn't the sixth century .
i reached for the monk 's sleeve , in considerable excitement , and asked him what day of the month it was .
<name> him , he said it was the <unk> !
it made me turn cold to hear him .
i begged him not to make any mistake about it ; but he was sure ; he knew it was the 21st .
so , that <unk> boy had <unk> things again !
the time of the day was right for the eclipse ; i had seen that for myself , in the beginning , by the dial that was near by .
yes , i was in king <name> 's court , and i might as well make the most out of it i could .
the darkness was steadily growing , the people becoming more and more distressed .
i now said : " i have reflected , sir king .
for a lesson , i <name> let this darkness proceed , and spread night in the world ; but whether i blot out the sun for good , or restore it , shall rest with you .
these are the terms , to wit : you shall remain king over all your dominions , and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship ; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive , and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state .
if i ca n't live on that , i sha'n't ask anybody to give me a lift .
is it satisfactory ? "
there was a prodigious roar of applause , and out of the midst of it the king 's voice rose , saying : " away with his bonds , and set him free !
and do him homage , high and low , <name> and poor , for he is become the king 's right hand , is clothed with power and authority , and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne !
now sweep away this creeping night , and bring the light and cheer again , that all the world may bless thee . "
but i said : " that a common man should be shamed before the world , is nothing ; but it were dishonor to the king if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame .
if i might ask that my clothes be brought again  " " they are not meet , " the king broke in .
" fetch raiment of another sort ; clothe him like a <name> ! "
my idea worked .
i wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total , otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness , and of course i could n't do it .
sending for the clothes gained some delay , but not enough .
so i had to make another excuse .
i said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement ; therefore i would let the darkness grow a while , and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same , the darkness should be dismissed .
neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement , but i had to stick to my point .
it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker , while i struggled with those awkward <unk> clothes .
it got to be pitch dark , at last , and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky .
at last the eclipse was total , and i was very glad of it , but everybody else was in misery ; which was quite natural .
i said : " the king , by his silence , still stands to the terms . "
then i lifted up my hands  stood just so a moment  then i said , with the most awful solemnity : " let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away ! "
there was no response , for a moment , in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush .
but when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out , a moment or two later , the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude ; and <name> was not the last of the wash , to be sure .
chapter vii <name> 's tower inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom , as far as political power and authority were concerned , much was made of me .
my raiment was of silks and <unk> and cloth of gold , and by consequence was very showy , also uncomfortable .
but habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes ; i was aware of that .
i was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle , after the king 's .
they were aglow with <unk> silken hangings , but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet , and they were <unk> rushes at that , being not all of one breed .
as for conveniences , properly speaking , there were n't any .
i mean little conveniences ; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life .
the big oaken chairs , graced with rude carvings , were well enough , but that was the stopping place .
there was no soap , no matches , no looking-glass  except a metal one , about as powerful as a pail of water .
and not a chromo .
i had been used to <unk> for years , and i saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for <name> had got worked into the fabric of my being , and was become a part of me .
it made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in east hartford , all unpretending as it was , you could n't go into a room but you would find an <unk> , or at least a <unk> <unk> over the door ; and in the parlor we had nine .
but here , even in my grand room of state , there was n't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a <unk> , which was either woven or knitted ( it had darned places in it ) , and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape ; and as for proportions , even <name> himself could n't have <unk> them more <unk> , after all his practice on those <unk> they call his " celebrated hampton court <unk> . "
<name> was a bird .
we had several of his <unk> ; one was his " miraculous draught of fishes , " where he puts in a miracle of his own  puts three men into a canoe which would n't have held a dog without upsetting .
i always admired to study r. 's <name> , it was so fresh and <unk> .
there was n't even a <name> or a <unk> in the castle .
i had a great many servants , and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom ; and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him .
there was no gas , there were no candles ; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light .
a lot of these <name> along the walls and modified the dark , just <unk> it down enough to make it dismal .
if you went out at night , your servants carried torches .
there were no books , pens , paper or ink , and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows .
it is a little thing  glass is  until it is absent , then it becomes a big thing .
but perhaps the worst of all was , that there wasn't any sugar , coffee , tea , or tobacco .
i saw that i was just another robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island , with no society but some more or less tame animals , and if i wanted to make life <unk> i must do as he did  invent , contrive , create , <unk> things ; set <name> and hand to work , and keep them busy .
well , that was in my line .
one thing troubled me along at first  the immense interest which people took in me .
apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me .
it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british world almost to death ; that while it lasted the whole country , from one end to the other , was in a pitiable state of panic , and the churches , <unk> , and <unk> overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come .
then had followed the news that the <unk> of this awful event was a stranger , a mighty magician at <name> 's court ; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle , and was just going to do it when his <name> was purchased , and he then dissolved his enchantments , and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction .
now if you consider that everybody believed that , and not only believed it , but never even dreamed of doubting it , you <name> easily understand that there was not a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me .
of course i was all the talk  all other subjects were dropped ; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety .
within twenty-four hours the <unk> began to arrive , and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming .
the village was crowded , and all the countryside .
i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes .
it came to be a great burden , as to time and trouble , but of course it was at the same time <unk> agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage .
it turned <unk> <name> green with envy and spite , which was a great satisfaction to me .
but there was one thing i couldn't understand  nobody had asked for an autograph .
i spoke to <name> about it .
by <name> !
i had to explain to him what it was .
then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests .
land !
think of that .
there was another thing that troubled me a little .
those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle .
that was natural .
to be able to <name> back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun , riding in the heavens , and be obeyed , would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors , and envied by them all ; but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselves  why , people would come a distance to see them .
the pressure got to be pretty strong .
there was going to be an eclipse of the moon , and i knew the date and hour , but it was too far away .
two years .
i would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it .
it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so , and come lagging along at a time when a body would n't have any use for it , as like as not .
if it had been booked for only a month away , i could have sold it short ; but , as matters stood , i couldn't seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good , so i gave up trying .
next , <name> found that old <name> was making himself busy on the sly among those people .
he was spreading a report that i was a humbug , and that the reason i did n't accommodate the people with a miracle was because i could n't .
i saw that i must do something .
i presently thought out a plan .
by my authority as executive i threw <name> into prison  the same cell i had occupied myself .
then i gave public notice by herald and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight , but about the end of that time i would take a moment's leisure and blow up <name> 's stone tower by fires from heaven ; in the meantime , whoso listened to evil reports about me , let him beware .
furthermore , i would perform but this one miracle at this time , and no more ; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured , i would turn the <unk> into horses , and make them useful .
quiet ensued .
i took <name> into my confidence , to a certain degree , and we went to work privately .
i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation , and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody .
that made his mouth safe enough .
<unk> we made a few bushels of first-rate blasting powder , and i superintended my <unk> while they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires .
this old stone tower was very massive  and rather ruinous , too , for it was <name> , and four hundred years old .
yes , and handsome , after a rude fashion , and clothed with <name> from base to summit , as with a shirt of scale mail .
it stood on a lonely eminence , in good view from the castle , and about half a mile away .
working by night , we stowed the powder in the tower  dug stones out , on the inside , and buried the powder in the walls themselves , which were fifteen feet thick at the base .
we put in a peck at a time , in a dozen places .
we could have blown up the tower of london with these charges .
when the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightning-rod , bedded it in one of the <unk> of powder , and ran wires from it to the other <unk> .
everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation , but on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people , through the heralds , to keep clear away  a quarter of a mile away .
then added , by command , that at some time during the twenty-four hours i would consummate the miracle , but would first give a brief notice ; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime , by <unk> in the same places if at night .
<unk> had been tolerably frequent of late , and i was not much afraid of a failure ; still , i should n't have cared for a delay of a day or two ; i should have explained that i was busy with affairs of state yet , and the people must wait .
of course , we had a blazing <name> day  almost the first one without a cloud for three weeks ; things always happen so .
i kept secluded , and watched the weather .
<name> dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time , and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements .
at last the wind sprang up and a cloud appeared  in the right quarter , too , and just at nightfall .
for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread and <unk> , then i judged it was time for me to appear .
i ordered the <unk> to be lit , and <name> liberated and sent to me .
a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward <name> 's tower .
already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far ; these people and the old turrets , being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great <unk> overhead , made a good deal of a picture .
<name> arrived in a gloomy mood .
i said : " you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm , and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation .
therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up your tower , but it is only fair to give you a chance ; now if you think you can break my enchantments and <name> off the fires , step to the bat , it 's your innings . "
" i can , fair sir , and i <name> .
doubt it not . "
he <name> an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof , and burnt a pinch of powder in it , which sent up a small cloud of <unk> smoke , whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable .
then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands .
he worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy , and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill .
by this time the storm had about reached us ; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows <unk> about , the first heavy drops of rain were falling , the world abroad was black as pitch , the lightning began to wink fitfully .
of course , my <name> would be loading itself now .
in fact , things were imminent .
so i said : " you have had time enough .
i have given you every advantage , and not interfered .
it is plain your magic is weak .
it is only fair that i begin now . "
i made about three passes in the air , and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks , along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday , and showed a thousand acres of human beings <unk> on the ground in a general collapse of consternation .
well , it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week .
this was the report ; but probably the facts would have modified it .
it was an effective miracle .
the great <unk> temporary population vanished .
there were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning , but they were all outward bound .
if i had advertised another miracle i could n't have raised an audience with a sheriff .
<name> 's stock was flat .
the king wanted to stop his wages ; he even wanted to banish him , but i interfered .
i said he would be useful to work the weather , and attend to small matters like that , and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little <unk> <unk> on him .
there was n't a rag of his tower left , but i had the government rebuild it for him , and advised him to take boarders ; but he was too high-toned for that .
and as for being grateful , he never even said thank you .
he was a rather hard lot , take him how you might ; but then you could n't fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so .
chapter viii the boss to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing ; but to have the <unk> world consent to it is a finer .
the tower episode solidified my power , and made it impregnable .
if any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that , they experienced a change of heart , now .
there was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters .
i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances .
for a time , i used to wake up , mornings , and smile at my " dream , " and listen for the colt 's factory whistle ; but that sort of thing played itself out , gradually , and at last i was fully able to realize that i was actually living in the sixth century , and in <unk> court , not a lunatic asylum .
after that , i was just as much at home in that century as i could have been in any other ; and as for preference , i would n't have traded it for the twentieth .
look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge , brains , pluck , and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country .
the grandest field that ever was ; and all my own ; not a competitor ; not a man who was n't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities ; whereas , what would i amount to in the twentieth century ?
i should be foreman of a factory , that is about all ; and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself .
what a jump i had made !
i could n't keep from thinking about it , and contemplating it , just as one does who has struck oil .
there was nothing back of me that could approach it , unless it might be <name> 's case ; and <name> 's only approached it , it did n't equal it , quite .
for it stands to reason that as <name> 's splendid financial <unk> <unk> nobody but the king , the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of <unk> , whereas i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun , and was popular by reason of it .
i was no shadow of a king ; i was the substance ; the king himself was the shadow .
my power was colossal ; and it was not a mere name , as such things have generally been , it was the genuine article .
i stood here , at the very spring and source of the second great period of the world 's history ; and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and <unk> , and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries ; and i could note the <unk> of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones : de <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <name> , and <name> the second 's <unk> <unk> ; but nowhere in the procession was my full-sized fellow visible .
i was a unique ; and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half , for sure .
yes , in power i was equal to the king .
at the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together .
that was the church .
i do not wish to disguise that fact .
i could n't , if i wanted to .
but never mind about that , now ; it <name> show up , in its proper place , later on .
it did n't cause me any trouble in the beginning  at least any of consequence .
well , it was a curious country , and full of interest .
and the people !
they were the <unk> and simplest and <unk> race ; why , they were nothing but rabbits .
it was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty <unk> of loyalty toward their king and church and nobility ; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and church and <name> than a slave has to love and honor the lash , or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him !
why , dear me , any kind of royalty , howsoever modified , any kind of aristocracy , howsoever <unk> , is rightly an insult ; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself , and do n't believe it when somebody else tells you .
it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason , and the <unk> people that have always figured as its <unk>  a company of monarchs and nobles who , as a rule , would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left , like their betters , to their own exertions .
the most of king <name> 's british nation were slaves , pure and simple , and bore that name , and wore the iron collar on their necks ; and the rest were slaves in fact , but without the name ; they imagined themselves men and freemen , and called themselves so .
the truth was , the nation as a body was in the world for one object , and one only : to <unk> before king and church and <name> ; to slave for them , sweat blood for them , starve that they might be fed , work that they might play , drink misery to the <unk> that they might be happy , go naked that they might wear silks and jewels , pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them , be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and <unk> of <unk> that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world .
and for all this , the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt ; and so <unk> were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor .
inherited ideas are a curious thing , and interesting to observe and examine .
i had mine , the king and his people had theirs .
in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit , and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands .
for instance , those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree , whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or had n't , were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals , bugs , insects ; whereas i had inherited the idea that human <unk> who can consent to masquerade in the <unk> of inherited dignities and <unk> titles , are of no good but to be laughed at .
the way i was looked upon was odd , but it was natural .
you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie : well , that is the idea .
they are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength ; they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers ; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him .
but does that make him one of them ?
no ; the <unk> tramp in the pit would smile at the idea .
he could n't comprehend it ; could n't take it in ; couldn't in any remote way conceive of it .
well , to the king , the nobles , and all the nation , down to the very slaves and tramps , i was just that kind of an elephant , and nothing more .
i was admired , also feared ; but it was as an animal is admired and feared .
the animal is not <unk> , neither was i ; i was not even respected .
i had no pedigree , no inherited title ; so in the king's and nobles ' eyes i was mere dirt ; the people regarded me with wonder and awe , but there was no reverence mixed with it ; through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship .
there you see the hand of that awful power , the <name> catholic church .
in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms .
before the day of the <unk> supremacy in the world , men were men , and held their heads up , and had a man 's pride and spirit and independence ; and what of greatness and position a person got , he got mainly by achievement , not by birth .
but then the church came to the front , with an axe to grind ; and she was wise , subtle , and knew more than one way to skin a cat  or a nation ; she invented " divine right of kings , " and propped it all around , brick by brick , with the <unk>  <unk> them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one ; she preached ( to the commoner ) humility , obedience to superiors , the beauty of self-sacrifice ; she preached ( to the commoner ) meekness under insult ; preached ( still to the commoner , always to the commoner ) <name> , meanness of spirit , <unk> under oppression ; and she introduced <unk> ranks and <unk> , and taught all the <name> populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them .
even down to my <unk> that poison was still in the blood of christendom , and the best of english <unk> was still content to see his <unk> <unk> continuing to hold a number of positions , such as <unk> and the throne , to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire ; in fact , he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things , he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it .
it seems to show that there isn't anything you ca n't stand , if you are only born and bred to it .
of course that taint , that reverence for rank and title , had been in our american blood , too  i know that ; but when i left <name> it had disappeared  at least to all intents and purposes .
the remnant of it was restricted to the <unk> and <unk> .
when a disease has worked its way down to that level , it may fairly be said to be out of the system .
but to return to my anomalous position in king <name> 's kingdom .
here i was , a giant among <unk> , a man among children , a master intelligence among intellectual moles : by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole british world ; and yet there and then , just as in the remote england of my <unk> , the <unk> <name> who could claim long descent from a king 's <unk> , acquired at second-hand from the slums of london , was a better man than i was .
such a personage was fawned upon in <name> 's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody , even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence , and his morals as base as his lineage .
there were times when he could sit down in the king 's presence , but i could n't .
i could have got a title easily enough , and that would have raised me a large step in everybody 's eyes ; even in the king 's , the giver of it .
but i did n't ask for it ; and i declined it when it was offered .
i could n't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions ; and it would n't have been fair , anyway , because as far back as i could go , our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister .
i could n't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and <unk> over any title except one that should come from the nation itself , the only legitimate source ; and such an one i hoped to win ; and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor , i did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride .
this title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith , one day , in a village , was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote ; in ten days it had swept the kingdom , and was become as familiar as the king 's name .
i was never known by any other designation afterward , whether in the nation 's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the <unk> of the sovereign .
this title , translated into modern speech , would be the boss .
elected by the nation .
that suited me .
and it was a pretty high title .
there were very few the 's , and i was one of them .
if you spoke of the duke , or the <name> , or the bishop , how could anybody tell which one you meant ?
but if you spoke of the king or the <name> or the boss , it was different .
well , i liked the king , and as king i respected him  respected the office ; at least respected it as much as i was capable of respecting any <unk> supremacy ; but as men i looked down upon him and his nobles  privately .
and he and they liked me , and respected my office ; but as an animal , without birth or sham title , they looked down upon me  and were not particularly private about it , either .
i did n't charge for my opinion about them , and they didn't charge for their opinion about me : the account was square , the books balanced , everybody was satisfied .
chapter ix the tournament they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot ; and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human <unk> they were , too , but just a little wearisome to the practical mind .
however , i was generally on hand  for two reasons : a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be liked  especially as a statesman ; and both as business man and statesman i wanted to study the tournament and see if i could n't invent an improvement on it .
that reminds me to remark , in passing , that the very first official thing i did , in my administration  and it was on the very first day of it , too  was to start a patent office ; for i knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab , and could n't travel any way but sideways or <unk> .
things ran along , a tournament nearly every week ; and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand  i mean sir launcelot and the rest  but i said i would by and by ; no hurry yet , and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going .
we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week , and as many as five hundred knights took part in it , from first to last .
they were weeks gathering .
they came on horseback from everywhere ; from the very ends of the country , and even from beyond the sea ; and many brought ladies , and all brought squires and troops of servants .
it was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd , as to <unk> , and very characteristic of the country and the time , in the way of high animal spirits , innocent <unk> of language , and <unk> indifference to morals .
it was fight or look on , all day and every day ; and sing , gamble , dance , <unk> half the night every night .
they had a most <name> good time .
you never saw such people .
those banks of beautiful ladies , shining in their barbaric splendors , would see a knight <unk> from his horse in the lists with a <unk> the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting , and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view ; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief , and look ostentatiously broken-hearted , and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public had n't found it out .
the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily , but i did n't mind it in the present circumstances , because it kept me from hearing the <unk> <unk> legs and arms from the day's cripples .
they ruined an uncommon good old <unk> saw for me , and broke the <unk> , too , but i let it pass .
and as for my axe  well , i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe to a surgeon i would pick my century .
i not only watched this tournament from day to day , but detailed an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and agriculture , and ordered him to report it ; for it was my purpose by and by , when i should have gotten the people along far enough , to start a newspaper .
the first thing you want in a new country , is a patent office ; then work up your school system ; and after that , out with your paper .
a newspaper has its faults , and plenty of them , but no matter , it 's hark from the tomb for a dead nation , and don't you forget it .
you ca n't <unk> a dead nation without it ; there is n't any way .
so i wanted to sample things , and be finding out what sort of <unk> i might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when i should come to need it .
well , the priest did very well , considering .
he got in all the details , and that is a good thing in a local item : you see , he had kept books for the <unk> of his church when he was younger , and there , you know , the money 's in the details ; the more details , the more swag : bearers , <unk> , candles , prayers  everything counts ; and if the bereaved do n't buy prayers enough you <name> up your candles with a forked pencil , and your <name> shows up all right .
and he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertise  no , i mean a knight that had influence ; and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration , for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles .
of course this novice 's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description , and therefore wanted the true ring ; but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple , and full of the <unk> and <unk> of the time , and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks .
here is an extract from it : then sir <name> de <name> isles and <unk> <unk> , knights of the castle , encountered with sir <unk> and sir <unk> , and sir <unk> smote down sir <unk> <unk> to the earth .
then came sir <unk> of the <unk> tower , and sir <unk> , knights of the castle , and there encountered with them sir <unk> de <unk> and sir <unk> de <unk> , that were two brethren , and there encountered sir <unk> with sir <unk> , and either brake their spears unto their hands , and then sir <unk> with sir <unk> , and either of them smote down other , horse and all , to the earth , and either parties rescued other and <unk> them again .
and sir <name> , and sir <unk> , knights of the castle , encountered with sir <unk> and sir <name> , and these four knights encountered mightily , and brake their spears to their hands .
then came sir <unk> from the castle , and there encountered with him sir <name> , and there sir <unk> the green knight smote down sir <name> , brother to sir launcelot .
all this was marked by <name> heralds , who bare him best , and their names .
then sir <unk> brake his spear upon sir gareth , but of that stroke sir <unk> fell to the earth .
when sir <unk> saw that , he bad sir gareth keep him , and sir gareth smote him to the earth .
then sir <unk> <unk> a spear to avenge his brother , and in the same wise sir gareth served him , and sir <unk> and his brother la <unk> male <unk> , and sir <unk> <name> <unk> , and sir <unk> <name> savage ; all these he bare down with one spear .
when king <unk> of ireland saw sir gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be , that one time seemed green , and another time , at his again coming , he seemed blue .
and thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color , so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him .
then sir <unk> the king of ireland encountered with sir gareth , and there sir gareth smote him from his horse , saddle and all .
and then came king <unk> of scotland , and sir gareth smote him down horse and man .
and in the same wise he served king <unk> of the land of gore .
and then there came in sir <unk> , and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the earth .
and <unk> 's son <unk> brake a spear upon sir gareth mightily and knightly .
and then sir <unk> the <name> <name> cried on high , knight with the many colors , well hast thou <unk> ; now make thee ready that i may just with thee .
sir gareth heard him , and he <unk> a great spear , and so they encountered together , and there the <name> brake his spear ; but sir gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm , that he reeled here and there , and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him .
truly , said king <name> , that knight with the many colors is a good knight .
wherefore the king called unto him sir launcelot , and prayed him to encounter with that knight .
sir , said launcelot , i may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this time , for he hath had <unk> enough this day , and when a good knight doth so well upon some day , it is no good knight 's part to let him of his worship , and , namely , when he <unk> a knight hath done so great labour ; for peradventure , said sir launcelot , his quarrel is here this day , and peradventure he is best beloved with this <name> of all that be here , for i see well he <unk> himself and <unk> him to do great deeds , and therefore , said sir launcelot , as for me , this day he shall have the honour ; though it lay in my power to put him from it , i would not .
there was an unpleasant little episode that day , which for reasons of state i struck out of my priest 's report .
you <name> have noticed that <name> was doing some great fighting in the engagement .
when i say <name> i mean sir gareth .
<name> was my private pet name for him ; it suggests that i had a deep affection for him , and that was the case .
but it was a private pet name only , and never spoken aloud to any one , much less to him ; being a <name> , he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me .
well , to proceed : i sat in the private box set apart for me as the king 's minister .
while sir <unk> was waiting for his turn to enter the lists , he came in there and sat down and began to talk ; for he was always making up to me , because i was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes , the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick .
i had always responded to his efforts as well as i could , and felt a very deep and real kindness for him , too , for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life , he had at least spared it me .
it was one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on american soil , from <name> down to artemus <name> .
it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the <unk> jokes for an hour and never got a laugh ; and then when he was leaving , some gray <unk> wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard , and " it was all they could do to keep from laughin ' right out in meetin ' . "
that anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling ; and yet i had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times , and cried and cursed all the way through .
then who can <name> to know what my feelings were , to hear this <unk> ass start in on it again , in the murky twilight of tradition , before the <name> of history , while even <unk> might be referred to as " the late <unk> , " and the crusades would n't be born for five hundred years yet ?
just as he finished , the <unk> came ; so , <unk> like a demon , he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings , and i knew nothing more .
it was some minutes before i came to , and then i opened my eyes just in time to see sir gareth fetch him an awful <unk> , and i unconsciously out with the prayer , " i <name> to gracious he 's killed ! "
but by ill-luck , before i had got half through with the words , sir gareth crashed into sir sagramor <name> desirous and sent him thundering over his horse 's <unk> , and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought i meant it for him .
well , whenever one of those people got a thing into his head , there was no getting it out again .
i knew that , so i saved my breath , and offered no explanations .
as soon as sir sagramor got well , he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us , and he named a day three or four years in the future ; place of settlement , the lists where the offense had been given .
i said i would be ready when he got back .
you see , he was going for the holy <unk> .
the boys all took a <unk> at the holy <unk> now and then .
it was a several years ' cruise .
they always put in the long absence <unk> around , in the most conscientious way , though none of them had any idea where the holy <unk> really was , and i do n't think any of them actually expected to find it , or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it .
you see , it was just the northwest passage of that day , as you may say ; that was all .
every year expeditions went out holy <unk> , and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them .
there was worlds of reputation in it , but no money .
why , they actually wanted me to put in !
well , i should smile .
chapter x beginnings of civilization the round table soon heard of the challenge , and of course it was a good deal discussed , for such things interested the boys .
the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures , so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away .
i excused myself for the present ; i said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly ; then i should be ready ; all the chances were that at the end of that time sir sagramor would still be out <unk> , so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement ; i should then have been in office six or seven years , and i believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without its working any harm .
i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished .
in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under way  nuclei of future vast factories , the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization .
in these were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find , and i kept agents out raking the country for more , all the time .
i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts  experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling .
these nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats , for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit  for i was afraid of the church .
i had started a <unk> and a lot of <unk> the first thing ; as a result , i now had an admirable system of <unk> schools in full blast in those places , and also a complete variety of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition .
everybody could be any kind of a <name> he wanted to ; there was perfect freedom in that matter .
but i confined public religious teaching to the churches and the <unk> , permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings .
i could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian without any trouble , but that would have been to affront a law of human nature : spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites , complexions , and features , and a man is only at his best , morally , when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion , <unk> , and stature of the individual who wears it ; and , besides , i was afraid of a united church ; it makes a mighty power , the mightiest conceivable , and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands , as it is always bound to do , it means death to human <name> and paralysis to human thought .
all mines were <name> property , and there were a good many of them .
they had formerly been worked as savages always work mines  holes <unk> in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand , at the rate of a ton a day ; but i had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as i could .
yes , i had made pretty handsome progress when sir <unk> challenge struck me .
four years rolled by  and then !
well , you would never imagine it in the world .
unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands .
the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government .
an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government , if the conditions were the same , namely , the despot the <unk> individual of the human race , and his lease of life perpetual .
but as a perishable perfect man must die , and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor , an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government , it is the worst form that is possible .
my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command .
unsuspected by this dark land , i had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose !
it was fenced away from the public view , but there it was , a gigantic and unassailable fact  and to be heard from , yet , if i lived and had luck .
there it was , as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano , standing innocent with its <unk> summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels .
my schools and churches were children four years before ; they were grown-up now ; my shops of that day were vast factories now ; where i had a dozen trained men then , i had a thousand now ; where i had one brilliant expert then , i had fifty now .
i stood with my hand on the cock , so to speak , ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment .
but i was not going to do the thing in that sudden way .
it was not my policy .
the people could not have stood it ; and , moreover , i should have had the established <name> catholic church on my back in a minute .
no , i had been going cautiously all the while .
i had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time , whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees , and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition , and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things .
i was turning on my light <unk> at a time , and meant to continue to do so .
i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom , and they were doing very well .
i meant to work this racket more and more , as time wore on , if nothing occurred to frighten me .
one of my deepest secrets was my west point  my military academy .
i kept that most jealously out of sight ; and i did the same with my naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport .
both were <unk> to my satisfaction .
<name> was twenty-two now , and was my head executive , my right hand .
he was a darling ; he was equal to anything ; there wasn't anything he could n't turn his hand to .
of late i had been training him for journalism , for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line ; nothing big , but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my <unk> .
he took to it like a duck ; there was an editor concealed in him , sure .
already he had doubled himself in one way ; he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth .
his journalistic style was climbing , steadily ; it was already up to the back settlement alabama <name> , and could n't be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor .
we had another large departure on hand , too .
this was a telegraph and a telephone ; our first venture in this line .
these wires were for private service only , as yet , and must be kept private until a <unk> day should come .
we had a gang of men on the road , working mainly by night .
they were stringing ground wires ; we were afraid to put up poles , for they would attract too much inquiry .
ground wires were good enough , in both instances , for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect .
my men had orders to strike across country , avoiding roads , and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence , and leaving experts in charge .
nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom , for nobody ever went intentionally to any place , but only struck it by accident in his wanderings , and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was .
at one time and another we had sent out <unk> expeditions to survey and map the kingdom , but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble .
so we had given the thing up , for the present ; it would be poor wisdom to <unk> the church .
as for the general condition of the country , it was as it had been when i arrived in it , to all intents and purposes .
i had made changes , but they were necessarily slight , and they were not noticeable .
thus far , i had not even meddled with taxation , outside of the taxes which provided the <name> revenues .
i had <unk> those , and put the service on an effective and righteous basis .
as a result , these revenues were already <unk> , and yet the burden was so much more <unk> distributed than before , that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief , and the praises of my administration were hearty and general .
personally , i struck an interruption , now , but i did not mind it , it could not have happened at a better time .
earlier it could have annoyed me , but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along .
the king had reminded me several times , of late , that the postponement i had asked for , four years before , had about run out now .
it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a <name> with sir sagramor , who was still out <unk> , but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions , and might be found any year , now .
so you see i was expecting this interruption ; it did not take me by surprise .
chapter xi the yankee in search of adventures there never was such a country for wandering liars ; and they were of both sexes .
hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving ; and generally loaded with a tale about some <name> or other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel , usually a giant .
now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a <unk> from an entire stranger , would be to ask for credentials  yes , and a pointer or two as to locality of castle , best route to it , and so on .
but nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing at that .
no , everybody swallowed these people 's lies whole , and never asked a question of any sort or about anything .
well , one day when i was not around , one of these people came along  it was a she one , this time  and told a tale of the usual pattern .
her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle , along with forty-four other young and beautiful girls , pretty much all of them princesses ; they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years ; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers , each with four arms and one eye  the eye in the center of the forehead , and as big as a fruit .
sort of fruit not mentioned ; their usual <unk> in statistics .
would you believe it ?
the king and the whole round table were in <unk> over this preposterous opportunity for adventure .
every knight of the table jumped for the chance , and begged for it ; but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me , who had not asked for it at all .
by an effort , i contained my <name> when <name> brought me the news .
but he  he could not contain his .
his mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge  delight in my good fortune , gratitude to the king for this splendid <name> of his favor for me .
he could keep neither his legs nor his body still , but <unk> about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness .
on my side , i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this <unk> , but i kept my vexation under the surface for policy 's sake , and did what i could to let on to be glad .
indeed , i said i was glad .
and in a way it was true ; i was as glad as a person is when he is scalped .
well , one must make the best of things , and not waste time with useless fretting , but get down to business and see what can be done .
in all lies there is wheat among the chaff ; i must get at the wheat in this case : so i sent for the girl and she came .
she was a comely enough creature , and soft and modest , but , if signs went for anything , she did n't know as much as a <name> 's watch .
i said : " my dear , have you been questioned as to particulars ? "
she said she had n't .
" well , i did n't expect you had , but i thought i would ask , to make sure ; it 's the way i 've been raised .
now you must n't take it <unk> if i remind you that as we do n't know you , we must go a little slow .
you may be all right , of course , and we 'll <name> that you are ; but to take it for granted is n't business .
you understand that .
i 'm obliged to ask you a few questions ; just answer up fair and square , and do n't be afraid .
where do you live , when you are at home ? "
" in the land of <unk> , fair sir . "
" land of <unk> .
i do n't remember hearing of it before .
parents living ? "
" as to that , i know not if they be yet on live , sith it is many years that i have lain shut up in the castle . "
" your name , please ? "
" i <unk> the <unk> <unk> la <unk> , an it please you . "
" do you know anybody here who can identify you ? "
" that were not likely , fair lord , i being come hither now for the first time . "
" have you brought any letters  any documents  any proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful ? "
" of a <unk> , no ; and wherefore should i ?
have i not a tongue , and can not i say all that myself ? "
" but your saying it , you know , and somebody else 's saying it , is different . "
" different ?
how might that be ?
i fear me i do not understand . "
" do n't understand ?
land of  why , you see  you see  why , great <name> , ca n't you understand a little thing like that ?
ca n't you understand the difference between your  why do you look so innocent and idiotic ! "
" i ?
in truth i know not , but an it were the <name> of god . "
" yes , yes , i reckon that 's about the size of it .
do n't mind my seeming excited ; i 'm not .
let us change the subject .
now as to this castle , with forty-five princesses in it , and three <unk> at the head of it , tell me  where is this harem ? "
" harem ? "
" the castle , you understand ; where is the castle ? "
" oh , as to that , it is great , and strong , and well <unk> , and lieth in a far country .
yes , it is many leagues . "
" how many ? "
" ah , fair sir , it were <unk> hard to tell , they are so many , and do so lap the one upon the other , and being made all in the same image and <unk> with the same color , one may not know the one league from its fellow , nor how to count them except they be taken apart , and ye wit well it were god 's work to do that , being not within man 's capacity ; for ye <name> note  " " hold on , hold on , never mind about the distance ; whereabouts does the castle lie ?
what 's the direction from here ? "
" ah , please you sir , it hath no direction from here ; by reason that the road lieth not straight , but <unk> evermore ; wherefore the direction of its place <unk> not , but is some time under the one sky and anon under another , <unk> if ye be minded that it is in the east , and <unk> <unk> , ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle , and this <name> <unk> again and yet again and still again , it <name> grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the <name> of him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it <unk> him , and if it please him not , <name> the rather that even all castles and all directions <unk> vanish out of the earth , leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant , so warning his creatures that where he <name> he <name> , and where he <name> not he  " " oh , that 's all right , that 's all right , give us a rest ; never mind about the direction , <name> the direction  i beg pardon , i beg a thousand pardons , i am not well to-day ; pay no attention when i <unk> , it is an old habit , an old , bad habit , and hard to get rid of when one 's digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born ; good land !
a man ca n't keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old .
but come  never mind about that ; let 's  have you got such a thing as a map of that region about you ?
now a good map  " " is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas , which , being boiled in oil , and an onion and salt added thereto , doth  " " what , a map ?
what are you talking about ?
do n't you know what a map is ?
there , there , never mind , do n't explain , i hate explanations ; they fog a thing up so that you ca n't tell anything about it .
run along , dear ; <unk> ; show her the way , <name> . "
oh , well , it was reasonably plain , now , why these donkeys didn't prospect these liars for details .
it may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere , but i do n't believe you could have sluiced it out with a <unk> ; nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting , even ; it was a case for dynamite .
why , she was a perfect ass ; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel .
it kind of sizes up the whole party .
and think of the simple ways of this court : this wandering wench had n't any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country .
in fact , he was glad to see her , glad to hear her tale ; with that adventure of hers to offer , she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner .
just as i was <unk> these reflections , <name> came back .
i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl ; had n't got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle .
the youth looked a little surprised , or puzzled , or something , and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for .
" why , great guns , " i said , " do n't i want to find the castle ?
and how else would i go about it ? "
" la , sweet your worship , one may lightly answer that , i <unk> .
she <name> go with thee .
they always do .
she <name> ride with thee . "
" ride with me ?
nonsense ! "
" but of a truth she <name> .
she <name> ride with thee .
thou shalt see . "
" what ?
she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me  alone  and i as good as engaged to be married ?
why , it 's scandalous .
think how it would look . "
my , the dear face that rose before me !
the boy was eager to know all about this tender matter .
i swore him to secrecy and then whispered her name  " puss <unk> . "
he looked disappointed , and said he did n't remember the countess .
how natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank .
he asked me where she lived .
" in east har  " i came to myself and stopped , a little confused ; then i said , " never mind , now ; i 'll tell you some time . "
and might he see her ?
would i let him see her some day ?
it was but a little thing to promise  thirteen hundred years or so  and he so eager ; so i said yes .
but i sighed ; i couldn't help it .
and yet there was no sense in sighing , for she wasn't born yet .
but that is the way we are made : we do n't reason , where we feel ; we just feel .
my expedition was all the talk that day and that night , and the boys were very good to me , and made much of me , and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment , and come to be as anxious for me to hive those <unk> and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract .
well , they were good children  but just children , that is all .
and they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants , and how to scoop them in ; and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments , and gave me <unk> and other rubbish to put on my wounds .
but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if i was such a wonderful <unk> as i was pretending to be , i ought not to need <unk> or instructions , or charms against enchantments , and , least of all , arms and armor , on a <unk> of any kind  even against <unk> dragons , and devils hot from perdition , let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after , these commonplace <unk> of the back settlements .
i was to have an early breakfast , and start at <name> , for that was the usual way ; but i had the demon 's own time with my armor , and this delayed me a little .
it is troublesome to get into , and there is so much detail .
first you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body , for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron ; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail  these are made of small steel links woven together , and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor , it <unk> into a pile like a peck of wet <unk> ; it is very heavy and is nearly the <unk> material in the world for a night shirt , yet plenty used it for that  tax collectors , and reformers , and one-horse kings with a defective title , and those sorts of people ; then you put on your shoes  <unk> roofed over with <unk> bands of steel  and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels .
next you buckle your <unk> on your legs , and your <unk> on your thighs ; then come your <unk> and your breastplate , and you begin to feel crowded ; then you hitch onto the breastplate the <unk> of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is <unk> out behind so you can sit down , and is n't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle , either for looks or for wear , or to wipe your hands on ; next you belt on your sword ; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms , your iron <unk> onto your hands , your iron <unk> onto your head , with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to <name> over the back of your neck  and there you are , snug as a candle in a <unk> .
this is no time to dance .
well , a man that is packed away like that is a nut that is n't worth the cracking , there is so little of the meat , when you get down to it , by comparison with the shell .
the boys helped me , or i never could have got in .
just as we finished , sir <unk> happened in , and i saw that as like as not i had n't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip .
how stately he looked ; and tall and broad and grand .
he had on his head a conical steel <unk> that only came down to his ears , and for <unk> had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose ; and all the rest of him , from neck to heel , was flexible chain mail , trousers and all .
but pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment , which of course was of chain mail , as i said , and <name> straight from his shoulders to his ankles ; and from his middle to the bottom , both before and behind , was divided , so that he could ride and let the skirts <name> down on each side .
he was going <unk> , and it was just the outfit for it , too .
i would have given a good deal for that ulster , but it was too late now to be fooling around .
the sun was just up , the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck ; so it would n't be etiquette for me to tarry .
you do n't get on your horse yourself ; no , if you tried it you would get disappointed .
they <name> you out , just as they <name> a <unk> man to the drug store , and put you on , and help get you to rights , and fix your feet in the stirrups ; and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else  like somebody that has been married on a sudden , or struck by lightning , or something like that , and has n't quite fetched around yet , and is sort of numb , and ca n't just get his bearings .
then they stood up the mast they called a spear , in its socket by my left foot , and i gripped it with my hand ; lastly they <name> my shield around my neck , and i was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea .
everybody was as good to me as they could be , and a maid of honor gave me the <unk> her own self .
there was nothing more to do now , but for that damsel to get up behind me on a <unk> , which she did , and put an arm or so around me to hold on .
and so we started , and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets .
and everybody we met , going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us , except some shabby little boys on the outskirts .
they said : " oh , what a <name> ! "
and hove clods at us .
in my experience boys are the same in all ages .
they do n't respect anything , they do n't care for anything or anybody .
they say " go up , <unk> " to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity ; they <unk> me in the holy gloom of the middle ages ; and i had seen them act the same way in <unk> administration ; i remember , because i was there and helped .
the prophet had his bears and settled with his boys ; and i wanted to get down and settle with mine , but it would n't answer , because i could n't have got up again .
i hate a country without a <name> .
chapter xii slow torture straight off , we were in the country .
it was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn .
from <unk> we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below , with streams winding through them , and island groves of trees here and there , and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black <unk> of shade ; and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills , blue with haze , stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon , with at wide intervals a dim <unk> of white or gray on a <unk> , which we knew was a castle .
we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew , and we moved like spirits , the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall ; we dreamed along through <unk> in a mist of green light that got its tint from the <unk> roof of leaves overhead , and by our feet the clearest and coldest of <unk> went <unk> and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music , comfortable to hear ; and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and <name> gloom of the forest , where furtive wild things whisked and <unk> by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was ; and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable <unk> of the woods .
and by and by out we would swing again into the glare .
about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare  it was along there somewhere , a couple of hours or so after <unk>  it was n't as pleasant as it had been .
it was beginning to get hot .
this was quite noticeable .
we had a very long pull , after that , without any shade .
now it is curious how <unk> little <unk> grow and multiply after they once get a start .
things which i did n't mind at all , at first , i began to mind now  and more and more , too , all the time .
the first ten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i did n't seem to care ; i got along , and said never mind , it is n't any matter , and dropped it out of my mind .
but now it was different ; i wanted it all the time ; it was nag , nag , nag , right along , and no rest ; i couldn't get it out of my mind ; and so at last i lost my temper and said <name> a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it .
you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet ; and some other things ; but it was that kind of a helmet that you ca n't take off by yourself .
that had n't occurred to me when i put it there ; and in fact i did n't know it .
i supposed it would be particularly convenient there .
and so now , the thought of its being there , so handy and close by , and yet not <unk> , made it all the worse and the harder to bear .
yes , the thing that you ca n't get is the thing that you want , mainly ; every one has noticed that .
well , it took my mind off from everything else ; took it clear off , and centered it in my helmet ; and mile after mile , there it stayed , imagining the handkerchief , picturing the handkerchief ; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes , and i could n't get at it .
it seems like a little thing , on paper , but it was not a little thing at all ; it was the most real kind of misery .
i would not say it if it was not so .
i made up my mind that i would <name> along a <unk> next time , let it look how it might , and people say what they would .
of course these iron <unk> of the round table would think it was scandalous , and maybe raise <unk> about it , but as for me , give me comfort first , and style afterwards .
so we jogged along , and now and then we struck a stretch of dust , and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry ; and of course i said things i ought n't to have said , i do n't deny that .
i am not better than others .
we could n't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain , not even an ogre ; and , in the mood i was in then , it was well for the ogre ; that is , an ogre with a handkerchief .
most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor ; but so i got his bandanna , he could keep his hardware , for all of me .
meantime , it was getting hotter and hotter in there .
you see , the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time .
well , when you are hot , that way , every little thing <unk> you .
when i trotted , i rattled like a crate of dishes , and that annoyed me ; and moreover i could n't seem to stand that shield <unk> and banging , now about my breast , now around my back ; and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and <unk> in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does , and as we didn't create any breeze at that gait , i was like to get fried in that stove ; and besides , the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute .
and you had to be always changing hands , and passing your spear over to the other foot , it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time .
well , you know , when you perspire that way , in rivers , there comes a time when you  when you  well , when you <unk> .
you are inside , your hands are outside ; so there you are ; nothing but iron between .
it is not a light thing , let it sound as it may .
first it is one place ; then another ; then some more ; and it goes on spreading and spreading , and at last the territory is all occupied , and nobody can imagine what you feel like , nor how unpleasant it is .
and when it had got to the worst , and it seemed to me that i could not stand anything more , a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose , and the bars were stuck and would n't work , and i could n't get the <unk> up ; and i could only shake my head , which was baking hot by this time , and the fly  well , you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty  he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip , and lip to ear , and buzz and buzz all around in there , and keep on lighting and biting , in a way that a person , already so distressed as i was , simply could not stand .
so i gave in , and got <unk> to <unk> the helmet and relieve me of it .
then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water , and i drank and then stood up , and she poured the rest down inside the armor .
one can not think how refreshing it was .
she continued to fetch and pour until i was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable .
it was good to have a rest  and peace .
but nothing is quite perfect in this life , at any time .
i had made a pipe a while back , and also some pretty fair tobacco ; not the real thing , but what some of the indians use : the inside bark of the <name> , dried .
these comforts had been in the helmet , and now i had them again , but no matches .
gradually , as the time wore along , one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding  that we were <unk> .
an armed novice can not mount his horse without help and plenty of it .
<name> was not enough ; not enough for me , anyway .
we had to wait until somebody should come along .
waiting , in silence , would have been agreeable enough , for i was full of matter for reflection , and wanted to give it a chance to work .
i wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even <unk> men could ever have learned to wear armor , considering its inconveniences ; and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what i had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives .
i wanted to think that out ; and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out ; but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances .
you couldn't think , where <name> was .
she was a quite <unk> creature and good-hearted , but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill , and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city .
if she had had a cork she would have been a comfort .
but you ca n't cork that kind ; they would die .
her clack was going all day , and you would think something would surely happen to her works , by and by ; but no , they never got out of order ; and she never had to slack up for words .
she could grind , and pump , and <unk> , and buzz by the week , and never stop to oil up or blow out .
and yet the result was just nothing but wind .
she never had any ideas , any more than a fog has .
she was a perfect <unk> ; i mean for jaw , jaw , jaw , talk , talk , talk , jabber , jabber , jabber ; but just as good as she could be .
i had n't minded her mill that morning , on account of having that hornets ' nest of other troubles ; but more than once in the afternoon i had to say : " take a rest , child ; the way you are using up all the domestic air , the kingdom <name> have to go to importing it by to-morrow , and it's a low enough treasury without that . "
chapter xiii freemen yes , it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented .
only a little while back , when i was riding and suffering , what a heaven this peace , this rest , this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this <unk> stream would have seemed , where i could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then ; yet already i was getting dissatisfied ; partly because i could not light my pipe  for , although i had long ago started a match factory , i had forgotten to bring matches with me  and partly because we had nothing to eat .
here was another illustration of the childlike <unk> of this age and people .
a man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey , and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear .
there was probably not a knight of all the round table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff .
and yet there could not be anything more sensible .
it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet , but i was interrupted in the act , and had to make an excuse and lay them aside , and a dog got them .
night approached , and with it a storm .
the darkness came on fast .
we must camp , of course .
i found a good shelter for the <unk> under a rock , and went off and found another for myself .
but i was obliged to remain in my armor , because i could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow <unk> to help , because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk .
it would not have amounted to that in reality , because i had clothes on underneath ; but the prejudices of one 's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump , and i knew that when it came to stripping off that <unk> iron petticoat i should be embarrassed .
with the storm came a change of weather ; and the stronger the wind blew , and the wilder the rain lashed around , the colder and colder it got .
pretty soon , various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm ; and while some of them behaved well enough , and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet , the majority were of a restless , uncomfortable sort , and never stayed still , but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what ; especially the ants , which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour , and are a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again .
it would be my advice to persons situated in this way , to not roll or thrash around , because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on , and this makes things worse than they were before , and of course makes you <unk> harder , too , if you can .
still , if one did not roll and thrash around he would die ; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other ; there is no real choice .
even after i was frozen solid i could still distinguish that tickling , just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment .
i said i would never wear armor after this trip .
all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living fire , as you may say , on account of that swarm of <unk> , that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head : how do people stand this miserable armor ?
how have they managed to stand it all these generations ?
how can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day ?
when the morning came at last , i was in a bad enough plight : seedy , drowsy , fagged , from want of sleep ; weary from thrashing around , famished from long fasting ; pining for a bath , and to get rid of the animals ; and crippled with rheumatism .
and how had it fared with the nobly born , the titled aristocrat , the <unk> <unk> la <unk> ?
why , she was as fresh as a squirrel ; she had slept like the dead ; and as for a bath , probably neither she nor any other <name> in the land had ever had one , and so she was not missing it .
measured by modern standards , they were merely modified savages , those people .
this <name> <name> showed no impatience to get to breakfast  and that <unk> of the savage , too .
on their journeys those britons were used to long <unk> , and knew how to bear them ; and also how to freight up against probable <unk> before starting , after the style of the indian and the <unk> .
as like as not , <name> was loaded for a <unk> stretch .
we were off before sunrise , <name> riding and i limping along behind .
in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road .
they were as humble as animals to me ; and when i proposed to breakfast with them , they were so flattered , so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that i was in <name> .
my <name> put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side ; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle  a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them , and not because it insulted or offended them , for it did n't .
and yet they were not slaves , not <unk> .
by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen .
<unk> of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree : small " independent " farmers , artisans , etc .
; which is to say , they were the nation , the actual nation ; they were about all of it that was useful , or worth saving , or really <unk> , and to <unk> them would have been to <unk> the nation and leave behind some <unk> , some refuse , in the shape of a king , nobility and gentry , idle , unproductive , acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying , and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world .
and yet , by ingenious contrivance , this gilded minority , instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged , was marching head up and banners flying , at the other end of it ; had elected itself to be the nation , and these innumerable <unk> had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth ; and not only that , but to believe it right and as it should be .
the priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of god ; and so , not reflecting upon how unlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms , and especially such poor transparent ones as this , they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet .
the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly american ear .
they were freemen , but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission ; they could not prepare their own bread , but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his <unk> , and pay roundly for the same ; they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds , nor buy a piece of somebody else 's without remembering him in cash for the privilege ; they had to harvest his grain for him gratis , and be ready to come at a moment 's notice , leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm ; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields , and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless <unk> trampled the grain around the trees ; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil ; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves , and when the swarms from my lord 's dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird , for awful would the penalty be ; when the harvest was at last gathered , then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it : first the church carted off its fat tenth , then the king 's commissioner took his twentieth , then my lord 's people made a mighty <unk> upon the remainder ; after which , the skinned <name> had <name> to bestow the remnant in his barn , in case it was worth the trouble ; there were taxes , and taxes , and taxes , and more taxes , and taxes again , and yet other taxes  upon this free and independent pauper , but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop , none upon the wasteful nobility or the <unk> church ; if the baron would sleep <unk> , the <name> must sit up all night after his day's work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet ; if the <unk> daughter  but no , that last infamy of monarchical government is <unk> ; and finally , if the <name> , grown desperate with his tortures , found his life unendurable under such conditions , and sacrificed it and fled to death for <name> and refuge , the gentle church condemned him to eternal fire , the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back , and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors .
and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop 's road three days each  gratis ; every head of a family , and every son of a family , three days each , gratis , and a day or so added for their servants .
why , it was like reading about <name> and the french , before the ever memorable and blessed revolution , which swept a thousand years of such <unk> away in one swift <unk> of blood  one : a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell .
there were two " reigns of terror , " if we would but remember it and consider it ; the one wrought murder in hot passion , the other in heartless cold blood ; the one lasted mere months , the other had lasted a thousand years ; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons , the other upon a hundred millions ; but our <unk> are all for the " horrors " of the minor terror , the momentary terror , so to speak ; whereas , what is the horror of swift death by the axe , compared with lifelong death from hunger , cold , insult , cruelty , and <unk> ?
what is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake ?
a city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over ; but all <name> could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror  that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves .
these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me , were as full of humble reverence for their king and church and nobility as their worst enemy could <name> .
there was something pitifully ludicrous about it .
i asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed , who , with a free vote in every man 's hand , would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever , whether gifted or <unk> , to the exclusion of all other families  including the <unk> 's ; and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank , and clothed on with offensive <unk> glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the <unk> families  including his own .
they all looked <unk> , and said they did n't know ; that they had never thought about it before , and it had n't ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could have a say in the government .
i said i had seen one  and that it would last until it had an established church .
again they were all <unk>  at first .
but presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again ; and state it slowly , so it could soak into his understanding .
i did it ; and after a little he had the idea , and he brought his fist down and said he did n't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way ; and that to steal from a nation its <name> and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes .
i said to myself : " this one 's a man .
if i were backed by enough of his sort , i would make a strike for the welfare of this country , and try to prove myself its <unk> citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government . "
you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one 's country , not to its institutions or its <unk> .
the country is the real thing , the substantial thing , the eternal thing ; it is the thing to watch over , and care for , and be loyal to ; institutions are extraneous , they are its mere clothing , and clothing can wear out , become ragged , cease to be comfortable , cease to protect the body from <name> , disease , and death .
to be loyal to rags , to shout for rags , to worship rags , to die for rags  that is a loyalty of <unk> , it is pure animal ; it belongs to monarchy , was invented by monarchy ; let monarchy keep it .
i was from connecticut , whose constitution declares " that all political power is inherent in the people , and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit ; and that they have at all times an undeniable and <unk> right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient . "
under that gospel , the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth 's political clothes are worn out , and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit , is <unk> ; he is a traitor .
that he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay , does not excuse him ; it is his duty to agitate anyway , and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does .
and now here i was , in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population .
for the nine hundred and ninety-four to express dissatisfaction with the <unk> system and propose to change it , would have made the whole six shudder as one man , it would have been so <unk> , so dishonorable , such putrid black treason .
so to speak , i was become a <unk> in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work , and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends .
it seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four <unk> needed was a new deal .
the thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the <unk> and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution ; but i knew that the <name> <unk> or the <unk> <name> who tries such a thing without first <unk> his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left .
i had never been accustomed to getting left , even if i do say it myself .
wherefore , the " deal " which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the <unk> sort .
so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and <unk> herd of human sheep , but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him .
after i had finished , i got him to lend me a little ink from his veins ; and with this and a <unk> i wrote on a piece of bark  put him in the <unk>  and gave it to him , and said : " take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of <unk> <name> <unk> , whom i call <name> , and he <name> understand . "
" he is a priest , then , " said the man , and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face .
" how  a priest ?
did n't i tell you that no <unk> of the church , no <unk> of pope or bishop can enter my <unk> ?
didn't i tell you that you could n't enter unless your religion , whatever it might be , was your own free property ? "
" marry , it is so , and for that i was glad ; wherefore it liked me not , and bred in me a cold doubt , to hear of this priest being there . "
" but he is n't a priest , i tell you . "
the man looked far from satisfied .
he said : " he is not a priest , and yet can read ? "
" he is not a priest and yet can read  yes , and write , too , for that matter .
i taught him myself . "
the man 's face cleared .
" and it is the first thing that you yourself <name> be taught in that factory  " " i ?
i would give blood out of my heart to know that <name> .
why , i <name> be your slave , your  " " no you wo n't , you wo n't be anybody 's slave .
take your family and go along .
your lord the bishop <name> confiscate your small property , but no matter .
<name> <name> fix you all right . "
chapter xiv " defend thee , lord " i paid three pennies for my breakfast , and a most extravagant price it was , too , seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money ; but i was feeling good by this time , and i had always been a kind of <unk> anyway ; and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing , scant as their provision was , and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet , where , these pennies being made of iron and not <unk> in weight , my <unk> 's worth was a good deal of a burden to me .
i spent money rather too freely in those days , it is true ; but one reason for it was that i had n't got the proportions of things entirely adjusted , even yet , after so long a sojourn in britain  had n't got along to where i was able to absolutely realize that a <name> in <name> 's land and a couple of dollars in connecticut were about one and the same thing : just twins , as you may say , in purchasing power .
if my start from camelot could have been delayed a very few days i could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint , and that would have pleased me ; and them , too , not less .
i had adopted the american values exclusively .
in a week or two now , cents , <unk> , <unk> , quarters , and <unk> , and also a trifle of gold , would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom , and i looked to see this new blood <unk> up its life .
the farmers were bound to throw in something , to sort of offset my liberality , whether i would or no ; so i let them give me a flint and steel ; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed <name> and me on our horse , i lit my pipe .
when the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet , all those people broke for the woods , and <name> went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud .
they thought i was one of those <unk> dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars .
i had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance .
then i told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies .
and i promised , with my hand on my heart , that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead .
the procession moved with a good deal of promptness .
there were no casualties to report , for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen .
i lost some time , now , for these big children , their fears gone , became so <unk> with wonder over my <unk> fireworks that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go .
still the delay was not wholly unproductive , for it took all that time to get <name> thoroughly wonted to the new thing , she being so close to it , you know .
it plugged up her conversation mill , too , for a considerable while , and that was a gain .
but above all other benefits <unk> , i had learned something .
i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along , now .
we tarried with a holy hermit , that night , and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon .
we were crossing a vast meadow by way of <unk> , and i was musing absently , hearing nothing , seeing nothing , when <name> suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning , with the cry : " defend thee , lord !  peril of life is toward ! "
and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood .
i looked up and saw , far off in the shade of a tree , half a dozen armed knights and their squires ; and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of <unk> for the mount .
my pipe was ready and would have been lit , if i had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without <unk> anybody .
i lit up at once , and by the time i had got a good head of reserved steam on , here they came .
all together , too ; none of those chivalrous <unk> which one reads so much about  one courtly rascal at a time , and the rest standing by to see fair play .
no , they came in a body , they came with a whirr and a rush , they came like a volley from a battery ; came with heads low down , plumes streaming out behind , lances advanced at a level .
it was a handsome sight , a beautiful sight  for a man up a tree .
i laid my <name> in rest and waited , with my heart beating , till the iron wave was just ready to break over me , then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet .
you should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter !
this was a finer sight than the other one .
but these people stopped , two or three hundred yards away , and this troubled me .
my satisfaction collapsed , and fear came ; i judged i was a lost man .
but <name> was radiant ; and was going to be eloquent  but i stopped her , and told her my magic had miscarried , somehow or other , and she must mount , with all despatch , and we must ride for life .
no , she would n't .
she said that my enchantment had disabled those knights ; they were not riding on , because they could n't ; wait , they would drop out of their saddles presently , and we would get their horses and harness .
i could not deceive such trusting simplicity , so i said it was a mistake ; that when my fireworks killed at all , they killed instantly ; no , the men would not die , there was something wrong about my apparatus , i could n't tell what ; but we must hurry and get away , for those people would attack us again , in a minute .
<name> laughed , and said : " <unk> , sir , they be not of that breed !
sir launcelot <name> give battle to dragons , and <name> abide by them , and <name> assail them again , and yet again , and still again , until he do conquer and destroy them ; and so likewise <name> sir <unk> and sir <unk> and sir <unk> , and mayhap others , but there be none else that <name> venture it , let the idle say what the idle <name> .
and , la , as to yonder base <unk> , think ye they have not their fill , but yet <name> more ? "
" well , then , what are they waiting for ?
why do n't they leave ?
nobody 's <unk> .
good land , i 'm willing to let bygones be bygones , i 'm sure . "
" leave , is it ?
oh , give thyself <unk> as to that .
they dream not of it , no , not they .
they wait to yield them . "
" come  really , is that <unk> '  as you people say ?
if they want to , why do n't they ? "
" it would like them much ; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed , ye would not hold them <unk> .
they fear to come . "
" well , then , suppose i go to them instead , and  " " ah , wit ye well they would not abide your coming .
i <name> go . "
and she did .
she was a handy person to have along on a raid .
i would have considered this a doubtful errand , myself .
i presently saw the knights riding away , and <name> coming back .
that was a relief .
i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings  i mean in the conversation ; otherwise the interview would n't have been so short .
but it turned out that she had managed the business well ; in fact , admirably .
she said that when she told those people i was the boss , it hit them where they lived : " smote them sore with fear and dread " was her word ; and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require .
so she swore them to appear at <name> 's court within two days and yield them , with horse and harness , and be my knights henceforth , and subject to my command .
how much better she managed that thing than i should have done it myself !
she was a <name> .
chapter xv <name> 's tale " and so i 'm proprietor of some knights , " said i , as we rode off .
" who would ever have supposed that i should live to list up assets of that sort .
i <name> n't know what to do with them ; unless i raffle them off .
how many of them are there , <name> ? "
" seven , please you , sir , and their squires . "
" it is a good haul .
who are they ?
where do they <name> out ? "
" where do they <name> out ? "
" yes , where do they live ? "
" ah , i understood thee not .
that <name> i tell <unk> . "
then she said musingly , and softly , turning the words daintily over her tongue : " <name> they out  <name> they out  where <name>  where do they <name> out ; eh , right so ; where do they <name> out .
of a truth the phrase hath a fair and <unk> <name> , and is prettily worded withal .
i <name> repeat it anon and anon in mine <unk> , whereby i may peradventure learn it .
where do they <name> out .
even so !
already it <unk> <unk> from my tongue , and <unk> as  " " do n't forget the cowboys , <name> . "
" cowboys ? "
" yes ; the knights , you know : you were going to tell me about them .
a while back , you remember .
<unk> speaking , game 's called . "
" game  " " yes , yes , yes !
go to the bat .
i mean , get to work on your statistics , and do n't burn so much kindling getting your fire started .
tell me about the knights . "
" i <name> well , and lightly <name> begin .
so they two departed and rode into a great forest .
and  " " great <name> ! "
you see , i recognized my mistake at once .
i had set her works a-going ; it was my own fault ; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts .
and she generally began without a preface and finished without a result .
if you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing , or answer with a couple of words , and go back and say the sentence over again .
so , interruptions only did harm ; and yet i had to interrupt , and interrupt pretty frequently , too , in order to save my life ; a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day .
" great <name> ! "
i said in my distress .
she went right back and began over again : " so they two departed and rode into a great forest .
and  " " which two ? "
" sir gawaine and sir <unk> .
and so they came to an <name> of monks , and there were well lodged .
so on the morn they heard their masses in the <name> , and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest ; then was sir gawaine ware in a valley by a turret , of twelve fair damsels , and two knights armed on great horses , and the damsels went to and fro by a tree .
and then was sir gawaine ware how there <name> a white shield on that tree , and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it , and some threw mire upon the shield  " " now , if i had n't seen the like myself in this country , <name> , i would n't believe it .
but i 've seen it , and i can just see those creatures now , parading before that shield and acting like that .
the women here do certainly act like all possessed .
yes , and i mean your best , too , society 's very choicest brands .
the humblest <unk> along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness , <name> , modesty , manners , to the highest duchess in <name> 's land . "
" <unk> ? "
" yes , but do n't you ask me to explain ; it 's a new kind of a girl ; they do n't have them here ; one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault , and he ca n't get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years , it 's such shabby mean conduct and so <unk> ; the fact is , no gentleman ever does it  though i  well , i myself , if i 've got to confess  " " peradventure she  " " never mind her ; never mind her ; i tell you i could n't ever explain her so you would understand . "
" even so be it , sith ye are so minded .
then sir gawaine and sir <unk> went and saluted them , and asked them why they did that despite to the shield .
sirs , said the damsels , we shall tell you .
there is a knight in this country that <unk> this white shield , and he is a passing good man of his hands , but he <unk> all ladies and <unk> , and therefore we do all this despite to the shield .
i <name> say you , said sir gawaine , it <unk> evil a good knight to despise all ladies and <unk> , and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause , and peradventure he <unk> in some other places ladies and <unk> , and to be loved again , and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of  " " man of prowess  yes , that is the man to please them , <name> .
man of brains  that is a thing they never think of .
<name> <unk>  <name> <unk>  <name> l. sullivan  pity but you could be here .
you would have your legs under the round table and a 'sir ' in front of your names within the twenty-four hours ; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and <unk> of the court in another twenty-four .
the fact is , it is just a sort of <unk> court of comanches , and there is n't a squaw in it who does n't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the <name> with the biggest string of scalps at his belt . "
"  and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of , said sir gawaine .
now , what is his name ?
sir , said they , his name is marhaus the king 's son of ireland . "
" son of the king of ireland , you mean ; the other form does n't mean anything .
and look out and hold on tight , now , we must jump this gully ... .
there , we are all right now .
this horse belongs in the circus ; he is born before his time . "
" i know him well , said sir <unk> , he is a passing good knight as any is on live . "
" on live .
if you 've got a fault in the world , <name> , it is that you are a shade too archaic .
but it is n't any matter . "
"  for i saw him once proved at a <unk> where many knights were gathered , and that time there might no man withstand him .
ah , said sir gawaine , damsels , <unk> ye are to blame , for it is to suppose he that <name> that shield there <name> not be long therefrom , and then may those knights match him on horseback , and that is more your worship than thus ; for i <name> abide no longer to see a knight 's shield <unk> .
and therewith sir <unk> and sir gawaine departed a little from them , and then were they ware where sir marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them .
and when the twelve damsels saw sir marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild , so that some of them fell by the way .
then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield , and said on high , sir marhaus defend thee .
and so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on marhaus , and sir marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse 's back  " " well , that is just the trouble about this state of things , it ruins so many horses . "
" that saw the other knight of the turret , and dressed him toward marhaus , and they went so eagerly together , that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down , horse and man , stark dead  " " another horse gone ; i tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up .
i do n't see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it . "
.
.
.
.
" so these two knights came together with great random  " i saw that i had been asleep and missed a chapter , but i didn't say anything .
i judged that the <name> knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time , and this turned out to be the <unk> "
 that sir <unk> smote sir marhaus that his spear <unk> in pieces on the shield , and sir marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth , and hurt sir <unk> on the left side  " " the truth is , <unk> , these <unk> are a little too simple ; the vocabulary is too limited , and so , by consequence , descriptions suffer in the matter of variety ; they run too much to level <unk> of fact , and not enough to picturesque detail ; this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous ; in fact the fights are all alike : a couple of people come together with great random  random is a good word , and so is <unk> , for that matter , and so is <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> and a hundred others , but land !
a body ought to discriminate  they come together with great random , and a spear is <unk> , and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down , horse and man , over his <unk> and brake his neck , and then the next candidate comes <unk> in , and <unk> his spear , and the other man <unk> his shield , and down he goes , horse and man , over his <unk> , and brake his neck , and then there 's another elected , and another and another and still another , till the material is all used up ; and when you come to figure up results , you ca n't tell one fight from another , nor who whipped ; and as a picture , of living , raging , roaring battle , sho !
why , it 's pale and noiseless  just ghosts scuffling in a fog .
dear me , what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle ?  the burning of rome in nero 's time , for instance ?
why , it would merely say , <unk> burned down ; no insurance ; boy <unk> a window , fireman brake his neck ! '
why , that ai n't a picture ! "
it was a good deal of a lecture , i thought , but it did n't disturb <name> , did n't turn a feather ; her steam soared steadily up again , the minute i took off the lid : " then sir marhaus turned his horse and rode toward gawaine with his spear .
and when sir gawaine saw that , he dressed his shield , and they <unk> their spears , and they came together with all the might of their horses , that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields , but sir gawaine 's spear brake  " " i knew it would . "
 " but sir marhaus 's spear held ; and therewith sir gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth  " " just so  and brake his back . "
 " and lightly sir gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword , and dressed him toward sir marhaus on foot , and therewith either came unto other eagerly , and smote together with their swords , that their shields flew in <unk> , and they bruised their <unk> and their <unk> , and wounded either other .
but sir gawaine , fro it passed nine of the clock , waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased .
all this espied sir marhaus , and had great wonder how his might increased , and so they wounded other passing sore ; and then when it was come noon  " the pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days : " <unk> haven !
ten minutes for refreshments  <unk> 'll strike the <unk> two minutes before train leaves  passengers for the shore line please take seats in the rear <unk> , this <unk> do n't go no <unk>  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , p  <unk> ! "
 " and waxed past noon and <name> toward <unk> .
sir <unk> strength <unk> and waxed passing faint , that <unk> he might <unk> any longer , and sir marhaus was then bigger and bigger  " " which strained his armor , of course ; and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that . "
 " and so , sir knight , said sir marhaus , i have well felt that ye are a passing good knight , and a marvelous man of might as ever i felt any , while it <unk> , and our quarrels are not great , and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt , for i feel you are passing feeble .
ah , said sir gawaine , gentle knight , ye say the word that i should say .
and therewith they took off their <unk> and either kissed other , and there they swore together either to love other as brethren  " but i lost the thread there , and dozed off to slumber , thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength  strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration , and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch  should not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose .
take a jackass , for instance : a jackass has that kind of strength , and puts it to a useful purpose , and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass ; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass .
it is a mixture that is always ineffectual , and should never have been attempted in the first place .
and yet , once you start a mistake , the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it .
when i came to myself again and began to listen , i perceived that i had lost another chapter , and that <unk> had wandered a long way off with her people .
" and so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones , and thereby they saw a fair stream of water ; above thereby was the head of the stream , a fair fountain , and three damsels sitting thereby .
in this country , said sir marhaus , came never knight since it was christened , but he found strange adventures  " " this is not good form , <unk> .
sir marhaus the king 's son of ireland talks like all the rest ; you ought to give him a <unk> , or at least a characteristic <unk> ; by this means one would recognize him as soon as he spoke , without his ever being named .
it is a common literary device with the great authors .
you should make him say , 'in this country , be <unk> , came never knight since it was christened , but he found strange adventures , be <unk> . '
you see how much better that sounds . "
 " came never knight but he found strange adventures , be <unk> .
of a truth it doth indeed , fair lord , albeit 't is passing hard to say , though peradventure that <name> not tarry but better speed with usage .
and then they rode to the damsels , and either saluted other , and the eldest had a <name> of gold about her head , and she was <unk> <name> of age or more  " " the damsel was ? "
" even so , dear lord  and her hair was white under the <name>  " " <unk> teeth , nine dollars a set , as like as not  the <unk> kind , that go up and down like a <unk> when you eat , and fall out when you laugh . "
" the second damsel was of thirty <name> of age , with a <unk> of gold about her head .
the third damsel was but fifteen year of age  " billows of thought came rolling over my soul , and the voice faded out of my hearing !
fifteen !
break  my heart !
oh , my lost darling !
just her age who was so gentle , and lovely , and all the world to me , and whom i shall never see again !
how the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time , a happy time , so many , many centuries hence , when i used to wake in the soft summer mornings , out of sweet dreams of her , and say " hello , central ! "
just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a " hello , <name> ! "
that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear .
she got three dollars a week , but she was worth it .
i could not follow <unk> 's further explanation of who our captured knights were , now  i mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were .
my interest was gone , my thoughts were far away , and sad .
by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale , caught here and there and now and then , i merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse , and one rode north , another east , the other south , to seek adventures , and meet again and lie , after year and day .
year and day  and without baggage .
it was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country .
the sun was now setting .
it was about three in the afternoon when <unk> had begun to tell me who the cowboys were ; so she had made pretty good progress with it  for her .
she would arrive some time or other , no doubt , but she was not a person who could be hurried .
we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground ; a huge , strong , venerable structure , whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with <name> , and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun .
it was the largest castle we had seen , and so i thought it might be the one we were after , but <name> said no .
she did not know who owned it ; she said she had passed it without calling , when she went down to camelot .
chapter xvi <name> <name> <name> if knights <unk> were to be believed , not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in .
as a matter of fact , knights <unk> were not persons to be believed  that is , measured by modern standards of veracity ; yet , measured by the standards of their own time , and scaled accordingly , you got the truth .
it was very simple : you <unk> a statement <unk> per cent ; the rest was fact .
now after making this allowance , the truth remained that if i could find out something about a castle before ringing the door-bell  i mean hailing the <unk>  it was the sensible thing to do .
so i was pleased when i saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle .
as we approached each other , i saw that he wore a plumed helmet , and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel , but bore a curious addition also  a stiff square garment like a herald 's <unk> .
however , i had to smile at my own forgetfulness when i got nearer and read this sign on his <unk> : " <unk> 's soap  all the <unk> use it . "
that was a little idea of my own , and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the <unk> and uplifting of this nation .
in the first place , it was a furtive , underhand blow at this nonsense of knight <unk> , though nobody suspected that but me .
i had started a number of these people out  the bravest knights i could get  each <unk> between <unk> bearing one device or another , and i judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous ; and then , even the <unk> ass that hadn't any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion .
secondly , these missionaries would gradually , and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm , introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility , and from them it would work down to the people , if the priests could be kept quiet .
this would undermine the church .
i mean would be a step toward that .
next , education  next , freedom  and then she would begin to crumble .
it being my conviction that any established church is an established crime , an established <unk> , i had no scruples , but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it .
why , in my own former day  in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time  there were old englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country : a " free " country with the corporation act and the test still in force in it  timbers propped against men's liberties and <unk> consciences to shore up an established <unk> with .
my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their <unk>  the showy gilding was a neat idea , i could have got the king to wear a <unk> for the sake of that barbaric splendor  they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was ; and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it , get them to try it on a dog .
the <unk> next move was to get the family together and try it on himself ; he was to stop at no experiment , however desperate , that could convince the nobility that soap was harmless ; if any final doubt remained , he must catch a hermit  the woods were full of them ; saints they called themselves , and saints they were believed to be .
they were unspeakably holy , and worked miracles , and everybody stood in awe of them .
if a hermit could survive a wash , and that failed to convince a duke , give him up , let him alone .
whenever my missionaries overcame a knight <unk> on the road they washed him , and when he got well they swore him to go and get a <unk> and <unk> soap and civilization the rest of his days .
as a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees , and the reform was steadily spreading .
my soap factory felt the strain early .
at first i had only two hands ; but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen , and running night and day ; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer , and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear , although i told him it was worse up there than anywhere else , but he said he wanted plenty of air ; and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway , and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he would n't strangle him .
there were ladies present , too , but much these people ever cared for that ; they would swear before children , if the wind was their way when the factory was going .
this missionary knight 's name was la <unk> male <unk> , and he said that this castle was the abode of <name> <name> <name> , sister of king <name> , and wife of king <unk> , monarch of a realm about as big as the district of columbia  you could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom .
" kings " and " kingdoms " were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in <name> 's time , when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they could n't stretch out without a passport .
la <unk> was much depressed , for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign .
he had not worked off a cake ; yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade , even to the washing of a hermit ; but the hermit died .
this was , indeed , a bad failure , for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr , and would take his place among the saints of the <name> calendar .
thus made he his moan , this poor sir la <unk> male <unk> , and <unk> passing sore .
and so my heart bled for him , and i was moved to comfort and stay him .
wherefore i said : " forbear to grieve , fair knight , for this is not a defeat .
we have brains , you and i ; and for such as have brains there are no defeats , but only victories .
observe how we <name> turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement ; an advertisement for our soap ; and the biggest one , to draw , that was ever thought of ; an advertisement that <name> transform that mount washington defeat into a matterhorn victory .
we <name> put on your <unk> , <unk> by the elect . '
how does that strike you ? "
" verily , it is <unk> bethought ! "
" well , a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little <unk> ad , it 's a corker . "
so the poor <unk> 's griefs vanished away .
he was a brave fellow , and had done mighty feats of arms in his time .
his chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine , which he had once made with a damsel named <unk> , who was as handy with her tongue as was <name> , though in a different way , for her tongue <unk> forth only railings and insult , whereas <name> 's music was of a <unk> sort .
i knew his story well , and so i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell .
he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it .
<name> and i discussed his story , as we rode along , and she said that la <unk> 's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip ; for the king 's fool had overthrown him on the first day , and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror , but <unk> did n't do it ; and also persisted afterward in sticking to him , after all his defeats .
but , said i , suppose the <name> should decline to accept his spoil ?
she said that that would n't answer  he must .
he could n't decline ; it would n't be regular .
i made a note of that .
if <name> 's music got to be too burdensome , some time , i would let a knight defeat me , on the chance that she would desert to him .
in due time we were challenged by the <unk> , from the castle walls , and after a parley admitted .
i have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit .
but it was not a disappointment , for i knew mrs. <name> <name> by reputation , and was not expecting anything pleasant .
she was held in awe by the whole realm , for she had made everybody believe she was a great <unk> .
all her ways were wicked , all her instincts devilish .
she was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice .
all her history was black with crime ; and among her crimes murder was common .
i was most curious to see her ; as curious as i could have been to see satan .
to my surprise she was beautiful ; black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive , age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its <unk> freshness .
she could have passed for old <unk> ' granddaughter , she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son .
as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence .
king <unk> was there , a <unk> old man with a subdued look ; and also the son , sir <unk> <name> <unk> , in whom i was , of course , interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights , and also on account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus , which <name> had been <unk> me with .
but <name> was the main attraction , the conspicuous personality here ; she was head chief of this household , that was plain .
she caused us to be seated , and then she began , with all manner of pretty graces and <unk> , to ask me questions .
dear me , it was like a bird or a flute , or something , talking .
i felt persuaded that this woman must have been <unk> , lied about .
she <unk> along , and <unk> along , and presently a handsome young <name> , clothed like the rainbow , and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave , came with something on a golden <unk> , and , kneeling to present it to her , <unk> his graces and lost his balance , and so fell lightly against her knee .
she slipped a <name> into him in as <unk> a way as another person would have <unk> a rat !
poor child !
he <unk> to the floor , twisted his silken limbs in one great straining <unk> of pain , and was dead .
out of the old king was wrung an involuntary " <unk> ! "
of compassion .
the look he got , made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more <unk> in it .
sir <unk> , at a sign from his mother , went to the anteroom and called some servants , and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk .
i saw that she was a good housekeeper , for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no <unk> in handling the body and getting it out ; when they came with fresh clean towels , she sent back for the other kind ; and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going , she indicated a crimson <unk> the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked .
it was plain to me that la <unk> male <unk> had failed to see the mistress of the house .
often , how louder and clearer than any tongue , does dumb circumstantial evidence speak .
<name> <name> <name> rippled along as musically as ever .
marvelous woman .
and what a glance she had : when it fell in reproof upon those servants , they shrunk and <unk> as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud .
i could have got the habit myself .
it was the same with that poor old <unk> <unk> ; he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension ; she could not even turn toward him but he winced .
in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about king <name> , forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother .
that one little compliment was enough .
she clouded up like storm ; she called for her guards , and said : " hale me these <unk> to the dungeons . "
that struck cold on my ears , for her dungeons had a reputation .
nothing occurred to me to say  or do .
but not so with <name> .
as the guard laid a hand upon me , she piped up with the <unk> confidence , and said : " god 's wounds , dost thou <unk> destruction , thou maniac ?
it is the boss ! "
now what a happy idea that was !  and so simple ; yet it would never have occurred to me .
i was born modest ; not all over , but in spots ; and this was one of the spots .
the effect upon madame was electrical .
it cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments ; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright .
she said : " la , but do list to thine <unk> !
as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who has vanquished <name> , and not be jesting .
by mine enchantments i foresaw your coming , and by them i knew you when you entered here .
i did but play this little jest with <name> to surprise you into some display of your <name> , as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires , consuming them to ashes on the spot , a <name> much beyond mine own ability , yet one which i have long been <unk> curious to see . "
the guards were less curious , and got out as soon as they got permission .
chapter xvii a <name> banquet madame , seeing me pacific and <unk> , no doubt judged that i was deceived by her excuse ; for her fright dissolved away , and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody , that the thing grew to be embarrassing .
however , to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers .
i <name> say this much for the nobility : that , tyrannical , murderous , <unk> , and morally rotten as they were , they were deeply and enthusiastically religious .
nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the <unk> enjoined by the church .
more than once i had seen a <name> who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage , stop to pray before cutting his throat ; more than once i had seen a <name> , after <unk> and <unk> his enemy , retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks , without even waiting to <name> the body .
there was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even <unk> <unk> , that <unk> saint , ten centuries later .
all the nobles of britain , with their families , attended divine service morning and night daily , in their private chapels , and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides .
the credit of this belonged entirely to the church .
although i was no friend to that catholic church , i was obliged to admit this .
and often , in spite of me , i found myself saying , " what would this country be without the church ? "
after prayers we had dinner in a great <unk> hall which was lighted by hundreds of <unk> , and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the <name> degree of the hosts .
at the head of the hall , on a dais , was the table of the king , <name> , and their son , <name> <unk> .
stretching down the hall from this , was the general table , on the floor .
at this , above the salt , sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families , of both sexes ,  the resident court , in effect  <unk> persons ; below the salt sat minor officers of the household , with their principal subordinates : altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting , and about as many <unk> servants standing behind their chairs , or serving in one capacity or another .
it was a very fine show .
in a gallery a band with cymbals , horns , <unk> , and other horrors , opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude <unk> or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as " in the sweet bye and bye . "
it was new , and ought to have been rehearsed a little more .
for some reason or other the <name> had the <unk> hanged , after dinner .
after this music , the priest who stood behind the <name> table said a <name> long <name> in ostensible latin .
then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts , and darted , rushed , flew , fetched and carried , and the mighty feeding began ; no words anywhere , but absorbing attention to business .
the rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison , and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery .
the havoc continued an hour and a half , and unimaginable was the destruction of <unk> .
of the chief feature of the feast  the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start  nothing was left but the semblance of a <unk> ; and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes .
with the <unk> and so on , the heavy drinking began  and the talk .
gallon after gallon of wine and <unk> disappeared , and everybody got comfortable , then happy , then <unk> joyous  both sexes ,  and by and by pretty noisy .
men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear , but nobody blushed ; and when the nub was sprung , the assemblage let go with a <unk> that shook the fortress .
ladies answered back with <unk> that would almost have made <name> <name> of <unk> or even the great <name> of england hide behind a handkerchief , but nobody hid here , but only laughed  howled , you may say .
in pretty much all of these dreadful stories , ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes , but that did n't worry the chaplain any , he had his laugh with the rest ; more than that , upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was <name> that night .
by midnight everybody was fagged out , and sore with laughing ; and , as a rule , drunk : some <unk> , some affectionately , some <unk> , some <unk> , some dead and under the table .
of the ladies , the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess , whose <unk> this was ; and indeed she was a spectacle , sure enough .
just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the regent <unk> , at the famous dinner whence she was carried , <unk> , intoxicated , and helpless , to her bed , in the lost and lamented days of the ancient regime .
suddenly , even while the priest was lifting his hands , and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing , there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired <name> , leaning upon a <unk> ; and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the <name> and cried out : " the wrath and curse of god fall upon you , woman without pity , who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick , nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him ! "
everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright , for a curse was an awful thing to those people ; but the <name> rose up majestic , with the <unk> in her eye , and flung back this ruthless command : " lay hands on her !
to the stake with her ! "
the guards left their posts to obey .
it was a shame ; it was a cruel thing to see .
what could be done ?
<name> gave me a look ; i knew she had another inspiration .
i said : " do what you choose . "
she was up and facing toward the <name> in a moment .
she indicated me , and said : " madame , he saith this may not be .
recall the commandment , or he <name> dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the <unk> fabric of a dream ! "
confound it , what a crazy contract to pledge a person to !
what if the <name>  but my consternation subsided there , and my panic passed off ; for the <name> , all in a collapse , made no show of resistance but gave a <unk> sign and sunk into her seat .
when she reached it she was sober .
so were many of the others .
the assemblage rose , <unk> ceremony to the winds , and rushed for the door like a mob ; overturning chairs , smashing crockery , tugging , struggling , shouldering , crowding  anything to get out before i should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space .
well , well , well , they were a superstitious lot .
it is all a body can do to conceive of it .
the poor <name> was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to <name> the <unk> without first consulting me .
i was very sorry for her  indeed , any one would have been , for she was really suffering ; so i was willing to do anything that was reasonable , and had no <name> to <name> things to wanton extremities .
i therefore considered the matter thoughtfully , and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that sweet bye and bye again , which they did .
then i saw that she was right , and gave her permission to <name> the whole band .
this little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the <name> .
a statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of <unk> authority upon all occasions that offer , for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates , and thus tends to undermine his strength .
a little concession , now and then , where it can do no harm , is the wiser policy .
now that the <name> was at ease in her mind once more , and <unk> happy , her wine naturally began to assert itself again , and it got a little the start of her .
i mean it set her music going  her silver <name> of a tongue .
dear me , she was a master talker .
it would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired man and very sleepy .
i wished i had gone off to bed when i had the chance .
now i must stick it out ; there was no other way .
so she <unk> along and along , in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle , until by and by there came , as if from deep down under us , a far-away sound , as of a muffled shriek  with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl .
the <name> stopped , and her eyes lighted with pleasure ; she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens .
the sound bored its way up through the stillness again .
" what is it ? "
i said .
" it is truly a stubborn soul , and <unk> long .
it is many hours now . "
" <unk> what ? "
" the rack .
come  ye shall see a blithe sight .
an he yield not his secret now , ye shall see him torn asunder . "
what a silky smooth <unk> she was ; and so composed and serene , when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that man 's pain .
conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches , we tramped along echoing corridors , and down stone stairways dank and dripping , and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night  a chill , uncanny journey and a long one , and not made the shorter or the <unk> by the <unk> 's talk , which was about this sufferer and his crime .
he had been accused by an anonymous <unk> , of having killed a stag in the <name> preserves .
i said : " anonymous testimony is n't just the right thing , your highness .
it were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser . "
" i had not thought of that , it being but of small consequence .
but an i would , i could not , for that the accuser came masked by night , and told the forester , and straightway got him hence again , and so the forester knoweth him not . "
" then is this unknown the only person who saw the stag killed ? "
" marry , no man saw the killing , but this unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay , and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester . "
" so the unknown was near the dead stag , too ?
is n't it just possible that he did the killing himself ?
his loyal zeal  in a mask  looks just a shade suspicious .
but what is your highness 's idea for racking the prisoner ?
where is the profit ? "
" he <name> not confess , else ; and then were his soul lost .
for his crime his life is forfeited by the law  and of a <unk> <name> i see that he <unk> it !  but it were peril to my own soul to let him die <unk> and <unk> .
nay , i were a fool to fling me into hell for his accommodation . "
" but , your highness , suppose he has nothing to confess ? "
" as to that , we shall see , anon .
an i rack him to death and he confess not , it <name> peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confess  ye <name> <name> that that is sooth ?
then shall i not be damned for an <unk> man that had naught to confess  wherefore , i shall be safe . "
it was the stubborn unreasoning of the time .
it was useless to argue with her .
arguments have no chance against petrified training ; they wear it as little as the waves wear a <name> .
and her training was everybody 's .
the brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective .
as we entered the <unk> i caught a picture that <name> not go from me ; i wish it would .
a native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back , with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over <unk> at either end .
there was no color in him ; his features were <unk> and set , and <unk> stood upon his forehead .
a priest bent over him on each side ; the executioner stood by ; guards were on duty ; smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls ; in a corner crouched a poor young creature , her face drawn with anguish , a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes , and in her lap lay a little child asleep .
just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn , which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman ; but i shouted , and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke .
i could not let this horror go on ; it would have killed me to see it .
i asked the <name> to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately ; and when she was going to object i spoke in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before her servants , but i must have my way ; for i was king <unk> representative , and was speaking in his name .
she saw she had to yield .
i asked her to <unk> me to these people , and then leave me .
it was not pleasant for her , but she took the pill ; and even went further than i was meaning to require .
i only wanted the backing of her own authority ; but she said : " ye <name> do in all things as this lord shall command .
it is the boss . "
it was certainly a good word to <unk> with : you could see it by the squirming of these rats .
the <name> 's guards fell into line , and she and they marched away , with their <unk> , and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating <unk> .
i had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed , and <unk> applied to his hurts , and wine given him to drink .
the woman crept near and looked on , eagerly , lovingly , but <unk> ,  like one who fears a repulse ; indeed , she tried furtively to touch the man 's forehead , and jumped back , the picture of fright , when i turned unconsciously toward her .
it was pitiful to see .
" lord , " i said , " stroke him , lass , if you want to .
do anything you 're a mind to ; do n't mind me . "
why , her eyes were as grateful as an animal 's , when you do it a kindness that it understands .
the baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the man 's in a minute and her hands <unk> his hair , and her happy tears running down .
the man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes , which was all he could do .
i judged i might clear the den , now , and i did ; cleared it of all but the family and myself .
then i said : " now , my friend , tell me your side of this matter ; i know the other side . "
the man moved his head in sign of refusal .
but the woman looked pleased  as it seemed to me  pleased with my suggestion .
i went on  " you know of me ? "
" yes .
all do , in <name> 's realms . "
" if my reputation has come to you right and straight , you should not be afraid to speak . "
the woman broke in , eagerly : " ah , fair my lord , do thou persuade him !
thou canst an thou wilt .
ah , he <unk> so ; and it is for me  for me !
and how can i bear it ?
i would i might see him die  a sweet , swift death ; oh , my <name> , i can not bear this one ! "
and she fell to sobbing and <unk> about my feet , and still imploring .
imploring what ?
the man 's death ?
i could not quite get the bearings of the thing .
but <name> interrupted her and said : " peace !
ye wit not what ye ask .
shall i starve whom i love , to win a gentle death ?
i <unk> thou <unk> me better . "
" well , " i said , " i ca n't quite make this out .
it is a puzzle .
now  " " ah , dear my lord , an ye <name> but persuade him !
consider how these his tortures wound me !
oh , and he <name> not speak !  whereas , the healing , the solace that lie in a blessed swift death  " " what are you <unk> about ?
he 's going out from here a free man and whole  he 's not going to die . "
the man 's white face lit up , and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of <name> , and cried out : " he is saved !  for it is the king 's word by the mouth of the king's servant  <name> , the king whose word is gold ! "
" well , then you do believe i can be trusted , after all .
why did n't you before ? "
" who doubted ?
not i , indeed ; and not she . "
" well , why would n't you tell me your story , then ? "
" ye had made no promise ; else had it been otherwise . "
" i see , i see ... . and yet i believe i do n't quite see , after all .
you stood the torture and refused to confess ; which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess  " " i , my lord ?
how so ?
it was i that killed the deer ! "
" you did ?
oh , dear , this is the most mixed-up business that ever  " " dear lord , i begged him on my knees to confess , but  " " you did !
it gets thicker and thicker .
what did you want him to do that for ? "
" sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain . "
" well  yes , there is reason in that .
but he did n't want the quick death . "
" he ?
why , of a <unk> he did . "
" well , then , why in the world didn't he confess ? "
" ah , sweet sir , and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter ? "
" oh , heart of gold , now i see it !
the bitter law takes the convicted man 's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans .
they could torture you to death , but without conviction or confession they could not <name> your wife and baby .
you stood by them like a man ; and you  true wife and the woman that you are  you would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and death  well , it <unk> a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice .
i 'll book you both for my colony ; you 'll like it there ; it 's a factory where i 'm going to turn groping and <unk> <unk> into men . "
chapter xviii in the <name> 's dungeons well , i arranged all that ; and i had the man sent to his home .
i had a great <name> to rack the executioner ; not because he was a good , painstaking and <unk> official ,  for surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions well  but to pay him back for wantonly <unk> and otherwise distressing that young woman .
the priests told me about this , and were generously hot to have him punished .
something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then .
i mean , episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and <unk> , but that many , even the great majority , of these that were down on the ground among the common people , were sincere and <unk> , and devoted to the <unk> of human troubles and sufferings .
well , it was a thing which could not be helped , so i seldom fretted about it , and never many minutes at a time ; it has never been my way to bother much about things which you ca n't cure .
but i did not like it , for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an established church .
we must have a religion  it goes without saying  but my idea is , to have it cut up into forty free sects , so that they <name> police each other , as had been the case in the united states in my time .
concentration of power in a political machine is bad ; and an established church is only a political machine ; it was invented for that ; it is nursed , <unk> , preserved for that ; it is an enemy to human <name> , and does no good which it could not better do in a <unk> and scattered condition .
that was n't law ; it was n't gospel : it was only an opinion  my opinion , and i was only a man , one man : so it wasn't worth any more than the pope 's  or any less , for that matter .
well , i could n't rack the executioner , neither would i overlook the just complaint of the priests .
the man must be punished somehow or other , so i degraded him from his office and made him leader of the band  the new one that was to be started .
he begged hard , and said he could n't play  a plausible excuse , but too thin ; there was n't a musician in the country that could .
the <name> was a good deal outraged , next morning when she found she was going to have neither <name> 's life nor his property .
but i told her she must bear this cross ; that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the man 's life and his property , there were <unk> circumstances , and so in <name> the king's name i had pardoned him .
the deer was <unk> the man 's fields , and he had killed it in sudden passion , and not for gain ; and he had carried it into the <name> forest in the <name> that that might make detection of the <unk> impossible .
confound her , i couldn't make her see that sudden passion is an <unk> circumstance in the killing of venison  or of a person  so i gave it up and let her <unk> it out .
i did think i was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the <name> modified that crime .
" crime ! "
she exclaimed .
" how thou <unk> !
crime , forsooth !
man , i am going to pay for him ! "
oh , it was no use to waste sense on her .
training  training is everything ; training is all there is to a person .
we speak of nature ; it is folly ; there is no such thing as nature ; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training .
we have no thoughts of our own , no opinions of our own ; they are transmitted to us , trained into us .
all that is original in us , and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us , can be covered up and hidden by the point of a <unk> needle , all the rest being atoms contributed by , and inherited from , a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the <unk> or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and <unk> developed .
and as for me , all that i think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage , this pathetic drift between the <unk> , is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life , and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly me : the rest may land in <unk> and welcome for all i care .
no , confound her , her intellect was good , she had brains enough , but her training made her an ass  that is , from a <unk> point of view .
to kill the <name> was no crime  it was her right ; and upon her right she stood , serenely and unconscious of offense .
she was a result of generations of training in the <unk> and <unk> belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one .
well , we must give even satan his due .
she deserved a compliment for one thing ; and i tried to pay it , but the words stuck in my throat .
she had a right to kill the boy , but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him .
that was law for some other people , but not for her .
she knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad , and that i ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it , but i could n't  my mouth refused .
i could n't help seeing , in my fancy , that poor old <unk> with the broken heart , and that fair young creature lying butchered , his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood .
how could she pay for him !
whom could she pay ?
and so , well knowing that this woman , trained as she had been , deserved praise , even <unk> , i was yet not able to utter it , trained as i had been .
the best i could do was to fish up a compliment from outside , so to speak  and the pity of it was , that it was true : " madame , your people <name> adore you for this . "
quite true , but i meant to <name> her for it some day if i lived .
some of those laws were too bad , altogether too bad .
a master might kill his slave for nothing  for mere spite , malice , or to pass the time  just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with his slave , that is to say , anybody .
a gentleman could kill a free commoner , and pay for him  cash or <unk> .
a <name> could kill a <name> without expense , as far as the law was concerned , but <unk> in kind were to be expected .
<unk> could kill <unk> , except the commoner and the slave ; these had no privileges .
if they killed , it was murder , and the law wouldn't stand murder .
it made short work of the <unk>  and of his family , too , if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks .
if a commoner gave a <name> even so much as a <unk> which did n't kill or even hurt , he got <unk> dose for it just the same ; they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses , and all the world came to see the show , and crack jokes , and have a good time ; and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough , and as properly <unk> , as any that have been printed by the pleasant <unk> in his chapter about the <unk> of <name> xv 's poor awkward enemy .
i had had enough of this grisly place by this time , and wanted to leave , but i could n't , because i had something on my mind that my conscience kept <unk> me about , and would n't let me forget .
if i had the <unk> of man , he would n't have any conscience .
it is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person ; and although it certainly does a great deal of good , it can not be said to pay , in the long run ; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort .
still , this is only my opinion , and i am only one man ; others , with less experience , may think differently .
they have a right to their view .
i only stand to this : i have noticed my conscience for many years , and i know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else i started with .
i suppose that in the beginning i prized it , because we prize anything that is ours ; and yet how foolish it was to think so .
if we look at it in another way , we see how absurd it is : if i had an anvil in me would i prize it ?
of course not .
and yet when you come to think , there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil  i mean for comfort .
i have noticed it a thousand times .
and you could dissolve an anvil with acids , when you could n't stand it any longer ; but there is n't any way that you can work off a conscience  at least so it <name> stay worked off ; not that i know of , anyway .
there was something i wanted to do before leaving , but it was a disagreeable matter , and i hated to go at it .
well , it bothered me all the morning .
i could have mentioned it to the old king , but what would be the use ?  he was but an extinct volcano ; he had been active in his time , but his fire was out , this good while , he was only a stately <unk> now ; gentle enough , and kindly enough for my purpose , without doubt , but not <unk> .
he was nothing , this so-called king : the <name> was the only power there .
and she was a vesuvius .
as a favor , she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you , but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city .
however , i reflected that as often as any other way , when you are expecting the worst , you get something that is not so bad , after all .
so i braced up and placed my matter before her <name> highness .
i said i had been having a general <unk> at camelot and among neighboring castles , and with her permission i would like to examine her collection , her bric-a-brac  that is to say , her prisoners .
she resisted ; but i was expecting that .
but she finally consented .
i was expecting that , too , but not so soon .
that about ended my discomfort .
she called her guards and torches , and we went down into the dungeons .
these were down under the <unk> foundations , and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock .
some of these cells had no light at all .
in one of them was a woman , in foul rags , who sat on the ground , and would not answer a question or speak a word , but only looked up at us once or twice , through a cobweb of tangled hair , as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life ; after that , she sat bowed , with her <unk> fingers idly <unk> in her lap , and gave no further sign .
this poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age , apparently ; but only apparently ; she had been there nine years , and was eighteen when she entered .
she was a commoner , and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir <unk> <unk> <unk> , a neighboring lord whose <unk> her father was , and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called <name> <unk> du <unk> , and , moreover , had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood .
the young husband had interfered at that point , believing the bride 's life in danger , and had flung the <name> out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests , in the parlor , and left him there astonished at this strange treatment , and <unk> embittered against both bride and groom .
the said lord being cramped for <unk> had asked the <name> to accommodate his two criminals , and here in her <unk> they had been ever since ; hither , indeed , they had come before their crime was an hour old , and had never seen each other since .
here they were , <unk> like toads in the same rock ; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other , yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not .
all the first years , their only question had been  asked with <unk> and tears that might have moved stones , in time , perhaps , but hearts are not stones : " is he alive ? "
" is she alive ? "
but they had never got an answer ; and at last that question was not asked any more  or any other .
i wanted to see the man , after hearing all this .
he was thirty-four years old , and looked sixty .
he sat upon a squared block of stone , with his head bent down , his <unk> resting on his knees , his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face , and he was muttering to himself .
he raised his <name> and looked us slowly over , in a listless dull way , blinking with the distress of the torchlight , then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us .
there were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present .
on his wrists and ankles were <unk> , old smooth scars , and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with <unk> and fetters attached ; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground , and was thick with rust .
chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner .
i could not rouse the man ; so i said we would take him to her , and see  to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him , once  roses , pearls , and dew made flesh , for him ; a <unk> , the <unk> of nature : with eyes like no other eyes , and voice like no other voice , and a freshness , and lithe young <name> , and beauty , that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams  as he thought  and to no other .
the sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping ; the sight of her  but it was a disappointment .
they sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each other 's faces a while , with a sort of weak animal curiosity ; then forgot each other 's presence , and dropped their eyes , and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about .
i had them taken out and sent to their friends .
the <name> did not like it much .
not that she felt any personal interest in the matter , but she thought it disrespectful to sir <unk> <unk> <unk> .
however , i assured her that if he found he could n't stand it i would fix him so that he could .
i set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful <unk> , and left only one in captivity .
he was a lord , and had killed another lord , a sort of kinsman of the <name> .
that other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him , but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat .
however , it was not for that that i left him jailed , but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages .
the <name> was bound to <name> him for killing her kinsman , but i would not allow it : it was no crime to kill an assassin .
but i said i was willing to let her <name> him for destroying the well ; so she concluded to put up with that , as it was better than nothing .
dear me , for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven men and women were shut up there !
indeed , some were there for no distinct offense at all , but only to gratify somebody 's spite ; and not always the <name> 's by any means , but a friend 's .
the newest prisoner 's crime was a mere remark which he had made .
he said he believed that men were about all alike , and one man as good as another , barring clothes .
he said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd , he could n't tell the king from a quack doctor , nor a duke from a hotel clerk .
apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training .
i set him loose and sent him to the factory .
some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice , and in each of these an <unk> had been pierced outward to the daylight , and so the captive had a thin <name> from the blessed sun for his comfort .
the case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard .
from his dusky <unk> hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the <unk> and see his own home off yonder in the valley ; and for twenty-two years he had watched it , with <unk> and longing , through that crack .
he could see the lights shine there at night , and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come out  his wife and children , some of them , no doubt , though he could not make out at that distance .
in the course of years he noted festivities there , and tried to rejoice , and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be .
and he noted funerals ; and they wrung his heart .
he could make out the coffin , but he could not determine its size , and so could not tell whether it was wife or child .
he could see the procession form , with priests and mourners , and move solemnly away , bearing the secret with them .
he had left behind him five children and a wife ; and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue , and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant .
so he had lost five of his treasures ; there must still be one remaining  one now infinitely , unspeakably precious ,  but which one ?
wife , or child ?
that was the question that tortured him , by night and by day , asleep and awake .
well , to have an interest , of some sort , and half a <name> of light , when you are in a dungeon , is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect .
this man was in pretty good condition yet .
by the time he had finished telling me his <unk> tale , i was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself , if you have got average human curiosity ; that is to say , i was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left .
so i took him over home myself ; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was , too  <unk> and <unk> of frantic <name> , and whole <unk> of happy tears ; and by <name> !
we found the aforetime young matron <unk> toward the imminent verge of her half century , and the babies all men and women , and some of them married and experimenting <unk> themselves  for not a soul of the tribe was dead !
conceive of the ingenious <unk> of that <name> : she had a special hatred for this prisoner , and she had invented all those funerals herself , to <unk> his heart with ; and the <unk> stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the <unk> a funeral short , so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing .
but for me , he never would have got out .
<name> <name> <name> hated him with her whole heart , and she never would have softened toward him .
and yet his crime was committed more in <unk> than deliberate depravity .
he had said she had red hair .
well , she had ; but that was no way to speak of it .
when red-headed people are above a certain social grade their hair is <unk> .
consider it : among these forty-seven captives there were five whose names , offenses , and dates of <unk> were no longer known !
one woman and four men  all bent , and wrinkled , and <unk> patriarchs .
they themselves had long ago forgotten these details ; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them , nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way .
the succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that god had put them there , for some wise purpose or other , and teach them that <name> , <unk> , and submission to oppression was what he loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank , had traditions about these poor old human ruins , but nothing more .
these traditions went but little way , for they concerned the length of the <unk> only , and not the names of the offenses .
and even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years : how much longer this privation has lasted was not <unk> .
the king and the <name> knew nothing about these poor creatures , except that they were heirlooms , assets inherited , along with the throne , from the former firm .
nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons , and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value , and had felt no interest in them .
i said to the <name> : " then why in the world did n't you set them free ? "
the question was a <unk> .
she did n't know why she had n't , the thing had never come up in her mind .
so here she was , <unk> the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle <unk> , without knowing it .
it seemed plain to me now , that with her training , those inherited prisoners were merely property  nothing more , nothing less .
well , when we inherit property , it does not occur to us to throw it away , even when we do not value it .
when i brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sun  previously <unk> them , in <name> for eyes so long <unk> by light  they were a spectacle to look at .
skeletons , <unk> , goblins , pathetic <unk> , every one ; <unk> possible children of monarchy by the <name> of god and the established church .
i muttered absently : " i wish i could photograph them ! "
you have seen that kind of people who <name> never let on that they do n't know the meaning of a new big word .
the more ignorant they are , the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven't shot over their heads .
the <name> was just one of that sort , and was always making the <unk> blunders by reason of it .
she hesitated a moment ; then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension , and she said she would do it for me .
i thought to myself : she ?
why what can she know about <unk> ?
but it was a poor time to be thinking .
when i looked around , she was moving on the procession with an axe !
well , she certainly was a curious one , was <name> <name> <name> .
i have seen a good many kinds of women in my time , but she laid over them all for variety .
and how sharply characteristic of her this episode was .
she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession ; but being in doubt , it was just like her to try to do it with an axe .
chapter xix <unk> as a trade <name> and i were on the road again , next morning , bright and early .
it was so good to open up one 's lungs and take in whole <unk> <unk> of the blessed god 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> air once more , after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical <unk> of that intolerable old <unk> !
i mean , for me : of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for <name> , for she had been used to high life all her days .
poor girl , her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while , and i was expecting to get the consequences .
i was right ; but she had stood by me most <unk> in the castle , and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic <unk> which were worth more for the occasion than <unk> double their size ; so i thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while , if she wanted to , and i felt not a pang when she started it up : " now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <name> of age southward  " " are you going to see if you can work up another <unk> on the trail of the cowboys , <name> ? "
" even so , fair my lord . "
" go ahead , then .
i wo n't interrupt this time , if i can help it .
begin over again ; start fair , and shake out all your reefs , and i <name> load my pipe and give good attention . "
" now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <name> of age southward .
and so they came into a deep forest , and by fortune they were <unk> , and rode along in a deep way , and at the last they came into a <unk> where abode the duke of south marches , and there they asked harbour .
and on the morn the duke sent unto sir marhaus , and bad him make him ready .
and so sir marhaus arose and armed him , and there was a mass <name> afore him , and he brake his fast , and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle , there they should do the battle .
so there was the duke already on horseback , clean armed , and his six sons by him , and every each had a spear in his hand , and so they encountered , whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him , but sir marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them .
then came the four sons by couples , and two of them brake their spears , and so did the other two .
and all this while sir marhaus touched them not .
then sir marhaus ran to the duke , and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth .
and so he served his sons .
and then sir marhaus alight down , and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him .
and then some of his sons recovered , and would have set upon sir marhaus .
then sir marhaus said to the duke , cease thy sons , or else i <name> do the uttermost to you all .
when the duke saw he might not escape the death , he cried to his sons , and charged them to yield them to sir marhaus .
and they kneeled all down and put the <unk> of their swords to the knight , and so he received them .
and then they <unk> up their father , and so by their common assent promised unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king <name> , and thereupon at <unk> after , to come he and his sons , and put them in the king 's <name> .
* [ <unk> : the story is borrowed , language and all , from the <unk> <unk>  m.t . ]
" even so standeth the history , fair sir boss .
now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to <name> 's court ! "
" why , <name> , you ca n't mean it ! "
" an i speak not sooth , let it be the worse for me . "
" well , well , well ,  now who would ever have thought it ?
one whole duke and six <unk> ; why , <name> , it was an elegant haul .
<unk> is a most <unk> trade , and it is tedious hard work , too , but i begin to see that there is money in it , after all , if you have luck .
not that i would ever engage in it as a business , for i would n't .
no sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation .
a successful whirl in the <unk> line  now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts ?
it 's just a corner in pork , that 's all , and you ca n't make anything else out of it .
you 're <name>  yes ,  suddenly <name>  for about a day , maybe a week ; then somebody corners the market on you , and down goes your <unk> ; ai n't that so , <name> ? "
" <unk> it be that my mind <unk> , <unk> simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come <unk> and <unk>  " " there 's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way , <name> , it 's so , just as i say .
i know it 's so .
and , moreover , when you come right down to the <unk> , <unk> is worse than pork ; for whatever happens , the pork 's left , and so somebody 's benefited anyway ; but when the market breaks , in a <unk> whirl , and every knight in the pool passes in his checks , what have you got for assets ?
just a <unk> of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware .
can you call those assets ?
give me pork , every time .
am i right ? "
" ah , peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters <unk> the <unk> of these but late <unk> <unk> and <unk> whereby not i alone nor you alone , but every each of us , <unk>  " " no , it 's not your head , <name> .
your head 's all right , as far as it goes , but you do n't know business ; that 's where the trouble is .
it <unk> you to argue about business , and you 're wrong to be always trying .
however , that aside , it was a good haul , anyway , and <name> breed a handsome crop of reputation in <unk> court .
and speaking of the cowboys , what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old .
now there 's <name> <name> <name> , as fresh and young as a <unk> <unk> , to all appearances , and here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with sword and <name> at his time of life , after raising such a family as he has raised .
as i understand it , sir gawaine killed seven of his sons , and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to take into camp .
and then there was that damsel of sixty <name> of age still <unk> around in her frosty bloom  how old are you , <name> ? "
it was the first time i ever struck a still place in her .
the mill had shut down for repairs , or something .
chapter xx the ogre 's castle between six and nine we made ten miles , which was plenty for a horse carrying triple  man , woman , and armor ; then we stopped for a long <unk> under some trees by a limpid <name> .
right so came by and by a knight riding ; and as he <name> near he made <unk> moan , and by the words of it i perceived that he was cursing and swearing ; yet nevertheless was i glad of his coming , for that i saw he bore a <unk> whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ : " use peterson 's <unk> <unk>  all the go . "
i was glad of his coming , for even by this token i knew him for knight of mine .
it was sir <unk> de la <unk> , a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending sir launcelot down over his <unk> once .
he was never long in a stranger 's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact .
but there was another fact of nearly the same size , which he never pushed upon anybody <unk> , and yet never withheld when asked : that was , that the reason he did n't quite succeed was , that he was interrupted and sent down over <unk> himself .
this innocent vast <unk> did not see any particular difference between the two facts .
i liked him , for he was <name> in his work , and very valuable .
and he was so fine to look at , with his broad mailed shoulders , and the grand <unk> set of his plumed head , and his big shield with its quaint device of a <unk> hand clutching a <unk> <unk> , with motto : " try <unk> . "
this was a <unk> that i was introducing .
he was <unk> , he said , and indeed he looked it ; but he would not alight .
he said he was after the <unk> man ; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew .
the <unk> referred to was sir <unk> of <unk> , a brave knight , and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once , with no less a mogul than sir <unk> himself  although not successfully .
he was of a light and laughing disposition , and to him nothing in this world was serious .
it was for this reason that i had chosen him to work up a <unk> sentiment .
there were no stoves yet , and so there could be nothing serious about <unk> .
all that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change , and have them established in <unk> toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage .
sir <unk> was very bitter , and brake out anew with <unk> .
he said he had cursed his soul to rags ; and yet he would not get down from his horse , neither would he take any rest , or listen to any comfort , until he should have found sir <unk> and settled this account .
it appeared , by what i could piece together of the <unk> fragments of his statement , that he had chanced upon sir <unk> at <name> of the morning , and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and <unk> , he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for <unk> and <unk> with characteristic zeal sir <unk> had plunged away at once upon this quest , and after three hours of awful <unk> riding had overhauled his game .
and behold , it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before !
poor old creatures , it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth .
" <unk> him , " said sir <unk> , " an i do not <unk> him an i may find him , leave it to me ; for never no knight that <unk> <unk> or aught else may do me this <unk> and bide on live , an i may find him , the which i have <unk> sworn a great oath this day . "
and with these words and others , he lightly took his spear and <unk> him thence .
in the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves , in the edge of a poor village .
he was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years ; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now ; but to him these were all strangers , his memory was gone , his mind was stagnant .
it seemed incredible that a man could <unk> half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat , but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it .
they could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood , when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother 's hands and went away into that long oblivion .
the people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his <unk> and forgotten offense ; but this old wife knew ; and so did her old child , who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name , a thought , a formless image , a tradition , all her life , and now was suddenly <unk> into actual flesh and blood and set before her face .
it was a curious situation ; yet it is not on that account that i have made room for it here , but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious .
to wit , that this dreadful matter brought from these <unk> people no outburst of rage against these <unk> .
they had been <unk> and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness .
yes , here was a curious revelation , indeed , of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery .
their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of <name> , resignation , dumb <unk> acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life .
their very imagination was dead .
when you can say that of a man , he has struck bottom , i reckon ; there is no lower deep for him .
i rather wished i had gone some other road .
this was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind .
for it could not help bringing up the <unk> fact that , all gentle cant and <unk> to the contrary notwithstanding , no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by <unk> talk and moral <unk> : it being immutable law that all revolutions that <name> succeed must begin in blood , whatever may answer afterward .
if history teaches anything , it teaches that .
what this folk needed , then , was a reign of terror and a <unk> , and i was the wrong man for them .
two days later , toward noon , <name> began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy .
she said we were approaching the <unk> castle .
i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock .
the object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind ; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment , and roused up in me a smart interest .
<unk> excitement increased every moment ; and so did mine , for that sort of thing is catching .
my heart got to thumping .
you ca n't reason with your heart ; it has its own laws , and <unk> about things which the intellect <unk> .
presently , when <name> slid from the horse , motioned me to stop , and went creeping stealthily , with her head bent nearly to her knees , toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity , the <unk> grew stronger and quicker .
and they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity ; and also while i was creeping to her side on my knees .
her eyes were burning now , as she pointed with her finger , and said in a panting whisper : " the castle !
the castle !
lo , where it looms ! "
what a welcome disappointment i experienced !
i said : " castle ?
it is nothing but a <unk> ; a <unk> with a wattled fence around it . "
she looked surprised and distressed .
the animation faded out of her face ; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent .
then : " it was not enchanted aforetime , " she said in a musing fashion , as if to herself .
" and how strange is this <name> , and how awful  that to the one perception it is enchanted and <unk> in a base and shameful aspect ; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted , hath suffered no change , but stands firm and stately still , girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers .
and god shield us , how it <unk> the heart to see again these gracious captives , and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces !
we have tarried along , and are to blame . "
i saw my cue .
the castle was enchanted to me , not to her .
it would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion , it couldn't be done ; i must just humor it .
so i said : " this is a common case  the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another .
you have heard of it before , <name> , though you have n't happened to experience it .
but no harm is done .
in fact , it is lucky the way it is .
if these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves , it would be necessary to break the enchantment , and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment .
and hazardous , too ; for in attempting a <unk> without the true key , you are liable to err , and turn your hogs into dogs , and the dogs into cats , the cats into rats , and so on , and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally , or to an <unk> gas which you ca n't follow  which , of course , amounts to the same thing .
but here , by good luck , no one 's eyes but mine are under the enchantment , and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it .
these ladies remain ladies to you , and to themselves , and to everybody else ; and at the same time they <name> suffer in no way from my delusion , for when i know that an ostensible hog is a <name> , that is enough for me , i know how to treat her . "
" thanks , oh , sweet my lord , thou <unk> like an <name> .
and i know that thou wilt deliver them , for that thou <name> minded to great deeds and <name> as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to <name> and to do , as any that is on live . "
" i <name> not leave a <name> in the sty , <name> .
are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are <unk> <unk>  " " the <unk> , are they changed also ?
it is most wonderful .
now am i fearful ; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine <unk> of stature are to thee invisible ?
ah , go warily , fair sir ; this is a mightier <unk> than i <unk> . "
" you be easy , <name> .
all i need to know is , how much of an ogre is invisible ; then i know how to locate his vitals .
do n't you be afraid , i <name> make short work of these <unk> .
stay where you are . "
i left <name> kneeling there , <unk> but plucky and hopeful , and rode down to the <unk> , and struck up a trade with the <unk> .
i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies , which was rather above latest quotations .
i was just in time ; for the church , the lord of the manor , and the rest of the <unk> would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock , leaving the <unk> very short of hogs and <name> out of princesses .
but now the tax people could be paid in cash , and there would be a stake left besides .
one of the men had ten children ; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the <unk> one for <unk> , the wife burst out upon him , and offered him a child and said : " thou beast without bowels of <name> , why leave me my child , yet <name> me of the <unk> to feed it ? "
how curious .
the same thing had happened in the wales of my day , under this same old established church , which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise .
i sent the three men away , and then opened the sty gate and beckoned <name> to come  which she did ; and not leisurely , but with the rush of a prairie fire .
and when i saw her fling herself upon those hogs , with tears of <name> running down her cheeks , and strain them to her heart , and kiss them , and caress them , and call them reverently by grand princely names , i was ashamed of her , ashamed of the human race .
we had to drive those hogs home  ten miles ; and no ladies were ever more <unk> or contrary .
they would stay in no road , no path ; they broke out through the brush on all sides , and flowed away in all directions , over rocks , and hills , and the roughest places they could find .
and they must not be struck , or roughly accosted ; <name> could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank .
the <unk> old sow of the lot had to be called my <name> , and your highness , like the rest .
it is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs , in armor .
there was one small countess , with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back , that was the devil for perversity .
she gave me a race of an hour , over all sorts of country , and then we were right where we had started from , having made not a <name> of real progress .
i seized her at last by the tail , and brought her along squealing .
when i overtook <name> she was horrified , and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train .
we got the hogs home just at dark  most of them .
the <name> <unk> de <unk> was missing , and two of her ladies in waiting : namely , miss <name> <unk> , and the <unk> <name> <unk> , the former of these two being a young black sow with a white <name> in her forehead , and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward <unk> on the starboard side  a couple of the <unk> blisters to drive that i ever saw .
also among the missing were several mere <unk>  and i wanted them to stay missing ; but no , all that <unk> had to be found ; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end .
of course , the whole drove was housed in the house , and , great guns !  well , i never saw anything like it .
nor ever heard anything like it .
and never smelt anything like it .
it was like an insurrection in a <unk> .
chapter xxi the pilgrims when i did get to bed at last i was unspeakably tired ; the stretching out , and the relaxing of the <unk> muscles , how luxurious , how delicious !
but that was as far as i could get  sleep was out of the question for the present .
the ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again , and kept me broad awake .
being awake , my thoughts were busy , of course ; and mainly they busied themselves with <unk> curious delusion .
here she was , as sane a person as the kingdom could produce ; and yet , from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman .
my land , the power of training !
of influence !
of education !
it can bring a body up to believe anything .
i had to put myself in <name> 's place to realize that she was not a lunatic .
yes , and put her in mine , to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught .
if i had told <name> i had seen a wagon , <unk> by enchantment , spin along fifty miles an hour ; had seen a man , <unk> with magic powers , get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds ; and had listened , without any <unk> help , to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away , <name> would not merely have supposed me to be crazy , she would have thought she knew it .
everybody around her believed in enchantments ; nobody had any doubts ; to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty , and its occupants into hogs , would have been the same as my doubting among connecticut people the <unk> of the telephone and its wonders ,  and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind , an unsettled reason .
yes , <name> was sane ; that must be admitted .
if i also would be sane  to <name>  i must keep my superstitions about <unk> and <unk> locomotives , balloons , and <unk> , to myself .
also , i believed that the world was not flat , and had n't pillars under it to support it , nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above ; but as i was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions , i recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter , too , if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman .
the next morning <name> assembled the swine in the dining-room and gave them their breakfast , waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island , ancient and modern , have always felt for rank , let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may .
i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my lofty official rank ; but i had n't , and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint .
<name> and i had our breakfast at the second table .
the family were not at home .
i said : " how many are in the family , <name> , and where do they keep themselves ? "
" family ? "
" yes . "
" which family , good my lord ? "
" why , this family ; your own family . "
" sooth to say , i understand you not .
i have no family . "
" no family ?
why , <name> , is n't this your home ? "
" now how indeed might that be ?
i have no home . "
" well , then , whose house is this ? "
" ah , wit you well i would tell you an i knew myself . "
" come  you do n't even know these people ?
then who invited us here ? "
" none invited us .
we but came ; that is all . "
" why , woman , this is a most extraordinary performance .
the effrontery of it is beyond admiration .
we blandly march into a man 's house , and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth , and then it turns out that we do n't even know the man 's name .
how did you ever venture to take this extravagant <name> ?
i supposed , of course , it was your home .
what <name> the man say ? "
" what <name> he say ?
forsooth what can he say but give thanks ? "
" thanks for what ? "
her face was filled with a puzzled surprise : " verily , thou <unk> mine understanding with strange words .
do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to <name> his house withal ? "
" well , no  when you come to that .
no , it 's an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this . "
" then let him be thankful , and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility ; he were a dog , else , and the heir and ancestor of dogs . "
to my mind , the situation was uncomfortable .
it might become more so .
it might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on .
so i said : " the day is wasting , <name> .
it is time to get the nobility together and be moving . "
" wherefore , fair sir and boss ? "
" we want to take them to their home , do n't we ? "
" la , but list to him !
they be of all the regions of the earth !
each must <unk> to her own home ; <unk> you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as he hath appointed that created life , and thereto death likewise with help of <name> , who by sin done through persuasion of his <unk> , she being wrought upon and <unk> by the <unk> of the great enemy of man , that serpent <unk> satan , aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by <unk> spite and envy <unk> in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature <unk> so white and pure <unk> it hove with the shining multitudes its <unk> in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that <name> estate and  " " great <name> ! "
" my lord ? "
" well , you know we have n't got time for this sort of thing .
don't you see , we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we ca n't .
we must n't talk now , we must act .
you want to be careful ; you mustn't let your mill get the start of you that way , at a time like this .
to business now  and sharp 's the word .
who is to take the aristocracy home ? "
" even their friends .
these <name> come for them from the far parts of the earth . "
this was lightning from a clear sky , for <unk> ; and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner .
she would remain to deliver the goods , of course .
" well , then , <name> , as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended , i <name> go home and report ; and if ever another one  " " i also am ready ; i <name> go with thee . "
this was recalling the pardon .
" how ?
you <name> go with me ?
why should you ? "
" <name> i be traitor to my knight , dost think ?
that were dishonor .
i may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some <unk> champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me .
i were to blame an i thought that that might ever <unk> . "
" elected for the long term , " i sighed to myself .
" i may as well make the best of it . "
so then i spoke up and said : " all right ; let us make a start . "
while she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork , i gave that whole peerage away to the servants .
and i asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and <unk> ; but they considered that that would be hardly worth while , and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom , and therefore likely to make talk .
a departure from custom  that settled it ; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that .
the servants said they would follow the fashion , a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance ; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls , and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible .
it was a kind of satire on nature : it was the scientific method , the <unk> method ; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record ; and the <unk> could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years .
the first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims .
it was not going our way , but we joined it , nevertheless ; for it was hourly being borne in upon me now , that if i would govern this country wisely , i must be posted in the details of its life , and not at second hand , but by personal observation and scrutiny .
this company of pilgrims resembled chaucer 's in this : that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show , and a corresponding variety of costume .
there were young men and old men , young women and old women , lively folk and grave folk .
they rode upon mules and horses , and there was not a <unk> in the party ; for this specialty was to remain unknown in england for nine hundred years yet .
it was a pleasant , friendly , sociable herd ; pious , happy , <name> and full of unconscious <unk> and innocent <unk> .
what they regarded as the <name> tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best english society twelve centuries later .
practical jokes worthy of the english wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line , and compelled the <unk> applause ; and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other , you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along ; and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake .
<name> knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage , and she posted me .
she said : " they journey to the valley of holiness , for to be blessed of the <unk> hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from sin . "
" where is this watering place ? "
" it lieth a <unk> journey hence , by the borders of the land that <unk> the cuckoo kingdom . "
" tell me about it .
is it a celebrated place ? "
" oh , of a truth , yes .
there be none more so .
of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks .
belike were none in the world more holy than these ; for they gave themselves to study of pious books , and spoke not the one to the other , or indeed to any , and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto , and slept hard , and prayed much , and washed never ; also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay .
right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy <unk> , and visited by <name> and poor , and <unk> . "
" proceed . "
" but always there was lack of water there .
whereas , upon a time , the holy abbot prayed , and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place .
now were the fickle monks tempted of the fiend , and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by <unk> and <unk> that he would construct a bath ; and when he was become <unk> and might not resist more , he said have ye your <name> , then , and granted that they asked .
now <name> thou what 't is to forsake the ways of purity the which he <unk> , and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense .
these monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow ; and lo , in that moment his sign appeared , in miraculous rebuke !
for his insulted waters ceased to flow , and utterly vanished away . "
" they fared mildly , <name> , considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country . "
" belike ; but it was their first sin ; and they had been of perfect life for long , and differing in naught from the angels .
prayers , tears , <unk> of the flesh , all was vain to beguile that water to flow again .
even processions ; even <unk> ; even <unk> candles to the virgin , did fail every each of them ; and all in the land did <name> . "
" how odd to find that even this industry has its financial <unk> , and at times sees its <unk> and greenbacks <unk> to zero , and everything come to a standstill .
go on , <name> . "
" and so upon a time , after year and day , the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath .
and behold , his anger was in that moment appeased , and the waters gushed richly forth again , and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure . "
" then i take it nobody has washed since . "
" he that would essay it could have his halter free ; yes , and swiftly would he need it , too . "
" the community has prospered since ? "
" even from that very day .
the fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands .
from every land came monks to join ; they came even as the fishes come , in shoals ; and the monastery added building to building , and yet others to these , and so spread wide its arms and took them in .
and nuns came , also ; and more again , and yet more ; and built over against the monastery on the <name> side of the vale , and added building to building , until mighty was that nunnery .
and these were friendly unto those , and they joined their loving labors together , and together they built a fair great <unk> asylum midway of the valley between . "
" you spoke of some hermits , <name> . "
" these have gathered there from the ends of the earth .
a hermit <unk> best where there be multitudes of pilgrims .
ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting .
if any shall mention a hermit of a kind he <unk> new and not to be found but in some far strange land , let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that valley of holiness , and whatsoever be his breed , it <unk> not , he shall find a sample of it there . "
i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored face , purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact ; but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up , in the immemorial way , to that same old anecdote  the one sir <unk> told me , what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it .
i excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession , sad at heart , willing to go hence from this troubled life , this vale of tears , this brief day of broken rest , of cloud and storm , of weary struggle and monotonous defeat ; and yet shrinking from the change , as remembering how long eternity is , and how many have <unk> thither who know that anecdote .
early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims ; but in this one was no merriment , no jokes , no laughter , no playful ways , nor any happy <unk> , whether of youth or age .
yet both were here , both age and youth ; gray old men and women , strong men and women of middle age , young husbands , young wives , little boys and girls , and three babies at the breast .
even the children were <unk> ; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down , and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair .
they were slaves .
chains led from their fettered feet and their <unk> hands to a <unk> belt about their waists ; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart , by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line .
they were on foot , and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days , upon the cheapest odds and ends of food , and stingy rations of that .
they had slept in these chains every night , bundled together like swine .
they had upon their bodies some poor rags , but they could not be said to be clothed .
their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were <unk> and <unk> .
their naked feet were torn , and none walked without a limp .
originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates , but about half had been sold on the trip .
the trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end .
with this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain , and straightened them up .
he did not speak ; the whip conveyed his <name> without that .
none of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by ; they showed no consciousness of our presence .
and they made no sound but one ; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file , as forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison .
the file moved in a cloud of its own making .
all these faces were gray with a coating of dust .
one has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses , and has written his idle thought in it with his finger .
i was reminded of this when i noticed the faces of some of those women , young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom , how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces , plain to see , and lord , how plain to read !
for it was the track of tears .
one of these young mothers was but a girl , and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing , and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child , a breast that ought not to know trouble yet , but only the gladness of the morning of life ; and no doubt  she reeled just then , giddy with fatigue , and down came the lash and flicked a <unk> of skin from her naked shoulder .
it stung me as if i had been hit instead .
the master halted the file and jumped from his horse .
he stormed and swore at this girl , and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness , and as this was the last chance he should have , he would settle the account now .
she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg , and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror , but the master gave no attention .
he snatched the child from her , and then made the <unk> who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body ; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed , she shrieking and struggling the while piteously .
one of the men who was holding her turned away his face , and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged .
all our pilgrims looked on and commented  on the expert way in which the whip was handled .
they were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment .
this was what slavery could do , in the way of <unk> what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling ; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people , and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that .
i wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free , but that would not do .
i must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the country 's laws and the citizen 's rights <unk> .
if i lived and prospered i would be the death of slavery , that i was resolved upon ; but i would try to fix it so that when i became its executioner it should be by command of the nation .
just here was the wayside shop of a smith ; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back , <unk> here where her irons could be taken off .
they were removed ; then there was a <unk> between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith .
the moment the girl was delivered from her irons , she flung herself , all tears and frantic <unk> , into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped .
he strained her to his breast , and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses , and washed them with the rain of his tears .
i suspected .
i inquired .
yes , i was right ; it was husband and wife .
they had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away , and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight ; and even after that , we could still make out the fading <unk> of those receding shrieks .
and the husband and father , with his wife and child gone , never to be seen by him again in life ?  well , the look of him one might not bear at all , and so i turned away ; but i knew i should never get his picture out of my mind again , and there it is to this day , to wring my <unk> whenever i think of it .
we put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall , and when i rose next morning and looked abroad , i was ware where a knight came riding in the golden <name> of the new day , and recognized him for knight of mine  sir <unk> <name> cure hardy .
he was in the gentlemen 's furnishing line , and his <unk> specialty was plug hats .
he was clothed all in steel , in the <unk> armor of the time  up to where his helmet ought to have been ; but he had n't any helmet , he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat , and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see .
it was another of my <unk> schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd .
sir <unk> 's saddle was <name> about with leather hat boxes , and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it .
i dressed and ran down to welcome sir <unk> and get his news .
" how is trade ? "
i asked .
" ye <name> note that i have but these four left ; yet were they sixteen <unk> i got me from camelot . "
" why , you have certainly done nobly , sir <unk> .
where have you been <unk> of late ? "
" i am but now come from the valley of holiness , please you sir . "
" i am pointed for that place myself .
is there anything stirring in the <unk> , more than common ? "
" by the mass ye may not question it ! ... .
give him good feed , boy , and stint it not , an thou <unk> thy crown ; so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as i bid ... . sir , it is <unk> news i bring , and  be these pilgrims ?
then ye may not do better , good folk , than gather and hear the tale i have to tell , sith it <unk> you , <unk> as ye go to find that ye <name> not find , and seek that ye <name> seek in vain , my life being hostage for my word , and my word and message being these , namely : that a <unk> has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years , which was the first and last time that that said misfortune <unk> the holy valley in that form by commandment of the most high <unk> by reasons just and causes <unk> contributing , wherein the matter  " " the miraculous <unk> hath ceased to flow ! "
this shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once .
" ye say well , good people .
i was <unk> to it , even when ye spake . "
" has somebody been washing again ? "
" nay , it is suspected , but none believe it .
it is thought to be some other sin , but none wit what . "
" how are they feeling about the calamity ? "
" none may describe it in words .
the <unk> is these nine days dry .
the prayers that did begin then , and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes , and the holy processions , none of these have ceased nor night nor day ; and so the monks and the nuns and the <unk> be all exhausted , and do <name> up prayers writ upon parchment , sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice .
and at last they sent for thee , sir boss , to try magic and enchantment ; and if you could not come , then was the messenger to fetch <name> , and he is there these three days now , and saith he <name> fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it ; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his <unk> to <unk> them hither and help , but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet , even so much as might <unk> as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he <unk> betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task ; and if ye  " breakfast was ready .
as soon as it was over i showed to sir <unk> these words which i had written on the inside of his hat : " chemical department , laboratory extension , section g. <unk> .
send two of first size , two of no .
3 , and six of no .
4 , together with the proper <unk> details  and two of my trained assistants . "
and i said : " now get you to camelot as fast as you can fly , brave knight , and show the writing to <name> , and tell him to have these required matters in the valley of holiness with all possible dispatch . "
" i <name> well , sir boss , " and he was off .
chapter xxii the holy fountain the pilgrims were human beings .
otherwise they would have acted differently .
they had come a long and difficult journey , and now when the journey was nearly finished , and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist , they did n't do as horses or cats or <unk> would probably have done  turn back and get at something profitable  no , anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain , they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be .
there is no accounting for human beings .
we made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness , and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features .
that is , its large features .
these were the three masses of buildings .
they were distant and isolated <unk> shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert  and was .
such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death .
but there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its <unk> ; this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze , and so faintly , so softly , that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits .
we reached the monastery before dark , and there the males were given lodging , but the women were sent over to the nunnery .
the bells were close at hand now , and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom .
a superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face .
everywhere , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> appeared , flitted about and disappeared , noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream , and as uncanny .
the old abbot 's <name> to see me was pathetic .
even to tears ; but he did the shedding himself .
he said : " delay not , son , but get to thy saving work .
an we bring not the water back again , and soon , we are ruined , and the good work of two hundred years must end .
and see thou do it with enchantments that be holy , for the church <name> not endure that work in her cause be done by devil 's magic . "
" when i work , father , be sure there <name> be no devil 's work connected with it .
i shall use no arts that come of the devil , and no elements not created by the hand of god .
but is <name> working strictly on pious lines ? "
" ah , he said he would , my son , he said he would , and took oath to make his promise good . "
" well , in that case , let him proceed . "
" but surely you <name> not sit idle by , but help ? "
" it <name> not answer to mix methods , father ; neither would it be professional courtesy .
two of a trade must not <unk> each other .
we might as well cut rates and be done with it ; it would arrive at that in the end .
<name> has the contract ; no other magician can touch it till he throws it up . "
" but i <name> take it from him ; it is a terrible emergency and the act is thereby justified .
and if it were not so , who <name> give law to the church ?
the church giveth law to all ; and what she wills to do , that she may do , hurt whom it may .
i <name> take it from him ; you shall begin upon the moment . "
" it may not be , father .
no doubt , as you say , where power is supreme , one can do as one likes and suffer no injury ; but we poor magicians are not so situated .
<name> is a very good magician in a small way , and has quite a neat provincial reputation .
he is struggling along , doing the best he can , and it would not be etiquette for me to take his job until he himself <unk> it . "
the abbot 's face lighted .
" ah , that is simple .
there are ways to persuade him to abandon it . "
" <unk> , father , it <unk> not , as these people say .
if he were persuaded against his <name> , he would load that well with a malicious enchantment which would balk me until i found out its secret .
it might take a month .
i could set up a little enchantment of mine which i call the telephone , and he could not find out its secret in a hundred years .
yes , you perceive , he might block me for a month .
would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this ? "
" a month !
the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder .
have it thy way , my son .
but my heart is heavy with this disappointment .
leave me , and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting , even as i have done these ten long days , <unk> thus the thing that is called rest , the prone body making outward sign of repose where inwardly is none . "
of course , it would have been best , all round , for <name> to <unk> etiquette and quit and call it half a day , since he would never be able to start that water , for he was a true magician of the time ; which is to say , the big miracles , the ones that gave him his reputation , always had the luck to be performed when nobody but <name> was present ; he could n't start this well with all this crowd around to see ; a crowd was as bad for a magician 's miracle in that day as it was for a <unk> 's miracle in mine ; there was sure to be some <unk> on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything .
but i did not want <name> to retire from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively myself ; and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot , and that would take two or three days .
my presence gave the monks <name> , and cheered them up a good deal ; insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days .
as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food , their spirits began to rise fast ; when the <unk> began to go round they rose faster .
by the time everybody was <unk> over , the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it ; so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line .
matters got to be very jolly .
good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter ; and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells .
at last i ventured a story myself ; and vast was the success of it .
not right off , of course , for the native of those islands does not , as a rule , dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing ; but the fifth time i told it , they began to crack in places ; the eight time i told it , they began to crumble ; at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks ; and at the fifteenth they disintegrated , and i got a broom and swept them up .
this language is <unk> .
those islanders  well , they are slow pay at first , in the matter of return for your investment of effort , but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast .
i was at the well next day <unk> .
<name> was there , enchanting away like a beaver , but not raising the moisture .
he was not in a pleasant humor ; and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too <unk> for a novice he <unk> his tongue and cursed like a bishop  french bishop of the regency days , i mean .
matters were about as i expected to find them .
the " fountain " was an ordinary well , it had been dug in the ordinary way , and stoned up in the ordinary way .
there was no miracle about it .
even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous ; i could have told it myself , with one hand tied behind me .
the well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a <unk> chapel , whose walls were <name> with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good ; pictures historically <unk> of <unk> miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking .
that is , nobody but angels ; they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the fore  so as to get put in the picture , perhaps .
angels are as fond of that as a fire company ; look at the old masters .
the <unk> was dimly lighted by lamps ; the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks , and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone <unk> outside in the chapel  when there was water to draw , i mean  and none but monks could enter the <unk> .
i entered it , for i had temporary authority to do so , by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate .
but he had n't entered it himself .
he did everything by incantations ; he never worked his intellect .
if he had stepped in there and used his eyes , instead of his disordered mind , he could have cured the well by natural means , and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way ; but no , he was an old <unk> , a magician who believed in his own magic ; and no magician can thrive who is <unk> with a superstition like that .
i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak ; that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape .
i measured the chain  98 feet .
then i called in a couple of monks , locked the door , took a candle , and made them lower me in the bucket .
when the chain was all paid out , the candle confirmed my suspicion ; a considerable section of the wall was gone , exposing a good big fissure .
i almost regretted that my theory about the well 's trouble was correct , because i had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle .
i remembered that in <name> , many centuries later , when an oil well ceased to flow , they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo .
if i should find this well dry and no explanation of it , i could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it .
it was my idea to appoint <name> .
however , it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb .
one can not have everything the way he would like it .
a man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment , anyway ; he ought to make up his mind to get even .
that is what i did .
i said to myself , i am in no hurry , i can wait ; that bomb <name> come good yet .
and it did , too .
when i was above ground again , i turned out the monks , and let down a <unk> ; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep , and there was forty-one feet of water in it .
i called in a monk and asked : " how deep is the well ? "
" that , sir , i wit not , having never been told . "
" how does the water usually stand in it ? "
" near to the top , these two centuries , as the testimony <unk> , brought down to us through our predecessors . "
it was true  as to recent times at least  for there was witness to it , and better witness than a monk ; only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use , the rest of it was <unk> and <name> .
what had happened when the well gave out that other time ?
without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak , and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by <unk> that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again .
the leak had befallen again now , and these children would have prayed , and <unk> , and <unk> their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away , and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a <unk> into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter .
old habit of mind is one of the <unk> things to get away from in the world .
it transmits itself like physical form and feature ; and for a man , in those days , to have had an idea that his ancestors had n't had , would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate .
i said to the monk : " it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well , but we <name> try , if my brother <name> fails .
brother <name> is a very passable artist , but only in the <unk> line , and he may not succeed ; in fact , is not likely to succeed .
but that should be nothing to his discredit ; the man that can do this kind of miracle knows enough to keep hotel . "
" hotel ?
i mind not to have heard  " " of hotel ?
it 's what you call <unk> .
the man that can do this miracle can keep <unk> .
i can do this miracle ; i shall do this miracle ; yet i do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain . "
" none knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood , indeed ; for it is of record that aforetime it was <unk> difficult and took a year .
<unk> , god send you good success , and to that end <name> we pray . "
as a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult .
many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising .
that monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise ; he would fill up the others .
in two days the solicitude would be booming .
on my way home at noon , i met <name> .
she had been <unk> the hermits .
i said : " i would like to do that myself .
this is wednesday .
is there a <unk> ? "
" a which , please you , sir ? "
" <unk> .
do they keep open afternoons ? "
" who ? "
" the hermits , of course . "
" keep open ? "
" yes , keep open .
is n't that plain enough ?
do they knock off at noon ? "
" knock off ? "
" knock off ?  yes , knock off .
what is the matter with knock off ?
i never saw such a <unk> ; ca n't you understand anything at all ?
in plain terms , do they shut up shop , draw the game , bank the fires  " " shut up shop , draw  " " there , never mind , let it go ; you make me tired .
you ca n't seem to understand the simplest thing . "
" i would i might please thee , sir , and it is to me dole and sorrow that i fail , albeit sith i am but a simple damsel and taught of none , being from the cradle <unk> in those deep waters of learning that do <unk> with a sovereignty him that <unk> of that most <name> sacrament , investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the humble mortal who , by bar and lack of that great consecration <unk> in his own <unk> estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief do lie <unk> and <unk> , and so , when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery , these <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , it is but by the <name> of god that he burst not for envy of the mind that can <unk> , and tongue that can deliver so great and <unk> miracles of speech , and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler mind , and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders , then if so be this <unk> is not vain but sooth and true , wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and may not lightly be <unk> , nor had been , an ye had noted this complexion of mood and mind and understood that that i would i could not , and that i could not i might not , nor yet nor might nor could , nor <unk> nor <unk> , might be by advantage turned to the desired would , and so i pray you <name> of my fault , and that ye <name> of your kindness and your <name> forgive it , good my master and most dear lord . "
i could n't make it all out  that is , the details  but i got the general idea ; and enough of it , too , to be ashamed .
it was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the <unk> infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she could n't get their drift ; and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could , too , and no fault of hers that she couldn't fetch the home plate ; and so i apologized .
then we <unk> pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together , and better friends than ever .
i was gradually coming to have a mysterious and <unk> reverence for this girl ; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those <unk> <unk> sentences of hers , it was borne in upon me that i was standing in the awful presence of the mother of the <name> language .
i was so impressed with this , that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me i unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence , and stood uncovered ; and if words had been water , i had been drowned , sure .
she had exactly the <name> way ; whatever was in her mind to be delivered , whether a mere remark , or a sermon , or a <unk> , or the history of a war , she would get it into a single sentence or die .
whenever the literary <name> dives into a sentence , that is the last you are going to see of him till he <unk> on the other side of his atlantic with his verb in his mouth .
we drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon .
it was a most strange menagerie .
the chief emulation among them seemed to be , to see which could manage to be the <unk> and most prosperous with vermin .
their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent <unk> .
it was one <unk> 's pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested ; it was another 's to <name> against a rock , all day long , conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray ; it was another 's to go naked and crawl around on all fours ; it was another 's to drag about with him , year in and year out , eighty pounds of iron ; it was another 's to never lie down when he slept , but to stand among the <unk> and snore when there were pilgrims around to look ; a woman , who had the white hair of age , and no other apparel , was black from crown to heel with forty-seven years of holy <unk> from water .
groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects , lost in reverent wonder , and envious of the <unk> sanctity which these pious <unk> had won for them from an exacting heaven .
by and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones .
he was a mighty celebrity ; his fame had penetrated all christendom ; the <name> and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence .
his stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley ; and it took all that space to hold his crowds .
his stand was a pillar sixty feet high , with a broad platform on the top of it .
he was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up there  bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet .
it was his way of praying .
i timed him with a stop watch , and he made <unk> revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds .
it seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste .
it was one of the most useful motions in mechanics , the <unk> movement ; so i made a note in my memorandum book , purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it .
i afterward carried out that scheme , and got five years ' good service out of him ; in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand first-rate <unk> shirts , which was ten a day .
i worked him sundays and all ; he was going , sundays , the same as week days , and it was no use to waste the power .
these shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materials  i furnished those myself , it would not have been right to make him do that  and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece , which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in <unk> .
they were regarded as a perfect protection against sin , and advertised as such by my knights everywhere , with the <unk> and <unk> ; insomuch that there was not a <name> or a <unk> or a dead wall in england but you could read on it at a mile distance : " buy the only genuine st. <unk> ; patronized by the nobility .
patent applied for . "
there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with .
as it extended , i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings , and a <unk> thing for <unk> and that sort , with ruffles down the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> up with a <unk> to leeward and then hauled aft with a <unk> and <unk> up with a <unk> in the standing rigging forward of the <unk> .
yes , it was a <name> .
but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg , and i found that there was something the matter with the other one ; so i stocked the business and unloaded , taking sir <unk> de <unk> into camp financially along with certain of his friends ; for the works stopped within a year , and the good saint got him to his rest .
but he had earned it .
i can say that for him .
when i saw him that first time  however , his personal condition <name> not quite bear description here .
you can read it in the lives of the saints .
* [ <unk> the details concerning the hermits , in this chapter , are from lecky  but greatly modified .
this book not being a history but only a tale , the majority of the historian 's <name> details were too strong for reproduction in it.  editor ] chapter xxiii restoration of the fountain saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while .
<name> was still burning <unk> , and pawing the air , and muttering <unk> as hard as ever , but looking pretty <unk> , for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet .
finally i said : " how does the thing promise by this time , partner ? "
" behold , i am even now busied with trial of the <unk> enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the east ; an it fail me , naught can avail .
peace , until i finish . "
he raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region , and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits , for the wind was their way , and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog .
he poured out volumes of speech to match , and <unk> his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way .
at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting , and about exhausted .
now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns , and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of <unk> , all drawn by the prodigious smoke , and all in a grand state of excitement .
the abbot inquired anxiously for results .
<name> said : " if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters , this which i have but just essayed had done it .
it has failed ; whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is a truth established ; the sign of this failure is , that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the east , and whose name none may utter and live , has laid his spell upon this well .
the mortal does not breathe , nor ever <name> , who can penetrate the secret of that spell , and without that secret none can break it .
the water <name> flow no more forever , good father .
i have done what man could .
suffer me to go . "
of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation .
he turned to me with the signs of it in his face , and said : " ye have heard him .
is it true ? "
" part of it is . "
" not all , then , not all !
what part is true ? "
" that that spirit with the russian name has put his spell upon the well . "
" god 's wounds , then are we ruined ! "
" possibly . "
" but not certainly ?
ye mean , not certainly ? "
" that is it . "
" wherefore , ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell  " " yes , when he says that , he says what is n't necessarily true .
there are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chance  that is , some small , some trifling chance  of success . "
" the conditions  " " oh , they are nothing difficult .
only these : i want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile , entirely to myself from sunset to-day until i remove the ban  and nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority . "
" are these all ? "
" yes . "
" and you have no fear to try ? "
" oh , none .
one may fail , of course ; and one may also succeed .
one can try , and i am ready to chance it .
i have my conditions ? "
" these and all others ye may name .
i <name> issue commandment to that effect . "
" wait , " said <name> , with an evil smile .
" ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirit 's name ? "
" yes , i know his name . "
" and wit you also that to know it <unk> not of itself , but ye must likewise pronounce it ?
<unk> !
knew ye that ? "
" yes , i knew that , too . "
" you had that knowledge !
<name> a fool ?
are ye minded to utter that name and die ? "
" utter it ?
why certainly .
i would utter it if it was welsh . "
" ye are even a dead man , then ; and i go to tell <name> . "
" that 's all right .
take your <unk> and get along .
the thing for you to do is to go home and work the weather , <name> w .
<name> . "
it was a home shot , and it made him wince ; for he was the worst <unk> in the kingdom .
whenever he ordered up the <unk> along the coast there was a week 's dead calm , sure , and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained <unk> .
but i kept him in the weather bureau right along , to undermine his reputation .
however , that shot raised his <unk> , and instead of starting home to report my death , he said he would remain and enjoy it .
my two experts arrived in the evening , and pretty well fagged , for they had traveled double tides .
they had <unk> along , and had brought everything i needed  tools , pump , lead pipe , greek fire , sheaves of big rockets , <name> candles , colored fire <unk> , electric apparatus , and a lot of <unk>  everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle .
they got their supper and a nap , and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite <unk> the required conditions .
we took possession of the well and its surroundings .
my boys were experts in all sorts of things , from the <unk> up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument .
an hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in <unk> fashion , and the water began to rise .
then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel , locked up the place , and went home to bed .
before the noon mass was over , we were at the well again ; for there was a deal to do yet , and i was determined to spring the miracle before midnight , for business reasons : for whereas a miracle worked for the church on a week-day is worth a good deal , it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a <name> .
in nine hours the water had risen to its customary level  that is to say , it was within twenty-three feet of the top .
we put in a little iron pump , one of the first turned out by my works near the capital ; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the <unk> and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold , where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time .
we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel , where we <unk> it down fast , poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom , then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand , all the different breeds of rockets there are ; and they made a portly and imposing sheaf , i can tell you .
we grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder , we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of the roof  blue on one corner , green on another , red on another , and purple on the last  and grounded a wire in each .
about two hundred yards off , in the flat , we built a pen of <unk> , about four feet high , and laid planks on it , and so made a platform .
we covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion , and topped it off with the abbot 's own throne .
when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race , you want to get in every detail that <name> count ; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye ; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest ; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth .
i know the value of these things , for i know human nature .
you ca n't throw too much style into a miracle .
it costs trouble , and work , and sometimes money ; but it pays in the end .
well , we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel , and then brought them under the ground to the platform , and hid the batteries there .
we put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude , and that finished the work .
my idea was , doors open at <unk> , performance to begin at <unk> sharp .
i wished i could charge admission , but of course that would n't answer .
i instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10 , before anybody was around , and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time , and make the fur fly .
then we went home to supper .
the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time ; and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley .
the lower end of the valley was become one huge camp ; we should have a good house , no question about that .
<unk> went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt , which put every pulse up to fever heat .
they gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at <unk> , up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear ; the bells would then cease from tolling , and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places .
i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot 's solemn procession hove in sight  which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence , because it was a <unk> black night and no torches permitted .
with it came <name> , and took a front seat on the platform ; he was as good as his word for once .
one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban , but they were there , just the same .
the moment the bells stopped , those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave , and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow , and then it solidified itself , and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to  well , miles .
we had a solemn <unk> , now , for about twenty minutes  a thing i had counted on for effect ; it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy .
at length , out of the silence a <name> latin chant  men 's voices  broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night , a majestic tide of <name> .
i had put that up , too , and it was one of the best effects i ever invented .
when it was finished i stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad , for two minutes , with my face uplifted  that always produces a dead hush  and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of <unk> which caused hundreds to tremble , and many women to faint : " <unk> ! "
just as i was moaning out the closing <unk> of that word , i touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare !
it was immense  that effect !
lots of people shrieked , women curled up and quit in every direction , <unk> collapsed by <unk> .
the abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers .
<name> held his grip , but he was astonished clear down to his <unk> ; he had never seen anything to begin with that , before .
now was the time to pile in the effects .
i lifted my hands and groaned out this word  as it were in agony : " <unk> ! "
 and turned on the red fire !
you should have heard that atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue !
after sixty seconds i shouted : " <unk> <unk> ! "
 and lit up the green fire !
after waiting only forty seconds this time , i spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words : " <unk> ! "
 and whirled on the purple glare !
there they were , all going at once , red , blue , green , purple !  four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft , and spreading a blinding <unk> noonday to the furthest confines of that valley .
in the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky , his <unk> stopped for the first time in twenty years .
i knew the boys were at the pump now and ready .
so i said to the abbot : " the time is come , father .
i am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve .
you want to brace up , and take hold of something . "
then i shouted to the people : " behold , in another minute the spell <name> be broken , or no mortal can break it .
if it break , all <name> know it , for you <name> see the sacred water gush from the chapel door ! "
i stood a few moments , to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who could n't hear , and so convey it to the furthest ranks , then i made a grand exhibition of extra <unk> and <unk> , and shouted : " lo , i command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now <unk> into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him , and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit , there to lie bound a thousand years .
by his own dread name i command it  <unk> ! "
then i touched off the hogshead of rockets , and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire <unk> itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush , and burst in <unk> into a storm of flashing jewels !
one mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people  then suddenly broke into a wild <unk> of <name>  for there , fair and plain in the uncanny glare , they saw the freed water leaping forth !
the old abbot could not speak a word , for tears and the <unk> in his throat ; without utterance of any sort , he folded me in his arms and mashed me .
it was more eloquent than speech .
and harder to get over , too , in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel .
you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it ; kiss it , and pet it , and <unk> it , and talk to it as if it were alive , and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings , just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost , and was come home again .
yes , it was pretty to see , and made me think more of them than i had done before .
i sent <name> home on a shutter .
he had caved in and gone down like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name , and had never come to since .
he never had heard that name before ,  neither had i  but to him it was the right one .
any jumble would have been the right one .
he admitted , afterward , that that spirit 's own mother could not have pronounced that name better than i did .
he never could understand how i survived it , and i did n't tell him .
it is only young magicians that give away a secret like that .
<name> spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it .
but he did n't arrive .
when i started to the chapel , the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me , as if i had been some kind of a superior being  and i was .
i was aware of that .
i took along a night shift of monks , and taught them the mystery of the pump , and set them to work , for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night , consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it .
to those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself , and they were full of wonder over it ; and of admiration , too , of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance .
it was a great night , an immense night .
there was reputation in it .
i could hardly get to sleep for <unk> over it .
chapter xxiv a rival magician my influence in the valley of holiness was something prodigious now .
it seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account .
the thought came to me the next morning , and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in .
according to history , the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash .
it might be that there was a <unk> of this <unk> still remaining .
so i sounded a brother : " would n't you like a bath ? "
he shuddered at the thought  the thought of the peril of it to the well  but he said with feeling : " one needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy .
would god i might wash me !
but it may not be , fair sir , tempt me not ; it is forbidden . "
and then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that i was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed , if it sized up my whole influence and <unk> the pile .
so i went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this brother .
he <unk> at the idea  i do n't mean that you could see him <unk> , for of course you could n't see it without you scraped him , and i did n't care enough about it to scrape him , but i knew the <unk> was there , just the same , and within a <unk> 's thickness of the surface , too  <unk> , and trembled .
he said : " ah , son , ask aught else thou wilt , and it is thine , and freely granted out of a grateful heart  but this , oh , this !
would you drive away the blessed water again ? "
" no , father , i <name> not drive it away .
i have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain . "
a large interest began to show up in the old man 's face .
" my knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune , which was caused by quite another sort of sin . "
" these are brave words  but  but right welcome , if they be true . "
" they are true , indeed .
let me build the bath again , father .
let me build it again , and the fountain shall flow forever . "
" you promise this ?  you promise it ?
say the word  say you promise it ! "
" i do promise it . "
" then <name> i have the first bath myself !
go  get ye to your work .
tarry not , tarry not , but go . "
i and my boys were at work , straight off .
the ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery , not a stone missing .
they had been left just so , all these <unk> , and avoided with a pious fear , as things accursed .
in two days we had it all done and the water in  a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in .
it was running water , too .
it came in , and went out , through the ancient pipes .
the old abbot kept his word , and was the first to try it .
he went down black and shaky , leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of <unk> ; but he came back white and joyful , and the game was made !
another triumph scored .
it was a good campaign that we made in that valley of holiness , and i was very well satisfied , and ready to move on now , but i struck a disappointment .
i caught a heavy cold , and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine .
of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there .
this was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me , what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace .
when at last i got out , i was a shadow .
but everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses , and these brought cheer back into my life , and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again ; so i gained fast .
<name> was worn out with nursing ; so i made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone , leaving her at the nunnery to rest up .
my idea was to disguise myself as a <name> of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot .
this would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the <unk> and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms .
there was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it .
if i went among them as a gentleman , there would be restraints and <unk> which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles , and i should get no further than the outside shell .
one morning i was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip , and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley , when i came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice , and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and <unk> .
i knew he had lately been offered a situation in the great sahara , where lions and <unk> made the <unk> peculiarly attractive and difficult , and had gone to africa to take possession , so i thought i would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation .
my surprise was great : the place was newly swept and scoured .
then there was another surprise .
back in the gloom of the cavern i heard the clink of a little <name> , and then this exclamation : " hello central !
is this you , camelot ?  behold , thou <unk> glad thy heart an thou hast <name> to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places  here standeth in the flesh his <unk> the boss , and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak ! "
now what a radical reversal of things this was ; what a <unk> together of extravagant incongruities ; what a fantastic conjunction of <unk> and <unk>  the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one , the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office !
the telephone clerk stepped into the light , and i recognized one of my young fellows .
i said : " how long has this office been established here , <unk> ? "
" but since midnight , fair sir boss , an it please you .
we saw many lights in the valley , and so judged it well to make a station , for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size . "
" quite right .
it is n't a town in the customary sense , but it's a good stand , anyway .
do you know where you are ? "
" of that i have had no time to make inquiry ; for <unk> my comradeship moved hence upon their labors , leaving me in charge , i got me to needed rest , purposing to inquire when i waked , and report the place 's name to camelot for record . "
" well , this is the valley of holiness . "
it did n't take ; i mean , he did n't start at the name , as i had supposed he would .
he merely said : " i <name> so report it . "
" why , the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here !
you did n't hear of them ? "
" ah , ye <name> remember we move by night , and avoid speech with all .
we learn naught but that we get by the telephone from camelot . "
" why they know all about this thing .
have n't they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain ? "
" oh , that ?
indeed yes .
but the name of this valley doth <unk> differ from the name of that one ; indeed to differ wider were not pos  " " what was that name , then ? "
" the valley of <unk> . "
" that explains it .
confound a telephone , anyway .
it is the very demon for conveying <unk> of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense .
but no matter , you know the name of the place now .
call up camelot . "
he did it , and had <name> sent for .
it was good to hear my boy's voice again .
it was like being home .
after some affectionate <unk> , and some account of my late illness , i said : " what is new ? "
" the king and <name> and many of the court do start even in this hour , to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored , and cleanse themselves of sin , and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true <unk> to the clouds  an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile , sith 't was i that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order . "
" does the king know the way to this place ? "
" the king ?  no , nor to any other in his realms , mayhap ; but the lads that <unk> you with your miracle <name> be his guide and lead the way , and appoint the places for rests at <unk> and sleeps at night . "
" this <name> bring them here  when ? "
" <unk> , or later , the third day . "
" anything else in the way of news ? "
" the king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him ; one regiment is complete and officered . "
" the mischief !
i wanted a main hand in that myself .
there is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army . "
" yes  and now ye <name> <name> to know there 's not so much as one west pointer in that regiment . "
" what are you talking about ?
are you in <name> ? "
" it is truly as i have said . "
" why , this makes me uneasy .
who were chosen , and what was the method ?
<unk> examination ? "
" indeed , i know naught of the method .
i but know this  these officers be all of <name> family , and are born  what is it you call it ?  <unk> . "
" there 's something wrong , <name> . "
" comfort yourself , then ; for two candidates for a <unk> do travel hence with the king  young nobles both  and if you but wait where you are you <name> hear them questioned . "
" that is news to the purpose .
i <name> get one west pointer in , anyway .
mount a man and send him to that school with a message ; let him kill horses , if necessary , but he must be there before sunset to-night and say  " " there is no need .
i have laid a ground wire to the school .
prithee let me connect you with it . "
it sounded good !
in this atmosphere of <unk> and lightning communication with distant regions , i was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation .
i realized , then , what a creepy , dull , inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years , and how i had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it .
i gave my order to the superintendent of the academy personally .
i also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches .
i was getting tired of doing without these conveniences .
i could have them now , as i wasn't going to wear armor any more at present , and therefore could get at my pockets .
when i got back to the monastery , i found a thing of interest going on .
the abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall , observing with childish wonder and <name> the performances of a new magician , a fresh arrival .
his dress was the extreme of the fantastic ; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an indian <unk> wears .
he was mowing , and mumbling , and gesticulating , and drawing <unk> figures in the air and on the floor ,  the regular thing , you know .
he was a celebrity from <name>  so he said , and that was enough .
that sort of evidence was as good as gold , and passed current everywhere .
how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this <unk> terms .
his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment ; and what he had done at any time in the past , and what he would do at any time in the future .
he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of the east was doing now ?
the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer  this reverend crowd would like to know what that monarch was at , just as this moment .
the fraud went through some more <unk> , and then made grave announcement : " the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar  one , two , three pieces , and they be all of silver . "
a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out , all around : " it is marvelous ! "
" wonderful ! "
" what study , what labor , to have acquired a so amazing power as this ! "
would they like to know what the supreme lord of <unk> was doing ?
yes .
he told them what the supreme lord of <unk> was doing .
then he told them what the sultan of egypt was at ; also what the king of the remote seas was about .
and so on and so on ; and with each new <name> the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher .
they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time ; but no , he never had to hesitate , he always knew , and always with unerring precision .
i saw that if this thing went on i should lose my supremacy , this fellow would capture my following , i should be left out in the cold .
i must put a <unk> in his wheel , and do it right away , too .
i said : " if i might ask , i should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing . "
" speak , and freely .
i <name> tell you . "
" it <name> be difficult  perhaps impossible . "
" my <name> knoweth not that word .
the more difficult it is , the more certainly <name> i reveal it to you . "
you see , i was working up the interest .
it was getting pretty high , too ; you could see that by the <unk> necks all around , and the <unk> breathing .
so now i <unk> it : " if you make no mistake  if you tell me truly what i want to know  i <name> give you two hundred silver pennies . "
" the fortune is mine !
i <name> tell you what you would know . "
" then tell me what i am doing with my right hand . "
" <unk> ! "
there was a general gasp of surprise .
it had not occurred to anybody in the crowd  that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who was n't ten thousand miles away .
the magician was hit hard ; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before , and it <unk> him ; he did n't know how to meet it .
he looked stunned , confused ; he could n't say a word .
" come , " i said , " what are you waiting for ?
is it possible you can answer up , right off , and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing , and yet ca n't tell what a person is doing who is n't three yards from you ?
persons behind me know what i am doing with my right hand  they <name> <unk> you if you tell correctly . "
he was still dumb .
" very well , i 'll tell you why you do n't speak up and tell ; it is because you do n't know .
you a magician !
good friends , this tramp is a mere fraud and liar . "
this distressed the monks and terrified them .
they were not used to hearing these awful beings called names , and they did not know what might be the consequence .
there was a dead silence now ; superstitious <unk> were in every mind .
the magician began to pull his wits together , and when he presently smiled an easy , <unk> smile , it spread a mighty relief around ; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive .
he said : " it hath struck me speechless , the frivolity of this <unk> speech .
let all know , if perchance there be any who know it not , that <unk> of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings , princes , emperors , them that be born in the purple and them only .
had ye asked me what <name> the great king is doing , it were another matter , and i had told ye ; but the doings of a subject interest me not . "
" oh , i misunderstood you .
i thought you said <unk> , ' and so i supposed <unk> ' included  well , anybody ; that is , everybody . "
" it doth  anybody that is of lofty birth ; and the better if he be <name> . "
" that , it <unk> , might well be , " said the abbot , who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster , " for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness .
our <name> the king  " " would you know of him ? "
broke in the <unk> .
" most gladly , yea , and gratefully . "
everybody was full of awe and interest again right away , the <unk> idiots .
they watched the incantations <unk> , and looked at me with a " there , now , what can you say to that ? "
air , when the announcement came : " the king is weary with the <name> , and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a <unk> sleep . "
" god 's <unk> upon him ! "
said the abbot , and crossed himself ; " may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul . "
" and so it might be , if he were sleeping , " i said , " but the king is not sleeping , the king rides . "
here was trouble again  a conflict of authority .
nobody knew which of us to believe ; i still had some reputation left .
the <unk> scorn was stirred , and he said : " lo , i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days , but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an <unk> to help . "
" you have lived in the woods , and lost much by it .
i use incantations myself , as this good brotherhood are aware  but only on occasions of moment . "
when it comes to <unk> , i reckon i know how to keep my end up .
that <unk> made this fellow squirm .
the abbot inquired after the <name> and the court , and got this information : " they be all on sleep , being overcome by fatigue , like as to the king . "
i said : " that is merely another lie .
half of them are about their amusements , the <name> and the other half are not sleeping , they ride .
now perhaps you can spread yourself a little , and tell us where the king and <name> and all that are this moment riding with them are going ? "
" they sleep now , as i said ; but on the morrow they <name> ride , for they go a journey toward the sea . "
" and where <name> they be the day after to-morrow at <unk> ? "
" far to the north of camelot , and half their journey <name> be done . "
" that is another lie , by the space of a hundred and fifty miles .
their journey <name> not be merely half done , it <name> be all done , and they <name> be here , in this valley . "
that was a <name> shot !
it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement , and it rocked the <unk> to his base .
i followed the thing right up : " if the king does not arrive , i <name> have myself ridden on a rail : if he does i <name> ride you on a rail instead . "
next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line .
i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way .
i kept these matters to myself .
the third day 's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon .
there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming ; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state ; a strange thing , truly .
only one thing could explain this : that other magician had been cutting under me , sure .
this was true .
i asked a friend of mine , a monk , about it , and he said , yes , the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all , but stay at home .
think of that !
observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country .
these people had seen me do the very <unk> bit of magic in history , and the only one within their memory that had a positive value , and yet here they were , ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere <unk> word .
however , it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all , so i went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o'clock to meet him .
and that was the sort of state he arrived in .
the abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome , and no stir of life or clang of <unk> to glad his spirit .
he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces .
the next minute the bells were <unk> furiously , and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns , who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession ; and with them went that magician  and he was on a rail , too , by the abbot 's order ; and his reputation was in the mud , and mine was in the sky again .
yes , a man can keep his <unk> current in such a country , but he ca n't sit around and do it ; he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along .
chapter xxv a <unk> examination when the king traveled for change of air , or made a progress , or visited a distant <name> whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep , part of the administration moved with him .
it was a fashion of the time .
the commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the valley , whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home .
and although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king , he kept some of his business functions going just the same .
he touched for the evil , as usual ; he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases , for he was himself chief justice of the king 's bench .
he shone very well in this latter office .
he was a wise and humane judge , and he clearly did his honest best and fairest ,  according to his lights .
that is a large reservation .
his lights  i mean his rearing  often colored his decisions .
whenever there was a dispute between a <name> or gentleman and a person of lower degree , the king 's <unk> and sympathies were for the former class always , whether he suspected it or not .
it was impossible that this should be otherwise .
the <unk> effects of slavery upon the <unk> moral perceptions are known and conceded , the world over ; and a privileged class , an aristocracy , is but a band of <unk> under another name .
this has a harsh sound , and yet should not be offensive to any  even to the <name> himself  unless the fact itself be an offense : for the statement simply <unk> a fact .
the repulsive feature of slavery is the thing , not its name .
one needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize  and in but indifferently modified measure  the very air and tone of the actual <unk> ; and behind these are the <unk> 's spirit , the <unk> 's blunted feeling .
they are the result of the same cause in both cases : the <unk> old and <unk> custom of regarding himself as a superior being .
the king 's judgments wrought frequent <unk> , but it was merely the fault of his training , his natural and unalterable sympathies .
he was as <unk> for a <unk> as would be the average mother for the position of <unk> to starving children in <unk> ; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest .
one very curious case came before the king .
a young girl , an orphan , who had a considerable estate , married a fine young fellow who had nothing .
the girl 's property was within a <unk> held by the church .
the bishop of the diocese , an arrogant <unk> of the great nobility , claimed the girl 's estate on the ground that she had married privately , and thus had cheated the church out of one of its rights as lord of the <unk>  the one heretofore referred to as <name> <unk> du <unk> .
the penalty of refusal or avoidance was <unk> .
the girl 's defense was , that the lordship of the <unk> was vested in the bishop , and the particular right here involved was not transferable , but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated ; and that an older law , of the church itself , strictly barred the bishop from exercising it .
it was a very odd case , indeed .
it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of london raised the money that built the mansion house .
a person who had not taken the sacrament according to the <unk> rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of london .
thus <unk> were <unk> ; they could not run if asked , they could not serve if elected .
the aldermen , who without any question were yankees in disguise , hit upon this neat device : they passed a by-law imposing a fine of <unk> upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff , and a fine of <unk> upon any person who , after being elected sheriff , refused to serve .
then they went to work and elected a lot of <unk> , one after another , and kept it up until they had collected <unk> in fines ; and there stands the stately mansion house to this day , to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of yankees slipped into london and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth .
the girl 's case seemed strong to me ; the bishop 's case was just as strong .
i did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole .
but he got out .
i append his decision : " truly i find small difficulty here , the matter being even a child 's affair for <unk> .
an the young bride had conveyed notice , as in duty bound , to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop , she had suffered no loss , for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him , for temporary <unk> , eligible to the exercise of his said right , and thus would she have kept all she had .
whereas , failing in her first duty , she hath by that failure failed in all ; for whoso , clinging to a rope , <unk> it above his hands , must fall ; it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound , neither any deliverance from his peril , as he shall find .
<unk> , the woman's case is rotten at the source .
it is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods , even to the last farthing that she doth possess , and be thereto <unk> in the costs .
next ! "
here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old .
poor young creatures !
they had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts .
these clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the <unk> stretch of the <unk> laws allowed to people of their degree ; and in these pretty clothes , she crying on his shoulder , and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair , they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless , <unk> , <unk> ; why , the very beggars by the <unk> were not so poor as they .
well , the king was out of the hole ; and on terms satisfactory to the church and the rest of the aristocracy , no doubt .
men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy , but the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote , brutal laws are impossible .
<name> 's people were of course poor material for a republic , because they had been <unk> so long by monarchy ; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote .
there is a phrase which has grown so common in the world 's mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning  the sense and meaning implied when it is used ; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being " capable of self-government " ; and the implied sense of it is , that there has been a nation somewhere , some time or other which wasn't capable of it  was n't as able to govern itself as some <unk> <unk> were or would be to govern it .
the master minds of all nations , in all ages , have sprung in <unk> multitude from the mass of the nation , and from the mass of the nation only  not from its privileged classes ; and so , no matter what the nation 's intellectual grade was ; whether high or low , the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor , and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself .
which is to assert an always <unk> fact : that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people ; and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades , all the way down to the lowest .
king <name> had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations .
i had not supposed he would move in the matter while i was away ; and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers ; i had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination ; and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my west pointers .
that ought to have been attended to before i left ; for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he could n't wait but must get about it at once , and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head .
i was impatient to see what this was ; and to show , too , how much more admirable was the one which i should display to the examining board .
i intimated this , gently , to the king , and it fired his curiosity .
when the board was assembled , i followed him in ; and behind us came the candidates .
one of these candidates was a bright young west pointer of mine , and with him were a couple of my west point professors .
when i saw the board , i did not know whether to cry or to laugh .
the head of it was the officer known to later centuries as <unk> <unk> !
the two other members were chiefs of <unk> in his department ; and all three were priests , of course ; all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests .
my candidate was called first , out of courtesy to me , and the head of the board opened on him with official solemnity : " name ? "
" <unk> . "
" son of ? "
" webster . "
" webster  webster .
h 'm  i  my memory <unk> to recall the name .
condition ? "
" weaver . "
" weaver !  god keep us ! "
the king was staggered , from his summit to his foundations ; one clerk fainted , and the others came near it .
the chairman pulled himself together , and said indignantly : " it is sufficient .
get you hence . "
but i appealed to the king .
i begged that my candidate might be examined .
the king was willing , but the board , who were all well-born folk , implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver 's son .
i knew they did n't know enough to examine him anyway , so i joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors .
i had had a <unk> prepared , and it was put up now , and the circus began .
it was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war , and wallow in details of battle and siege , of supply , transportation , mining and <unk> , grand tactics , big strategy and little strategy , signal service , infantry , cavalry , artillery , and all about siege guns , field guns , gatling guns , rifled guns , smooth bores , musket practice , revolver practice  and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of , you understand  and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical <unk> on the <unk> that would stump the angels themselves , and do it like nothing , too  all about <unk> , and comets , and <unk> , and constellations , and mean time , and <unk> time , and dinner time , and bedtime , and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could <name> or <unk> an enemy with and make him wish he had n't come  and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last , i was proud enough to hug him , and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified , partly drunk , and wholly caught out and snowed under .
i judged that the cake was ours , and by a large majority .
education is a great thing .
this was the same youth who had come to west point so ignorant that when i asked him , " if a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle , what ought he to do ? "
answered up naively and said : " get up and brush himself . "
one of the young nobles was called up now .
i thought i would question him a little myself .
i said : " can your lordship read ? "
his face flushed indignantly , and he fired this at me : " <unk> me for a clerk ?
i trow i am not of a blood that  " " answer the question ! "
he crowded his wrath down and made out to answer " no . "
" can you write ? "
he wanted to resent this , too , but i said : " you <name> confine yourself to the questions , and make no comments .
you are not here to air your blood or your graces , and nothing of the sort <name> be permitted .
can you write ? "
" no . "
" do you know the multiplication table ? "
" i wit not what ye refer to . "
" how much is 9 times 6 ? "
" it is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the <unk> of it hath not in my <unk> occurred , and so , not having no need to know this thing , i abide barren of the knowledge . "
" if a trade a barrel of onions to b , worth 2 pence the bushel , in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a <name> , and c kill the dog before delivery , because bitten by the same , who mistook him for d , what sum is still due to a from b , and which party pays for the dog , c or d , and who gets the money ?
if a , is the <name> sufficient , or may he claim <unk> damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog , and <unk> as earned <unk> , that is to say , <unk> ? "
" verily , in the <unk> and <unk> providence of god , who <unk> in mysterious ways his wonders to perform , have i never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and <unk> of the ducts of thought .
wherefore i beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several <unk> from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine , for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is , whereas an i tried to help i should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought . "
" what do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation ? "
" if there be such , mayhap his <name> the king did <unk> them whilst that i lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed to hear his proclamation . "
" what do you know of the science of optics ? "
" i know of governors of places , and <unk> of castles , and sheriffs of counties , and many like small offices and titles of honor , but him you call the science of optics i have not heard of before ; peradventure it is a new dignity . "
" yes , in this country . "
try to conceive of this <unk> gravely applying for an official position , of any kind under the sun !
why , he had all the <unk> of a typewriter <unk> , if you leave out the disposition to contribute <unk> <unk> of your grammar and <unk> .
it was unaccountable that he did n't attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job .
but that did n't prove that he had n't material in him for the disposition , it only proved that he was n't a typewriter <unk> yet .
after nagging him a little more , i let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out , on the line of scientific war , and found him empty , of course .
he knew somewhat about the warfare of the time  <unk> around for <unk> , and <unk> in the tournament ring , and such things  but otherwise he was empty and useless .
then we took the other young <name> in hand , and he was the first one 's twin , for ignorance and incapacity .
i delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough .
they were examined in the previous order of precedence .
" name , so please you ? "
" <unk> , son of sir <unk> , baron of barley mash . "
" grandfather ? "
" also sir <unk> , baron of barley mash . "
" great-grandfather ? "
" the same name and title . "
" <unk> ? "
" we had none , worshipful sir , the line failing before it had reached so far back . "
" it <unk> not .
it is a good four generations , and <unk> the requirements of the rule . "
" <unk> what rule ? "
i asked .
" the rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the candidate is not eligible . "
" a man not eligible for a <unk> in the army unless he can prove four generations of <name> descent ? "
" even so ; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned without that qualification . "
" oh , come , this is an astonishing thing .
what good is such a qualification as that ? "
" what good ?
it is a hardy question , fair sir and boss , since it doth go far to <unk> the wisdom of even our holy mother church herself . "
" as how ? "
" for that she hath established the self-same rule regarding saints .
by her law none may be <unk> until he hath lain dead four generations . "
" i see , i see  it is the same thing .
it is wonderful .
in the one case a man lies <unk> four generations  <unk> in ignorance and sloth  and that <unk> him to command live people , and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands ; and in the other case , a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations , and that <unk> him for office in the celestial camp .
does the king's <name> approve of this strange law ? "
the king said : " why , truly i see naught about it that is strange .
all places of honor and of profit do belong , by natural right , to them that be of <name> blood , and so these dignities in the army are their property and would be so without this or any rule .
the rule is but to <name> a limit .
its purpose is to keep out too recent blood , which would bring into contempt these offices , and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them .
i were to blame an i permitted this calamity .
you can permit it an you are minded so to do , for you have the delegated authority , but that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not comprehensible to any . "
" i yield .
proceed , sir chief of the herald 's college . "
the chairman resumed as follows : " by what illustrious achievement for the honor of the throne and state did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the british nobility ? "
" he built a <unk> . "
" sire , the board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command , and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor . "
the competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself .
so there was a tie in military qualifications that far .
he stood aside a moment , and sir <unk> was questioned further : " of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line ? "
" she came of the highest landed gentry , yet she was not <name> ; she was gracious and pure and charitable , of a blameless life and character , insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best <name> in the land . "
" that <name> do .
stand down . "
he called up the competing <unk> again , and asked : " what was the rank and condition of the <unk> who conferred british nobility upon your great house ? "
" she was a king 's <unk> and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own <unk> merit from the sewer where she was born . "
" ah , this , indeed , is true nobility , this is the right and perfect <unk> .
the <unk> is yours , fair lord .
hold it not in contempt ; it is the humble step which <name> lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine . "
i was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation .
i had promised myself an easy and <unk> triumph , and this was the outcome !
i was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face .
i told him to go home and be patient , this was n't the end .
i had a private audience with the king , and made a proposition .
i said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities , and he could n't have done a wiser thing .
it would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it ; in fact , add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country , even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it ; and thus make it the crack regiment , the envied regiment , the king 's own regiment , and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way , and go whither it would and come when it pleased , in time of war , and be utterly swell and independent .
this would make that regiment the heart 's <name> of all the nobility , and they would all be satisfied and happy .
then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials , and officer it with <unk> , as was proper  <unk> selected on a basis of mere efficiency  and we would make this regiment toe the line , allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint , and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering , to the end that whenever the king 's own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and <unk> around amongst <unk> and have a good time , it could go without uneasiness , knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it , and business going to be continued at the old stand , same as usual .
the king was charmed with the idea .
when i noticed that , it gave me a valuable notion .
i thought i saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last .
you see , the royalties of the <unk> stock were a long-lived race and very fruitful .
whenever a child was born to any of these  and it was pretty often  there was wild <name> in the nation 's mouth , and piteous sorrow in the nation 's heart .
the <name> was questionable , but the grief was honest .
because the event meant another call for a <name> <name> .
long was the list of these royalties , and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown .
yet <name> could not believe this latter fact , and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the <name> grants .
if i could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying <unk> from his own pocket , i could have made a grand <unk> over it , and it would have had a good effect with the nation ; but no , he would n't hear of such a thing .
he had something like a religious passion for <name> <name> ; he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag , and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution .
if i ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in england that would humble itself to hold out the hat  however , that is as far as i ever got ; he always cut me short there , and peremptorily , too .
but i believed i saw my chance at last .
i would form this crack regiment out of officers alone  not a single private .
half of it should consist of nobles , who should fill all the places up to <unk> , and serve gratis and pay their own expenses ; and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood .
these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenant-general up to field marshal , and be gorgeously <unk> and equipped and fed by the state .
moreover  and this was the master stroke  it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a <unk> gaudy and <unk> title ( which i would presently invent ) , and they and they only in all england should be so addressed .
finally , all princes of the blood should have free choice ; join that regiment , get that great title , and renounce the <name> <name> , or stay out and receive a <name> .
<unk> touch of all : unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be born into the regiment , and start fair , with good wages and a permanent situation , upon due notice from the parents .
all the boys would join , i was sure of that ; so , all existing grants would be relinquished ; that the newly born would always join was equally certain .
within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly , the <name> <name> , would cease to be a living fact , and take its place among the curiosities of the past .
chapter xxvi the first newspaper when i told the king i was going out disguised as a petty <name> to scour the country and <unk> myself with the humbler life of the people , he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute , and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself  nothing should stop him  he would drop everything and go along  it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day .
he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once ; but i showed him that that would n't answer .
you see , he was <unk> for the <unk>  to touch for it , i mean  and it would n't be right to disappoint the house and it would n't make a delay worth considering , anyway , it was only a <unk> stand .
and i thought he ought to tell the <name> he was going away .
he clouded up at that and looked sad .
i was sorry i had spoken , especially when he said mournfully : " thou <unk> that launcelot is here ; and where launcelot is , she <unk> not the going forth of the king , nor what day he <unk> . "
of course , i changed the subject .
yes , <unk> was beautiful , it is true , but take her all around she was pretty slack .
i never meddled in these matters , they were n't my affair , but i did hate to see the way things were going on , and i do n't mind saying that much .
many 's the time she had asked me , " sir boss , hast seen sir launcelot about ? "
but if ever she went fretting around for the king i did n't happen to be around at the time .
there was a very good <unk> for the <unk> business  very tidy and creditable .
the king sat under a canopy of state ; about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full <unk> .
conspicuous , both for location and personal outfit , stood <unk> , a hermit of the <unk> species , to introduce the sick .
all abroad over the spacious floor , and clear down to the doors , in a thick jumble , lay or sat the <unk> , under a strong light .
it was as good as a <unk> ; in fact , it had all the look of being gotten up for that , though it was n't .
there were eight hundred sick people present .
the work was slow ; it lacked the interest of novelty for me , because i had seen the ceremonies before ; the thing soon became tedious , but the proprieties required me to stick it out .
the doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them , and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of <unk> contact with a king , and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch .
up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar .
when you consider how much that amount of money would buy , in that age and country , and how usual it was to be <unk> , when not dead , you would understand that the annual <unk> appropriation was just the river and harbor <name> of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus .
so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the <unk> .
i covered <unk> of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from camelot on my adventures , and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into <unk> <unk> and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the king 's evil department ; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin , you see , and do its work for it .
it might strain the nickel some , but i judged it could stand it .
as a rule , i do not approve of watering stock , but i considered it square enough in this case , for it was just a gift , anyway .
of course , you can water a gift as much as you want to ; and i generally do .
the old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin , as a rule , but some of them were <name> ; they were <unk> , and seldom <unk> than a moon that is a week past the full ; they were hammered , not <unk> , and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters , and looked like them .
i judged that a sharp , bright new nickel , with a first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and <unk> on the other , and a blooming pious motto , would take the tuck out of <unk> as handy as a nobler coin and please the <unk> fancy more ; and i was right .
this batch was the first it was tried on , and it worked to a charm .
the saving in expense was a notable economy .
you <name> see that by these figures : we touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients ; at former rates , this would have cost the government about $ 240 ; at the new rate we pulled through for about $ 35 , thus saving upward of $ 200 at one swoop .
to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke , consider these other figures : the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days ' average wages of every individual of the population , counting every individual as if he were a man .
if you take a nation of <unk> , where average wages are $ 2 per day , three days ' wages taken from each individual <name> provide $ <unk> and pay the government 's expenses .
in my day , in my own country , this money was collected from <unk> , and the citizen imagined that the foreign <unk> paid it , and it made him comfortable to think so ; whereas , in fact , it was paid by the american people , and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the <unk> and the annual cost to the sucking child of the <unk> was precisely the same  each paid $ 6 .
nothing could be <unk> than that , i reckon .
well , scotland and ireland were tributary to <name> , and the united populations of the british islands amounted to something less than <unk> .
a mechanic 's average wage was 3 cents a day , when he paid his own keep .
by this rule the national government 's expenses were $ <unk> a year , or about $ 250 a day .
thus , by the <unk> of <unk> for gold on a <unk> day , i not only injured no one , dissatisfied no one , but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day 's national expense into the bargain  a saving which would have been the equivalent of $ <unk> in my day in <name> .
in making this <unk> i had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source  the wisdom of my boyhood  for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom , howsoever lowly may be its origin : in my boyhood i had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause .
the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin , the coin would answer me better than the buttons ; all hands were happy and nobody hurt .
<unk> took the patients as they came .
he examined the candidate ; if he could n't <unk> he was warned off ; if he could he was passed along to the king .
a priest pronounced the words , " they shall lay their hands on the sick , and they shall recover . "
then the king stroked the <unk> , while the reading continued ; finally , the patient graduated and got his nickel  the king hanging it around his neck himself  and was dismissed .
would you think that that would cure ?
it certainly did .
any <unk> <name> cure if the patient 's <name> is strong in it .
up by <unk> there was a chapel where the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there  the girl said so herself  and they built the chapel upon that spot and <name> a picture in it representing the occurrence  a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach ; whereas , on the contrary , thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound ; and even the well could look upon it and live .
of course , when i was told these things i did not believe them ; but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb .
i saw the cures effected myself ; and they were real cures and not questionable .
i saw cripples whom i had seen around camelot for years on crutches , arrive and pray before that picture , and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp .
there were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony .
in other places people operated on a patient 's mind , without saying a word to him , and cured him .
in others , experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them , and appealed to their <name> , and those patients went away cured .
wherever you find a king who can't cure the <unk> you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne  the subject 's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign  has passed away .
in my youth the monarchs of england had ceased to touch for the evil , but there was no occasion for this diffidence : they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty .
well , when the priest had been droning for three hours , and the good king polishing the evidences , and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever , i got to feeling intolerably bored .
i was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state .
for the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his <unk> stroked ; again those words were being <unk> out : " they shall lay their hands on the sick "  when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears : " camelot weekly <unk> and literary volcano !   latest irruption  only two cents  all about the big miracle in the valley of holiness ! "
one greater than kings had arrived  the newsboy .
but i was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth , and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do .
i dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper ; the <unk> of the world went around the corner to get my change ; is around the corner yet .
it was delicious to see a newspaper again , yet i was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display <unk> .
i had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence , respect , deference , so long that they sent a <unk> little cold wave through me : high times in the valley of holiness !
  the <unk> <unk> !
  <unk> <name> works his arts , but gets left ?
  but the boss scores on his first innings !
  the miraculous well <unk> amid awful <unk> of infernal fire and smoke <unk> !
  the <unk> astonished !
  unparalleled <unk> !
 and so on , and so on .
yes , it was too loud .
once i could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it , but now its note was discordant .
it was good arkansas journalism , but this was not arkansas .
moreover , the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits , and perhaps lose us their advertising .
indeed , there was too <unk> a tone of <unk> all through the paper .
it was plain i had undergone a considerable change without noticing it .
i found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little <unk> which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life .
there was an abundance of the following breed of items , and they <unk> me : local smoke and cinders .
sir launcelot met up with old king <unk> of ireland unexpectedly last <unk> over on the moor south of sir <unk> <name> <unk> 's hog <unk> .
the widow has been notified .
expedition no .
3 <name> start <unk> the first of <unk> month on a search <unk> sir <unk> <name> desirous .
it is in <unk> and of the renowned knight of the red lawns , <unk> by sir <unk> of <unk> , who is <unk> .
intelligent , <unk> <unk> , and in every way a brick , and fur ther assisted by sir <unk> the <name> <unk> , who is no huckleberry <unk> .
this is no <unk> , these boys mean <unk> & s .
the readers of the <unk> <name> re <unk> to learn that the <unk> and popular sir <unk> of gaul , who <unk> <unk> his four weeks ' stay at the bull and <unk> , this city , has won every heart by his polished manners and elegant <unk> , <name> pull out to-day for home .
give us another call , <name> !
the <unk> end of the funeral of the late sir <unk> the duke 's son of cornwall , killed in an encounter with the giant of the knotted <unk> last tuesday on the borders of the plain of enchantment was in the hands of the ever affable and efficient mumble , <name> of <unk> , then whom there exists none by whom it were a more satisfying pleasure to have the last sad offices performed .
give him a trial .
the cordial thanks of the <unk> office are due , from editor down to devil , to the ever courteous and thought <unk> lord high stew d of the <unk> third assistant v t for several <name> <unk> of ice cream a quality calculated to make the <unk> of the <unk> hu mid with <unk> <unk> ; and it done it .
when this administration wants to chalk up a desirable name for early promotion , the <unk> would like a chance to <unk> .
the <unk> <name> dewlap , of south <unk> , is visiting her uncle , the popular host of the <unk> 's board <unk> ho & se , liver <name> , this city .
young <unk> the <unk> is home again , and looks much improved by his vacation round-up among the out lying <unk> .
see his ad .
of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning ; i knew that quite well , and yet it was somehow disappointing .
the " court circular " pleased me better ; indeed , its simple and dignified <unk> was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful <unk> .
but even it could have been improved .
do what one may , there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular , i acknowledge that .
there is a profound <unk> about its facts that <unk> and defeats one 's sincerest efforts to make them <name> and <unk> .
the best way to manage  in fact , the only sensible way  is to disguise <unk> of fact under variety of form : skin your fact each time and lay on a new <unk> of words .
it <unk> the eye ; you think it is a new fact ; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything ; this excites you , and you drain the whole column , with a good appetite , and perhaps never notice that it 's a barrel of soup made out of a single bean .
<name> 's way was good , it was simple , it was dignified , it was direct and business-like ; all i say is , it was not the best way : court circular .
on monday , the king rode in the <unk> "
tuesday , " " " " <unk> " " " " thursday " " " " friday , " " " " saturday " " " " <name> , " " " however , take the paper by and large , i was vastly pleased with it .
little <unk> of a mechanical sort were observable here and there , but there were not enough of them to amount to anything , and it was good enough arkansas <unk> , anyhow , and better than was needed in <name> 's day and realm .
as a rule , the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame ; but i did not much mind these things .
they are common defects of my own , and one must n't criticise other people on grounds where he ca n't stand perpendicular himself .
i was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal , but i got only a few bites , and then had to postpone , because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions : what is this curious thing ?
what is it for ?
is it a handkerchief ?  saddle blanket ?  part of a shirt ?
what is it made of ?
how thin it is , and how dainty and frail ; and how it rattles .
<name> it wear , do you think , and wo n't the rain injure it ?
is it writing that appears on it , or is it only ornamentation ?
they suspected it was writing , because those among them who knew how to read latin and had a <unk> of greek , recognized some of the letters , but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole .
i put my information in the simplest form i could : " it is a public journal ; i <name> explain what that is , another time .
it is not cloth , it is made of paper ; some time i <name> explain what paper is .
the lines on it are reading matter ; and not written by hand , but printed ; by and by i <name> explain what printing is .
a thousand of these sheets have been made , all exactly like this , in every minute detail  they ca n't be told apart . "
then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration : " a thousand !
verily a mighty work  a year 's work for many men . "
" no  merely a day 's work for a man and a boy . "
they crossed themselves , and <unk> out a protective prayer or two .
" <unk>  a miracle , a wonder !
dark work of enchantment . "
i let it go at that .
then i read in a low voice , to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance , part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well , and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through : " <unk> ! "
" how true ! "
" amazing , amazing ! "
" these be the very <unk> as they happened , in marvelous exactness ! "
and might they take this strange thing in their hands , and feel of it and examine it ?  they would be very careful .
yes .
so they took it , handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region ; and gently felt of its texture , caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch , and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes .
these grouped bent heads , these charmed faces , these speaking eyes  how beautiful to me !
for was not this my darling , and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and <unk> compliment to it ?
i knew , then , how a mother feels when women , whether strangers or friends , take her new baby , and close themselves about it with one eager impulse , and bend their heads over it in a <unk> adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not , for that time .
i knew how she feels , and that there is no other satisfied ambition , whether of king , conqueror , or poet , that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment .
during all the rest of the <unk> my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall , and my happy eye was upon it always , and i sat motionless , steeped in satisfaction , drunk with enjoyment .
yes , this was heaven ; i was tasting it once , if i might never taste it more .
chapter xxvii the yankee and the king travel incognito about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the <name> of the lowly raiment he was to wear .
the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around , whereas the lowest ranks of <unk> were banged fore and aft both ; the slaves were <unk> , and allowed their hair free growth .
so i inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that <name> below it .
i also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a <unk> long ; and tried to do it <unk> , and succeeded .
it was a villainous <unk> .
when he got his <unk> sandals on , and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth , which <name> straight from his neck to his <unk> , he was no longer the <unk> man in his kingdom , but one of the <unk> and most commonplace and unattractive .
we were dressed and <unk> alike , and could pass for small farmers , or farm <unk> , or shepherds , or <unk> ; yes , or for village artisans , if we chose , our costume being in effect universal among the poor , because of its strength and <unk> .
i do n't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person , but i do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire  manufactured material , you understand .
we slipped away an hour before <name> , and by broad <unk> had made eight or ten miles , and were in the midst of a <unk> settled country .
i had a pretty heavy knapsack ; it was laden with provisions  provisions for the king to taper down on , till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage .
i found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside , and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with .
then i said i would find some water for him , and strolled away .
part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself .
it had always been my custom to stand when in his presence ; even at the council board , except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one , extending over hours ; then i had a trifling little <unk> thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache .
i did n't want to break him in suddenly , but do it by degrees .
we should have to sit together now when in company , or people would notice ; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it .
i found the water some three hundred yards away , and had been resting about twenty minutes , when i heard voices .
that is all right , i thought  peasants going to work ; nobody else likely to be stirring this early .
but the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road  <unk> clad people of quality , with <unk> and servants in their train !
i was off like a shot , through the bushes , by the shortest cut .
for a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before i could get to him ; but desperation gives you wings , you know , and i canted my body forward , inflated my breast , and held my breath and flew .
i arrived .
and in plenty good enough time , too .
" pardon , my king , but it 's no time for ceremony  jump !
jump to your feet  some quality are coming ! "
" is that a <name> ?
let them come . "
" but my liege !
you must not be seen sitting .
rise !  and stand in humble posture while they pass .
you are a peasant , you know . "
" true  i had forgot it , so lost was i in planning of a huge war with gaul "  he was up by this time , but a farm could have got up quicker , if there was any kind of a boom in real estate  " and <unk> a thought came <unk> <unk> this majestic dream the which  " " a humbler attitude , my lord the king  and quick !
duck your head !
 more !  still more !  droop it ! "
he did his honest best , but lord , it was no great things .
he looked as humble as the leaning tower at pisa .
it is the most you could say of it .
indeed , it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering <unk> all along the line , and a gorgeous <unk> at the tail end of it raised his whip ; but i jumped in time and was under it when it fell ; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed , i spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice .
he mastered himself for the moment , but it was a sore tax ; he wanted to eat up the procession .
i said : " it would end our adventures at the very start ; and we , being without weapons , could do nothing with that armed gang .
if we are going to succeed in our <unk> , we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant . "
" it is wisdom ; none can <unk> it .
let us go on , sir boss .
i <name> take note and learn , and do the best i may . "
he kept his word .
he did the best he could , but i 've seen better .
if you have ever seen an active , heedless , enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long , and an anxious mother at its heels all the while , and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment , you 've seen the king and me .
if i could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like , i should have said , no , if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant , let him take the <unk> ; i can do better with a menagerie , and last longer .
and yet , during the first three days i never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling .
if he could pass muster anywhere during his early <unk> it would be in small inns and on the road ; so to these places we confined ourselves .
yes , he certainly did the best he could , but what of that ?
he did n't improve a bit that i could see .
he was always frightening me , always breaking out with fresh <unk> , in new and unexpected places .
toward evening on the second day , what does he do but blandly fetch out a <name> from inside his robe !
" great guns , my liege , where did you get that ? "
" from a <unk> at the inn , <unk> <name> . "
" what in the world possessed you to buy it ? "
" we have escaped divers dangers by wit  thy wit  but i have bethought me that it were but <name> if i bore a weapon , too .
thine might fail thee in some pinch . "
" but people of our condition are not allowed to <name> arms .
what would a lord say  yes , or any other person of whatever condition  if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person ? "
it was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then .
i persuaded him to throw the <name> away ; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself .
we walked along , silent and thinking .
finally the king said : " when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient , or that hath a peril in it , why do you not warn me to cease from that project ? "
it was a startling question , and a <unk> .
i did n't quite know how to take hold of it , or what to say , and so , of course , i ended by saying the natural thing : " but , sire , how can i know what your thoughts are ? "
the king stopped dead in his tracks , and stared at me .
" i believed thou wert greater than <name> ; and truly in magic thou <name> .
but prophecy is greater than magic .
<name> is a prophet . "
i saw i had made a blunder .
i must get back my lost ground .
after a deep reflection and careful planning , i said : " sire , i have been misunderstood .
i <name> explain .
there are two kinds of prophecy .
one is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off , the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away .
which is the mightier gift , do you think ? "
" oh , the last , most surely ! "
" true .
does <name> possess it ? "
" partly , yes .
he foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away . "
" has he ever gone beyond that ? "
" he would not claim more , i think . "
" it is probably his limit .
all prophets have their limit .
the limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years . "
" these are few , i <unk> . "
" there have been two still greater ones , whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years , and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty . "
" <unk> , it is marvelous ! "
" but what are these in comparison with me ?
they are nothing . "
" what ?
canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as  " " seven hundred years ?
my liege , as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half ! "
my land , you should have seen the king 's eyes spread slowly open , and lift the earth 's entire atmosphere as much as an inch !
that settled <unk> <name> .
one never had any occasion to prove his facts , with these people ; all he had to do was to state them .
it never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement .
" now , then , " i continued , " i could work both kinds of prophecy  the long and the short  if i chose to take the trouble to keep in practice ; but i seldom exercise any but the long kind , because the other is beneath my dignity .
it is <unk> to <name> 's sort  <unk> prophets , as we call them in the profession .
of course , i <unk> up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy , but not often  hardly ever , in fact .
you <name> remember that there was great talk , when you reached the valley of holiness , about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival , two or three days beforehand . "
" indeed , yes , i mind it now . "
" well , i could have done it as much as forty times easier , and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain , if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days . "
" how amazing that it should be so ! "
" yes , a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing that 's only five hundred seconds off . "
" and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way ; it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first , for , indeed , it is so close by that one <unk> might almost see it .
in truth , the law of prophecy doth contradict the <unk> , most strangely making the difficult easy , and the easy difficult . "
it was a wise head .
a peasant 's cap was no safe disguise for it ; you could know it for a king 's under a <unk> , if you could hear it work its intellect .
i had a new trade now , and plenty of business in it .
the king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them .
from that time out , i prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand .
i have done some indiscreet things in my day , but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst .
still , it had its <unk> .
a prophet does n't have to have any brains .
they are good to have , of course , for the ordinary exigencies of life , but they are no use in professional work .
it is the <unk> vocation there is .
when the spirit of prophecy comes upon you , you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest , and <unk> your jaw and leave it alone ; it <name> work itself : the result is prophecy .
every day a <unk> or so came along , and the sight of them fired the king 's martial spirit every time .
he would have forgotten himself , sure , and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree , and so i always got him well out of the road in time .
then he would stand and look with all his eyes ; and a proud light would flash from them , and his nostrils would <unk> like a <unk> 's , and i knew he was longing for a brush with them .
but about noon of the third day i had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the <unk> that had fallen to my share two days before ; a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave <unk> , i was so loath to institute it ; but now i had just had a fresh reminder : while striding heedlessly along , with jaw spread and intellect at rest , for i was <unk> , i <unk> my toe and fell sprawling .
i was so pale i could n't think for a moment ; then i got softly and carefully up and <unk> my knapsack .
i had that dynamite bomb in it , done up in wool in a box .
it was a good thing to have along ; the time would come when i could do a valuable miracle with it , maybe , but it was a nervous thing to have about me , and i did n't like to ask the king to <name> it .
yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society .
i got it out and slipped it into my <unk> , and just then here came a couple of knights .
the king stood , stately as a statue , gazing toward them  had forgotten himself again , of course  and before i could get a word of warning out , it was time for him to skip , and well that he did it , too .
he supposed they would turn aside .
turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot ?
when had he ever turned aside himself  or ever had the chance to do it , if a peasant saw him or any other <name> knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble ?
the knights paid no attention to the king at all ; it was his place to look out himself , and if he had n't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down , and laughed at besides .
the king was in a flaming fury , and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most <name> vigor .
the knights were some little distance by now .
they halted , greatly surprised , and turned in their saddles and looked back , as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we .
then they wheeled and started for us .
not a moment must be lost .
i started for them .
i passed them at a rattling gait , and as i went by i flung out a <unk> <unk> <unk> insult which made the king 's effort poor and cheap by comparison .
i got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how .
they had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up ; then , frantic with rage , they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around , and the next moment here they came , breast to breast .
i was seventy yards off , then , and scrambling up a great <unk> at the roadside .
when they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level , depressed their mailed heads , and so , with their <unk> plumes streaming straight out behind , most gallant to see , this lightning express came tearing for me !
when they were within fifteen yards , i sent that bomb with a sure aim , and it struck the ground just under the horses ' noses .
yes , it was a neat thing , very neat and pretty to see .
it resembled a steamboat explosion on the mississippi ; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and <unk> .
i say we , for the king joined the audience , of course , as soon as he had got his breath again .
there was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come  in trying to explain it , i mean ; as for filling it up , that service would be comparatively prompt , and would fall to the lot of a select few  peasants of that <unk> ; and they would n't get anything for it , either .
but i explained it to the king myself .
i said it was done with a dynamite bomb .
this information did him no damage , because it left him as intelligent as he was before .
however , it was a <name> miracle , in his eyes , and was another settler for <name> .
i thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it could n't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right .
otherwise he would be <unk> it every time we had a good subject , and that would be inconvenient , because i had n't any more bombs along .
chapter xxviii drilling the king on the morning of the fourth day , when it was just sunrise , and we had been tramping an hour in the chill <name> , i came to a resolution : the king must be drilled ; things could not go on so , he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled , or we could n't ever venture to enter a dwelling ; the very cats would know this <unk> for a humbug and no peasant .
so i called a halt and said : " sire , as between clothes and countenance , you are all right , there is no discrepancy ; but as between your clothes and your bearing , you are all wrong , there is a most noticeable discrepancy .
your soldierly stride , your lordly port  these <name> not do .
you stand too straight , your looks are too high , too confident .
the cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders , they do not droop the <name> , they do not depress the high level of the <unk> , they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and <name> out the signs of them in <unk> body and <unk> step .
it is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things .
you must learn the trick ; you must imitate the <unk> of poverty , misery , oppression , insult , and the other several and common <unk> that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters , or the very infants <name> know you for better than your disguise , and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at .
pray try to walk like this . "
the king took careful note , and then tried an imitation .
" pretty fair  pretty fair .
<name> a little lower , please  there , very good .
eyes too high ; pray do n't look at the horizon , look at the ground , ten steps in front of you .
ah  that is better , that is very good .
wait , please ; you betray too much vigor , too much decision ; you want more of a <unk> .
look at me , please  this is what i mean ... . now you are getting it ; that is the idea  at least , it sort of approaches it ... .
yes , that is pretty fair .
but !  there is a great big something wanting , i do n't quite know what it is .
please walk thirty yards , so that i can get a perspective on the thing ... . now , then  your head 's right , speed 's right , shoulders right , eyes right , <name> right , gait , carriage , general style right  everything 's right !
and yet the fact remains , the aggregate 's wrong .
the account do n't balance .
do it again , please ... . now i think i begin to see what it is .
yes , i've struck it .
you see , the genuine <unk> is wanting ; that's what 's the trouble .
it 's all amateur  mechanical details all right , almost to a hair ; everything about the delusion perfect , except that it do n't <unk> . "
" what , then , must one do , to prevail ? "
" let me think ...
i ca n't seem to quite get at it .
in fact , there is n't anything that can right the matter but practice .
this is a good place for it : roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait , a region not liable to interruption , only one field and one hut in sight , and they so far away that nobody could see us from there .
it <name> be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you , sire . "
after the drill had gone on a little while , i said : " now , sire , imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder , and the family are before us .
proceed , please  accost the head of the house . "
the king unconsciously straightened up like a monument , and said , with frozen <unk> : " <unk> , bring a seat ; and serve to me what cheer ye have . "
" ah , your <name> , that is not well done . "
" in what <unk> it ? "
" these people do not call each other <unk> . "
" nay , is that true ? "
" yes ; only those above them call them so . "
" then must i try again .
i <name> call him <unk> . "
" <unk> ; for he may be a <name> . "
" ah  so .
then peradventure i should call him goodman . "
" that would answer , your <name> , but it would be still better if you said friend , or brother . "
" brother !  to dirt like that ? "
" ah , but we are pretending to be dirt like that , too . "
" it is even true .
i <name> say it .
brother , bring a seat , and thereto what cheer ye have , withal .
now 't is right . "
" not quite , not wholly right .
you have asked for one , not us  for one , not both ; food for one , a seat for one . "
the king looked puzzled  he was n't a very heavy weight , intellectually .
his head was an <unk> ; it could stow an idea , but it had to do it a grain at a time , not the whole idea at once .
" would you have a seat also  and sit ? "
" if i did not sit , the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals  and playing the deception pretty poorly , too . "
" it is well and truly said !
how wonderful is truth , come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may !
yes , he must bring out seats and food for both , and in serving us present not <unk> and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other . "
" and there is even yet a detail that needs correcting .
he must bring nothing outside ; we <name> go in  in among the dirt , and possibly other repulsive things ,  and take the food with the household , and after the fashion of the house , and all on equal terms , except the man be of the <unk> class ; and finally , there <name> be no <unk> and no napkin , whether he be <unk> or free .
please walk again , my liege .
there  it is better  it is the best yet ; but not perfect .
the shoulders have known no <unk> burden than iron mail , and they <name> not stoop . "
" give me , then , the bag .
i <name> learn the spirit that <unk> with burdens that have not honor .
it is the spirit that <unk> the shoulders , i <unk> , and not the weight ; for armor is heavy , yet it is a proud burden , and a man standeth straight in it ... . nay , but me no <unk> , offer me no objections .
i <name> have the thing .
strap it upon my back . "
he was complete now with that knapsack on , and looked as little like a king as any man i had ever seen .
but it was an obstinate pair of shoulders ; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive <unk> .
the drill went on , i <unk> and correcting : " now , make believe you are in debt , and eaten up by relentless creditors ; you are out of work  which is <unk> , let us say  and can get none ; and your wife is sick , your children are crying because they are hungry  " and so on , and so on .
i drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes .
but lord , it was only just words , words  they meant nothing in the world to him , i might just as well have whistled .
words realize nothing , <unk> nothing to you , unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe .
there are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about " the working classes , " and satisfy themselves that a day 's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day 's hard <name> toil , and is <unk> entitled to much bigger pay .
why , they really think that , you know , because they know all about the one , but have n't tried the other .
but i know all about both ; and so far as i am concerned , there is n't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a <unk> thirty days , but i <name> do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down  and i <name> be satisfied , too .
intellectual " work " is <unk> ; it is a pleasure , a dissipation , and is its own highest reward .
the poorest paid architect , engineer , general , author , sculptor , painter , lecturer , advocate , <unk> , actor , preacher , singer is <unk> in heaven when he is at work ; and as for the musician with the <unk> in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him  why , certainly , he is at work , if you wish to call it that , but lord , it 's a sarcasm just the same .
the law of work does seem utterly unfair  but there it is , and nothing can change it : the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it , the higher shall be his pay in cash , also .
and it 's also the very law of those transparent <unk> , <unk> nobility and kingship .
chapter xxix the smallpox hut when we arrived at that hut at <unk> , we saw no signs of life about it .
the field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before , and had a skinned look , so exhaustively had it been harvested and <unk> .
fences , sheds , everything had a ruined look , and were eloquent of poverty .
no animal was around anywhere , no living thing in sight .
the stillness was awful , it was like the stillness of death .
the cabin was a <unk> one , whose thatch was black with age , and ragged from lack of repair .
the door stood a trifle ajar .
we approached it stealthily  on tiptoe and at <unk>  for that is the way one 's feeling makes him do , at such a time .
the king knocked .
we waited .
no answer .
knocked again .
no answer .
i pushed the door softly open and looked in .
i made out some dim forms , and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me , as one does who is wakened from sleep .
presently she found her voice : " have <name> ! "
she pleaded .
" all is taken , nothing is left . "
" i have not come to take anything , poor woman . "
" you are not a priest ? "
" no . "
" nor come not from the lord of the manor ? "
" no , i am a stranger . "
" oh , then , for the fear of god , who visits with misery and death such as be harmless , tarry not here , but fly !
this place is under his curse  and his church 's . "
" let me come in and help you  you are sick and in trouble . "
i was better used to the dim light now .
i could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me .
i could see how emaciated she was .
" i tell you the place is under the church 's ban .
save yourself  and go , before some <unk> see thee here , and report it . "
" give yourself no trouble about me ; i do n't care anything for the church 's curse .
let me help you . "
" now all good spirits  if there be any such  bless thee for that word .
would god i had a sup of water !  but hold , hold , forget i said it , and fly ; for there is that here that even he that <unk> not the church must fear : this disease whereof we die .
leave us , thou brave , good stranger , and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give . "
but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the <name> .
it was ten yards away .
when i got back and entered , the king was within , and was opening the shutter that closed the <unk> , to let in air and light .
the place was full of a foul stench .
i put the bowl to the woman's lips , and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face .
smallpox !
i sprang to the king , and said in his ear : " out of the door on the instant , sire !
the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of camelot two years ago . "
he did not budge .
" of a truth i shall remain  and likewise help . "
i whispered again : " king , it must not be .
you must go . "
" ye mean well , and ye speak not <unk> .
but it were shame that a king should know fear , and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor .
peace , i <name> not go .
it is you who must go .
the church 's ban is not upon me , but it <unk> you to be here , and she <name> deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass . "
it was a desperate place for him to be in , and might cost him his life , but it was no use to argue with him .
if he considered his knightly honor at stake here , that was the end of argument ; he would stay , and nothing could prevent it ; i was aware of that .
and so i dropped the subject .
the woman spoke : " fair sir , of your kindness <name> ye climb the ladder there , and bring me news of what ye find ?
be not afraid to report , for times can come when even a mother 's heart is past breaking  being already broke . "
" abide , " said the king , " and give the woman to eat .
i <name> go . "
and he put down the knapsack .
i turned to start , but the king had already started .
he halted , and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light , and had not noticed us thus far , or spoken .
" is it your husband ? "
the king asked .
" yes . "
" is he asleep ? "
" god be thanked for that one <name> , yes  these three hours .
where shall i pay to the full , my gratitude !
for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he <unk> now . "
i said : " we <name> be careful .
we <name> not wake him . "
" ah , no , that ye <name> not , for he is dead . "
" dead ? "
" yes , what triumph it is to know it !
none can harm him , none insult him more .
he is in heaven now , and happy ; or if not there , he <unk> in hell and is content ; for in that place he <name> find neither abbot nor yet bishop .
we were boy and girl together ; we were man and wife these five and twenty years , and never separated till this day .
think how long that is to love and suffer together .
this morning was he out of his mind , and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields ; and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther , still lightly gossiping , and entered into those other fields we know not of , and was shut away from mortal sight .
and so there was no parting , for in his fancy i went with him ; he knew not but i went with him , my hand in his  my young soft hand , not this withered claw .
ah , yes , to go , and know it not ; to separate and know it not ; how could one go peace  fuller than that ?
it was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne . "
there was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was .
it was the king descending .
i could see that he was bearing something in one arm , and assisting himself with the other .
he came forward into the light ; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen .
she was but half conscious ; she was dying of smallpox .
here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility , its utmost summit ; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed , with all the odds against the <unk> , no reward set upon the contest , and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud ; and yet the king 's bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel .
he was great now ; <unk> great .
the rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition  i would see to that ; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon , like the rest , it would be a king in commoner 's garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted .
he laid the girl down by her mother , who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart , and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the child 's eyes , but that was all .
the mother <name> over her , kissing her , petting her , and imploring her to speak , but the lips only moved and no sound came .
i snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack , but the woman forbade me , and said : " no  she does not suffer ; it is better so .
it might bring her back to life .
none that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt .
for look you  what is left to live for ?
her brothers are gone , her father is gone , her mother <unk> , the church 's curse is upon her , and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road .
she is desolate .
i have not asked you , good heart , if her sister be still on live , here overhead ; i had no need ; ye had gone back , else , and not left the poor thing forsaken  " " she lieth at peace , " interrupted the king , in a subdued voice .
" i would not change it .
how <name> is this day in happiness !
ah , my <name> , thou shalt join thy sister soon  <unk> on thy way , and these be merciful friends that <name> not hinder . "
and so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again , and softly stroking her face and hair , and kissing her and calling her by endearing names ; but there was scarcely sign of response now in the <unk> eyes .
i saw tears well from the king 's eyes , and trickle down his face .
the woman noticed them , too , and said : " ah , i know that sign : <unk> a wife at home , poor soul , and you and she have gone hungry to bed , many 's the time , that the little ones might have your crust ; you know what poverty is , and the daily insults of your betters , and the heavy hand of the church and the king . "
the king winced under this accidental <unk> , but kept still ; he was learning his part ; and he was playing it well , too , for a pretty dull beginner .
i struck up a diversion .
i offered the woman food and liquor , but she refused both .
she would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death .
then i slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft , and laid it by her .
this broke her down again , and there was another scene that was full of <unk> .
by and by i made another diversion , and beguiled her to sketch her story .
" ye know it well yourselves , having suffered it  for truly none of our condition in britain escape it .
it is the old , weary tale .
we fought and struggled and succeeded ; meaning by success , that we lived and did not die ; more than that is not to be claimed .
no troubles came that we could not outlive , till this year brought them ; then came they all at once , as one might say , and overwhelmed us .
years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm ; in the best part of it , too  a grievous wrong and shame  " " but it was his right , " interrupted the king .
" none <unk> that , indeed ; an the law mean anything , what is the lord 's is his , and what is mine is his also .
our farm was ours by lease , therefore 't was likewise his , to do with it as he would .
some little time ago , three of those trees were found hewn down .
our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime .
well , in his lordship 's dungeon there they lie , who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess .
they have naught to confess , being innocent , wherefore there <name> they remain until they die .
ye know that right well , i <unk> .
think how this left us ; a man , a woman and two children , to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force , yes , and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort .
when my lord 's crop was nearly ready for the harvest , so also was ours ; when his <name> rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing , he would not allow that i and my two girls should count for our three captive sons , but for only two of them ; so , for the lacking one were we daily fined .
all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect ; and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage .
in the end the fines ate up our crop  and they took it all ; they took it all and made us harvest it for them , without pay or food , and we starving .
then the worst came when i , being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys , and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair , uttered a deep blasphemy  oh !
a thousand of them !
 against the church and the church 's ways .
it was ten days ago .
i had fallen sick with this disease , and it was to the priest i said the words , for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the <unk> hand of god .
he carried my trespass to his betters ; i was stubborn ; wherefore , presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me , fell the curse of rome .
" since that day we are avoided , shunned with horror .
none has come near this hut to know whether we live or not .
the rest of us were taken down .
then i roused me and got up , as wife and mother <name> .
it was little they could have eaten in any case ; it was less than little they had to eat .
but there was water , and i gave them that .
how they craved it !
and how they blessed it !
but the end came yesterday ; my strength broke down .
yesterday was the last time i ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive .
i have lain here all these hours  these ages , ye may say  listening , listening for any sound up there that  " she gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter , then cried out , " oh , my darling ! "
and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms .
she had recognized the <unk> .
chapter xxx the tragedy of the <unk> at midnight all was over , and we sat in the presence of four corpses .
we covered them with such rags as we could find , and started away , fastening the door behind us .
their home must be these people 's grave , for they could not have <name> burial , or be admitted to consecrated ground .
they were as dogs , wild beasts , <unk> , and no soul that valued its <name> of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts .
we had not moved four steps when i caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel .
my heart flew to my throat .
we must not be seen coming from that house .
i plucked at the king 's robe and we <name> back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin .
" now we are safe , " i said , " but it was a close call  so to speak .
if the night had been lighter he might have seen us , no doubt , he seemed to be so near . "
" mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all . "
" true .
but man or beast , it <name> be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way . "
" hark !
it cometh hither . "
true again .
the step was coming toward us  straight toward the hut .
it must be a beast , then , and we might as well have saved our trepidation .
i was going to step out , but the king laid his hand upon my arm .
there was a moment of silence , then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door .
it made me shiver .
presently the knock was repeated , and then we heard these words in a guarded voice : " mother !
father !
open  we have got free , and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts ; and we may not tarry , but must fly !
and  but they answer not .
mother !
father !  " i <name> the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered : " come  now we can get to the road . "
the king hesitated , was going to demur ; but just then we heard the door give way , and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead .
" come , my liege !
in a moment they <name> strike a light , and then <name> follow that which it would break your heart to hear . "
he did not hesitate this time .
the moment we were in the road i ran ; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed .
i did not want to think of what was happening in the hut  i couldn't bear it ; i wanted to drive it out of my mind ; so i struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind : " i have had the disease those people died of , and so have nothing to fear ; but if you have not had it also  " he broke in upon me to say he was in trouble , and it was his conscience that was troubling him : " these young men have got free , they say  but how ?
it is not likely that their lord hath set them free . "
" oh , no , i make no doubt they escaped . "
" that is my trouble ; i have a fear that this is so , and your suspicion doth confirm it , you having the same fear . "
" i should not call it by that name though .
i do suspect that they escaped , but if they did , i am not sorry , certainly . "
" i am not sorry , i think  but  " " what is it ?
what is there for one to be troubled about ? "
" if they did escape , then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord ; for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage from persons of their base degree . "
there it was again .
he could see only one side of it .
he was born so , educated so , his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality , brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream .
to <unk> these men without proof , and starve their kindred , was no harm , for they were merely peasants and subject to the <name> and pleasure of their lord , no matter what fearful form it might take ; but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage , and a thing not to be <unk> by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste .
i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the subject  and even then an outside matter did it for me .
this was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill  a red glow , a good way off .
" that 's a fire , " said i .
fires interested me considerably , because i was getting a good deal of an insurance business started , and was also training some horses and building some steam <unk> , with an eye to a paid fire department by and by .
the priests opposed both my fire and life insurance , on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of god ; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least , but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck , they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god , and was just as bad .
so they managed to damage those industries more or less , but i got even on my accident business .
as a rule , a knight is a <unk> , and some times even a <unk> , and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a <unk> , but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while ; and so of late you could n't clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my <unk> in every helmet .
we stood there awhile , in the thick darkness and stillness , looking toward the red blur in the distance , and trying to make out the meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night .
sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote ; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature , it dulled and sank again , carrying its mystery with it .
we started down the hill in its direction , and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darkness  darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls .
we groped along down for half a mile , perhaps , that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time .
the coming storm threatening more and more , with now and then a little shiver of wind , a faint show of lightning , and dull <unk> of distant thunder .
i was in the lead .
i ran against something  a soft heavy something which gave , slightly , to the impulse of my weight ; at the same moment the lightning glared out , and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree !
that is , it seemed to be writhing , but it was not .
it was a <unk> sight .
straightway there was an <unk> explosion of thunder , and the bottom of heaven fell out ; the rain poured down in a deluge .
no matter , we must try to cut this man down , on the chance that there might be life in him yet , must n't we ?
the lightning came quick and sharp now , and the place was alternately noonday and midnight .
one moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light , and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness .
i told the king we must cut him down .
the king at once objected .
" if he hanged himself , he was willing to lose him property to his lord ; so let him be .
if others hanged him , belike they had the right  let him <name> . "
" but  " " but me no <unk> , but even leave him as he is .
and for yet another reason .
when the lightning cometh again  there , look abroad . "
two others hanging , within fifty yards of us !
" it is not weather meet for doing useless <unk> unto dead folk .
they are past thanking you .
come  it is unprofitable to tarry here . "
there was reason in what he said , so we moved on .
within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning , and altogether it was a grisly excursion .
that murmur was a murmur no longer , it was a roar ; a roar of men 's voices .
a man came flying by now , dimly through the darkness , and other men chasing him .
they disappeared .
presently another case of the kind occurred , and then another and another .
then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fire  it was a large <unk> , and little or nothing was left of it  and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit .
i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers .
we would better get away from the light , until matters should improve .
we stepped back a little , and hid in the edge of the wood .
from this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob .
the fearful work went on until nearly <name> .
then , the fire being out and the storm spent , the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased , and darkness and stillness reigned again .
we ventured out , and hurried cautiously away ; and although we were worn out and sleepy , we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us .
then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal <unk> , and got what was to be had .
a woman was up and about , but the man was still asleep , on a straw <unk> , on the <name> floor .
the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night .
she became talkative , then , and asked if we had heard of the terrible <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> .
yes , we had heard of them , but what we wanted now was rest and sleep .
the king broke in : " sell us the house and take yourselves away , for we be perilous company , being late come from people that died of the spotted death . "
it was good of him , but unnecessary .
one of the commonest decorations of the nation was the <unk> face .
i had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated .
she made us entirely welcome , and had no fears ; and plainly she was immensely impressed by the king 's proposition ; for , of course , it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king's humble appearance who was ready to buy a man 's house for the sake of a night 's lodging .
it gave her a large respect for us , and she strained the <name> possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable .
we slept till far into the afternoon , and then got up hungry enough to make <unk> fare quite <unk> to the king , the more particularly as it was scant in quantity .
and also in variety ; it consisted solely of onions , salt , and the national black bread made out of <unk> .
the woman told us about the affair of the evening before .
at ten or eleven at night , when everybody was in bed , the <unk> burst into flames .
the country-side swarmed to the rescue , and the family were saved , with one exception , the master .
he did not appear .
everybody was frantic over this loss , and two brave <unk> sacrificed their lives in <unk> the burning house seeking that valuable personage .
but after a while he was found  what was left of him  which was his corpse .
it was in a <unk> three hundred yards away , bound , gagged , stabbed in a dozen places .
who had done this ?
suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron ; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and <unk> .
a suspicion was enough ; my lord 's <unk> retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people , and were promptly joined by the community in general .
the woman 's husband had been active with the mob , and had not returned home until nearly <name> .
he was gone now to find out what the general result had been .
while we were still talking he came back from his quest .
his report was revolting enough .
eighteen persons hanged or butchered , and two <unk> and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire .
" and how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults ? "
" thirteen . "
" then every one of them was lost ? "
" yes , all . "
" but the people arrived in time to save the family ; how is it they could save none of the prisoners ? "
the man looked puzzled , and said : " would one unlock the vaults at such a time ?
marry , some would have escaped . "
" then you mean that nobody did unlock them ? "
" none went near them , either to lock or unlock .
it standeth to reason that the bolts were fast ; wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch , so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape , but be taken .
none were taken . "
" <unk> , three did escape , " said the king , " and ye <name> do well to publish it and set justice upon their track , for these <unk> the baron and fired the house . "
i was just expecting he would come out with that .
for a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it ; then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces , and they began to ask questions .
i answered the questions myself , and narrowly watched the effects produced .
i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere ; that our hosts ' continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real .
the king did not notice the change , and i was glad of that .
i worked the conversation around toward other details of the night 's proceedings , and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction .
the painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor .
this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord , it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil 's whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him , without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter .
this man had been out helping to <name> his neighbors , and had done his work with zeal , and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion , with nothing back of it <unk> as evidence , still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it .
this was depressing  to a man with the dream of a republic in his head .
it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away , when the " poor whites " of our south who were always despised and frequently insulted by the <unk> around them , and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst , were yet <unk> ready to side with the <unk> in all political moves for the <unk> and <unk> of slavery , and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them .
and there was only one <unk> feature connected with that pitiful piece of history ; and that was , that secretly the " poor white " did detest the <unk> , and did feel his own shame .
that feeling was not brought to the surface , but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out , under <unk> circumstances , was something  in fact , it was enough ; for it showed that a man is at bottom a man , after all , even if it does n't show on the outside .
well , as it turned out , this charcoal <unk> was just the twin of the southern " poor white " of the far future .
the king presently showed impatience , and said : " an ye <unk> here all the day , justice <name> <unk> .
think ye the criminals <name> abide in their father 's house ?
they are fleeing , they are not waiting .
you should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track . "
the woman paled slightly , but quite perceptibly , and the man looked <unk> and irresolute .
i said : " come , friend , i <name> walk a little way with you , and explain which direction i think they would try to take .
if they were merely <unk> of the <unk> or some kindred absurdity i would try to protect them from capture ; but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house , that is another matter . "
the last remark was for the king  to quiet him .
on the road the man pulled his resolution together , and began the march with a steady gait , but there was no eagerness in it .
by and by i said : " what relation were these men to you  cousins ? "
he turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him , and stopped , trembling .
" ah , my god , how know ye that ? "
" i did n't know it ; it was a chance guess . "
" poor lads , they are lost .
and good lads they were , too . "
" were you actually going yonder to tell on them ? "
he did n't quite know how to take that ; but he said , hesitatingly : " <unk> " " then i think you are a damned scoundrel ! "
it made him as glad as if i had called him an <name> .
" say the good words again , brother !
for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an i failed of my duty . "
" duty ?
there is no duty in the matter , except the duty to keep still and let those men get away .
they 've done a righteous deed . "
he looked pleased ; pleased , and touched with apprehension at the same time .
he looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming , and then said in a cautious voice : " from what land come you , brother , that you speak such perilous words , and seem not to be afraid ? "
" they are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste , i take it .
you would not tell anybody i said them ? "
" i ?
i would be drawn asunder by wild horses first . "
" well , then , let me say my say .
i have no fears of your repeating it .
i think devil 's work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people .
that old baron got only what he deserved .
if i had my way , all his kind should have the same luck . "
fear and depression vanished from the man 's manner , and <unk> and a brave animation took their place : " even though you be a spy , and your words a trap for my <unk> , yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them , i would go to the gallows happy , as having had one good feast at least in a starved life .
and i <name> say my say now , and ye may report it if ye be so minded .
i helped to <name> my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master 's cause ; the others helped for none other reason .
all rejoice to-day that he is dead , but all do go about seemingly sorrowing , and shedding the hypocrite 's tear , for in that lies safety .
i have said the words , i have said the words !
the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth , and the reward of that taste is sufficient .
lead on , an ye <name> , be it even to the scaffold , for i am ready . "
there it was , you see .
a man is a man , at bottom .
whole ages of abuse and oppression can not crush the manhood clear out of him .
whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken .
yes , there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existed  even the russians ; plenty of manhood in them  even in the germans  if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy , to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it .
we should see certain things yet , let us <name> and believe .
first , a modified monarchy , till <name> 's days were done , then the destruction of the throne , nobility abolished , every member of it bound out to some useful trade , universal suffrage instituted , and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain .
yes , there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while .
chapter xxxi <name> we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now , and talked .
we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of <unk> and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again .
and meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet , never lost its novelty for me since i had been in <name> 's kingdom : the behavior  born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste  of chance passers-by toward each other .
toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his <unk> tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat <unk> , the <unk> was deeply reverent ; to the gentleman he was abject ; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and <unk> ; and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered , this chap 's nose was in the air  he couldn't even see him .
well , there are times when one would like to <name> the whole human race and finish the farce .
presently we struck an incident .
a small mob of <unk> boys and girls came tearing out of the woods , scared and shrieking .
the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old .
they implored help , but they were so beside themselves that we could n't make out what the matter was .
however , we plunged into the wood , they <unk> in the lead , and the trouble was quickly revealed : they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope , and he was kicking and struggling , in the process of choking to death .
we rescued him , and fetched him around .
it was some more human nature ; the admiring little folk imitating their elders ; they were playing mob , and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for .
it was not a dull excursion for me .
i managed to put in the time very well .
i made various <unk> , and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to .
a thing which naturally interested me , as a statesman , was the matter of wages .
i picked up what i could under that head during the afternoon .
a man who has n't had much experience , and doesn't think , is apt to measure a nation 's prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages ; if the wages be high , the nation is prosperous ; if low , it is n't .
which is an error .
it is n't what sum you get , it 's how much you can buy with it , that's the important thing ; and it 's that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name .
i could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century .
in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day , gold <unk> ; in the south he got fifty  payable in confederate <unk> worth a dollar a bushel .
in the north a suit of <unk> cost three dollars  a day 's wages ; in the south it cost seventy-five  which was two days ' wages .
other things were in proportion .
consequently , wages were twice as high in the north as they were in the south , because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had .
yes , i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation  lots of <unk> , lots of mills , lots of cents , a good many <unk> , and some silver ; all this among the artisans and <unk> generally ; yes , and even some gold  but that was at the bank , that is to say , the goldsmith 's .
i dropped in there while <name> , the son of <name> , was <unk> with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt , and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece .
they furnished it  that is , after they had chewed the piece , and rung it on the counter , and tried acid on it , and asked me where i got it , and who i was , and where i was from , and where i was going to , and when i expected to get there , and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions ; and when they got aground , i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily ; told them i owned a dog , and his name was watch , and my first wife was a free <name> baptist , and her grandfather was a <unk> , and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip , and died in the <name> of a glorious resurrection , and so on , and so on , and so on , till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied , and also a shade put out ; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength , and so he did n't give me any lip , but i noticed he took it out of his underlings , which was a perfectly natural thing to do .
yes , they changed my twenty , but i judged it strained the bank a little , which was a thing to be expected , for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two <unk> <name> for you all of a sudden .
he could do it , maybe ; but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket ; which was probably this <unk> thought , too ; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration .
our new money was not only handsomely circulating , but its language was already glibly in use ; that is to say , people had dropped the names of the former moneys , and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or <unk> now .
it was very gratifying .
we were progressing , that was sure .
i got to know several master mechanics , but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith , dowley .
he was a live man and a brisk talker , and had two <unk> and three apprentices , and was doing a raging business .
in fact , he was getting <name> , hand over fist , and was vastly respected .
<name> was very proud of having such a man for a friend .
he had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal , but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man .
dowley and i <unk> at once ; i had had just such picked men , splendid fellows , under me in the colt arms factory .
i was bound to see more of him , so i invited him to come out to <name> 's <name> , and dine with us .
<name> was appalled , and held his breath ; and when the grandee accepted , he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension .
<name> 's <name> was <unk>  but only for a moment ; then he grew thoughtful , then sad ; and when he heard me tell dowley i should have <unk> , the boss <name> , and <unk> , the boss wheelwright , out there , too , the <unk> on his face turned to chalk , and he lost his grip .
but i knew what was the matter with him ; it was the expense .
he saw ruin before him ; he judged that his financial days were numbered .
however , on our way to invite the others , i said : " you must allow me to have these friends come ; and you must also allow me to pay the costs . "
his face cleared , and he said with spirit : " but not all of it , not all of it .
ye can not well bear a burden like to this alone . "
i stopped him , and said : " now let 's understand each other on the spot , old friend .
i am only a farm bailiff , it is true ; but i am not poor , nevertheless .
i have been very fortunate this year  you would be astonished to know how i have <unk> .
i tell you the honest truth when i say i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care that for the expense ! "
and i snapped my fingers .
i could see myself rise a foot at a time in <name> 's estimation , and when i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style and altitude .
" so you see , you must let me have my way .
you ca n't contribute a cent to this orgy , that 's settled . "
" it 's grand and good of you  " " no , it is n't .
you 've opened your house to jones and me in the most generous way ; jones was remarking upon it to-day , just before you came back from the village ; for although he would n't be likely to say such a thing to you  because jones is n't a talker , and is diffident in society  he has a good heart and a grateful , and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated ; yes , you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us  " " ah , brother , 't is nothing  such hospitality ! "
" but it is something ; the best a man has , freely given , is always something , and is as good as a <name> can do , and ranks right along beside it  for even a <name> can but do his best .
and so we 'll shop around and get up this <unk> now , and do n't you worry about the expense .
i 'm one of the worst <unk> that ever was born .
why , do you know , sometimes in a single week i spend  but never mind about that  you 'd never believe it anyway . "
and so we went <unk> along , dropping in here and there , <unk> things , and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot , and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it , in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged .
the raiment of <name> and his wife was of coarse <unk> and <unk> respectively , and resembled township maps , it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added , township by township , in the course of five or six years , until hardly a <unk> of the original garments was surviving and present .
now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits , on account of that swell company , and i did n't know just how to get at it  with delicacy , until at last it struck me that as i had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king , it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort ; so i said : " and <name> , there 's another thing which you must permit  out of kindness for jones  because you would n't want to offend him .
he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way , but he is so diffident he could n't venture it himself , and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame <name> and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him  you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing  and so i said i would , and we would keep mum .
well , his idea was , a new outfit of clothes for you both  " " oh , it is <unk> !
it may not be , brother , it may not be .
consider the vastness of the sum  " " <name> the vastness of the sum !
try to keep quiet for a moment , and see how it would seem ; a body ca n't get in a word <unk> , you talk so much .
you ought to cure that , <name> ; it is n't good form , you know , and it <name> grow on you if you do n't check it .
yes , we 'll step in here now and price this man 's stuff  and don't forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had anything to do with it .
you ca n't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is .
he 's a farmer  pretty fairly well-to-do farmer  and i 'm his bailiff ; but  the imagination of that man !
why , sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off , you'd think he was one of the swells of the earth ; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer  especially if he talked agriculture .
he thinks he 's a <unk> of a farmer ; thinks he 's old <unk> from <unk> ; but between you and me privately he do n't know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom  still , whatever he talks about , you want to drop your <unk> and listen , the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before , and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it .
that <name> please jones . "
it tickled <name> to the marrow to hear about such an odd character ; but it also prepared him for accidents ; and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and ca n't remember it more than about half the time , you ca n't take too many precautions .
this was the best store we had come across yet ; it had everything in it , in small quantities , from <unk> and <unk> all the way down to fish and <unk> jewelry .
i concluded i would bunch my whole <unk> right here , and not go <unk> around any more .
so i got rid of <name> , by sending him off to invite the <name> and the wheelwright , which left the field free to me .
for i never care to do a thing in a quiet way ; it 's got to be theatrical or i don't take any interest in it .
i showed up money enough , in a careless way , to corral the shopkeeper 's respect , and then i wrote down a list of the things i wanted , and handed it to him to see if he could read it .
he could , and was proud to show that he could .
he said he had been educated by a priest , and could both read and write .
he ran it through , and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy <name> .
well , and so it was , for a little concern like that .
i was not only providing a swell dinner , but some odds and ends of extras .
i ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of <name> , the son of <name> , by saturday evening , and send me the <name> at dinner-time <name> .
he said i could depend upon his promptness and <unk> , it was the rule of the house .
he also observed that he would throw in a couple of <unk> for the <name> gratis  that everybody was using them now .
he had a mighty opinion of that clever device .
i said : " and please fill them up to the middle <name> , too ; and add that to the <name> . "
he would , with pleasure .
he filled them , and i took them with me .
i could n't venture to tell him that the <unk> was a little invention of my own , and that i had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government price  which was the merest trifle , and the shopkeeper got that , not the government .
we furnished them for nothing .
the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall .
he had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back , and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again .
chapter xxxii dowley 's humiliation well , when that cargo arrived toward sunset , saturday afternoon , i had my hands full to keep the <name> from fainting .
they were sure jones and i were ruined past help , and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy .
you see , in addition to the <unk> , which called for a sufficiently round sum , i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family : for instance , a big lot of wheat , a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit 's ; also a <unk> deal dinner-table ; also two entire pounds of salt , which was another piece of extravagance in those people 's eyes ; also crockery , stools , the clothes , a small cask of beer , and so on .
i instructed the <name> to keep quiet about this <unk> , so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little .
concerning the new clothes , the simple couple were like children ; they were up and down , all night , to see if it was n't nearly daylight , so that they could put them on , and they were into them at last as much as an hour before <name> was due .
then their pleasure  not to say delirium  was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered .
the king had slept just as usual  like the dead .
the <name> could not thank him for their clothes , that being forbidden ; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were .
which all went for nothing : he did n't notice any change .
it turned out to be one of those <name> and rare fall days which is just a <name> day <unk> down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors .
toward noon the guests arrived , and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances .
even the king 's reserve melted a little , though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at first .
i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer ; but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that , and not elaborate it any .
because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you did n't warn him , his tongue was so handy , and his spirit so willing , and his information so uncertain .
dowley was in fine feather , and i early got him started , and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero , and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum .
self-made man , you know .
they know how to talk .
they do deserve more credit than any other breed of men , yes , that is true ; and they are among the very first to find it out , too .
he told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him ; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived ; how his day 's work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long , and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a <unk> condition ; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith , who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering , when he was totally unprepared , to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade  or " mystery " as dowley called it .
that was his first great rise , his first gorgeous stroke of fortune ; and you saw that he could n't yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being .
he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship , but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in <unk> <unk> and made him feel unspeakably <name> and fine .
" i remember me of that day ! "
the wheelwright sang out , with enthusiasm .
" and i likewise ! "
cried the <name> .
" i would not believe they were thine own ; in <name> i could not . "
" nor other ! "
shouted dowley , with sparkling eyes .
" i was like to lose my character , the neighbors <unk> i had mayhap been stealing .
it was a great day , a great day ; one <unk> not days like that . "
yes , and his master was a fine man , and prosperous , and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year , and with it white bread , true <unk> bread ; in fact , lived like a lord , so to speak .
and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter .
" and now consider what is come to pass , " said he , impressively .
" two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table . "
he made a pause here , to let that fact sink home , then added  " and eight times salt meat . "
" it is even true , " said the wheelwright , with bated breath .
" i know it of mine own knowledge , " said the <name> , in the same reverent fashion .
" on my table <unk> white bread every <name> in the year , " added the master smith , with solemnity .
" i leave it to your own consciences , friends , if this is not also true ? "
" by my head , yes , " cried the <name> .
" i can testify it  and i do , " said the wheelwright .
" and as to furniture , ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is . "
he waved his hand in fine gesture of granting <name> and <unk> freedom of speech , and added : " speak as ye are moved ; speak as ye would speak ; an i were not here . "
" ye have five stools , and of the sweetest workmanship at that , albeit your family is but three , " said the wheelwright , with deep respect .
" and six wooden <unk> , and six <unk> of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal , " said the <name> , impressively .
" and i say it as knowing god is my judge , and we tarry not here alway , but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body , be they false or be they sooth . "
" now ye know what manner of man i am , brother jones , " said the smith , with a fine and friendly condescension , " and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of <unk> to strangers till their <unk> and quality be assured , but trouble yourself not , as concerning that ; wit ye well ye shall find me a man that <unk> not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that <unk> a right heart in his body , be his worldly estate howsoever modest .
and in token of it , here is my hand ; and i say with my own mouth we are equals  equals "  and he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it .
the king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance , and let go of it as willingly as a <name> lets go of a fish ; all of which had a good effect , for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness .
the dame brought out the table now , and set it under the tree .
it caused a visible stir of surprise , it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal .
but the surprise rose higher still when the dame , with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore , but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity , slowly unfolded an actual <unk> tablecloth and spread it .
that was a notch above even the blacksmith 's domestic grandeurs , and it hit him hard ; you could see it .
but <name> was in paradise ; you could see that , too .
then the dame brought two fine new stools  whew !
that was a sensation ; it was visible in the eyes of every guest .
then she brought two more  as calmly as she could .
sensation again  with awed murmurs .
again she brought two  walking on air , she was so proud .
the guests were petrified , and the <name> muttered : " there is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence . "
as the dame turned away , <name> could n't help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot ; so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it : " these suffice ; leave the rest . "
so there were more yet !
it was a fine effect .
i could n't have played the hand better myself .
from this out , the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade , and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped " oh 's " and " ah 's , " and mute <unk> of hands and eyes .
she fetched crockery  new , and plenty of it ; new wooden <unk> and other table furniture ; and beer , fish , chicken , a goose , eggs , roast beef , roast mutton , a ham , a small roast pig , and a wealth of genuine white <unk> bread .
take it by and large , that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before .
and while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe , i sort of waved my hand as if by accident , and the storekeeper 's son emerged from space and said he had come to collect .
" that 's all right , " i said , indifferently .
" what is the amount ?
give us the items . "
then he read off this <name> , while those three amazed men listened , and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over <name> 's : 2 pounds salt .

3,000 he ceased .
there was a pale and awful silence .
not a limb stirred .
not a <unk> betrayed the passage of breath .
" is that all ? "
i asked , in a voice of the most perfect calmness .
" all , fair sir , save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head <unk> <unk> .
if it would like you , i <name> <unk>  " " it is of no consequence , " i said , accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference ; " give me the grand total , please . "
the clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself , and said : " thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty <unk> ! "
the wheelwright fell off his stool , the others grabbed the table to save themselves , and there was a deep and general ejaculation of : " god be with us in the day of disaster ! "
the clerk hastened to say : " my father <unk> me to say he can not honorably require you to pay it all at this time , and therefore only <unk> you  " i paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze , but , with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness , got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table .
ah , you should have seen them stare !
the clerk was astonished and charmed .
he asked me to retain one of the dollars as security , until he could go to town and  i interrupted : " what , and fetch back nine cents ?
nonsense !
take the whole .
keep the change . "
there was an amazed murmur to this effect : " verily this being is made of money !
he <unk> it away even as if it were dirt . "
the blacksmith was a crushed man .
the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune .
i said to <name> and his wife : " good folk , here is a little trifle for you "  handing the <unk> as if it were a matter of no consequence , though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash ; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude , i turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day : " well , if we are all ready , i judge the dinner is .
come , fall to . "
ah , well , it was immense ; yes , it was a <name> .
i do n't know that i ever put a situation together better , or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available .
the blacksmith  well , he was simply mashed .
land !
i would n't have felt what that man was feeling , for anything in the world .
here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand <unk> twice a year , and his fresh meat twice a month , and his salt meat twice a week , and his white bread every <name> the year round  all for a family of three ; the entire cost for the year not above <unk> ( <unk> cents , two mills and six <unk> ) , and all of a sudden here comes along a man who <unk> out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out ; and not only that , but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums .
yes , dowley was a good deal wilted , and <unk> and collapsed ; he had the aspect of a <unk> that 's been stepped on by a cow .
chapter xxxiii sixth century political economy however , i made a dead set at him , and before the first third of the dinner was reached , i had him happy again .
it was easy to do  in a country of ranks and castes .
you see , in a country where they have ranks and castes , a man is n't ever a man , he is only part of a man , he ca n't ever get his full growth .
you prove your superiority over him in station , or rank , or fortune , and that 's the end of it  he knuckles down .
you ca n't insult him after that .
no , i do n't mean quite that ; of course you can insult him , i only mean it 's difficult ; and so , unless you 've got a lot of useless time on your hands it does n't pay to try .
i had the smith 's reverence now , because i was apparently immensely prosperous and <name> ; i could have had his adoration if i had had some little <unk> title of nobility .
and not only his , but any <unk> in the land , though he were the mightiest production of all the ages , in intellect , worth , and character , and i bankrupt in all three .
this was to remain so , as long as england should exist in the earth .
with the spirit of prophecy upon me , i could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable <unk> and other <name> and <name> <unk> , and leave <unk> the <unk> of this world  after god  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , morse , stephenson , <name> .
the king got his cargo aboard , and then , the talk not turning upon battle , conquest , or <unk> duel , he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap .
mrs. <name> cleared the table , placed the beer keg handy , and went away to eat her dinner of <unk> in humble privacy , and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort  business and wages , of course .
at a first glance , things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom  whose lord was king <unk>  as compared with the state of things in my own region .
they had the " protection " system in full force here , whereas we were working along down toward <unk> , by easy stages , and were now about half way .
before long , dowley and i were doing all the talking , the others hungrily listening .
dowley warmed to his work , snuffed an advantage in the air , and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me , and they did have something of that look : " in your country , brother , what is the wage of a master bailiff , master hind , <name> , shepherd , <unk> ? "
" twenty-five <unk> a day ; that is to say , a quarter of a cent . "
the smith 's face beamed with <name> .
he said : " with us they are allowed the double of it !
and what may a mechanic get  carpenter , <unk> , <name> , painter , blacksmith , wheelwright , and the like ? "
" on the average , fifty <unk> ; half a cent a day . "
" <unk> !
with us they are allowed a hundred !
with us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day !
i count out the tailor , but not the others  they are all allowed a cent a day , and in driving times they get more  yes , up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen <unk> a day .
i 've paid a hundred and fifteen myself , within the week .
<unk> for protection  to <unk> with <unk> ! "
and his face shone upon the company like a <unk> .
but i didn't scare at all .
i rigged up my <unk> , and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth  drive him all in  drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground .
here is the way i started in on him .
i asked : " what do you pay a pound for salt ? "
" a hundred <unk> . "
" we pay forty .
what do you pay for beef and mutton  when you buy it ? "
that was a neat hit ; it made the color come .
" it <unk> somewhat , but not much ; one may say seventy-five <unk> the pound . "
" we pay thirty-three .
what do you pay for eggs ? "
" fifty <unk> the dozen . "
" we pay twenty .
what do you pay for beer ? "
" it <unk> us eight and one-half <unk> the pint . "
" we get it for four ; twenty-five bottles for a cent .
what do you pay for wheat ? "
" at the rate of nine hundred <unk> the bushel . "
" we pay four hundred .
what do you pay for a man 's <unk> suit ? "
" thirteen cents . "
" we pay six .
what do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic ? "
" we pay eight cents , four mills . "
" well , observe the difference : you pay eight cents and four mills , we pay only four cents . "
i prepared now to sock it to him .
i said : " look here , dear friend , what 's become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes ago ?  "  and i looked around on the company with placid satisfaction , for i had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot , you see , without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all .
" what 's become of those <name> high wages of yours ?  i seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them , it appears to me . "
but if you <name> believe me , he merely looked surprised , that is all !
he did n't grasp the situation at all , did n't know he had walked into a trap , did n't discover that he was in a trap .
i could have shot him , from sheer vexation .
with cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out : " marry , i seem not to understand .
it is proved that our wages be double thine ; how then may it be that <unk> knocked therefrom the stuffing ?  an <unk> not the <unk> word , this being the first time under <name> and providence of god it hath been granted me to hear it . "
well , i was stunned ; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on his part , and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind  if you might call it mind .
my position was simple enough , plain enough ; how could it ever be simplified more ?
however , i must try : " why , look here , brother dowley , do n't you see ?
your wages are merely higher than ours in name , not in fact . "
" hear him !
they are the double  ye have confessed it yourself . "
" <unk> , i do n't deny that at all .
but that 's got nothing to do with it ; the amount of the wages in mere coins , with meaningless names attached to them to know them by , has got nothing to do with it .
the thing is , how much can you buy with your wages ?
 that 's the idea .
while it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year , and with us only about a dollar and seventy-five  " " there  ye 're confessing it again , ye 're confessing it again ! "
" confound it , i 've never denied it , i tell you !
what i say is this .
with us half a dollar buys more than a dollar buys with you  and therefore it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common-sense , that our wages are higher than yours . "
he looked dazed , and said , despairingly : " verily , i can not make it out .
ye 've just said ours are the higher , and with the same breath ye take it back . "
" oh , great <name> , is n't it possible to get such a simple thing through your head ?
now look here  let me illustrate .
we pay four cents for a woman 's stuff gown , you pay <unk> , which is four mills more than double .
what do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm ? "
" two mills a day . "
" very good ; we allow but half as much ; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day ; and  " " again ye 're <unk>  " " wait !
now , you see , the thing is very simple ; this time you'll understand it .
for instance , it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown , at 2 mills a day  7 weeks ' work ; but ours earns hers in forty days  two days short of 7 weeks .
your woman has a gown , and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ; ours has a gown , and two days ' wages left , to buy something else with .
there  now you understand it ! "
he looked  well , he merely looked dubious , it 's the most i can say ; so did the others .
i waited  to let the thing work .
dowley spoke at last  and betrayed the fact that he actually had n't gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet .
he said , with a trifle of hesitancy : " but  but  ye can not fail to <name> that two mills a day is better than one . "
shucks !
well , of course , i hated to give it up .
so i chanced another <unk> : " let us suppose a case .
suppose one of your <unk> goes out and buys the following articles : " 1 pound of salt ; 1 dozen eggs ; 1 dozen pints of beer ; 1 bushel of wheat ; 1 <unk> suit ; 5 pounds of beef ; 5 pounds of mutton .
" the lot <name> cost him 32 cents .
it takes him 32 working days to earn the money  5 weeks and 2 days .
let him come to us and work 32 days at half the wages ; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents ; they <name> cost him a shade under 29 days ' work , and he <name> have about half a week 's wages over .
<name> it through the year ; he would save nearly a week 's wages every two months , your man nothing ; thus saving five or six weeks ' wages in a year , your man not a cent .
now i reckon you understand that <unk> wages ' and <unk> wages ' are phrases that do n't mean anything in the world until you find out which of them <name> buy the most ! "
it was a <unk> .
but , alas !
it did n't crush .
no , i had to give it up .
what those people valued was high wages ; it did n't seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not .
they stood for " protection , " and swore by it , which was reasonable enough , because interested parties had <unk> them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages .
i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent. , while the cost of living had gone up 100 ; and that with us , in a shorter time , wages had advanced 40 per cent .
while the cost of living had gone steadily down .
but it did n't do any good .
nothing could <unk> their strange beliefs .
well , i was <unk> under a sense of defeat .
<unk> defeat , but what of that ?
that did n't soften the smart any .
and to think of the circumstances !
the first statesman of the age , the <unk> man , the <unk> man in the entire world , the loftiest <unk> head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries , sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith !
and i could see that those others were sorry for me  which made me blush till i could smell my whiskers scorching .
put yourself in my place ; feel as mean as i did , as ashamed as i felt  would n't you have struck below the belt to get even ?
yes , you would ; it is simply human nature .
well , that is what i did .
i am not trying to justify it ; i 'm only saying that i was mad , and anybody would have done it .
well , when i make up my mind to hit a man , i do n't plan out a <unk> ; no , that is n't my way ; as long as i 'm going to hit him at all , i 'm going to hit him a <unk> .
and i do n't jump at him all of a sudden , and risk making a blundering half-way business of it ; no , i get away off yonder to one side , and work up on him gradually , so that he never suspects that i 'm going to hit him at all ; and by and by , all in a flash , he 's flat on his back , and he ca n't tell for the life of him how it all happened .
that is the way i went for brother dowley .
i started to talking lazy and comfortable , as if i was just talking to pass the time ; and the oldest man in the world could n't have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up : " boys , there 's a good many curious things about law , and custom , and usage , and all that sort of thing , when you come to look at it ; yes , and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement , too .
there are written laws  they perish ; but there are also unwritten laws  they are eternal .
take the unwritten law of wages : it says they 've got to advance , little by little , straight through the centuries .
and notice how it works .
we know what wages are now , here and there and yonder ; we strike an average , and say that's the wages of to-day .
we know what the wages were a hundred years ago , and what they were two hundred years ago ; that 's as far back as we can get , but it suffices to give us the law of progress , the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation ; and so , without a document to help us , we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago .
good , so far .
do we stop there ?
no .
we stop looking backward ; we face around and apply the law to the future .
my friends , i can tell you what people 's wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know , for hundreds and hundreds of years . "
" what , goodman , what ! "
" yes .
in seven hundred years wages <name> have risen to six times what they are now , here in your region , and farm hands <name> be allowed 3 cents a day , and mechanics 6 . "
" i <unk> i might die now and live then ! "
interrupted <unk> , the wheelwright , with a fine <unk> glow in his eye .
" and that is n't all ; they 'll get their board besides  such as it is : it wo n't <unk> them .
two hundred and fifty years later  pay attention now  a mechanic 's wages <name> be  mind you , this is law , not <unk> ; a mechanic 's wages <name> then be twenty cents a day ! "
there was a general gasp of awed astonishment , <unk> the <name> murmured , with raised eyes and hands : " more than three weeks ' pay for one day 's work ! "
" riches !  of a truth , yes , riches ! "
muttered <name> , his breath coming quick and short , with excitement .
" wages <name> keep on rising , little by little , little by little , as steadily as a tree grows , and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there 'll be at least one country where the mechanic 's average wage <name> be two hundred cents a day ! "
it knocked them absolutely dumb !
not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes .
then the <unk> said <unk> : " might i but live to see it ! "
" it is the income of an <name> ! "
said <unk> .
" an <name> , say ye ? "
said dowley ; " ye could say more than that and speak no lie ; there 's no <name> in the realm of <unk> that hath an income like to that .
income of an <name>  <unk> !
it 's the income of an <name> ! "
" now , then , that is what is going to happen as regards wages .
in that remote day , that man <name> earn , with one week 's work , that <name> of goods which it takes you upwards of fifty weeks to earn now .
some other pretty surprising things are going to happen , too .
brother dowley , who is it that determines , every spring , what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic , laborer , and servant shall be for that year ? "
" sometimes the courts , sometimes the town council ; but most of all , the magistrate .
ye may say , in general terms , it is the magistrate that fixes the wages . "
" does n't ask any of those poor devils to help him fix their wages for them , does he ? "
" <unk> !
that were an idea !
the master that 's to pay him the money is the one that 's rightly concerned in that matter , ye <name> notice . "
" yes  but i thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it , too ; and even his wife and children , poor creatures .
the masters are these : nobles , <name> men , the prosperous generally .
these few , who do no work , determine what pay the vast hive shall have who do work .
you see ?
they 're a <unk> '  a trade union , to coin a new phrase  who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give .
thirteen hundred years hence  so says the unwritten law  the <unk> ' <name> be the other way , and then how these fine people 's posterity <name> fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions !
yes , indeed !
the magistrate <name> tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century ; and then all of a sudden the <unk> <name> consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this <unk> sort of thing ; and he <name> rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself .
ah , he <name> have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle . "
" do ye believe  " " that he actually <name> help to fix his own wages ?
yes , indeed .
and he <name> be strong and able , then . "
" brave times , brave times , of a truth ! "
sneered the prosperous smith .
" oh ,  and there 's another detail .
in that day , a master may hire a man for only just one day , or one week , or one month at a time , if he wants to . "
" what ? "
" it 's true .
moreover , a magistrate wo n't be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not . "
" <name> there be no law or sense in that day ? "
" both of them , dowley .
in that day a man <name> be his own property , not the property of magistrate and master .
and he can leave town whenever he wants to , if the wages do n't suit him !  and they can't put him in the <unk> for it . "
" perdition catch such an age ! "
shouted dowley , in strong indignation .
" an age of dogs , an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority !
the <unk>  " " oh , wait , brother ; say no good word for that institution .
i think the <unk> ought to be abolished . "
" a most strange idea .
why ? "
" well , i 'll tell you why .
is a man ever put in the <unk> for a capital crime ? "
" no . "
" is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him ? "
there was no answer .
i had scored my first point !
for the first time , the smith was n't up and ready .
the company noticed it .
good effect .
" you do n't answer , brother .
you were about to <unk> the <unk> a while ago , and shed some pity on a future age that is n't going to use it .
i think the <unk> ought to be abolished .
what usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the <unk> for some little offense that did n't amount to anything in the world ?
the mob try to have some fun with him , do n't they ? "
" yes . "
" they begin by <unk> him ; and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another ? "
" yes . "
" then they throw dead cats at him , do n't they ? "
" yes . "
" well , then , suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him  and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community , for his pride , or his prosperity , or one thing or another  stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently , do n't they ? "
" there is no doubt of it . "
" as a rule he is crippled for life , is n't he ?  jaws broken , teeth smashed out ?  or legs mutilated , <unk> , presently cut off ?
 or an eye knocked out , maybe both eyes ? "
" it is true , god knoweth it . "
" and if he is unpopular he can depend on dying , right there in the stocks , ca n't he ? "
" he surely can !
one may not deny it . "
" i take it none of you are unpopular  by reason of pride or insolence , or conspicuous prosperity , or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village ?
you would n't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks ? "
dowley winced , visibly .
i judged he was hit .
but he did n't betray it by any spoken word .
as for the others , they spoke out plainly , and with strong feeling .
they said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a man 's chance in them was , and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging .
" well , to change the subject  for i think i 've established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished .
i think some of our laws are pretty unfair .
for instance , if i do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks , and you know i did it and yet keep still and do n't report me , you <name> get the stocks if anybody informs on you . "
" ah , but that would serve you but right , " said dowley , " for you must inform .
so saith the law . "
the others <unk> .
" well , all right , let it go , since you vote me down .
but there's one thing which certainly is n't fair .
the magistrate fixes a mechanic 's wage at one cent a day , for instance .
the law says that if any master shall venture , even under utmost press of business , to pay anything over that cent a day , even for a single day , he shall be both fined and <unk> for it ; and whoever knows he did it and does n't inform , they also shall be fined and <unk> .
now it seems to me unfair , dowley , and a deadly peril to all of us , that because you <unk> confessed , a while ago , that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen <unk>  " oh , i tell you it was a <unk> !
you ought to have seen them to go to pieces , the whole gang .
i had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly , that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags .
a fine effect .
in fact , as fine as any i ever produced , with so little time to work it up in .
but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little .
i was expecting to scare them , but i was n't expecting to scare them to death .
they were mighty near it , though .
you see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the <unk> ; and to have that thing staring them in the face , and every one of them distinctly at the <name> of me , a stranger , if i chose to go and report  well , it was awful , and they could n't seem to recover from the shock , they could n't seem to pull themselves together .
pale , shaky , dumb , pitiful ?
why , they were n't any better than so many dead men .
it was very uncomfortable .
of course , i thought they would appeal to me to keep mum , and then we would shake hands , and take a drink all round , and laugh it off , and there an end .
but no ; you see i was an unknown person , among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people , a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness , and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates .
appeal to me to be gentle , to be fair , to be generous ?
of course , they wanted to , but they could n't dare .
chapter xxxiv the yankee and the king sold as slaves well , what had i better do ?
nothing in a hurry , sure .
i must get up a diversion ; anything to employ me while i could think , and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again .
there sat <name> , petrified in the act of trying to get the <name> of his <unk>  turned to stone , just in the attitude he was in when my <unk> fell , the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers .
so i took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery .
mystery !
a simple little thing like that ; and yet it was mysterious enough , for that race and that age .
i never saw such an awkward people , with machinery ; you see , they were totally unused to it .
the <unk> was a little double-barreled tube of <unk> glass , with a neat little trick of a spring to it , which upon pressure would let a shot escape .
but the shot would n't hurt anybody , it would only drop into your hand .
in the gun were two sizes  wee <unk> shot , and another sort that were several times larger .
they were money .
the <unk> shot represented <unk> , the larger ones mills .
so the gun was a purse ; and very handy , too ; you could pay out money in the dark with it , with accuracy ; and you could <name> it in your mouth ; or in your vest pocket , if you had one .
i made them of several sizes  one size so large that it would <name> the equivalent of a dollar .
using shot for money was a good thing for the government ; the metal cost nothing , and the money could n't be <unk> , for i was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower .
" paying the shot " soon came to be a common phrase .
yes , and i knew it would still be passing men 's lips , away down in the nineteenth century , yet none would suspect how and when it originated .
the king joined us , about this time , mightily refreshed by his nap , and feeling good .
anything could make me nervous now , i was so uneasy  for our lives were in danger ; and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the king 's eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other ; confound it , why must he go and choose such a time as this ?
i was right .
he began , straight off , in the most innocently artful , and transparent , and <unk> way , to lead up to the subject of agriculture .
the cold sweat broke out all over me .
i wanted to whisper in his ear , " man , we are in awful danger !
every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men's confidence ; don't waste any of this golden time . "
but of course i could n't do it .
whisper to him ?
it would look as if we were <unk> .
so i had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and <unk> along about his damned onions and things .
at first the tumult of my own thoughts , summoned by the <unk> and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull , kept up such a hurrah and confusion and <unk> and drumming that i could n't take in a word ; but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to <unk> and fall into position and form line of battle , a sort of order and quiet ensued and i caught the boom of the king 's batteries , as if out of remote distance : "  were not the best way , methinks , albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point , some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome <name> when stricken early from the tree  " the audience showed signs of life , and sought each other 's eyes in a surprised and troubled <unk> "
 <unk> others do yet maintain , with much show of reason , that this is not of necessity the case , <unk> that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the <unk> state  " the audience exhibited distinct distress ; yes , and also <unk> "
 yet are they clearly wholesome , the more especially when one doth <unk> the <unk> of their nature by <unk> of the <unk> juice of the wayward cabbage  " the wild light of terror began to glow in these men 's eyes , and one of them muttered , " these be errors , every one  god hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer . "
i was in miserable apprehension ; i sat upon <unk> "
 and further <unk> the known truth that in the case of animals , the young , which may be called the green fruit of the creature , is the better , all confessing that when a goat is ripe , his fur doth heat and sore <unk> his flesh , the which defect , taken in connection with his several <unk> habits , and <unk> appetites , and godless attitudes of mind , and <unk> quality of morals  " they rose and went for him !
with a fierce shout , " the one would betray us , the other is mad !
kill them !
kill them ! "
they flung themselves upon us .
what <name> flamed up in the king 's eye !
he might be lame in agriculture , but this kind of thing was just in his line .
he had been fasting long , he was hungry for a fight .
he hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back .
" st. <name> for britain ! "
and he <unk> the wheelwright .
the <name> was big , but i laid him out like nothing .
the three gathered themselves up and came again ; went down again ; came again ; and kept on repeating this , with native british pluck , until they were battered to jelly , reeling with exhaustion , and so blind that they could n't tell us from each other ; and yet they kept right on , hammering away with what might was left in them .
hammering each other  for we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled , and struggled , and <unk> , and pounded , and bit , with the strict and <unk> attention to business of so many <unk> .
we looked on without apprehension , for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us , and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion .
well , while they were gradually playing out , it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of <name> .
i looked around ; he was nowhere to be seen .
oh , but this was ominous !
i pulled the king 's sleeve , and we glided away and rushed for the hut .
no <name> there , no <name> there !
they had gone to the road for help , sure .
i told the king to give his heels wings , and i would explain later .
we made good time across the open ground , and as we darted into the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view , with <name> and his wife at their head .
they were making a world of noise , but that could n't hurt anybody ; the wood was dense , and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle .
ah , but then came another sound  dogs !
yes , that was quite another matter .
it magnified our contract  we must find running water .
we tore along at a good gait , and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur .
we struck a stream and darted into it .
we waded swiftly down it , in the dim forest light , for as much as three hundred yards , and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water .
we climbed up on this bough , and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree ; now we began to hear those sounds more plainly ; so the mob had struck our trail .
for a while the sounds approached pretty fast .
and then for another while they did n't .
no doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream , and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again .
when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage , the king was satisfied , but i was doubtful .
i believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree , and i judged it worth while to try .
we tried it , and made a success of it , though the king slipped , at the junction , and came near failing to connect .
we got comfortable <unk> and satisfactory concealment among the foliage , and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt .
presently we heard it coming  and coming on the jump , too ; yes , and down both sides of the stream .
louder  louder  next minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings , <unk> , <unk> , and swept by like a cyclone .
" i was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them , " said i , " but i do n't mind the disappointment .
come , my liege , it were well that we make good use of our time .
we've flanked them .
dark is coming on , presently .
if we can cross the stream and get a good start , and borrow a couple of horses from somebody 's pasture to use for a few hours , we shall be safe enough . "
we started down , and got nearly to the lowest limb , when we seemed to hear the hunt returning .
we stopped to listen .
" yes , " said i , " they 're baffled , they 've given it up , they 're on their way home .
we <name> climb back to our roost again , and let them go by . "
so we climbed back .
the king listened a moment and said : " they still search  i wit the sign .
we did best to abide . "
he was right .
he knew more about hunting than i did .
the noise approached steadily , but not with a rush .
the king said : " they reason that we were <unk> by no <unk> start of them , and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water . "
" yes , sire , that is about it , i am afraid , though i was hoping better things . "
the noise <name> nearer and nearer , and soon the van was drifting under us , on both sides of the water .
a voice called a halt from the other bank , and said : " an they were so minded , they could get to <name> tree by this branch that <unk> , and yet not touch ground .
ye <name> do well to send a man up it . "
" marry , that we <name> do ! "
i was obliged to admire my <unk> in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it .
but , do n't you know , there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight ?
awkwardness and stupidity can .
the best <unk> in the world does n't need to fear the second best <unk> in the world ; no , the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before ; he does n't do the thing he ought to do , and so the expert is n't prepared for him ; he does the thing he ought not to do ; and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot .
well , how could i , with all my gifts , make any valuable preparation against a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one ?
and that is what he did .
he went for the wrong tree , which was , of course , the right one by mistake , and up he started .
matters were serious now .
we remained still , and awaited developments .
the peasant toiled his difficult way up .
the king raised himself up and stood ; he made a leg ready , and when the comer 's head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud , and down went the man floundering to the ground .
there was a wild outbreak of anger below , and the mob swarmed in from all around , and there we were <unk> , and prisoners .
another man started up ; the <unk> bough was detected , and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge .
the king ordered me to play <unk> and keep the bridge .
for a while the enemy came thick and fast ; but no matter , the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach .
the king 's spirits rose , his <name> was limitless .
he said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night , for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country-side .
however , the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves ; wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans .
they had no weapons , but there were plenty of stones , and stones might answer .
we had no objections .
a stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while , but it was n't very likely ; we were well protected by boughs and foliage , and were not visible from any good aiming point .
if they would but waste half an hour in <unk> , the dark would come to our help .
we were feeling very well satisfied .
we could smile ; almost laugh .
but we did n't ; which was just as well , for we should have been interrupted .
before the stones had been raging through the leaves and <unk> from the boughs fifteen minutes , we began to notice a smell .
a couple of <unk> of it was enough of an explanation  it was smoke !
our game was up at last .
we recognized that .
when smoke invites you , you have to come .
they raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher , and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree , they broke out in a storm of <unk> .
i got enough breath to say : " proceed , my liege ; after you is manners . "
the king gasped : " follow me down , and then back thyself against one side of the trunk , and leave me the other .
then <name> we fight .
let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste . "
then he descended , barking and coughing , and i followed .
i struck the ground an instant after him ; we sprang to our appointed places , and began to give and take with all our might .
the powwow and racket were prodigious ; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and <unk> blows .
suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd , and a voice shouted : " hold  or ye are dead men ! "
how good it sounded !
the owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman : picturesque and costly raiment , the aspect of command , a hard countenance , with complexion and features marred by dissipation .
the mob fell humbly back , like so many <unk> .
the gentleman inspected us critically , then said sharply to the peasants : " what are ye doing to these people ? "
" they be madmen , worshipful sir , that have come wandering we know not whence , and  " " ye know not whence ?
do ye pretend ye know them not ? "
" most honored sir , we speak but the truth .
they are strangers and unknown to any in this region ; and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever  " " peace !
ye know not what ye say .
they are not mad .
who are ye ?
and whence are ye ?
explain . "
" we are but peaceful strangers , sir , " i said , " and traveling upon our own concerns .
we are from a far country , and unacquainted here .
we have purposed no harm ; and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us .
as you have divined , sir , we are not mad ; neither are we violent or bloodthirsty . "
the gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly : " lash me these animals to their <unk> ! "
the mob vanished in an instant ; and after them plunged the horsemen , laying about them with their whips and <unk> riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush .
the shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance , and soon the horsemen began to <unk> back .
meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely , but had dug no particulars out of us .
we were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us , but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country .
when the escort were all returned , the gentleman said to one of his servants : " bring the <unk> and mount these people . "
" yes , my lord . "
we were placed toward the rear , among the servants .
we traveled pretty fast , and finally <name> rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles .
my lord went immediately to his room , after ordering his supper , and we saw no more of him .
at <name> in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start .
my lord 's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent <name> , and said : " ye have said ye should continue upon this road , which is our direction likewise ; wherefore my lord , the <name> grip , hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride , and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that <unk> <unk> , <unk> ye shall be out of peril . "
we could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer .
we jogged along , six in the party , at a moderate and comfortable gait , and in conversation learned that my lord grip was a very great personage in his own region , which lay a day's journey beyond <unk> .
we loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town .
we dismounted , and left our thanks once more for my lord , and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square , to see what might be the object of interest .
it was the remnant of that old <unk> band of slaves !
so they had been dragging their chains about , all this weary time .
that poor husband was gone , and also many others ; and some few purchases had been added to the gang .
the king was not interested , and wanted to move along , but i was absorbed , and full of pity .
i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity .
there they sat , grounded upon the ground , silent , <unk> , with bowed heads , a pathetic sight .
and by hideous contrast , a <unk> orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away , in <unk> <unk> of " our glorious british liberties ! "
i was boiling .
i had forgotten i was a plebeian , i was remembering i was a man .
cost what it might , i would mount that rostrum and  click !
the king and i were handcuffed together !
our companions , those servants , had done it ; my lord grip stood looking on .
the king burst out in a fury , and said : " what <unk> this <unk> jest ? "
my lord merely said to his head miscreant , coolly : " put up the slaves and sell them ! "
slaves !  the word had a new sound  and how unspeakably awful !
the king lifted his <unk> and brought them down with a deadly force ; but my lord was out of the way when they arrived .
a dozen of the rascal 's servants sprang forward , and in a moment we were helpless , with our hands bound behind us .
we so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen , that we got the interested attention of that <unk> orator and his patriotic crowd , and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude .
the orator said : " if , indeed , ye are freemen , ye have nought to fear  the <unk> liberties of britain are about ye for your shield and shelter !
( applause . )
ye shall soon see .
bring forth your proofs . "
" what proofs ? "
" proof that ye are freemen . "
ah  i remembered !
i came to myself ; i said nothing .
but the king stormed out : " <unk> insane , man .
it were better , and more in reason , that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are not freemen . "
you see , he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws ; by words , not by effects .
they take a meaning , and get to be very vivid , when you come to apply them to yourself .
all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed ; some turned away , no longer interested .
the orator said  and this time in the tones of business , not of sentiment : " an ye do not know your country 's laws , it were time ye learned them .
ye are strangers to us ; ye <name> not deny that .
ye may be freemen , we do not deny that ; but also ye may be slaves .
the law is clear : it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves , it <unk> you to prove ye are not . "
i said : " dear sir , give us only time to send to <unk> ; or give us only time to send to the valley of holiness  " " peace , good man , these are extraordinary requests , and you may not <name> to have them granted .
it would cost much time , and would <unk> inconvenience your master  " " master , idiot ! "
stormed the king .
" i have no master , i myself am the m  " " silence , for god 's sake ! "
i got the words out in time to stop the king .
we were in trouble enough already ; it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics .
there is no use in stringing out the details .
the <name> put us up and sold us at auction .
this same infernal law had existed in our own south in my own time , more than thirteen hundred years later , and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me ; but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience , a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly <unk> .
well , that 's the way we are made .
yes , we were sold at auction , like swine .
in a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price ; but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed , every time i think of it .
the king of england brought seven dollars , and his prime minister nine ; whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and i as easily worth fifteen .
but that is the way things always go ; if you force a sale on a dull market , i do n't care what the property is , you are going to make a poor business of it , and you can make up your mind to it .
if the <name> had had wit enough to  however , there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account .
let him go , for the present ; i took his number , so to speak .
the <unk> bought us both , and hitched us onto that long chain of his , and we constituted the rear of his procession .
we took up our line of march and passed out of <unk> at noon ; and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the king of england and his chief minister , marching <unk> and fettered and yoked , in a slave convoy , could move by all manner of idle men and women , and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely , and yet never attract a curious eye , never provoke a single remark .
dear , dear , it only shows that there is nothing <unk> about a king than there is about a tramp , after all .
he is just a cheap and hollow <unk> when you do n't know he is a king .
but reveal his quality , and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him .
i reckon we are all fools .
born so , no doubt .
chapter xxxv a pitiful incident it 's a world of surprises .
the king brooded ; this was natural .
what would he brood about , should you say ?
why , about the prodigious nature of his fall , of course  from the loftiest place in the world to the lowest ; from the most illustrious station in the world to the <unk> ; from the grandest vocation among men to the <unk> .
no , i take my oath that the thing that <unk> him most , to start with , was not this , but the price he had fetched !
he couldn't seem to get over that seven dollars .
well , it stunned me so , when i first found it out , that i could n't believe it ; it did n't seem natural .
but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it , i saw i was mistaken ; it was natural .
for this reason : a king is a mere <unk> , and so a king 's feelings , like the impulses of an automatic doll , are mere <unk> ; but as a man , he is a reality , and his feelings , as a man , are real , not phantoms .
it shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth , and the king certainly wasn't anything more than an average man , if he was up that high .
confound him , he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars , sure  a thing which was plainly nonsense , and full or the <unk> conceit ; i was n't worth it myself .
but it was tender ground for me to argue on .
in fact , i had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead .
i had to throw conscience aside , and <unk> concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars ; whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages , the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money , and during the next thirteen centuries would n't see one that was worth the fourth of it .
yes , he tired me .
if he began to talk about the crops ; or about the recent weather ; or about the condition of politics ; or about dogs , or cats , or morals , or theology  no matter what  i sighed , for i knew what was coming ; he was going to get out of it a <unk> of that tiresome <unk> sale .
wherever we halted where there was a crowd , he would give me a look which said plainly : " if that thing could be tried over again now , with this kind of folk , you would see a different result . "
well , when he was first sold , it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars ; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying i wished he had fetched a hundred .
the thing never got a chance to die , for every day , at one place or another , possible <unk> looked us over , and , as often as any other way , their comment on the king was something like this : " here 's a <unk> chump with a <unk> style .
pity but style was <unk> . "
at last this sort of remark produced an evil result .
our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king .
so he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty .
i could have given the man some valuable advice , but i did n't ; you mustn't volunteer advice to a <unk> unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for .
i had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king 's style to a peasant 's style , even when he was a willing and anxious pupil ; now then , to undertake to reduce the king 's style to a slave 's style  and by force  go to !
it was a stately contract .
never mind the details  it <name> save me trouble to let you imagine them .
i <name> only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well ; the king 's body was a sight to see  and to weep over ; but his spirit ?  why , it was n't even <unk> .
even that dull clod of a <unk> was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who <name> remain a man till he dies ; whose bones you can break , but whose manhood you ca n't .
this man found that from his first effort down to his latest , he could n't ever come within reach of the king , but the king was ready to plunge for him , and did it .
so he gave up at last , and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired .
the fact is , the king was a good deal more than a king , he was a man ; and when a man is a man , you ca n't knock it out of him .
we had a rough time for a month , tramping to and fro in the earth , and suffering .
and what englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time ?
his <name> the king !
yes ; from being the most indifferent , he was become the most interested .
he was become the bitterest <unk> of the institution i had ever heard talk .
and so i ventured to ask once more a question which i had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that i had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further .
would he abolish slavery ?
his answer was as sharp as before , but it was music this time ; i should n't ever wish to hear pleasanter , though the profanity was not good , being awkwardly put together , and with the <unk> almost in the middle instead of at the end , where , of course , it ought to have been .
i was ready and willing to get free now ; i had n't wanted to get free any sooner .
no , i can not quite say that .
i had wanted to , but i had not been willing to take desperate chances , and had always <unk> the king from them .
but now  ah , it was a new atmosphere !
<name> would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now .
i set about a plan , and was straightway charmed with it .
it would require time , yes , and <name> , too , a great deal of both .
one could invent quicker ways , and fully as sure ones ; but none that would be as picturesque as this ; none that could be made so dramatic .
and so i was not going to give this one up .
it might delay us months , but no matter , i would <name> it out or break something .
now and then we had an adventure .
one night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for .
almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog , the driving snow was so thick .
you could n't see a thing , and we were soon lost .
the <unk> lashed us desperately , for he saw ruin before him , but his lashings only made matters worse , for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor .
so we had to stop at last and <unk> down in the snow where we were .
the storm continued until toward midnight , then ceased .
by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead , and others past moving and threatened with death .
our master was nearly beside himself .
he stirred up the living , and made us stand , jump , slap ourselves , to restore our circulation , and he helped as well as he could with his whip .
now came a diversion .
we heard shrieks and yells , and soon a woman came running and crying ; and seeing our group , she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection .
a mob of people came tearing after her , some with torches , and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease , and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat .
this poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human , she was so battered and bloody .
the mob wanted to burn her .
well , now , what do you suppose our master did ?
when we closed around this poor creature to shelter her , he saw his chance .
he said , burn her here , or they should n't have her at all .
imagine that !
they were willing .
they fastened her to a post ; they brought wood and piled it about her ; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast ; and our brute , with a heart solely for business , lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother .
that was the sort of master we had .
i took his number .
that snow-storm cost him nine of his flock ; and he was more brutal to us than ever , after that , for many days together , he was so enraged over his loss .
we had adventures all along .
one day we ran into a procession .
and such a procession !
all the <unk> of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it ; and all drunk at that .
in the van was a cart with a coffin in it , and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby , which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while , and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it ; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her , happy and content , <unk> her breast with its dimpled fat hand , which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart .
men and women , boys and girls , trotted along beside or after the cart , hooting , shouting profane and <unk> remarks , singing snatches of foul song , skipping , dancing  a very holiday of <unk> , a sickening sight .
we had struck a suburb of london , outside the walls , and this was a sample of one sort of london society .
our master secured a good place for us near the gallows .
a priest was in attendance , and he helped the girl climb up , and said comforting words to her , and made the <unk> provide a stool for her .
then he stood there by her on the gallows , and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet , then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near , and then began to tell the story of the case .
and there was pity in his voice  how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land !
i remember every detail of what he said , except the words he said it in ; and so i change it into my own words : " law is intended to <unk> out justice .
sometimes it fails .
this can not be helped .
we can only grieve , and be resigned , and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law , and that his fellows may be few .
a law sends this poor young thing to death  and it is right .
but another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child  and before god that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death !
" a little while ago this young thing , this child of eighteen years , was as happy a wife and mother as any in england ; and her lips were blithe with song , which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts .
her young husband was as happy as she ; for he was doing his whole duty , he worked early and late at his <unk> , his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned , he was <unk> , he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family , he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation .
by consent of a treacherous law , instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away !
that young husband was waylaid and impressed , and sent to sea .
the wife knew nothing of it .
she sought him everywhere , she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears , the broken eloquence of her despair .
weeks dragged by , she watching , waiting , hoping , her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery .
little by little all her small possessions went for food .
when she could no longer pay her rent , they turned her out of doors .
she begged , while she had strength ; when she was starving at last , and her milk failing , she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent , thinking to sell it and save her child .
but she was seen by the owner of the cloth .
she was put in jail and brought to trial .
the man testified to the facts .
a plea was made for her , and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf .
she spoke , too , by permission , and said she did steal the cloth , but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts , criminal or other , swam meaningless through her <name> and she knew nothing rightly , except that she was so hungry !
for a moment all were touched , and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her , seeing that she was so young and friendless , and her case so piteous , and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression ; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true , and most pitiful as well , still there was much small theft in these days , and <unk> <name> here would be a danger to property  oh , my god , is there no property in ruined homes , and <unk> babes , and broken hearts that british law holds precious !  and so he must require sentence .
" when the judge put on his black cap , the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up , his lip quivering , his face as gray as ashes ; and when the awful words came , he cried out , 'oh , poor child , poor child , i did not know it was death ! '
and fell as a tree falls .
when they lifted him up his reason was gone ; before the sun was set , he had taken his own life .
a kindly man ; a man whose heart was right , at bottom ; add his murder to this that is to be now done here ; and charge them both where they belong  to the rulers and the bitter laws of britain .
the time is come , my child ; let me pray over thee  not for thee , dear abused poor heart and innocent , but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death , who need it more . "
after his prayer they put the noose around the young girl 's neck , and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear , because she was devouring the baby all the time , wildly kissing it , and snatching it to her face and her breast , and drenching it with tears , and half moaning , half shrieking all the while , and the baby crowing , and laughing , and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play .
even the <unk> could n't stand it , but turned away .
when all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother 's arms , and stepped quickly out of her reach ; but she clasped her hands , and made a wild spring toward him , with a shriek ; but the rope  and the <unk>  held her short .
then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried : " one more kiss  oh , my god , one more , one more ,  it is the dying that begs it ! "
she got it ; she almost smothered the little thing .
and when they got it away again , she cried out : " oh , my child , my darling , it <name> die !
it has no home , it has no father , no friend , no mother  " " it has them all ! "
said that good priest .
" all these <name> i be to it till i die . "
you should have seen her face then !
gratitude ?
lord , what do you want with words to express that ?
words are only painted fire ; a look is the fire itself .
she gave that look , and carried it away to the treasury of heaven , where all things that are divine belong .
chapter xxxvi an encounter in the dark london  to a slave  was a sufficiently interesting place .
it was merely a great big village ; and mainly mud and thatch .
the streets were muddy , crooked , <unk> .
the populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags , and splendors , of nodding plumes and shining armor .
the king had a palace there ; he saw the outside of it .
it made him sigh ; yes , and swear a little , in a poor juvenile sixth century way .
we saw knights and grandees whom we knew , but they did n't know us in our rags and dirt and raw <unk> and bruises , and would n't have recognized us if we had hailed them , nor stopped to answer , either , it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain .
<name> passed within ten yards of me on a mule  hunting for me , i imagined .
but the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square , while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for <unk> pennies .
it was the sight of a newsboy  and i could n't get at him !
still , i had one comfort  here was proof that <name> was still alive and banging away .
i meant to be with him before long ; the thought was full of cheer .
i had one little glimpse of another thing , one day , which gave me a great uplift .
it was a wire stretching from <unk> to <unk> .
telegraph or telephone , sure .
i did very much wish i had a little piece of it .
it was just what i needed , in order to <name> out my project of escape .
my idea was to get loose some night , along with the king , then gag and bind our master , change clothes with him , batter him into the aspect of a stranger , hitch him to the <unk> , assume possession of the property , march to camelot , and  but you get my idea ; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise i would wind up with at the palace .
it was all feasible , if i could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which i could shape into a <unk> .
i could then undo the lumbering <unk> with which our chains were fastened , whenever i might choose .
but i never had any luck ; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way .
however , my chance came at last .
a gentleman who had come twice before to <unk> for me , without result , or indeed any approach to a result , came again .
i was far from expecting ever to belong to him , for the price asked for me from the time i was first <unk> was exorbitant , and always provoked either anger or derision , yet my master stuck stubbornly to it  twenty-two dollars .
he would n't bate a cent .
the king was greatly admired , because of his grand physique , but his kingly style was against him , and he was n't <unk> ; nobody wanted that kind of a slave .
i considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price .
no , i was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom i have spoken of , but he had something which i expected would belong to me eventually , if he would but visit us often enough .
it was a steel thing with a long pin to it , with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front .
there were three of them .
he had disappointed me twice , because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe ; but this time i succeeded ; i captured the lower clasp of the three , and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way .
i had a chance to be glad about a minute , then straightway a chance to be sad again .
for when the purchase was about to fail , as usual , the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus  in modern english : " i 'll tell you what i 'll do .
i 'm tired supporting these two for no good .
give me twenty-two dollars for this one , and i 'll throw the other one in . "
the king could n't get his breath , he was in such a fury .
he began to choke and gag , and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing .
" an ye <name> keep the offer open  " " 't is open till the morrow at this hour . "
" then i <name> answer you at that time , " said the gentleman , and disappeared , the master following him .
i had a time of it to cool the king down , but i managed it .
i whispered in his ear , to this effect : " your <name> <name> go for nothing , but after another fashion .
and so shall i. to-night we shall both be free . "
" ah !
how is that ? "
" with this thing which i have stolen , i <name> unlock these locks and cast off these chains to-night .
when he comes about <unk> to inspect us for the night , we <name> seize him , gag him , batter him , and early in the morning we <name> march out of this town , proprietors of this caravan of slaves . "
that was as far as i went , but the king was charmed and satisfied .
that evening we waited patiently for our <unk> to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign , for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it .
it is best to keep your own secrets .
no doubt they fidgeted only about as usual , but it did n't seem so to me .
it seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring .
as the time dragged on i got nervously afraid we should n't have enough of it left for our needs ; so i made several premature attempts , and merely delayed things by it ; for i could n't seem to touch a <unk> , there in the dark , without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebody 's sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang .
but finally i did get my last iron off , and was a free man once more .
i took a good breath of relief , and reached for the king's irons .
too late !
in comes the master , with a light in one hand and his heavy <unk> in the other .
i snuggled close among the wallow of <unk> , to conceal as nearly as possible that i was naked of irons ; and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me .
but he did n't approach .
he stopped , gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute , evidently thinking about something else ; then set down his light , moved musingly toward the door , and before a body could imagine what he was going to do , he was out of the door and had closed it behind him .
" quick ! "
said the king .
" fetch him back ! "
of course , it was the thing to do , and i was up and out in a moment .
but , dear me , there were no lamps in those days , and it was a dark night .
but i glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away .
i darted for it , threw myself upon it , and then there was a state of things and lively !
we fought and <unk> and struggled , and <name> a crowd in no time .
they took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could , and , in fact , couldn't have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight .
then a tremendous row broke out behind us , and as much as half of our audience left us , with a rush , to invest some sympathy in that .
lanterns began to swing in all directions ; it was the watch gathering from far and near .
presently a <unk> fell across my back , as a reminder , and i knew what it meant .
i was in custody .
so was my adversary .
we were marched off toward prison , one on each side of the watchman .
here was disaster , here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction !
i tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was i who had been fighting him ; and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for <unk> and petty <unk> , as was the custom ; and what might  just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction , the freckled light from the watchman 's tin lantern fell on it , and , by <name> , he was the wrong man !
chapter xxxvii an awful predicament sleep ?
it was impossible .
it would naturally have been impossible in that <unk> cavern of a jail , with its mangy crowd of drunken , quarrelsome , and <unk> <unk> .
but the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of , was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the <unk> in consequence of that intolerable <unk> of mine .
it was a long night , but the morning got around at last .
i made a full and <name> explanation to the court .
i said i was a slave , the property of the great <name> grip , who had arrived just after dark at the <unk> inn in the village on the other side of the water , and had stopped there over night , by compulsion , he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder .
i had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician ; i was doing my best ; naturally i was running with all my might ; the night was dark , i ran against this common person here , who seized me by the throat and began to <unk> me , although i told him my errand , and implored him , for the sake of the great <name> my master 's mortal peril  the common person interrupted and said it was a lie ; and was going to explain how i rushed upon him and attacked him without a word  " silence , <unk> ! "
from the court .
" take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time .
go ! "
then the court begged my pardon , and hoped i would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court 's fault that this high-handed thing had happened .
i said i would make it all right , and so took my leave .
took it just in time , too ; he was starting to ask me why i did n't fetch out these facts the moment i was arrested .
i said i would if i had thought of it  which was true  but that i was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of me  and so forth and so on , and got myself away , still mumbling .
i did n't wait for breakfast .
no grass grew under my feet .
i was soon at the slave quarters .
empty  everybody gone !
that is , everybody except one body  the <unk> 's .
it lay there all battered to pulp ; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight .
there was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door , and workmen , assisted by the police , were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in .
i picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as i , and got his account of the matter .
" there were sixteen slaves here .
they rose against their master in the night , and thou seest how it ended . "
" yes .
how did it begin ? "
" there was no witness but the slaves .
they said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way  by magic arts 't was thought , by reason that he had no key , and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured .
when the master discovered his loss , he was mad with despair , and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick , who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end . "
" this is dreadful .
it <name> go hard with the slaves , no doubt , upon the trial . "
" marry , the trial is over . "
" over ! "
" would they be a week , think you  and the matter so simple ?
they were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it . "
" why , i do n't see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time . "
" which ones ?
indeed , they considered not particulars like to that .
they condemned them in a body .
wit ye not the law ?  which men say the romans left behind them here when they went  that if one slave <unk> his master all the slaves of that man must die for it . "
" true .
i had forgotten .
and when <name> these die ? "
" belike within a four and twenty hours ; albeit some say they <name> wait a pair of days more , if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime . "
the missing one !
it made me feel uncomfortable .
" is it likely they <name> find him ? "
" before the day is spent  yes .
they seek him everywhere .
they stand at the gates of the town , with certain of the slaves who <name> discover him to them if he cometh , and none can pass out but he <name> be first examined . "
" might one see the place where the rest are confined ? "
" the outside of it  yes .
the inside of it  but ye <name> not want to see that . "
i took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off .
at the first second-hand clothing shop i came to , up a back street , i got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage , and bound up my face with a liberal bandage , saying i had a toothache .
this concealed my worst bruises .
it was a transformation .
i no longer resembled my former self .
then i struck out for that wire , found it and followed it to its den .
it was a little room over a <unk> shop  which meant that business was n't very brisk in the telegraphic line .
the young chap in charge was drowsing at his table .
i locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom .
this alarmed the young fellow , and he was going to make a noise ; but i said : " save your wind ; if you open your mouth you are dead , sure .
tackle your instrument .
lively , now !
call camelot . "
" this doth <unk> me !
how should such as you know aught of such matters as  " " call camelot !
i am a desperate man .
call camelot , or get away from the instrument and i <name> do it myself . "
" what  you ? "
" yes  certainly .
stop <unk> .
call the palace . "
he made the call .
" now , then , call <name> . "
" <name> who ? "
" never mind <name> who .
say you want <name> ; you 'll get an answer . "
he did so .
we waited five <unk> minutes  ten minutes  how long it did seem !  and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice ; for <name> had been my own pupil .
" now , my lad , vacate !
they would have known my touch , maybe , and so your call was surest ; but i 'm all right now . "
he vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen  but it didn't win .
i used a cipher .
i did n't waste any time in <unk> with <name> , but squared away for business , <unk>  thus : " the king is here and in danger .
we were captured and brought here as slaves .
we should not be able to prove our identity  and the fact is , i am not in a position to try .
send a telegram for the palace here which <name> <name> conviction with it . "
his answer came straight back : " they do n't know anything about the telegraph ; they have n't had any experience yet , the line to london is so new .
better not venture that .
they might <name> you .
think up something else . "
might <name> us !
little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts .
i could n't think up anything for the moment .
then an idea struck me , and i started it along : " send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead ; and send them on the jump .
let them enter by the southwest gate , and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm . "
the answer was prompt : " they shall start in half an hour . "
" all right , <name> ; now tell this lad here that i 'm a friend of yours and a <unk> ; and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine . "
the instrument began to talk to the youth and i hurried away .
i fell to ciphering .
in half an hour it would be nine o'clock .
knights and horses in heavy armor could n't travel very fast .
these would make the best time they could , and now that the ground was in good condition , and no snow or mud , they would probably make a <unk> gait ; they would have to change horses a couple of times ; they would arrive about six , or a little after ; it would still be plenty light enough ; they would see the white cloth which i should tie around my right arm , and i would take command .
we would surround that prison and have the king out in no time .
it would be showy and picturesque enough , all things considered , though i would have preferred noonday , on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have .
now , then , in order to increase the strings to my bow , i thought i would look up some of those people whom i had formerly recognized , and make myself known .
that would help us out of our scrape , without the knights .
but i must proceed cautiously , for it was a risky business .
i must get into sumptuous raiment , and it would n't do to run and jump into it .
no , i must work up to it by degrees , buying suit after suit of clothes , in shops wide apart , and getting a little finer article with each change , until i should finally reach silk and <name> , and be ready for my project .
so i started .
but the scheme fell through like <unk> !
the first corner i turned , i came plump upon one of our slaves , <unk> around with a watchman .
i coughed at the moment , and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow .
i judge he thought he had heard that cough before .
i turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter , <unk> things and watching out of the corner of my eye .
those people had stopped , and were talking together and looking in at the door .
i made up my mind to get out the back way , if there was a back way , and i asked the <unk> if i could step out there and look for the escaped slave , who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere , and said i was an officer in disguise , and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge , and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he need n't wait , but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when i <unk> him out .
she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers , and she started on the errand at once .
i slipped out the back way , locked the door behind me , put the key in my pocket and started off , chuckling to myself and comfortable .
well , i had gone and spoiled it again , made another mistake .
a double one , in fact .
there were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device , but no , i must pick out a picturesque one ; it is the crying defect of my character .
and then , i had ordered my procedure upon what the officer , being human , would naturally do ; whereas when you are least expecting it , a man <name> now and then go and do the very thing which it 's not natural for him to do .
the natural thing for the officer to do , in this case , was to follow straight on my heels ; he would find a stout oaken door , securely locked , between him and me ; before he could break it down , i should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling <unk> in britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character .
but instead of doing the natural thing , the officer took me at my word , and followed my instructions .
and so , as i came trotting out of that <unk> de sac , full of satisfaction with my own cleverness , he turned the corner and i walked right into his handcuffs .
if i had known it was a <unk> de sac  however , there is n't any <unk> a blunder like that , let it go .
charge it up to profit and loss .
of course , i was indignant , and swore i had just come ashore from a long voyage , and all that sort of thing  just to see , you know , if it would deceive that slave .
but it did n't .
he knew me .
then i reproached him for betraying me .
he was more surprised than hurt .
he stretched his eyes wide , and said : " what , wouldst have me let thee , of all men , escape and not <name> with us , when <unk> the very cause of our hanging ?
go to ! "
" go to " was their way of saying " i should smile ! "
or " i like that ! "
queer talkers , those people .
well , there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case , and so i dropped the matter .
when you ca n't cure a disaster by argument , what is the use to argue ?
it is n't my way .
so i only said : " you 're not going to be hanged .
none of us are . "
both men laughed , and the slave said : " ye have not ranked as a fool  before .
you might better keep your reputation , seeing the strain would not be for long . "
" it <name> stand it , i reckon .
before to-morrow we shall be out of prison , and free to go where we <name> , besides . "
the witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb , made a rasping noise in his throat , and said : " out of prison  yes  ye say true .
and free likewise to go where ye <name> , so ye wander not out of his <name> the devil 's sultry realm . "
i kept my temper , and said , indifferently : " now i suppose you really think we are going to <name> within a day or two . "
" i thought it not many minutes ago , for so the thing was decided and proclaimed . "
" ah , then you 've changed your mind , is that it ? "
" even that .
i only thought , then ; i know , now . "
i felt <unk> , so i said : " oh , <unk> servant of the law , condescend to tell us , then , what you know . "
" that ye <name> all be hanged to-day , at <unk> !
oho !
that shot hit home !
<name> upon me . "
the fact is i did need to <name> upon somebody .
my knights couldn't arrive in time .
they would be as much as three hours too late .
nothing in the world could save the king of england ; nor me , which was more important .
more important , not merely to me , but to the nation  the only nation on earth standing ready to <name> into civilization .
i was sick .
i said no more , there wasn't anything to say .
i knew what the man meant ; that if the missing slave was found , the postponement would be <unk> , the execution take place to-day .
well , the missing slave was found .
chapter xxxviii sir launcelot and knights to the rescue nearing four in the afternoon .
the scene was just outside the walls of london .
a cool , comfortable , superb day , with a brilliant sun ; the kind of day to make one want to live , not die .
the multitude was prodigious and far-reaching ; and yet we fifteen poor devils had n't a friend in it .
there was something painful in that thought , look at it how you might .
there we sat , on our tall scaffold , the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies .
we were being made a holiday spectacle .
they had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry , and these were there in full force , with their ladies .
we recognized a good many of them .
the crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king .
the moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up , in his fantastic rags , with face bruised out of all recognition , and proclaimed himself <name> , king of britain , and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched .
it startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter .
it wounded his dignity , and he locked himself up in silence .
then , although the crowd begged him to go on , and tried to provoke him to it by <unk> , jeers , and shouts of : " let him speak !
the king !
the king !
his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his serene and sacred <unk> ! "
but it went for nothing .
he put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved .
he certainly was great in his way .
absently , i had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm .
when the crowd noticed this , they began upon me .
they said : " doubtless this <unk> is his minister  observe his costly badge of office ! "
i let them go on until they got tired , and then i said : " yes , i am his minister , the boss ; and to-morrow you <name> hear that from camelot which  " i got no further .
they drowned me out with joyous derision .
but presently there was silence ; for the sheriffs of london , in their official robes , with their subordinates , began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin .
in the hush which followed , our crime was recited , the death warrant read , then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer .
then a slave was blindfolded ; the <unk> unslung his rope .
there lay the smooth road below us , we upon one side of it , the banked multitude wailing its other side  a good clear road , and kept free by the police  how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it !
but no , it was out of the possibilities .
i followed its receding thread out into the distance  not a horseman on it , or sign of one .
there was a jerk , and the slave <name> dangling ; dangling and hideously squirming , for his limbs were not tied .
a second rope was unslung , in a moment another slave was dangling .
in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air .
it was dreadful .
i turned away my head a moment , and when i turned back i missed the king !
they were <unk> him !
i was paralyzed ; i could n't move , i was choking , my tongue was petrified .
they finished <unk> him , they led him under the rope .
i couldn't shake off that clinging impotence .
but when i saw them put the noose around his neck , then everything let go in me and i made a spring to the rescue  and as i made it i shot one more glance abroad  by <name> !
here they came , <unk> !  five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles !
the grandest sight that ever was seen .
lord , how the plumes streamed , how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of <unk> wheels !
i waved my right arm as launcelot swept in  he recognized my rag  i tore away noose and bandage , and shouted : " on your knees , every rascal of you , and salute the king !
who fails shall sup in hell to-night ! "
i always use that high style when i 'm <unk> an effect .
well , it was <name> to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard .
and it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been <unk> and insulting .
and as he stood apart there , receiving this homage in rags , i thought to myself , well , really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king , after all .
i was immensely satisfied .
take the whole situation all around , it was one of the <unk> effects i ever <unk> .
and presently up comes <name> , his own self !
and winks , and says , very <unk> : " good deal of a surprise , was n't it ?
i knew you 'd like it .
i've had the boys practicing this long time , privately ; and just hungry for a chance to show off . "
chapter xxxix the yankee 's fight with the knights home again , at camelot .
a morning or two later i found the paper , damp from the press , by my plate at the breakfast table .
i turned to the advertising columns , knowing i should find something of personal interest to me there .
it was this : de par <name> roi .
know that the great lord and <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir sagramor <name> desirous having condescended to meet the king 's minister , <name> <unk> <unk> , the which is <unk> the boss , for <unk> of offence anciently given , these <name> engage in the lists by camelot about the fourth hour of the morning of the sixteenth day of this next succeeding month .
the battle <name> be a l <unk> , sith the said offence was of a deadly sort , admitting of no composition .
de par <name> roi <name> 's editorial reference to this affair was to this effect : it <name> be observed , by a <unk> at our advertising columns , that the <unk> <unk> is to be favored with a treat of <name> usual interest in the tournament line .
the n <unk> of the artists are warrant of good <unk> .
the <unk> <name> be open at noon of the 13th ; ad mission 3 cents , reserved <unk> 5 ; pro <unk> to go to the hospital fund the <name> pair and all the court <name> be <unk> ent .
with these exceptions , and the press and the clergy , the free list is strict <unk> suspended .
parties are hereby warn <name> against buying tickets of speculators ; they <name> not be good at the door .
everybody knows and likes the boss , everybody knows and likes sir <unk> .
; come , let us give the lads a good send off .
remember , the proceeds go to a great and free <name> , and one whose broad <unk> stretches out its help <unk> hand , warm with the blood of a <unk> <unk> heart , to all that suffer , regardless of race , creed , condition or color  the only <name> yet established in the earth which has no <unk> stop cock on its compassion , but says here flows the stream , let all come and drink !
turn out , all hands !
fetch along your <unk> and your <unk> and have a good time .
pie for sale on the grounds , and rocks to crack it with ; and <unk>  three drops of lime juice to a barrel of water .
n.b .
this is the first tournament under the new law , <unk> allow each <unk> to use any weapon he may <unk> fer .
you may want to make a note of that .
up to the day set , there was no talk in all britain of anything but this combat .
all other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of men 's thoughts and interest .
it was not because a tournament was a great matter , it was not because sir sagramor had found the holy <unk> , for he had not , but had failed ; it was not because the second ( official ) personage in the kingdom was one of the <unk> ; no , all these features were commonplace .
yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating .
it was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men , so to speak , but a duel between two mighty magicians ; a duel not of muscle but of mind , not of human skill but of superhuman <name> and craft ; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master <unk> of the age .
it was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this ; they could be but child's play , contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods .
yes , all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between <name> and me , a measuring of his magic powers against mine .
it was known that <name> had been busy whole days and nights together , <unk> sir sagramor 's arms and armor with <unk> powers of offense and defense , and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men .
against sir sagramor , so <unk> and protected , a thousand knights could accomplish nothing ; against him no known enchantments could prevail .
these facts were sure ; regarding them there was no doubt , no reason for doubt .
there was but one question : might there be still other enchantments , unknown to <name> , which could render sir sagramor 's veil transparent to me , and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons ?
this was the one thing to be decided in the lists .
until then the world must remain in suspense .
so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here , and the world was right , but it was not the one they had in their minds .
no , a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die : the life of <unk> .
i was a champion , it was true , but not the champion of the frivolous black arts , i was the champion of hard <unk> common-sense and reason .
i was entering the lists to either destroy <unk> or be its victim .
vast as the <unk> were , there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists , at ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th .
the mammoth <unk> was clothed in flags , streamers , and <name> tapestries , and packed with several acres of <unk> tributary kings , their suites , and the british aristocracy ; with our own <name> gang in the chief place , and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and <unk>  well , i never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippi sunset and the <name> borealis .
the huge camp of <unk> and <unk> tents at one end of the lists , with a <unk> sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge , was another fine sight .
you see , every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling ; for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret , and so here was their chance .
if i won my fight with sir sagramor , others would have the right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond .
down at our end there were but two tents ; one for me , and another for my servants .
at the appointed hour the king made a sign , and the heralds , in their <unk> , appeared and made proclamation , naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel .
there was a pause , then a ringing <unk> , which was the signal for us to come forth .
all the multitude caught their breath , and an eager curiosity flashed into every face .
out from his tent rode great sir sagramor , an imposing tower of iron , stately and rigid , his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand , his grand horse 's face and breast cased in steel , his body clothed in <name> trappings that almost dragged the ground  oh , a most <name> picture .
a great shout went up , of welcome and admiration .
and then out i came .
but i did n't get any shout .
there was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment , then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea , but a warning <unk> cut its career short .
i was in the simplest and <unk> of gymnast costumes  <unk> tights from neck to heel , with blue silk <unk> about my loins , and bareheaded .
my horse was not above medium size , but he was alert , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , and just a greyhound to go .
he was a beauty , glossy as silk , and naked as he was when he was born , except for bridle and <unk> .
the iron tower and the gorgeous <unk> came <unk> but gracefully <unk> down the lists , and we tripped lightly up to meet them .
we halted ; the tower saluted , i responded ; then we wheeled and rode side by side to the <unk> and faced our king and <name> , to whom we made obeisance .
the <name> exclaimed : " alack , sir boss , wilt fight naked , and without <name> or sword or  " but the king checked her and made her understand , with a polite phrase or two , that this was none of her business .
the bugles rang again ; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists , and took position .
now old <name> stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned him into hamlet 's ghost ; the king made a sign , the bugles blew , sir sagramor laid his great <name> in rest , and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind , and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him  <unk> my ear the while , as if noting the invisible <unk> position and progress by hearing , not sight .
a chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him , and one brave voice flung out a <unk> word for me  said : " go it , slim <name> ! "
it was an even bet that <name> had procured that favor for me  and furnished the language , too .
when that formidable <unk> was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside without an effort , and the big knight swept by , scoring a blank .
i got plenty of applause that time .
we turned , braced up , and down we came again .
another blank for the knight , a roar of applause for me .
this same thing was repeated once more ; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his temper , and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down .
why , he had n't any show in the world at that ; it was a game of tag , with all the advantage on my side ; i whirled out of his path with ease whenever i chose , and once i slapped him on the back as i went to the rear .
finally i took the <name> into my own hands ; and after that , turn , or twist , or do what he would , he was never able to get behind me again ; he found himself always in front at the end of his <unk> .
so he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists .
his temper was clear gone now , and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine .
i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle , and grasped the coil in my right hand .
this time you should have seen him come !  it was a business trip , sure ; by his gait there was blood in his eye .
i was sitting my horse at ease , and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head ; the moment he was under way , i started for him ; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet , i sent the <unk> spirals of the rope <unk> through the air , then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge .
the next moment the rope sprang taut and <unk> sir sagramor out of the saddle !
great <name> , but there was a sensation !
unquestionably , the popular thing in this world is novelty .
these people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before , and it carried them clear off their feet with delight .
from all around and everywhere , the shout went up : " encore !
encore ! "
i wondered where they got the word , but there was no time to cipher on <unk> matters , because the whole <unk> hive was just humming now , and my prospect for trade could n't have been better .
the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramor had been assisted to his tent , i hauled in the slack , took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again .
i was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for sir sagramor , and that could n't take long where there were so many hungry candidates .
indeed , they elected one straight off  sir <unk> de revel .
<unk> !
here he came , like a house afire ; i dodged : he passed like a flash , with my <unk> coils settling around his neck ; a second or so later , <unk> !
his saddle was empty .
i got another encore ; and another , and another , and still another .
when i had <unk> five men out , things began to look serious to the <unk> , and they stopped and consulted together .
as a result , they decided that it was time to <unk> etiquette and send their greatest and best against me .
to the astonishment of that little world , i <unk> sir <unk> de <unk> , and after him sir <unk> .
so you see there was simply nothing to be done now , but play their right bower  bring out the <unk> of the superb , the mightiest of the mighty , the great sir launcelot himself !
a proud moment for me ?
i should think so .
yonder was <name> , king of britain ; yonder was <unk> ; yes , and whole tribes of little provincial kings and <unk> ; and in the <unk> camp yonder , renowned knights from many lands ; and likewise the <unk> body known to chivalry , the knights of the table round , the most illustrious in christendom ; and biggest fact of all , the very sun of their shining system was yonder <unk> his <name> , the <unk> point of forty thousand adoring eyes ; and all by myself , here was i laying for him .
across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain <unk> of west hartford , and i wished she could see me now .
in that moment , down came the invincible , with the rush of a whirlwind  the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward  the fateful coils went circling through the air , and before you could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his back , and kissing my hand to the storm of waving <unk> and the <unk> of applause that greeted me !
said i to myself , as i coiled my lariat and <name> it on my <unk> , and sat there drunk with <name> , " the victory is perfect  no other <name> venture against me  <unk> is dead . "
now imagine my astonishment  and everybody else 's , too  to hear the peculiar <unk> which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists !
there was a mystery here ; i could n't account for this thing .
next , i noticed <name> gliding away from me ; and then i noticed that my lasso was gone !
the old <unk> expert had stolen it , sure , and slipped it under his robe .
the bugle blew again .
i looked , and down came sagramor riding again , with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely <unk> .
i trotted up to meet him , and pretended to find him by the sound of his horse 's hoofs .
he said : " <unk> quick of ear , but it <name> not save thee from this ! "
and he touched the hilt of his great sword .
" an ye are not able to see it , because of the influence of the veil , know that it is no <unk> <name> , but a sword  and i <unk> ye <name> not be able to avoid it . "
his <unk> was up ; there was death in his smile .
i should never be able to dodge his sword , that was plain .
somebody was going to die this time .
if he got the drop on me , i could name the corpse .
we rode forward together , and saluted the royalties .
this time the king was disturbed .
he said : " where is thy strange weapon ? "
" it is stolen , sire . "
" hast another at hand ? "
" no , sire , i brought only the one . "
then <name> mixed in : " he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring .
there exists none other but that one .
it <unk> to the king of the demons of the sea .
this man is a <unk> , and ignorant , else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight <unk> only , and then it <unk> away to its home under the sea . "
" then is he <unk> , " said the king .
" sir <unk> , ye <name> <name> him leave to borrow . "
" and i <name> lend ! "
said sir launcelot , limping up .
" he is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live , and he shall have mine . "
he put his hand on his sword to draw it , but sir sagramor said : " stay , it may not be .
he shall fight with his own weapons ; it was his privilege to choose them and bring them .
if he has erred , on his head be it . "
" knight ! "
said the king .
" <unk> <unk> with passion ; it <unk> thy mind .
wouldst kill a naked man ? "
" an he do it , he shall answer it to me , " said sir launcelot .
" i <name> answer it to any he that <unk> ! "
retorted sir sagramor hotly .
<name> broke in , rubbing his hands and smiling his <unk> smile of malicious gratification : " 't is well said , right well said !
and 't is enough of <unk> , let my lord the king deliver the battle signal . "
the king had to yield .
the bugle made proclamation , and we turned apart and rode to our stations .
there we stood , a hundred yards apart , facing each other , rigid and motionless , like <unk> statues .
and so we remained , in a <unk> hush , as much as a full minute , everybody gazing , nobody stirring .
it seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal .
but at last he lifted his hand , the clear note of the bugle followed , sir sagramor 's long blade described a flashing curve in the air , and it was superb to see him come .
i sat still .
on he came .
i did not move .
people got so excited that they shouted to me : " fly , fly !
save thyself !
this is <unk> ! "
i never <unk> so much as an inch till that thundering apparition had got within fifteen paces of me ; then i snatched a <unk> revolver out of my holster , there was a flash and a roar , and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened .
here was a <unk> horse plunging by , and yonder lay sir sagramor , stone dead .
the people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible , no hurt upon his body , nothing like a wound .
there was a hole through the breast of his <unk> , but they attached no importance to a little thing like that ; and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood , none came in sight because of the clothing and <unk> under the armor .
the body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it .
they were stupefied with astonishment naturally .
i was requested to come and explain the miracle .
but i remained in my tracks , like a statue , and said : " if it is a command , i <name> come , but my lord the king knows that i am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any <name> to come against me . "
i waited .
nobody challenged .
then i said : " if there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won , i do not wait for them to challenge me , i challenge them . "
" it is a gallant offer , " said the king , " and well <unk> you .
whom <name> you name first ? "
" i name none , i challenge all !
here i stand , and dare the chivalry of england to come against me  not by individuals , but in mass ! "
" what ! "
shouted a score of knights .
" you have heard the challenge .
take it , or i proclaim you <unk> knights and vanquished , every one ! "
it was a " bluff " you know .
at such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth ; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to " call , " and you rake in the chips .
but just this once  well , things looked <unk> !
in just no time , five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles , and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me .
i snatched both revolvers from the <unk> and began to measure distances and calculate chances .
bang !
one saddle empty .
bang !
another one .
bang  bang , and i <unk> two .
well , it was nip and tuck with us , and i knew it .
if i spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people , the twelfth man would kill me , sure .
and so i never did feel so happy as i did when my ninth <unk> its man and i detected the wavering in the crowd which is <unk> of panic .
an instant lost now could knock out my last chance .
but i did n't lose it .
i raised both revolvers and pointed them  the halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment , then broke and fled .
the day was mine .
<unk> was a doomed institution .
the march of civilization was begun .
how did i feel ?
ah , you never could imagine it .
and <unk> <name> ?
his stock was flat again .
somehow , every time the magic of <unk> tried conclusions with the magic of science , the magic of <unk> got left .
chapter xl three years later when i broke the back of <unk> that time , i no longer felt obliged to work in secret .
so , the very next day i exposed my hidden schools , my mines , and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world .
that is to say , i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth .
well , it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly .
the knights were temporarily down , but if i would keep them so i must just simply <unk> them  nothing short of that would answer .
you see , i was " <unk> " that last time in the field ; it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion , if i gave them a chance .
so i must not give them time ; and i did n't .
i renewed my challenge , engraved it on brass , posted it up where any priest could read it to them , and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper .
i not only renewed it , but added to its proportions .
i said , name the day , and i would take fifty assistants and stand up against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it .
i was not <unk> this time .
i meant what i said ; i could do what i promised .
there was n't any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge .
even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of " put up , or shut up . "
they were wise and did the latter .
in all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning .
consider the three years sped .
now look around on england .
a happy and prosperous country , and strangely altered .
schools everywhere , and several colleges ; a number of pretty good newspapers .
even authorship was taking a start ; sir <unk> the humorist was first in the field , with a volume of gray-headed jokes which i had been familiar with during thirteen centuries .
if he had left out that old <unk> one about the lecturer i would n't have said anything ; but i could n't stand that one .
i suppressed the book and hanged the author .
slavery was dead and gone ; all men were equal before the law ; taxation had been <unk> .
the telegraph , the telephone , the phonograph , the typewriter , the <unk> , and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor .
we had a steamboat or two on the thames , we had steam warships , and the beginnings of a steam commercial <name> ; i was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover <name> .
we were building several lines of railway , and our line from camelot to london was already finished and in operation .
i was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor .
my idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility , and make them useful and keep them out of mischief .
the plan worked very well , the competition for the places was hot .
the conductor of the <unk> express was a duke ; there was n't a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of <name> .
they were good men , every one , but they had two defects which i could n't cure , and so had to wink at : they would n't lay aside their armor , and they would " knock down " fare  i mean <name> the company .
there was hardly a knight in all the land who was n't in some useful employment .
they were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities ; their <unk> for wandering , and their experience in it , made them altogether the most effective <unk> of civilization we had .
they went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and <name> and battle-axe , and if they couldn't persuade a person to try a <unk> on the <unk> plan , or a <unk> , or a <unk> fence , or a prohibition journal , or any of the other thousand and one things they <unk> for , they removed him and passed on .
i was very happy .
things were working steadily toward a secretly <unk> point .
you see , i had two schemes in my head which were the <unk> of all my projects .
the one was to overthrow the catholic church and set up the protestant <name> on its ruins  not as an established church , but a <unk> one ; and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by , commanding that upon <name> 's death unlimited suffrage should be introduced , and given to men and women alike  at any rate to all men , wise or unwise , and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one .
<name> was good for thirty years yet , he being about my own age  that is to say , forty  and i believed that in that time i could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the world  a rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed .
the result to be a republic .
well , i may as well confess , though i do feel ashamed when i think of it : i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself .
yes , there was more or less human nature in me ; i found that out .
<name> was with me as concerned the revolution , but in a modified way .
his idea was a republic , without privileged orders , but with a hereditary <name> family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate .
he believed that no nation that had ever known the <name> of worshiping a <name> family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy .
i urged that kings were dangerous .
he said , then have cats .
he was sure that a <name> family of cats would answer every purpose .
they would be as useful as any other <name> family , they would know as much , they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries , the same disposition to get up <unk> with other <name> cats , they would be <unk> vain and absurd and never know it , they would be wholly <unk> ; finally , they would have as sound a divine right as any other <name> house , and " <name> vii , or <name> xi , or <name> xiv by the <name> of god king , " would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary <name> <unk> with tights on .
" and as a rule , " said he , in his neat modern english , " the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king , and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation , for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarch 's .
the worship of royalty being founded in <unk> , these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties , and indeed more so , because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody , beheaded nobody , imprisoned nobody , inflicted no cruelties or <unk> of any sort , and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king , and would certainly get it .
the eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system , and <name> butchers would presently begin to disappear ; their subjects would fill the vacancies with <unk> from our own <name> house ; we should become a factory ; we should supply the thrones of the world ; within forty years all europe would be governed by cats , and we should furnish the cats .
the reign of universal peace would begin then , to end no more forever ... .
<unk>  <unk> !  wow ! "
<name> him , i supposed he was in <name> , and was beginning to be persuaded by him , until he exploded that <unk> and startled me almost out of my clothes .
but he never could be in <name> .
he did n't know what it was .
he had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy , but he was too <unk> to know it , or care anything about it , either .
i was going to give him a scolding , but <name> came flying in at that moment , wild with terror , and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice .
i ran and took her in my arms , and lavished caresses upon her and said , <unk> : " speak , darling , speak !
what is it ? "
her head fell limp upon my bosom , and she gasped , almost <unk> : " <unk> ! "
" quick ! "
i shouted to <name> ; " telephone the king 's <unk> to come ! "
in two minutes i was kneeling by the child 's crib , and <name> was <unk> servants here , there , and everywhere , all over the palace .
i took in the situation almost at a glance  membranous croup !
i bent down and whispered : " wake up , sweetheart !
<unk> . "
she opened her soft eyes languidly , and made out to say : " papa . "
that was a comfort .
she was far from dead yet .
i sent for preparations of sulphur , i <unk> out the <unk> myself ; for i do n't sit down and wait for doctors when <name> or the child is sick .
i knew how to nurse both of them , and had had experience .
this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life , and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the <unk> on its <unk> when even its mother could n't .
sir launcelot , in his richest armor , came striding along the great hall now on his way to the <unk> ; he was president of the <unk> , and occupied the siege perilous , which he had bought of sir <unk> ; for the <unk> consisted of the knights of the round table , and they used the round table for business purposes now .
seats at it were worth  well , you would never believe the figure , so it is no use to state it .
sir launcelot was a bear , and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines , and was just getting ready to squeeze the <unk> to-day ; but what of that ?
he was the same old launcelot , and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick , that was enough for him ; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him , he would come right in here and stand by little <unk> for all he was worth .
and that was what he did .
he shied his helmet into the corner , and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the <unk> .
by this time <name> had built a blanket canopy over the crib , and everything was ready .
sir launcelot got up steam , he and i loaded up the kettle with <unk> lime and <unk> acid , with a touch of <unk> acid added thereto , then filled the thing up with water and inserted the <unk> under the canopy .
everything was <unk> now , and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch .
<name> was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of <unk> with <unk> and <unk> for us , and told us to smoke as much as we pleased , it could n't get under the canopy , and she was used to smoke , being the first <name> in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown .
well , there could n't be a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his <name> armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy <unk> .
he was a beautiful man , a lovely man , and was just intended to make a wife and children happy .
but , of course <unk>  however , it 's no use to cry over what 's done and ca n't be helped .
well , he stood <unk> with me , right straight through , for three days and nights , till the child was out of danger ; then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her , with his plumes falling about her golden head , then laid her softly in <unk> lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall , between the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and <unk> , and so disappeared .
and no instinct warned me that i should never look upon him again in this world !
lord , what a world of <unk> it is .
the doctors said we must take the child away , if we would coax her back to health and strength again .
and she must have <unk> .
so we took a man-of-war , and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons , and went cruising about , and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the french coast , and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there .
the little king of that region offered us his hospitalities , and we were glad to accept .
if he had had as many conveniences as he lacked , we should have been plenty comfortable enough ; even as it was , we made out very well , in his queer old castle , by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship .
at the end of a month i sent the vessel home for fresh supplies , and for news .
we expected her back in three or four days .
she would bring me , along with other news , the result of a certain experiment which i had been starting .
it was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry , keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief , and at the same time preserve the best thing in them , which was their hardy spirit of emulation .
i had had a choice band of them in private training for some time , and the date was now arriving for their first public effort .
this experiment was baseball .
in order to give the thing vogue from the start , and place it out of the reach of criticism , i chose my <unk> by rank , not capacity .
there was n't a knight in either team who was n't a <unk> sovereign .
as for material of this sort , there was a <unk> of it always around <name> .
you couldn't throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king .
of course , i could n't get these people to leave off their armor ; they wouldn't do that when they bathed .
they consented to <unk> the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other , but that was the most they would do .
so , one of the teams wore <unk> <unk> , and the other wore <unk> made of my new <unk> steel .
their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing i ever saw .
being <unk> , they never skipped out of the way , but stood still and took the result ; when a <unk> was at the bat and a ball hit him , it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes .
and when a man was running , and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base , it was like an <unk> coming into port .
at first i appointed men of no rank to act as umpires , but i had to <unk> that .
these people were no easier to please than other <unk> .
the umpire 's first decision was usually his last ; they broke him in two with a bat , and his friends <unk> him home on a shutter .
when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game , <unk> got to be unpopular .
so i was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him .
here are the names of the <unk> : <unk> <unk> king <name> .
emperor <name> .
king lot of <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of <unk> .
king <unk> of ireland .
king <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of little britain .
king <name> of cornwall .
king labor .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of the lake .
king <unk> la <unk> .
the <unk> of syria .
umpire  <name> .
the first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people ; and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see .
everything would be favorable ; it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now , and nature was all <unk> out in her new clothes .
chapter <unk> the <unk> however , my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters ; our child began to lose ground again , and we had to go to sitting up with her , her case became so serious .
we could n't bear to allow anybody to help in this service , so we two stood <unk> , day in and day out .
ah , <name> , what a right heart she had , how simple , and genuine , and good she was !
she was a flawless wife and mother ; and yet i had married her for no other particular reasons , except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field .
she had hunted britain over for me ; had found me at the <unk> outside of london , and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the <unk> way and as of right .
i was a new <unk> , and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her , sooner or later .
she could n't see how , but i cut argument short and we had a wedding .
now i did n't know i was drawing a prize , yet that was what i did draw .
within the <unk> i became her <unk> ; and ours was the dearest and <unk> comradeship that ever was .
people talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex .
what is the best of that sort , as compared with the friendship of man and wife , where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same ?
there is no place for comparison between the two friendships ; the one is earthly , the other divine .
in my dreams , along at first , i still wandered thirteen centuries away , and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and <unk> all up and down the <unk> vacancies of a vanished world .
many a time <name> heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep .
with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child , conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine .
it touched me to tears , and it also nearly knocked me off my feet , too , when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward , and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me : " the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved , here made holy , and the music of it <name> abide alway in our ears .
now thou'lt kiss me , as knowing the name i have given the child . "
but i did n't know it , all the same .
i had n't an idea in the world ; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game ; so i never let on , but said : " yes , i know , sweetheart  how dear and good it is of you , too !
but i want to hear these lips of yours , which are also mine , utter it first  then its music <name> be perfect . "
pleased to the marrow , she murmured : " <unk> ! "
i did n't laugh  i am always thankful for that  but the strain ruptured every cartilage in me , and for weeks afterward i could hear my bones clack when i walked .
she never found out her mistake .
the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised , and not pleased ; but i told her i had given order for it : that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality , in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake .
this was not true .
but it answered .
well , during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib , and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sick-room .
then our reward came : the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend .
grateful ?
it is n't the term .
there isn't any term for it .
you know that yourself , if you've watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one <unk> smile that you could cover with your hand .
why , we were back in this world in one instant !
then we looked the same startled thought into each other 's eyes at the same moment ; more than two weeks gone , and that ship not back yet !
in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train .
they had been steeped in troubled <unk> all this time  their faces showed it .
i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea .
where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its <unk> flocks ?
vanished , every one !
not a sail , from verge to verge , not a <unk>  just a dead and empty solitude , in place of all that brisk and breezy life .
i went swiftly back , saying not a word to anybody .
i told <name> this ghastly news .
we could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain .
had there been an invasion ?
an earthquake ?
a pestilence ?
had the nation been swept out of existence ?
but guessing was <unk> .
i must go  at once .
i borrowed the king's navy  a " ship " no bigger than a steam launch  and was soon ready .
the parting  ah , yes , that was hard .
as i was devouring the child with last kisses , it <unk> up and <unk> out its vocabulary !
 the first time in more than two weeks , and it made fools of us for <name> .
the darling <unk> of childhood !  dear me , there 's no music that can touch it ; and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness , knowing it <name> never visit his bereaved ear again .
well , how good it was to be able to <name> that gracious memory away with me !
i approached england the next morning , with the wide highway of salt water all to myself .
there were ships in the harbor , at dover , but they were naked as to sails , and there was no sign of life about them .
it was <name> ; yet at canterbury the streets were empty ; strangest of all , there was not even a priest in sight , and no stroke of a <name> fell upon my ear .
the <unk> of death was everywhere .
i could n't understand it .
at last , in the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession  just a family and a few friends following a coffin  no priest ; a funeral without <name> , book , or candle ; there was a church there close at hand , but they passed it by weeping , and did not enter it ; i glanced up at the belfry , and there <name> the <name> , shrouded in black , and its tongue tied back .
now i knew !
now i understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england .
invasion ?
invasion is a <unk> to it .
it was the <unk> !
i asked no questions ; i did n't need to ask any .
the church had struck ; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise , and go warily .
one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes , and when we were safe beyond the town i put them on , and from that time i traveled alone ; i could not risk the embarrassment of company .
a miserable journey .
a desolate silence everywhere .
even in london itself .
traffic had ceased ; men did not talk or laugh , or go in groups , or even in couples ; they moved aimlessly about , each man by himself , with his head down , and woe and terror at his heart .
the tower showed recent <unk> .
verily , much had been happening .
of course , i meant to take the train for camelot .
train !
why , the station was as vacant as a cavern .
i moved on .
the journey to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen .
the monday and the tuesday differed in no way from the <name> .
i arrived far in the night .
from being the best <unk> town in the kingdom and the most like a <unk> sun of anything you ever saw , it was become simply a blot  a blot upon darkness  that is to say , it was darker and <unk> than the rest of the darkness , and so you could see it a little better ; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical  a sort of sign that the church was going to keep the upper hand now , and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that .
i found no life stirring in the somber streets .
i groped my way with a heavy heart .
the vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop , not a spark visible about it .
the drawbridge was down , the great gate stood wide , i entered without challenge , my own heels making the only sound i heard  and it was sepulchral enough , in those huge vacant courts .
chapter <unk> war !
i found <name> alone in his quarters , drowned in melancholy ; and in place of the electric light , he had <unk> the ancient <unk> , and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains drawn tight .
he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly , saying : " oh , it 's worth a billion <unk> to look upon a live person again ! "
he knew me as easily as if i had n't been disguised at all .
which frightened me ; one may easily believe that .
" quick , now , tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster , " i said .
" how did it come about ? "
" well , if there had n't been any <name> <unk> , it would n't have come so early ; but it would have come , anyway .
it would have come on your own account by and by ; by luck , it happened to come on the <name> 's . "
" and sir launcelot 's ? "
" just so . "
" give me the details . "
" i reckon you <name> <name> that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the <name> and sir launcelot  " " yes , king <name> 's . "
"  and only one heart that was without suspicion  " " yes  the king 's ; a heart that is n't capable of thinking evil of a friend . "
" well , the king might have gone on , still happy and unsuspecting , to the end of his days , but for one of your modern improvements  the <unk> .
when you left , three miles of the london , canterbury and dover were ready for the rails , and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the <unk> .
it was wildcat , and everybody knew it .
the stock was for sale at a <unk> .
what does sir launcelot do , but  " " yes , i know ; he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song ; then he bought about twice as much more , <unk> upon call ; and he was about to call when i left . "
" very well , he did call .
the boys could n't deliver .
oh , he had them  and he just settled his grip and squeezed them .
they were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at 15 and 16 and along there that was n't worth 10 .
well , when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths , they <unk> that side by shifting the laugh to the other side .
that was when they compromised with the invincible at 283 ! "
" good land ! "
" he skinned them alive , and they deserved it  anyway , the whole kingdom rejoiced .
well , among the flayed were sir <unk> and sir mordred , nephews to the king .
end of the first act .
act second , scene first , an apartment in carlisle castle , where the court had gone for a few days ' hunting .
persons present , the whole tribe of the king 's nephews .
mordred and <unk> propose to call the guileless <name> 's attention to <unk> and sir launcelot .
sir gawaine , sir gareth , and sir <unk> <name> have nothing to do with it .
a dispute ensues , with loud talk ; in the midst of it enter the king .
mordred and <unk> spring their devastating tale upon him .
<unk> .
a trap is laid for launcelot , by the king 's command , and sir launcelot walks into it .
he made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses  to wit , mordred , <unk> , and twelve knights of lesser rank , for he killed every one of them but mordred ; but of course that couldn't straighten matters between launcelot and the king , and did n't . "
" oh , dear , only one thing could result  i see that .
war , and the knights of the realm divided into a king 's party and a sir launcelot 's party . "
" yes  that was the way of it .
the king sent the <name> to the stake , proposing to purify her with fire .
launcelot and his knights rescued her , and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine  in fact , some of the best we ever had ; to wit , sir <unk> <name> <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> <name> <unk> de dieu , sir <unk> , sir <unk>  " " oh , you tear out my <unk> . "
"  wait , i 'm not done yet  sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk>  " " the very best man in my subordinate nine .
what a handy <unk> he was ! "
"  sir <unk> 's three brothers , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <name> the stranger  " " my peerless <unk> !
i 've seen him catch a <unk> in his teeth .
come , i ca n't stand this ! "
"  sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , and  whom do you think ? "
" rush !
go on . "
" sir <unk> , and sir gareth  both ! "
" oh , incredible !
their love for launcelot was indestructible . "
" well , it was an accident .
they were simply onlookers ; they were unarmed , and were merely there to witness the <name> 's punishment .
sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury , and he killed these without noticing who they were .
here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle ; it's for sale on every <unk> .
there  the figures nearest the <name> are sir launcelot with his sword up , and sir gareth gasping his latest breath .
you can catch the agony in the <name> 's face through the curling smoke .
it 's a rattling <unk> . "
" indeed , it is .
we must take good care of it ; its historical value is incalculable .
go on . "
" well , the rest of the tale is just war , pure and simple .
launcelot retreated to his town and castle of joyous <unk> , and gathered there a great following of knights .
the king , with a great host , went there , and there was desperate fighting during several days , and , as a result , all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast-iron .
then the church patched up a peace between <name> and launcelot and the <name> and everybody  everybody but sir gawaine .
he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers , gareth and <unk> , and would not be appeased .
he notified launcelot to get him thence , and make swift preparation , and look to be soon attacked .
so launcelot sailed to his duchy of <unk> with his following , and gawaine soon followed with an army , and he beguiled <name> to go with him .
<name> left the kingdom in sir mordred 's hands until you should return  " " ah  a king 's customary wisdom ! "
" yes .
sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent .
he was going to marry <unk> , as a first move ; but she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london .
mordred attacked ; the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the <unk> .
the king returned ; mordred fought him at dover , at canterbury , and again at <unk> down .
then there was talk of peace and a composition .
terms , mordred to have cornwall and <name> during <name> 's life , and the whole kingdom afterward . "
" well , upon my word !
my dream of a republic to be a dream , and so remain . "
" yes .
the two armies lay near salisbury .
gawaine  gawaine 's head is at dover castle , he fell in the fight there  gawaine appeared to <name> in a dream , at least his ghost did , and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month , let the delay cost what it might .
but battle was precipitated by an accident .
<name> had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with mordred , sound the trumpet and fall on !
for he had no confidence in mordred .
mordred had given a similar order to his people .
well , by and by an <unk> bit a knight 's heel ; the knight forgot all about the order , and made a slash at the <unk> with his sword .
inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash !
they butchered away all day .
then the king  however , we have started something fresh since you left  our paper has . "
" no ?
what is that ? "
" war correspondence ! "
" why , that 's good . "
" yes , the paper was booming right along , for the <unk> made no impression , got no grip , while the war lasted .
i had war correspondents with both armies .
i <name> finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says : 'then the king looked about him , and then was he ware of all his host and of all his good knights were left no more on live but two knights , that was sir <unk> de <unk> , and his brother sir <unk> : and they were full sore wounded .
<unk> <name> , said the king , where are all my <name> knights <unk> ?
alas that ever i should see this doleful day .
for now , said <name> , i am come to mine end .
but would to god that i <unk> where were that traitor sir mordred , that hath caused all this mischief .
then was king <name> ware where sir mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men .
now give me my spear , said <name> unto sir <unk> , for yonder i have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought .
sir , let him be , said sir <unk> , for he is unhappy ; and if ye pass this unhappy day , ye shall be right well revenged upon him .
good lord , remember ye of your night 's dream , and what the spirit of sir gawaine told you this night , yet god of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto .
therefore , for god's sake , my lord , leave off by this .
for blessed be god ye have won the field : for here we be three on live , and with sir mordred is none on live .
and if ye leave off now , this wicked day of <name> is past .
tide me death , betide me life , saith the king , now i see him yonder alone , he shall never escape mine hands , for at a better avail shall i never have him .
god speed you well , said sir <unk> .
then the king <unk> his spear in both his hands , and ran toward sir mordred crying , traitor , now is thy death day come .
and when sir mordred heard sir <name> , he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand .
and then king <name> smote sir mordred under the shield , with a <unk> of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom .
and when sir mordred felt that he had his death 's wound , he thrust himself , with the might that he had , up to the butt of king <name> 's spear .
and right so he smote his father <name> with his sword holden in both his hands , on the side of the head , that the sword pierced the helmet and the <unk> , and <unk> sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth .
and the <name> <name> fell in a swoon to the earth , and there he swooned <unk>  ' " " that is a good piece of war correspondence , <name> ; you are a first-rate newspaper man .
well  is the king all right ?
did he get well ? "
" poor soul , no .
he is dead . "
i was utterly stunned ; it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him .
" and the <name> , <name> ? "
" she is a nun , in <unk> . "
" what changes !
and in such a short while .
it is inconceivable .
what next , i wonder ? "
" i can tell you what next . "
" well ? "
" stake our lives and stand by them ! "
" what do you mean by that ? "
" the church is master now .
the <unk> included you with mordred ; it is not to be removed while you remain alive .
the clans are gathering .
the church has gathered all the knights that are left alive , and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands . "
" stuff !
with our deadly scientific <unk> ; with our hosts of trained  " " save your breath  we have n't sixty faithful left ! "
" what are you saying ?
our schools , our colleges , our vast workshops , our  " " when those knights come , those establishments <name> empty themselves and go over to the enemy .
did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people ? "
" i certainly did think it . "
" well , then , you may <unk> it .
they stood every strain easily  until the <unk> .
since then , they merely put on a bold outside  at heart they are quaking .
make up your mind to it  when the armies come , the mask <name> fall . "
" it 's hard news .
we are lost .
they <name> turn our own science against us . "
" no they wo n't . "
" why ? "
" because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game .
i 'll tell you what i 've done , and what moved me to it .
smart as you are , the church was <unk> .
it was the church that sent you cruising  through her servants , the doctors . "
" <name> ! "
" it is the truth .
i know it .
every officer of your ship was the church 's picked servant , and so was every man of the crew . "
" oh , come ! "
" it is just as i tell you .
i did not find out these things at once , but i found them out finally .
did you send me verbal information , by the commander of the ship , to the effect that upon his return to you , with supplies , you were going to leave cadiz  " " cadiz !
i have n't been at cadiz at all ! "
"  going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely , for the health of your family ?
did you send me that word ? "
" of course not .
i would have written , would n't i ? "
" naturally .
i was troubled and suspicious .
when the commander sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him .
i have never heard of vessel or spy since .
i gave myself two weeks to hear from you in .
then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz .
there was a reason why i did n't . "
" what was that ? "
" our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared !
also , as suddenly and as mysteriously , the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased , the men all deserted , poles were cut down , the church laid a ban upon the electric light !
i had to be up and doing  and straight off .
your life was safe  nobody in these kingdoms but <name> would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back  i had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming .
i felt safe myself  nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours .
so this is what i did .
from our various works i selected all the men  boys i mean  whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure i could swear to , and i called them together secretly and gave them their instructions .
there are fifty-two of them ; none younger than fourteen , and none above seventeen years old . "
" why did you select boys ? "
" because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it .
it is in their blood and bones .
we imagined we had educated it out of them ; they thought so , too ; the <unk> woke them up like a <unk> !
it revealed them to themselves , and it revealed them to me , too .
with boys it was different .
such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the church 's terrors , and it was among these that i found my fifty-two .
as a next move , i paid a private visit to that old cave of <name> 's  not the small one  the big one  " " yes , the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when i was projecting a miracle . "
" just so .
and as that miracle had n't become necessary then , i thought it might be a good idea to <unk> the plant now .
i've <unk> the cave for a siege  " " a good idea , a first-rate idea . "
" i think so .
i placed four of my boys there as a guard  inside , and out of sight .
nobody was to be hurt  while outside ; but any attempt to enter  well , we said just let anybody try it !
then i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories , mills , workshops , magazines , etc. , and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave , and nobody but you and i suspects where the other end of it goes to .
we laid it under ground , of course , and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so .
we sha'n't have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization . "
" it was the right move  and the natural one ; military necessity , in the changed condition of things .
well , what changes have come !
we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other , but  however , go on . "
" next , we built a wire fence . "
" wire fence ? "
" yes .
you dropped the hint of it yourself , two or three years ago . "
" oh , i remember  the time the church tried her strength against us the first time , and presently thought it wise to wait for a <unk> season .
well , how have you arranged the fence ? "
" i start twelve immensely strong wires  naked , not insulated  from a big <unk> in the cave  <unk> with no brushes except a positive and a negative one  " " yes , that 's right . "
" the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter ; they make twelve independent fences , ten feet apart  that is to say , twelve circles within circles  and their ends come into the cave again . "
" right ; go on . "
" the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart , and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground . "
" that is good and strong . "
" yes .
the wires have no <unk> outside of the cave .
they go out from the positive brush of the <unk> ; there is a <unk> through the negative brush ; the other ends of the wire return to the cave , and each is grounded independently . "
" no , no , that wo n't do ! "
" why ? "
" it 's too expensive  uses up force for nothing .
you do n't want any <unk> except the one through the negative brush .
the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently , and without any <unk> .
now , then , observe the economy of it .
a cavalry charge <unk> itself against the fence ; you are using no power , you are spending no money , for there is only one <unk> till those horses come against the wire ; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush through the ground , and drop dead .
do n't you see ?  you are using no energy until it is needed ; your lightning is there , and ready , like the load in a gun ; but it is n't <unk> you a cent till you touch it off .
oh , yes , the single <unk>  " " of course !
i do n't know how i overlooked that .
it 's not only cheaper , but it 's more effectual than the other way , for if wires break or get tangled , no harm is done . "
" no , especially if we have a <unk> in the cave and <unk> the broken wire .
well , go on .
the <unk> ? "
" yes  that 's arranged .
in the center of the inner circle , on a spacious platform six feet high , i 've grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns , and provided plenty of ammunition . "
" that 's it .
they command every approach , and when the <unk> knights arrive , there 's going to be music .
the brow of the precipice over the cave  " " i 've got a wire fence there , and a gatling .
they wo n't drop any rocks down on us . "
" well , and the <unk> dynamite torpedoes ? "
" that 's attended to .
it 's the prettiest garden that was ever planted .
it 's a belt forty feet wide , and goes around the outer fence  distance between it and the fence one hundred yards  kind of neutral ground that space is .
there is n't a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo .
we laid them on the surface of the ground , and sprinkled a layer of sand over them .
it 's an innocent looking garden , but you let a man start in to hoe it once , and you 'll see . "
" you tested the torpedoes ? "
" well , i was going to , but  " " but what ?
why , it 's an immense oversight not to apply a  " " test ?
yes , i know ; but they 're all right ; i laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they 've been tested . "
" oh , that alters the case .
who did it ? "
" a church committee . "
" how kind ! "
" yes .
they came to command us to make submission .
you see they did n't really come to test the torpedoes ; that was merely an incident . "
" did the committee make a report ? "
" yes , they made one .
you could have heard it a mile . "
" unanimous ? "
" that was the nature of it .
after that i put up some signs , for the protection of future committees , and we have had no intruders since . "
" <name> , you 've done a world of work , and done it perfectly . "
" we had plenty of time for it ; there was n't any occasion for hurry . "
we sat silent awhile , thinking .
then my mind was made up , and i said : " yes , everything is ready ; everything is <unk> , no detail is wanting .
i know what to do now . "
" so do i ; sit down and wait . "
" no , sir !
rise up and strike ! "
" do you mean it ? "
" yes , indeed !
the <unk> is n't in my line , and the <unk> is .
that is , when i hold a fair hand  two-thirds as good a hand as the enemy .
oh , yes , we 'll rise up and strike ; that 's our game . "
" a hundred to one you are right .
when does the performance begin ? "
" now !  we 'll proclaim the republic . "
" well , that <name> precipitate things , sure enough ! "
" it <name> make them buzz , i tell you !
england <name> be a <unk> nest before noon to-morrow , if the church 's hand has n't lost its cunning  and we know it has n't .
now you write and i 'll dictate thus : " proclamation   " be it known unto all .
whereas the king having died and left no heir , it becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me , until a government shall have been created and set in motion .
the monarchy has lapsed , it no longer exists .
by consequence , all political power has reverted to its original source , the people of the nation .
with the monarchy , its several <unk> died also ; wherefore there is no longer a nobility , no longer a privileged class , no longer an established church ; all men are become exactly equal ; they are upon one common level , and religion is free .
a republic is hereby proclaimed , as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased .
it is the duty of the british people to meet together immediately , and by their votes elect representatives and deliver into their hands the government . "
i signed it " the boss , " and dated it from <name> 's cave .
<name> said  " why , that tells where we are , and invites them to call right away . "
" that is the idea .
we strike  by the proclamation  then it's their innings .
now have the thing set up and printed and posted , right off ; that is , give the order ; then , if you 've got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill , ho for <name> 's cave ! "
" i shall be ready in ten minutes .
what a cyclone there is going to be to-morrow when this piece of paper gets to work ! ...
it 's a pleasant old palace , this is ; i wonder if we shall ever again  but never mind about that . "
chapter <unk> the battle of the sand belt in <name> 's cave  <name> and i and fifty-two fresh , bright , well-educated , <unk> young british boys .
at <name> i sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance , as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines , " and no telling at what moment  therefore , vacate at once . "
these people knew me , and had confidence in my word .
they would clear out without waiting to part their hair , and i could take my own time about <unk> the explosion .
you could n't hire one of them to go back during the century , if the explosion was still impending .
we had a week of waiting .
it was not dull for me , because i was writing all the time .
during the first three days , i finished turning my old diary into this narrative form ; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date .
the rest of the week i took up in writing letters to my wife .
it was always my habit to write to <name> every day , whenever we were separate , and now i kept up the habit for love of it , and of her , though i couldn't do anything with the letters , of course , after i had written them .
but it put in the time , you see , and was almost like talking ; it was almost as if i was saying , " <name> , if you and <unk> were here in the cave , instead of only your photographs , what good times we could have ! "
and then , you know , i could imagine the baby <unk> something out in reply , with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mother 's lap on its back , and she <unk> and admiring and <unk> , and now and then tickling under the baby 's <name> to set it <unk> , and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself  and so on and so on  well , do n't you know , i could sit there in the cave with my pen , and keep it up , that way , by the hour with them .
why , it was almost like having us all together again .
i had spies out every night , of course , to get news .
every report made things look more and more impressive .
the hosts were gathering , gathering ; down all the roads and paths of england the knights were riding , and priests rode with them , to hearten these original crusaders , this being the church 's war .
all the nobilities , big and little , were on their way , and all the gentry .
this was all as was expected .
we should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and  ah , what a donkey i was !
toward the end of the week i began to get this large and <unk> fact through my head : that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day , and there an end !
the church , the nobles , and the gentry then turned one grand , <unk> frown upon them and <unk> them into sheep !
from that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold  that is to say , the camps  and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the " righteous cause . "
why , even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the " righteous cause , " and <unk> it , praying for it , <unk> <unk> over it , just like all the other <unk> .
imagine such human muck as this ; conceive of this folly !
yes , it was now " death to the republic ! "
everywhere  not a <unk> voice .
all england was marching against us !
truly , this was more than i had bargained for .
i watched my fifty-two boys narrowly ; watched their faces , their walk , their unconscious attitudes : for all these are a language  a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency , when we have secrets which we want to keep .
i knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts , all england is marching against us !  and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition , ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations , until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it , but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say , all england  all england !  is marching against you !
i knew all this would happen ; i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance ; therefore , i must be ready with an answer at that time  an answer well chosen and <unk> .
i was right .
the time came .
they had to speak .
poor lads , it was pitiful to see , they were so pale , so worn , so troubled .
at first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words ; but he presently got both .
this is what he said  and he put it in the neat modern english taught him in my schools : " we have tried to forget what we are  english boys !
we have tried to put reason before sentiment , duty before love ; our minds approve , but our hearts reproach us .
while apparently it was only the nobility , only the gentry , only the twenty-five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars , we were of one mind , and undisturbed by any troubling doubt ; each and every one of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you , said , 'they have chosen  it is their affair . '
but think !  the matter is altered  all england is marching against us !
oh , sir , consider !
 reflect !  these people are our people , they are bone of our bone , flesh of our flesh , we love them  do not ask us to destroy our nation ! "
well , it shows the value of looking ahead , and being ready for a thing when it happens .
if i had n't foreseen this thing and been fixed , that boy would have had me !  i could n't have said a word .
but i was fixed .
i said : " my boys , your hearts are in the right place , you have thought the worthy thought , you have done the worthy thing .
you are english boys , you <name> remain english boys , and you <name> keep that name <unk> .
give yourselves no further concern , let your minds be at peace .
consider this : while all england is marching against us , who is in the van ?
who , by the commonest rules of war , <name> march in the front ?
answer me . "
" the mounted host of mailed knights . "
" true .
they are thirty thousand strong .
acres deep they <name> march .
now , observe : none but they <name> ever strike the <unk> !
then there <name> be an episode !
immediately after , the civilian multitude in the rear <name> retire , to meet business engagements elsewhere .
none but nobles and gentry are knights , and none but these <name> remain to dance to our music after that episode .
it is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights .
now speak , and it shall be as you decide .
shall we avoid the battle , retire from the field ? "
" no ! ! ! "
the shout was unanimous and hearty .
" are you  are you  well , afraid of these thirty thousand knights ? "
that joke brought out a good laugh , the boys ' troubles vanished away , and they went gaily to their posts .
ah , they were a darling fifty-two !
as pretty as girls , too .
i was ready for the enemy now .
let the approaching big day come along  it would find us on deck .
the big day arrived on time .
at <name> the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon , and a faint sound which he thought to be military music .
breakfast was just ready ; we sat down and ate it .
this over , i made the boys a little speech , and then sent out a detail to man the battery , with <name> in command of it .
the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land , and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us , with the steady drift and <unk> front of a wave of the sea .
nearer and nearer it came , and more and more <unk> imposing became its aspect ; yes , all england was there , apparently .
soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering , and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all <unk> .
yes , it was a fine sight ; i had n't ever seen anything to beat it .
at last we could make out details .
all the front ranks , no telling how many acres deep , were horsemen  plumed knights in armor .
suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets ; the slow walk burst into a gallop , and then  well , it was wonderful to see !
down swept that vast horse-shoe wave  it approached the <unk>  my breath stood still ; nearer , nearer  the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow  narrower still  became a mere ribbon in front of the horses  then disappeared under their hoofs .
great <name> !
why , the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a <unk> , and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments ; and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight .
time for the second step in the plan of campaign !
i touched a button , and shook the bones of england loose from her spine !
in that explosion all our <name> <unk> went up in the air and disappeared from the earth .
it was a pity , but it was necessary .
we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us .
now ensued one of the dullest <unk> i had ever endured .
we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire , and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these .
we couldn't see over the wall of smoke , and we could n't see through it .
but at last it began to shred away lazily , and by the end of another <unk> the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself .
no living creature was in sight !
we now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses .
the dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide , all around us , and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both borders of it .
as to destruction of life , it was amazing .
moreover , it was beyond estimate .
of course , we could not count the dead , because they did not exist as individuals , but merely as homogeneous protoplasm , with <unk> of iron and buttons .
no life was in sight , but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks , who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke ; there would be sickness among the others  there always is , after an episode like that .
but there would be no reinforcements ; this was the last stand of the chivalry of england ; it was all that was left of the order , after the recent <unk> wars .
so i felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small ; that is , of knights .
i therefore issued a <unk> proclamation to my army in these words : soldiers , champions of human <name> and equality : your general <unk> you !
in the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown , an arrogant enemy came against you .
you were ready .
the conflict was brief ; on your side , glorious .
this mighty victory , having been achieved utterly without loss , stands without example in history .
so long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits , the battle of the <unk> <name> not perish out of the memories of men .
the boss .
i read it well , and the applause i got was very gratifying to me .
i then wound up with these remarks : " the war with the english nation , as a nation , is at an end .
the nation has retired from the field and the war .
before it can be persuaded to return , war <name> have ceased .
this campaign is the only one that is going to be fought .
it <name> be brief  the briefest in history .
also the most destructive to life , considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to <name> engaged .
we are done with the nation ; henceforth we deal only with the knights .
english knights can be killed , but they can not be conquered .
we know what is before us .
while one of these men remains alive , our task is not finished , the war is not ended .
we <name> kill them all . "
[ loud and long continued applause . ]
i <unk> the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion  merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again .
next , i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south , to turn a mountain <name> that was there , and bring it within our lines and under our command , arranging it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency .
the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each , and were to relieve each other every two hours .
in ten hours the work was accomplished .
it was nightfall now , and i withdrew my pickets .
the one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight , but visible with the glass only .
he also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us , and had driven some cattle across our lines , but that the knights themselves had not come very near .
that was what i had been expecting .
they were feeling us , you see ; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again .
they would grow bolder in the night , perhaps .
i believed i knew what project they would attempt , because it was plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places and as ignorant as they were .
i mentioned it to <name> .
" i think you are right , " said he ; " it is the obvious thing for them to try . "
" well , then , " i said , " if they do it they are doomed . "
" certainly . "
" they wo n't have the slightest show in the world . "
" of course they wo n't . "
" it 's dreadful , <name> .
it seems an awful pity . "
the thing disturbed me so that i could n't get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it .
so , at last , to quiet my conscience , i framed this message to the knights : to the honorable the commander of the <unk> chivalry of england : you fight in vain .
we know your strength  if one may call it by that name .
we know that at the utmost you can not bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights .
therefore , you have no chance  none whatever .
reflect : we are well equipped , well fortified , we number 54 .
fifty-four what ?
men ?
no , minds  the <unk> in the world ; a force against which mere animal might may no more <name> to prevail than may the idle waves of the sea <name> to prevail against the granite barriers of england .
be advised .
we offer you your lives ; for the sake of your families , do not reject the gift .
we offer you this chance , and it is the last : throw down your arms ; surrender unconditionally to the republic , and all <name> be forgiven .
( signed ) the boss .
i read it to <name> , and said i proposed to send it by a flag of truce .
he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with , and said : " somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are .
now let us save a little time and trouble .
consider me the commander of the knights yonder .
now , then , you are the flag of truce ; approach and deliver me your message , and i <name> give you your answer . "
i <unk> the idea .
i came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemy 's soldiers , produced my paper , and read it through .
for answer , <name> struck the paper out of my hand , pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain : " <unk> me this animal , and return him in a basket to the <unk> knave who sent him ; other answer have i none ! "
how empty is theory in presence of fact !
and this was just fact , and nothing else .
it was the thing that would have happened , there was no getting around that .
i tore up the paper and granted my <unk> <unk> a permanent rest .
then , to business .
i tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave , and made sure that they were all right ; i tested and <unk> those which commanded the fences  these were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at <name> .
i placed the <unk> under the guard and authority of three of my best boys , who would alternate in <unk> watches all night and promptly obey my signal , if i should have occasion to give it  three <unk> in quick succession .
<unk> was discarded for the night , and the corral left empty of life ; i ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave , and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer .
as soon as it was good and dark , i shut off the current from all the fences , and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch .
i crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch .
but it was too dark to see anything .
as for sounds , there were none .
the stillness was <unk> .
true , there were the usual <unk> of the country  the whir of <unk> , the buzzing of insects , the barking of distant dogs , the mellow lowing of far-off kine  but these did n't seem to break the stillness , they only intensified it , and added a <unk> melancholy to it into the bargain .
i presently gave up looking , the night shut down so black , but i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound , for i judged i had only to wait , and i should n't be disappointed .
however , i had to wait a long time .
at last i caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound .
i pricked up my ears , then , and held my breath , for this was the sort of thing i had been waiting for .
this sound thickened , and approached  from toward the north .
presently , i heard it at my own level  the <unk> of the opposite embankment , a hundred feet or more away .
then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridge  human heads ?
i could n't tell ; it might n't be anything at all ; you ca n't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus .
however , the question was soon settled .
i heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch .
it augmented fast , it spread all along , and it unmistakably furnished me this fact : an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch .
yes , these people were arranging a little surprise party for us .
we could expect entertainment about <name> , possibly earlier .
i groped my way back to the corral now ; i had seen enough .
i went to the platform and <unk> to turn the current on to the two inner fences .
then i went into the cave , and found everything satisfactory there  nobody awake but the <unk> .
i woke <name> and told him the great ditch was filling up with men , and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body .
it was my notion that as soon as <name> approached we could expect the ditch 's <unk> thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault , and be followed immediately by the rest of their army .
<name> said : " they <name> be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations .
why not take the lightning off the outer fences , and give them a chance ? "
" i 've already done it , <name> .
did you ever know me to be inhospitable ? "
" no , you are a good heart .
i want to go and  " " be a reception committee ?
i <name> go , too . "
we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences .
even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat , but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances .
we had had to feel our way before , but we could make out to see the fence posts now .
we started a whispered conversation , but suddenly <name> broke off and said : " what is that ? "
" what is what ? "
" that thing yonder . "
" what thing  where ? "
" there beyond you a little piece  dark something  a dull shape of some kind  against the second fence . "
i gazed and he gazed .
i said : " could it be a man , <name> ? "
" no , i think not .
if you notice , it looks a lit  why , it is a man !  leaning on the fence . "
" i certainly believe it is ; let us go and see . "
we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close , and then looked up .
yes , it was a man  a dim great figure in armor , standing erect , with both hands on the upper wire  and , of course , there was a smell of burning flesh .
poor fellow , dead as a <unk> , and never knew what hurt him .
he stood there like a statue  no motion about him , except that his plumes <unk> about a little in the night wind .
we rose up and looked in through the bars of his <unk> , but could n't make out whether we knew him or not  features too dim and shadowed .
we heard muffled sounds approaching , and we sank down to the ground where we were .
we made out another knight vaguely ; he was coming very stealthily , and feeling his way .
he was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand , find an upper wire , then bend and step under it and over the lower one .
now he arrived at the first knight  and started slightly when he discovered him .
he stood a moment  no doubt wondering why the other one did n't move on ; then he said , in a low voice , " why <unk> thou here , good sir mar  " then he laid his hand on the corpse 's shoulder  and just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead .
killed by a dead man , you see  killed by a dead friend , in fact .
there was something awful about it .
these early birds came scattering along after each other , about one every five minutes in our vicinity , during half an hour .
they brought no armor of offense but their swords ; as a rule , they carried the sword ready in the hand , and put it forward and found the wires with it .
we would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us ; but we knew what had happened , all the same ; poor fellow , he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been <unk> .
we had brief intervals of grim stillness , interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an <unk> ; and this sort of thing was going on , right along , and was very creepy there in the dark and <unk> .
we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences .
we elected to walk upright , for convenience 's sake ; we argued that if discerned , we should be taken for friends rather than enemies , and in any case we should be out of reach of swords , and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along .
well , it was a curious trip .
everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fence  not plainly visible , but still visible ; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues  dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire .
one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated : our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out .
pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound , and next moment we guessed what it was .
it was a surprise in force coming !
i whispered <name> to go and wake the army , and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders .
he was soon back , and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host .
one could make out but little of detail ; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence .
that swelling bulk was dead men !
our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead  a bulwark , a <unk> , of corpses , you may say .
one terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices ; there were no cheers , no war cries ; being intent upon a surprise , these men moved as noiselessly as they could ; and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready , of course they struck the fatal line and went down without <unk> .
i sent a current through the third fence now ; and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth , so quickly were the gaps filled up .
i believed the time was come now for my climax ; i believed that that whole army was in our trap .
anyway , it was high time to find out .
so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice .
land , what a sight !
we were enclosed in three walls of dead men !
all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living , who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires .
the sudden glare paralyzed this host , petrified them , you may say , with astonishment ; there was just one instant for me to <unk> their <unk> in , and i did n't lose the chance .
you see , in another instant they would have recovered their faculties , then they 'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush , and my wires would have gone down before it ; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever ; while even that slight fragment of time was still <unk> , i shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks !
there was a groan you could hear !
it voiced the <unk> of eleven thousand men .
it swelled out on the night with awful pathos .
a glance showed that the rest of the enemy  perhaps ten thousand strong  were between us and the encircling ditch , and pressing forward to the assault .
consequently we had them all !  and had them past help .
time for the last act of the tragedy .
i fired the three appointed revolver shots  which meant : " turn on the water ! "
there was a sudden rush and roar , and in a minute the mountain <name> was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep .
" stand to your guns , men !
open fire ! "
the thirteen <unk> began to <unk> death into the fated ten thousand .
they halted , they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire , then they broke , faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a <name> .
a full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment ; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over  to death by drowning .
within ten short minutes after we had opened fire , armed resistance was totally annihilated , the campaign was ended , we fifty-four were masters of england .
twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us .
but how treacherous is fortune !
in a little while  say an hour  happened a thing , by my own fault , which  but i have no heart to write that .
let the record end here .
chapter <unk> a postscript by <name> i , <name> , must write it for him .
he proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded .
i was strenuous against the project .
i said that if there were many , we could do but little for them ; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them , anyway .
but he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed ; so we shut off the electric current from the fences , took an escort along , climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights , and moved out upon the field .
the first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade .
when the boss bent over him and spoke to him , the man recognized him and stabbed him .
that knight was sir <unk> , as i found out by tearing off his helmet .
he <name> not ask for help any more .
we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound , which was not very serious , the best care we could .
in this service we had the help of <name> , though we did not know it .
he was disguised as a woman , and appeared to be a simple old peasant <unk> .
in this disguise , with <unk> face and smooth shaven , he had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook for us , saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming , and that she was starving .
the boss had been getting along very well , and had amused himself with finishing up his record .
we were glad to have this woman , for we were short handed .
we were in a trap , you see  a trap of our own making .
if we stayed where we were , our dead would kill us ; if we moved out of our defenses , we should no longer be invincible .
we had conquered ; in turn we were conquered .
the boss recognized this ; we all recognized it .
if we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy  yes , but the boss could not go , and neither could i , for i was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands .
others were taken down , and still others .
to-morrow  <unk> it is here .
and with it the end .
about midnight i awoke , and saw that <unk> making curious passes in the air about the boss 's head and face , and wondered what it meant .
everybody but the <unk> lay steeped in sleep ; there was no sound .
the woman ceased from her mysterious <unk> , and started <unk> toward the door .
i called out : " stop !
what have you been doing ? "
she halted , and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction : " ye were conquerors ; ye are conquered !
these others are perishing  you also .
ye shall all die in this place  every one  except him .
he <unk> now  and shall sleep thirteen centuries .
i am <name> ! "
then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man , and presently fetched up against one of our wires .
his mouth is spread open yet ; apparently he is still laughing .
i suppose the face <name> retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust .
the boss has never stirred  sleeps like a stone .
if he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is , and his body <name> then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none <name> ever find it to <unk> it .
as for the rest of us  well , it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place , he <name> write the fact here , and loyally hide this manuscript with the boss , our dear good chief , whose property it is , be he alive or dead .
the end of the manuscript final p.s .
by m.t .
the <name> was come when i laid the manuscript aside .
the rain had almost ceased , the world was gray and sad , the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest .
i went to the <unk> room , and listened at his door , which was slightly ajar .
i could hear his voice , and so i knocked .
there was no answer , but i still heard the voice .
i peeped in .
the man lay on his back in bed , talking brokenly but with spirit , and <unk> with his arms , which he thrashed about , restlessly , as sick people do in delirium .
i slipped in softly and bent over him .
his mutterings and ejaculations went on .
i spoke  merely a word , to call his attention .
his glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure , gratitude , gladness , welcome : " oh , <name> , you are come at last  how i have longed for you !
sit by me  do not leave me  never leave me again , <name> , never again .
where is your hand ?  give it me , dear , let me hold it  there  now all is well , all is peace , and i am happy again  we are happy again , is n't it so , <name> ?
you are so dim , so vague , you are but a mist , a cloud , but you are here , and that is <unk> sufficient ; and i have your hand ; do n't take it away  it is for only a little while , i shall not require it long ... . was that the child ? ...
<unk> ! ...
she does n't answer .
asleep , perhaps ?
bring her when she wakes , and let me touch her hands , her face , her hair , and tell her good-bye ... . <name> !
yes , you are there .
i lost myself a moment , and i thought you were gone ... . have i been sick long ?
it must be so ; it seems months to me .
and such dreams !
such strange and awful dreams , <name> !
dreams that were as real as reality  delirium , of course , but so real !
why , i thought the king was dead , i thought you were in gaul and could n't get home , i thought there was a revolution ; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams , i thought that <name> and i and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england !
but even that was not the strangest .
i seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age , centuries hence , and even that was as real as the rest !
yes , i seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours , and then forward to it again , and was set down , a stranger and forlorn in that strange england , with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you !
between me and my home and my friends !
between me and all that is dear to me , all that could make life worth the living !
it was awful  <unk> than you can ever imagine , <name> .
ah , watch by me , <name>  stay by me every moment  don't let me go out of my mind again ; death is nothing , let it come , but not with those dreams , not with the torture of those hideous dreams  i can not endure that again ... .
<name> ? ... "
he lay muttering <unk> some little time ; then for a time he lay silent , and apparently sinking away toward death .
presently his fingers began to pick busily at the <unk> , and by that sign i knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the <unk> in his throat he started up slightly , and seemed to listen : then he said : " a bugle ? ...
it is the king !
the drawbridge , there !
man the battlements !  turn out the  " he was getting up his last " effect " ; but he never finished it .
a dog 's tale by <name> twain chapter i my father was a st. <name> , my mother was a collie , but i am a presbyterian .
this is what my mother told me , i do not know these nice distinctions myself .
to me they are only fine large words meaning nothing .
my mother had a fondness for such ; she liked to say them , and see other dogs look surprised and envious , as wondering how she got so much education .
but , indeed , it was not real education ; it was only show : she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company , and by going with the children to sunday-school and listening there ; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times , and so was able to keep it until there was a <unk> gathering in the neighborhood , then she would get it off , and surprise and distress them all , from <unk> to mastiff , which rewarded her for all her trouble .
if there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious , and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant .
and she always told him .
he was never expecting this but thought he would catch her ; so when she told him , he was the one that looked ashamed , whereas he had thought it was going to be she .
the others were always waiting for this , and glad of it and proud of her , for they knew what was going to happen , because they had had experience .
when she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one ; and that was natural , because , for one thing , she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking , and for another thing , where could they find out whether it was right or not ?
for she was the only cultivated dog there was .
by and by , when i was older , she brought home the word <unk> , one time , and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings , making much unhappiness and despondency ; and it was at this time that i noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages , and flashed out a fresh definition every time , which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture , though i said nothing , of course .
she had one word which she always kept on hand , and ready , like a life-preserver , a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way  that was the word synonymous .
when she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her <unk> , if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him <unk> for a couple of minutes , then he would come to , and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack , and not expecting anything ; so when he 'd hail and ask her to cash in , i ( the only dog on the inside of her game ) could see her canvas flicker a moment  but only just a moment  then it would belly out taut and full , and she would say , as calm as a summer 's day , " it 's synonymous with <unk> , " or some godless long reptile of a word like that , and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack , perfectly comfortable , you know , and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed , and the initiated <unk> the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy <name> .
and it was the same with phrases .
she would drag home a whole phrase , if it had a grand sound , and play it six nights and two <unk> , and explain it a new way every time  which she had to , for all she cared for was the phrase ; she was n't interested in what it meant , and knew those dogs had n't wit enough to catch her , anyway .
yes , she was a <name> !
she got so she was n't afraid of anything , she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures .
she even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the <unk> laugh and shout over ; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut , where , of course , it did n't fit and had n't any point ; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way , while i could see that she was wondering to herself why it did n't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it .
but no harm was done ; the others rolled and barked too , privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point , and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there was n't any to see .
you can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character ; still , she had virtues , and enough to make up , i think .
she had a kind heart and gentle ways , and never <unk> <unk> for injuries done her , but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them ; and she taught her children her kindly way , and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger , and not to run away , but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger , and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us .
and she taught us not by words only , but by example , and that is the best way and the surest and the most lasting .
why , the brave things she did , the splendid things !
she was just a soldier ; and so modest about it  well , you could n't help admiring her , and you could n't help imitating her ; not even a king <name> spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her society .
so , as you see , there was more to her than her education .
chapter ii when i was well grown , at last , i was sold and taken away , and i never saw her again .
she was broken-hearted , and so was i , and we cried ; but she comforted me as well as she could , and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpose , and must do our duties without <unk> , take our life as we might find it , live it for the best good of others , and never mind about the results ; they were not our affair .
she said men who did like this would have a <name> and beautiful reward by and by in another world , and although we animals would not go there , to do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives a <unk> and dignity which in itself would be a reward .
she had gathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the sunday-school with the children , and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had done with those other words and phrases ; and she had studied them deeply , for her good and ours .
one may see by this that she had a wise and thoughtful head , for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it .
so we said our farewells , and looked our last upon each other through our tears ; and the last thing she said  keeping it for the last to make me remember it the better , i think  was , " in memory of me , when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself , think of your mother , and do as she would do . "
do you think i could forget that ?
no .
chapter iii it was such a charming home !  my new one ; a fine great house , with pictures , and delicate decorations , and <name> furniture , and no gloom anywhere , but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding <name> ; and the spacious grounds around it , and the great garden  oh , <unk> , and <name> trees , and flowers , no end !
and i was the same as a member of the family ; and they loved me , and petted me , and did not give me a new name , but called me by my old one that was dear to me because my mother had given it me  <name> <unk> .
she got it out of a song ; and the grays knew that song , and said it was a beautiful name .
mrs. gray was thirty , and so sweet and so lovely , you can not imagine it ; and <name> was ten , and just like her mother , just a darling slender little copy of her , with <unk> tails down her back , and short frocks ; and the baby was a year old , and plump and dimpled , and fond of me , and never could get enough of hauling on my tail , and hugging me , and laughing out its innocent happiness ; and mr. gray was thirty-eight , and tall and slender and handsome , a little bald in front , alert , quick in his movements , business-like , prompt , decided , <unk> , and with that kind of <unk> face that just seems to glint and <name> with frosty <unk> !
he was a renowned scientist .
i do not know what the word means , but my mother would know how to use it and get effects .
she would know how to depress a <unk> with it and make a <unk> look sorry he came .
but that is not the best one ; the best one was laboratory .
my mother could organize a trust on that one that would skin the <unk> off the whole herd .
the laboratory was not a book , or a picture , or a place to wash your hands in , as the college president 's dog said  no , that is the lavatory ; the laboratory is quite different , and is filled with jars , and bottles , and electrics , and wires , and strange machines ; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place , and used the machines , and discussed , and made what they called experiments and discoveries ; and often i came , too , and stood around and listened , and tried to learn , for the sake of my mother , and in loving memory of her , although it was a pain to me , as realizing what she was losing out of her life and i gaining nothing at all ; for try as i might , i was never able to make anything out of it at all .
other times i lay on the floor in the mistress 's <unk> and slept , she gently using me for a <unk> , knowing it pleased me , for it was a caress ; other times i spent an hour in the nursery , and got well <unk> and made happy ; other times i watched by the crib there , when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby 's affairs ; other times i romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with <name> till we were tired out , then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book ; other times i went visiting among the neighbor dogs  for there were some most pleasant ones not far away , and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one , a <unk> <name> setter by the name of <name> <unk> , who was a presbyterian like me , and belonged to the scotch minister .
the servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me , and so , as you see , mine was a pleasant life .
there could not be a happier dog that i was , nor a <unk> one .
i <name> say this for myself , for it is only the truth : i tried in all ways to do well and right , and honor my mother 's memory and her teachings , and earn the happiness that had come to me , as best i could .
by and by came my little puppy , and then my cup was full , my happiness was perfect .
it was the dearest little <unk> thing , and so smooth and soft and velvety , and had such cunning little awkward paws , and such affectionate eyes , and such a sweet and innocent face ; and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother adored it , and fondled it , and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did .
it did seem to me that life was just too lovely to  then came the <name> .
one day i was standing a watch in the nursery .
that is to say , i was asleep on the bed .
the baby was asleep in the crib , which was alongside the bed , on the side next the fireplace .
it was the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of <unk> stuff that you can see through .
the nurse was out , and we two sleepers were alone .
a spark from the <unk> was shot out , and it lit on the slope of the tent .
i suppose a quiet interval followed , then a scream from the baby awoke me , and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling !
before i could think , i sprang to the floor in my fright , and in a second was half-way to the door ; but in the next <unk> my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears , and i was back on the bed again .
i reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the <unk> , and tugged it along , and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke ; i snatched a new hold , and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall , and was still tugging away , all excited and happy and proud , when the master 's voice shouted : " begone you cursed beast ! "
and i jumped to save myself ; but he was furiously quick , and chased me up , striking furiously at me with his cane , i dodging this way and that , in terror , and at last a strong blow fell upon my left <unk> , which made me shriek and fall , for the moment , helpless ; the cane went up for another blow , but never descended , for the nurse 's voice rang wildly out , " the nursery 's on fire ! "
and the master rushed away in that direction , and my other bones were saved .
the pain was cruel , but , no matter , i must not lose any time ; he might come back at any moment ; so i limped on three legs to the other end of the hall , where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a <name> where old boxes and such things were kept , as i had heard say , and where people seldom went .
i managed to climb up there , then i searched my way through the dark among the piles of things , and hid in the <unk> place i could find .
it was foolish to be afraid there , yet still i was ; so afraid that i held in and hardly even whimpered , though it would have been such a comfort to whimper , because that <unk> the pain , you know .
but i could lick my leg , and that did some good .
for half an hour there was a commotion downstairs , and shoutings , and rushing footsteps , and then there was quiet again .
quiet for some minutes , and that was grateful to my spirit , for then my fears began to go down ; and fears are worse than pains  oh , much worse .
then came a sound that froze me .
they were calling me  calling me by name  hunting for me !
it was muffled by distance , but that could not take the terror out of it , and it was the most dreadful sound to me that i had ever heard .
it went all about , everywhere , down there : along the halls , through all the rooms , in both stories , and in the basement and the cellar ; then outside , and farther and farther away  then back , and all about the house again , and i thought it would never , never stop .
but at last it did , hours and hours after the vague twilight of the <name> had long ago been blotted out by black darkness .
then in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away , and i was at peace and slept .
it was a good rest i had , but i woke before the twilight had come again .
i was feeling fairly comfortable , and i could think out a plan now .
i made a very good one ; which was , to creep down , all the way down the back stairs , and hide behind the cellar door , and slip out and escape when the <unk> came at <name> , while he was inside filling the refrigerator ; then i would hide all day , and start on my journey when night came ; my journey to  well , anywhere where they would not know me and betray me to the master .
i was feeling almost cheerful now ; then suddenly i thought : why , what would life be without my puppy !
that was despair .
there was no plan for me ; i saw that ; i must stay where i was ; stay , and wait , and take what might come  it was not my affair ; that was what life is  my mother had said it .
then  well , then the calling began again !
all my sorrows came back .
i said to myself , the master <name> never forgive .
i did not know what i had done to make him so bitter and so <unk> , yet i judged it was something a dog could not understand , but which was clear to a man and dreadful .
they called and called  days and nights , it seemed to me .
so long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad , and i recognized that i was getting very weak .
when you are this way you sleep a great deal , and i did .
once i woke in an awful fright  it seemed to me that the calling was right there in the <name> !
and so it was : it was <name> 's voice , and she was crying ; my name was falling from her lips all broken , poor thing , and i could not believe my ears for the <name> of it when i heard her say : " come back to us  oh , come back to us , and forgive  it is all so sad without our  " i broke in with such a grateful little yelp , and the next moment <name> was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and shouting for the family to hear , " she 's found , she 's found ! "
the days that followed  well , they were wonderful .
the mother and <name> and the servants  why , they just seemed to worship me .
they couldn't seem to make me a bed that was fine enough ; and as for food , they could n't be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out of season ; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear about my heroism  that was the name they called it by , and it means agriculture .
i remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once , and explaining it in that way , but did n't say what agriculture was , except that it was synonymous with <unk> <unk> ; and a dozen times a day mrs. gray and <name> would tell the tale to <unk> , and say i risked my life to say the baby 's , and both of us had burns to prove it , and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me , and you could see the pride in the eyes of <name> and her mother ; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp , they looked ashamed and changed the subject , and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it , it looked to me as if they were going to cry .
and this was not all the <name> ; no , the master 's friends came , a whole twenty of the most distinguished people , and had me in the laboratory , and discussed me as if i was a kind of discovery ; and some of them said it was wonderful in a dumb beast , the finest exhibition of instinct they could call to mind ; but the master said , with vehemence , " it 's far above instinct ; it 's reason , and many a man , privileged to be saved and go with you and me to a better world by right of its possession , has less of it that this poor silly quadruped that 's <unk> to perish ; " and then he laughed , and said : " why , look at me  i 'm a sarcasm !
bless you , with all my grand intelligence , the only thing i inferred was that the dog had gone mad and was destroying the child , whereas but for the <unk> intelligence  it 's reason , i tell you !  the child would have perished ! "
they disputed and disputed , and i was the very center of subject of it all , and i wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me ; it would have made her proud .
then they discussed optics , as they called it , and whether a certain injury to the <name> would produce blindness or not , but they could not agree about it , and said they must test it by experiment by and by ; and next they discussed plants , and that interested me , because in the summer <name> and i had planted seeds  i helped her dig the holes , you know  and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there , and it was a wonder how that could happen ; but it did , and i wished i could talk  i would have told those people about it and shown then how much i knew , and been all alive with the subject ; but i did n't care for the optics ; it was dull , and when they came back to it again it bored me , and i went to sleep .
pretty soon it was spring , and <name> and pleasant and lovely , and the sweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by , and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin , and the master was n't any company for us , but we played together and had good times , and the servants were kind and friendly , so we got along quite happily and counted the days and waited for the family .
and one day those men came again , and said , now for the test , and they took the puppy to the laboratory , and i limped <unk> along , too , feeling proud , for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure to me , of course .
they discussed and experimented , and then suddenly the puppy shrieked , and they set him on the floor , and he went staggering around , with his head all bloody , and the master clapped his hands and shouted : " there , i 've won  confess it !
he 's as blind as a bat ! "
and they all said : " it 's so  you 've proved your theory , and suffering humanity owes you a great debt from henceforth , " and they crowded around him , and wrung his hand cordially and <unk> , and praised him .
but i hardly saw or heard these things , for i ran at once to my little darling , and snuggled close to it where it lay , and licked the blood , and it put its head against mine , whimpering softly , and i knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother's touch , though it could not see me .
then it dropped down , presently , and its little <name> nose rested upon the floor , and it was still , and did not move any more .
soon the master stopped discussing a moment , and rang in the footman , and said , " bury it in the far corner of the garden , " and then went on with the discussion , and i trotted after the footman , very happy and grateful , for i knew the puppy was out of its pain now , because it was asleep .
we went far down the garden to the farthest end , where the children and the nurse and the puppy and i used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm , and there the footman dug a hole , and i saw he was going to plant the puppy , and i was glad , because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog , like <name> <unk> , and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home ; so i tried to help him dig , but my lame leg was no good , being stiff , you know , and you have to have two , or it is no use .
when the footman had finished and covered little <name> up , he patted my head , and there were tears in his eyes , and he said : " poor little doggie , you saved his child ! "
i have watched two whole weeks , and he does n't come up !
this last week a fright has been stealing upon me .
i think there is something terrible about this .
i do not know what it is , but the fear makes me sick , and i can not eat , though the servants bring me the best of food ; and they pet me so , and even come in the night , and cry , and say , " poor doggie  do give it up and come home ; do n't break our hearts ! "
and all this <unk> me the more , and makes me sure something has happened .
and i am so weak ; since yesterday i can not stand on my feet <unk> .
and within this hour the servants , looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on , said things i could not understand , but they carried something cold to my heart .
" those poor creatures !
they do not suspect .
they <name> come home in the morning , and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed , and who of us <name> be strong enough to say the truth to them : 'the humble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish . ' "
a double <unk> detective story by <name> twain part i " we ought never to do wrong when people are looking . "
i the first scene is in the country , in <name> ; the time , 1880 .
there has been a wedding , between a handsome young man of slender means and a <name> young girl  a case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage ; a marriage bitterly opposed by the girl 's widowed father .
<name> fuller , the bridegroom , is twenty-six years old , is of an old but <unk> family which had by compulsion <unk> from <unk> , and for king <name> 's purse 's profit , so everybody said  some maliciously the rest merely because they believed it .
the bride is nineteen and beautiful .
she is intense , <unk> , romantic , immeasurably proud of her cavalier blood , and passionate in her love for her young husband .
for its sake she braved her father 's displeasure , endured his reproaches , listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions , and went from his house without his blessing , proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had made its home in her heart .
the morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her .
her husband put aside her proffered caresses , and said : " sit down .
i have something to say to you .
i loved you .
that was before i asked your father to give you to me .
his refusal is not my grievance  i could have endured that .
but the things he said of me to you  that is a different matter .
there  you need n't speak ; i know quite well what they were ; i got them from authentic sources .
among other things he said that my character was written in my face ; that i was treacherous , a <unk> , a coward , and a brute without sense of pity or compassion : the <unk> <unk> , ' he called it  and <unk> badge . '
any other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog .
i wanted to do it , and was minded to do it , but a better thought came to me : to put him to shame ; to break his heart ; to kill him by inches .
how to do it ?
through my treatment of you , his idol !
i would marry you ; and then  have <name> .
you <name> see . "
from that moment onward , for three months , the young wife suffered all the humiliations , all the insults , all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of the husband could contrive , save physical injuries only .
her strong pride stood by her , and she kept the secret of her troubles .
now and then the husband said , " why do n't you go to your father and tell him ? "
then he invented new tortures , applied them , and asked again .
she always answered , " he shall never know by my mouth , " and <unk> him with his origin ; said she was the lawful slave of a <unk> of slaves , and must obey , and would  up to that point , but no further ; he could kill her if he liked , but he could not break her ; it was not in the <unk> breed to do it .
at the end of the three months he said , with a dark significance in his manner , " i have tried all things but one "  and waited for her reply .
" try that , " she said , and curled her lip in mockery .
that night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes , then said to her , " get up and dress ! "
she obeyed  as always , without a word .
he led her half a mile from the house , and proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road ; and succeeded , she screaming and struggling .
he gagged her then , struck her across the face with his cowhide , and set his bloodhounds on her .
they tore the clothes off her , and she was naked .
he called the dogs off , and said : " you <name> be found  by the passing public .
they <name> be dropping along about three hours from now , and <name> spread the news  do you hear ?
good-by .
you have seen the last of me . "
he went away then .
she moaned to herself : " i shall bear a child  to him !
god <name> it may be a boy ! "
the farmers released her by-and-by  and spread the news , which was natural .
they raised the country with <unk> intentions , but the bird had flown .
the young wife shut herself up in her father 's house ; he shut himself up with her , and thenceforth would see no one .
his pride was broken , and his heart ; so he wasted away , day by day , and even his daughter rejoiced when death relieved him .
then she sold the estate and disappeared .
ii in 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded new england village , with no company but a little boy about five years old .
she did her own work , she discouraged <unk> , and had none .
the butcher , the baker , and the others that served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was stillman , and that she called the child archy .
whence she came they had not been able to find out , but they said she talked like a southerner .
the child had no playmates and no comrade , and no teacher but the mother .
she taught him diligently and intelligently , and was satisfied with the results  even a little proud of them .
one day archy said , " mamma , am i different from other children ? "
" well , i suppose not .
why ? "
" there was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and i said yes , and she said how long since i saw him and i said i had n't seen him at all , and she said how did i know he 'd been by , then , and i said because i smelt his track on the sidewalk , and she said i was a dum fool and made a mouth at me .
what did she do that for ? "
the young woman turned white , and said to herself , " it 's a <unk> !
the gift of the bloodhound is in him . "
she snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately , saying , " god has appointed the way ! "
her eyes were burning with a fierce light , and her breath came short and quick with excitement .
she said to herself : " the puzzle is solved now ; many a time it has been a mystery to me , the impossible things the child has done in the dark , but it is all clear to me now . "
she set him in his small chair , and said , " wait a little till i come , dear ; then we <name> talk about the matter . "
she went up to her room and took from her <unk> several small articles and put them out of sight : a <unk> on the floor under the bed ; a pair of <unk> under the bureau ; a small <name> <unk> under the wardrobe .
then she returned , and said , " there !
i have left some things which i ought to have brought down . "
she named them , and said , " run up and bring them , dear . "
the child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things .
" did you have any difficulty , dear ? "
" no , mamma ; i only went where you went . "
during his absence she had stepped to the bookcase , taken several books from the bottom shelf , opened each , passed her hand over a <name> , noting its number in her memory , then restored them to their places .
now she said : " i have been doing something while you have been gone , archy .
do you think you can find out what it was ? "
the boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched , and opened them at the pages which had been stroked .
the mother took him in her lap , and said , " i <name> answer your question now , dear .
i have found out that in one way you are quite different from other people .
you can see in the dark , you can smell what other people can not , you have the talents of a bloodhound .
they are good and valuable things to have , but you must keep the matter a secret .
if people found it out , they would speak of you as an odd child , a strange child , and children would be disagreeable to you , and give you nicknames .
in this world one must be like everybody else if he does n't want to provoke scorn or envy or jealousy .
it is a great and fine distinction which has been born to you , and i am glad ; but you <name> keep it a secret , for mamma 's sake , wo n't you ? "
the child promised , without understanding .
all the rest of the day the mother 's <name> was busy with excited thinkings ; with plans , projects , schemes , each and all of them uncanny , grim , and dark .
yet they lit up her face ; lit it with a fell light of their own ; lit it with vague fires of hell .
she was in a fever of unrest ; she could not sit , stand , read , sew ; there was no relief for her but in movement .
she tested her boy 's gift in twenty ways , and kept saying to herself all the time , with her mind in the past : " he broke my father 's heart , and night and day all these years i have tried , and all in vain , to think out a way to break his .
i have found it now  i have found it now . "
when night fell , the demon of unrest still possessed her .
she went on with her tests ; with a candle she traversed the house from <name> to cellar , hiding pins , needles , <unk> , <unk> , under pillows , under carpets , in cracks in the walls , under the coal in the bin ; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them ; which he did , and was happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses .
from this time forward life took on a new complexion for her .
she said , " the future is secure  i can wait , and enjoy the waiting . "
the most of her lost interests revived .
she took up music again , and languages , drawing , painting , and the other <unk> delights of her <unk> .
she was happy once more , and felt again the zest of life .
as the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy , and was contented with it .
not altogether , but nearly that .
the soft side of his heart was larger than the other side of it .
it was his only defect , in her eyes .
but she considered that his love for her and worship of her made up for it .
he was a good <unk>  that was well ; but it was a question if the materials of his <unk> were of as tough and enduring a quality as those of his friendships  and that was not so well .
the years drifted on .
archy was become a handsome , shapely , athletic youth , courteous , dignified , companionable , pleasant in his ways , and looking perhaps a trifle older than he was , which was sixteen .
one evening his mother said she had something of grave importance to say to him , adding that he was old enough to hear it now , and old enough and possessed of character enough and stability enough to <name> out a stern plan which she had been for years contriving and maturing .
then she told him her bitter story , in all its naked <unk> .
for a while the boy was paralyzed ; then he said , " i understand .
we are <unk> ; and by our custom and nature there is but one atonement .
i <name> search him out and kill him . "
" kill him ?
no !
death is release , emancipation ; death is a favor .
do i owe him favors ?
you must not hurt a hair of his head . "
the boy was lost in thought awhile ; then he said , " you are all the world to me , and your <name> is my law and my pleasure .
tell me what to do and i <name> do it . "
the mother 's eyes beamed with satisfaction , and she said , " you <name> go and find him .
i have known his hiding-place for eleven years ; it cost me five years and more of inquiry , and much money , to locate it .
he is a <unk> in colorado , and well-to-do .
he lives in <name> .
his name is <name> fuller .
there  it is the first time i have spoken it since that <unk> night .
think !
that name could have been yours if i had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one .
you <name> drive him from that place ; you <name> hunt him down and drive him again ; and yet again , and again , and again , persistently , <unk> , poisoning his life , filling it with mysterious terrors , loading it with weariness and misery , making him wish for death , and that he had a suicide 's courage ; you <name> make of him another wandering jew ; he shall know no rest any more , no peace of mind , no placid sleep ; you shall shadow him , cling to him , persecute him , till you break his heart , as he broke my father 's and mine . "
" i <name> obey , mother . "
" i believe it , my child .
the preparations are all made ; everything is ready .
here is a letter of credit ; spend freely , there is no lack of money .
at times you may need disguises .
i have provided them ; also some other conveniences . "
she took from the drawer of the <unk> several squares of paper .
they all bore these <unk> words : $ 10,000 reward it is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an eastern state is <unk> here .
in 1880 , in the night , he tied his young wife to a tree by the public road , cut her across the face with a cowhide , and made his dogs tear her clothes from her , leaving her naked .
he left her there , and fled the country .
a <unk> of hers has searched for him for seventeen years .
address ... ... ... , ... ... ... . , post-office .
the above reward <name> be paid in cash to the person who <name> furnish the seeker , in a personal interview , the criminal 's address .
" when you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent , you <name> go in the night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies , and another one upon the post-office or in some other prominent place .
it <name> be the talk of the region .
at first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at something approaching their value .
we <name> ruin him by-and-by , but gradually ; we must not <unk> him at once , for that could bring him to despair and injure his health , possibly kill him . "
she took three or four more typewritten forms from the drawer  duplicates  and read one : ... ... ... . , ... ... ... . , 18 ... to <name> fuller : you have ... ... days in which to settle your affairs .
you <name> not be disturbed during that limit , which <name> expire at .
... .. m. , on the ... ... of ... ... . you must then move on .
if you are still in the place after the named hour , i <name> placard you on all the dead walls , <unk> your crime once more , and adding the date , also the scene of it , with all names concerned , including your own .
have no fear of bodily injury  it <name> in no circumstances ever be inflicted upon you .
you brought misery upon an old man , and ruined his life and broke his heart .
what he suffered , you are to suffer .
" you <name> add no signature .
he must receive this before he learns of the <unk>  before he rises in the morning  lest he lose his head and fly the place penniless . "
" i shall not forget . "
" you <name> need to use these forms only in the beginning  once may be enough .
afterward , when you are ready for him to vanish out of a place , see that he gets a copy of this form , which merely says , move on .
you have ... ... days .
" he <name> obey .
that is sure . "
iii extracts from letters to the mother : <name> , <name> 3 , 1897 i have now been living several days in the same hotel with <name> fuller .
i have his scent ; i could track him through ten divisions of infantry and find him .
i have often been near him and heard him talk .
he owns a good mine , and has a fair income from it ; but he is not <name> .
he learned mining in a good way  by working at it for wages .
he is a cheerful creature , and his forty-three years sit lightly upon him ; he could pass for a younger man  say thirty-six or thirty-seven .
he has never married again  passes himself off for a widower .
he stands well , is liked , is popular , and has many friends .
even i feel a drawing toward him  the paternal blood in me making its claim .
how blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature  the most of them , in fact !
my task is become hard now  you realize it ?
you comprehend , and make allowances ?  and the fire of it has cooled , more than i like to confess to myself .
but i <name> <name> it out .
even with the pleasure paled , the duty remains , and i <name> not spare him .
and for my help , a sharp resentment rises in me when i reflect that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it .
the lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character , and in the change he is happy .
he , the guilty party , is <unk> from all suffering ; you , the innocent , are borne down with it .
but be comforted  he shall harvest his share .
silver gulch , may 19 i <unk> form no .
1 at midnight of <name> 3 ; an hour later i slipped form no .
2 under his chamber door , <unk> him to leave <name> at or before <unk> the night of the 14th .
some late bird of a reporter stole one of my <unk> , then hunted the town over and found the other one , and stole that .
in this manner he accomplished what the profession call a " scoop "  that is , he got a valuable item , and saw to it that no other paper got it .
and so his paper  the principal one in the town  had it in glaring type on the editorial <name> in the morning , followed by a <unk> opinion of our wretch a column long , which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper 's account !
the journals out here know how to do the <name> thing  when there 's business in it .
at breakfast i occupied my usual seat  selected because it afforded a view of papa fuller 's face , and was near enough for me to hear the talk that went on at his table .
seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room , and all discussing that item , and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence from the town  with a rail , or a bullet , or something .
when fuller came in he had the notice to leave  folded up  in one hand , and the newspaper in the other ; and it gave me more than half a pang to see him .
his cheerfulness was all gone , and he looked old and pinched and ashy .
and then  only think of the things he had to listen to !
mamma , he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and <unk> drawn from the very <unk> and <unk> of satan 's own authorized editions down below .
and more than that , he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them .
his applause tasted bitter in his mouth , though ; he could not disguise that from me ; and it was observable that his appetite was gone ; he only nibbled ; he could n't eat .
finally a man said , " it is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel .
i <name> so . "
ah , dear , it was pitiful the way fuller winced , and glanced around scared !
he could n't endure any more , and got up and left .
during several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in mexico , and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could , and give the property his personal attention .
he played his cards well ; said he would take $ 40,000  a quarter in cash , the rest in safe notes ; but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase , he would diminish his terms for cash in full , he sold out for $ <unk> .
and then , what do you think he did ?
he asked for greenbacks , and took them , saying the man in mexico was a <unk> , with a head full of <unk> , and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts .
people thought it queer , since a draft on new york could produce greenbacks quite conveniently .
there was talk of this odd thing , but only for a day ; that is as long as any topic lasts in <name> .
i was watching , all the time .
as soon as the sale was completed and the money paid  which was on the 11th  i began to stick to fuller 's track without dropping it for a moment .
that night  no , 12th , for it was a little past midnight  i tracked him to his room , which was four doors from mine in the same hall ; then i went back and put on my muddy <unk> disguise , darkened my complexion , and sat down in my room in the gloom , with a <unk> handy , with a change in it , and my door ajar .
for i suspected that the bird would take wing now .
in half an hour an old woman passed by , carrying a grip ; i caught the familiar whiff , and followed with my grip , for it was fuller .
he left the hotel by a side entrance , and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness , and got into a <unk> hack , which , of course , was waiting for him by appointment .
i took a seat ( <unk> ) on the trunk platform behind , and we drove briskly off .
we drove ten miles , and the hack stopped at a way station and was discharged .
fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under the awning , as far as he could get from the light ; i went inside , and watched the <unk> .
fuller bought no ticket ; i bought none .
presently the train came along , and he boarded a car ; i entered the same car at the other end , and came down the aisle and took the seat behind him .
when he paid the conductor and named his objective point , i dropped back several seats , while the conductor was changing a <name> , and when he came to me i paid to the same place  about a hundred miles westward .
from that time for a week on end he led me a dance .
he travelled here and there and yonder  always on a general westward trend  but he was not a woman after the first day .
he was a laborer , like myself , and wore bushy false whiskers .
his outfit was perfect , and he could do the character without thinking about it , for he had served the trade for wages .
his nearest friend could not have recognized him .
at last he located himself here , the <unk> little mountain camp in montana ; he has a shanty , and goes out prospecting daily ; is gone all day , and <unk> society .
i am living at a miner 's boarding-house , and it is an awful place : the bunks , the food , the dirt  everything .
we have been here four weeks , and in that time i have seen him but once ; but every night i go over his track and post myself .
as soon as he engaged a shanty here i went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that <name> hotel to keep my baggage till i should send for it .
i need nothing here but a change of army shirts , and i brought that with me .
silver gulch , <name> 12 .
the <name> episode has never found its way here , i think .
i know the most of the men in camp , and they have never referred to it , at least in my hearing .
fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions .
he has located a claim , two miles away , in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains ; it promises very well , and he is working it diligently .
ah , but the change in him !
he never smiles , and he keeps quite to himself , <unk> with no one  he who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago .
i have seen him passing along several times recently  drooping , forlorn , the spring gone from his step , a pathetic figure .
he calls himself <name> <name> .
i can trust him to remain here until we disturb him .
since you insist , i <name> banish him again , but i do not see how he can be <unk> than he already is .
i <name> go hack to <name> and treat myself to a little season of comfort , and <unk> food , and <unk> beds , and bodily decency ; then i <name> fetch my things , and notify poor papa <name> to move on .
<name> , <name> 19 .
they miss him here .
they all <name> he is <unk> in mexico , and they do not say it just with their mouths , but out of their hearts .
you know you can always tell .
i am loitering here <unk> , i confess it .
but if you were in my place you would have <name> for me .
yes , i know what you <name> say , and you are right : if i were in your place , and carried your scalding memories in my heart  i <name> take the night train back to-morrow .
<name> , <name> 20 .
god forgive us , mother , we are hunting the wrong man !
i have not slept any all night .
i am now awaiting , at <name> , for the morning train  and how the minutes drag , how they drag !
this <name> fuller is a cousin of the guilty one .
how stupid we have been not to reflect that the guilty one would never again wear his own name after that fiendish deed !
the <name> fuller is four years younger than the other one ; he came here a young widower in <unk> , aged twenty-one  a year before you were married ; and the documents to prove it are innumerable .
last night i talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his arrival .
i said nothing , but a few days from now i <name> land him in this town again , with the loss upon his mine made good ; and there <name> be a banquet , and a <unk> procession , and there <name> not be any expense on anybody but me .
do you call this " gush " ?
i am only a boy , as you well know ; it is my privilege .
by-and-by i shall not be a boy any more .
silver gulch , july 3 .
mother , he is gone !
gone , and left no trace .
the scent was cold when i came .
to-day i am out of bed for the first time since .
i wish i were not a boy ; then i could stand shocks better .
they all think he went west .
i start to-night , in a wagon  two or three hours of that , then i get a train .
i do n't know where i 'm going , but i must go ; to try to keep still would be torture .
of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise .
this means that i may have to search the whole globe to find him .
indeed it is what i expect .
do you see , mother ?
it is i that am the wandering jew .
the irony of it !
we arranged that for another .
think of the difficulties !
and there would be none if i only could advertise for him .
but if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him , i have not been able to think it out , and i have tried till my brains are <unk> .
" if the gentleman who lately bought a mine in mexico and sold one in <name> <name> send his address to  " ( to whom , mother ?
) , " it <name> be explained to him that it was all a mistake ; his forgiveness <name> be asked , and full <unk> made for a loss which he sustained in a certain matter . "
do you see ?
he would think it a trap .
well , any one would .
if i should say , " it is now known that he was not the man wanted , but another man  a man who once bore the same name , but discarded it for good reasons "  would that answer ?
but the <name> people would wake up then and say " oho ! "
and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks , and say , " why did he run away if he was n't the right man ?  it is too thin . "
if i failed to find him he would be ruined there  there where there is no taint upon him now .
you have a better head than mine .
help me .
i have one clue , and only one .
i know his handwriting .
if he puts his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much , it <name> be valuable to me if i ever run across it .
san <name> , <name> 28 , 1898 .
you already know how well i have searched the states from colorado to the pacific , and how nearly i came to getting him once .
well , i have had another close miss .
it was here , yesterday .
i struck his trail , hot , on the street , and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel .
that was a costly mistake ; a dog would have gone the other way .
but i am only part dog , and can get very humanly stupid when excited .
he had been stopping in that house ten days ; i almost know , now , that he stops long nowhere , the past six or eight months , but is restless and has to keep moving .
i understand that feeling !
and i know what it is to feel it .
he still uses the name he had registered when i came so near catching him nine months ago  " <name> <name> " ; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from silver gulch .
an unpretending man , and has small taste for fancy names .
i recognized the hand easily , through its slight disguise .
a square man , and not good at shams and <unk> .
they said he was just gone , on a journey ; left no address ; did n't say where he was going ; looked frightened when asked to leave his address ; had no baggage but a cheap valise ; carried it off on foot  a " stingy old person , and not much loss to the house . "
" old ! "
i suppose he is , now .
i hardly heard ; i was there but a moment .
i rushed along his trail , and it led me to a wharf .
mother , the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon !
i should have saved half an hour if i had gone in the right direction at first .
i could have taken a fast tug , and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel .
she is bound for melbourne .
<name> canyon , california , october 3 , 1900 .
you have a right to complain .
" a letter a year " is a <unk> ; i freely acknowledge it ; but how can one write when there is nothing to write about but failures ?
no one can keep it up ; it breaks the heart .
i told you  it seems ages ago , now  how i missed him at melbourne , and then chased him all over australasia for months on end .
well , then , after that i followed him to <name> ; almost saw him in bombay ; traced him all around  to <unk> , <unk> , lucknow , lahore , cawnpore , allahabad , calcutta , madras  oh , everywhere ; week after week , month after month , through the dust and <unk>  always approximately on his track , sometimes close upon him , yet never catching him .
and down to ceylon , and then to  never mind ; by-and-by i <name> write it all out .
i chased him home to california , and down to mexico , and back again to california .
since then i have been hunting him about the state from the first of last <name> down to a month ago .
i feel almost sure he is not far from <name> canyon ; i traced him to a point thirty miles from here , but there i lost the trail ; some one gave him a lift in a wagon , i suppose .
i am taking a rest , now  modified by <unk> for the lost trail .
i was tired to death , mother , and low-spirited , and sometimes coming uncomfortably near to losing <name> ; but the miners in this little camp are good fellows , and i am used to their sort this long time back ; and their breezy ways <unk> a person up and make him forget his troubles .
i have been here a month .
i am <unk> with a young fellow named " <name> " <unk> , about twenty-five , the only son of his mother  like me  and loves her dearly , and writes to her every week  part of which is like me .
he is a timid body , and in the matter of intellect  well , he can not be depended upon to set a river on fire ; but no matter , he is well liked ; he is good and fine , and it is meat and bread and rest and luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again .
i wish " <name> <name> " could have it .
he had friends ; he liked company .
that brings up that picture of him , the time that i saw him last .
the pathos of it !
it comes before me often and often .
at that very time , poor thing , i was <unk> up my conscience to make him move on again !
<unk> 's heart is better than mine , better than anybody 's in the community , i suppose , for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the camp  flint buckner  and the only man flint ever talks with or allows to talk with him .
he says he knows flint 's history , and that it is trouble that has made him what he is , and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can .
now none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a <unk> like flint buckner , from all i hear about him outside .
i think that this one detail <name> give you a better idea of <name> 's character than any <unk> description i could furnish you of him .
in one of our talks he said something about like this : " flint is a kinsman of mine , and he pours out all his troubles to me  empties his breast from time to time , or i reckon it would burst .
there could n't be any <unk> man , archy stillman ; his life had been made up of misery of mind  he is n't near as old as he looks .
he has lost the feel of <unk> and peace  oh , years and years ago !
he does n't know what good luck is  never has had any ; often says he wishes he was in the other hell , he is so tired of this one . "
iv .
" no real gentleman <name> tell the naked truth in the presence of ladies . "
it was a crisp and <unk> morning in early october .
the lilacs and <unk> , lit with the <unk> of autumn , <name> burning and flashing in the upper air , a <name> bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the tree-tops and would visit together ; the <unk> and the <unk> flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad <unk> along the slanting sweep of the woodland ; the <unk> fragrance of innumerable <unk> flowers rose upon the <unk> atmosphere ; far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing ; everywhere brooded stillness , serenity , and the peace of god .
october is the time  1900 ; <name> canyon is the place , a <unk> camp away down in the <name> region .
it is a secluded spot , high and remote ; recent as to discovery ; thought by its occupants to be <name> in metal  a year or two 's prospecting <name> decide that matter one way or the other .
for inhabitants , the camp has about two hundred miners , one white woman and child , several chinese <unk> , five squaws , and a dozen vagrant <name> indians in <unk> robes , battered plug hats , and <unk> <unk> .
there are no mills as yet ; there is no church , no newspaper .
the camp has existed but two years ; it has made no big strike ; the world is ignorant of its name and place .
on both sides of the canyon the mountains rise <unk> , three thousand feet , and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day , when he sails over at noon .
the village is a couple of miles long ; the cabins stand well apart from each other .
the tavern is the only " frame " house  the only house , one might say .
it occupies a central position , and is the evening resort of the population .
they drink there , and play <unk> and dominoes ; also billiards , for there is a table , crossed all over with torn places repaired with <unk> ; there are some <unk> , but no <unk> ; some chipped balls which clatter when they run , and do not slow up gradually , but stop suddenly and sit down ; there is part of a cube of chalk , with a projecting <unk> of flint in it ; and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar 's expense .
flint buckner 's cabin was the last one of the village , going south ; his <unk> was at the other end of the village , northward , and a little beyond the last hut in that direction .
he was a sour creature , <unk> , and had no <unk> .
people who had tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him .
his history was not known .
some believed that <name> <unk> knew it ; others said no .
if asked , <unk> said no , he was not acquainted with it .
flint had a meek english youth of sixteen or seventeen with him , whom he treated roughly , both in public and in private , and of course this lad was applied to for information , but with no success .
fetlock jones  the name of the youth  said that flint picked him up on a prospecting tramp , and as he had neither home nor friends in <name> , he had found it wise to stay and take buckner 's hard usage for the sake of the salary , which was bacon and beans .
further than this he could offer no testimony .
fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now , and under his meek exterior he was slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put upon him .
for the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts ; more bitterly , perhaps , than do the <unk> sort , who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of endurance has been reached .
good-hearted people wanted to help fetlock out of his trouble , and tried to get him to leave buckner ; but the boy showed fright at the thought , and said he " das n't . "
<name> <name> urged him , and said , " you leave the damned <unk> and come with me ; do n't you be afraid .
i'll take care of him . "
the boy thanked him with tears in his eyes , but shuddered and said he " das n't risk it " ; he said flint would catch him alone , some time , in the night , and then  " oh , it makes me sick , mr. <name> , to think of it . "
others said , " run away from him ; we 'll stake you ; skip out for the coast some night . "
but all these suggestions failed ; he said flint would hunt him down and fetch him back , just for meanness .
the people could not understand this .
the boy 's miseries went steadily on , week after week .
it is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he was employing his spare time .
he slept in an <unk> near flint 's ; and there , nights , he nursed his bruises and his humiliations , and studied and studied over a single problem  how he could murder flint buckner and not be found out .
it was the only <name> he had in life ; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness .
he thought of poison .
no  that would not serve ; the inquest would reveal where it was procured and who had procured it .
he thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place when flint would be homeward-bound at midnight  his unvarying hour for the trip .
no  somebody might be near , and catch him .
he thought of stabbing him in his sleep .
no  he might strike an inefficient blow , and flint would seize him .
he examined a hundred different ways  none of them would answer ; for in even the very <unk> and <unk> of them there was always the fatal defect of a risk , a chance , a possibility that he might be found out .
he would have none of that .
but he was patient , <unk> patient .
there was no hurry , he said to himself .
he would never leave flint till he left him a corpse ; there was no hurry  he would find the way .
it was somewhere , and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it .
yes , somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace , not even the faintest clue to the murderer  there was no hurry  he would find that way , and then  oh , then , it would just be good to be alive !
meantime he would diligently keep up his reputation for meekness ; and also , as always <unk> , he would allow no one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor .
two days before the <unk> october morning flint had bought some things , and he and fetlock had brought them home to flint 's cabin : a fresh box of candles , which they put in the corner ; a tin can of <unk> , which they placed upon the <unk> ; a keg of <unk> , which they placed under flint 's bunk ; a huge coil of fuse , which they <name> on a <name> .
fetlock reasoned that flint 's mining operations had <unk> the pick , and that blasting was about to begin now .
he had seen blasting done , and he had a notion of the process , but he had never helped in it .
his conjecture was right  <unk> had come .
in the morning the pair carried fuse , drills , and the <unk> to the shaft ; it was now eight feet deep , and to get into it and out of it a short ladder was used .
they descended , and by command fetlock held the drill  without any instructions as to the right way to hold it  and flint proceeded to strike .
the sledge came down ; the drill sprang out of fetlock 's hand , almost as a matter of course .
" you mangy son of a nigger , is that any way to hold a drill ?
pick it up !
stand it up !
there  hold fast .
d  you !
i 'll teach you ! "
at the end of an hour the drilling was finished .
" now , then , charge it . "
the boy started to pour in the powder .
" idiot ! "
a heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out .
" get up !
you ca n't lie <unk> there .
now , then , stick in the fuse first .
now put in the powder .
hold on , hold on !
are you going to fill the hole all up ?
of all the <unk> <unk> i  put in some dirt !
put in some gravel !
<unk> it down !
hold on , hold on !
oh , great <name> !
get out of the way ! "
he snatched the iron and <unk> the charge himself , meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend .
then he fired the fuse , climbed out of the shaft , and ran fifty yards away , fetlock following .
they stood waiting a few minutes , then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion ; after a little there was a shower of descending stones ; then all was serene again .
" i wish to god you 'd been in it ! "
remarked the master .
they went down the shaft , cleaned it out , drilled another hole , and put in another charge .
" look here !
how much fuse are you proposing to waste ?
do n't you know how to time a fuse ? "
" no , sir . "
" you do n't !
well , if you do n't beat anything i ever saw ! "
he climbed out of the shaft and spoke down , " well , idiot , are you going to be all day ?
cut the fuse and light it ! "
the trembling creature began , " if you please , sir , i  " " you talk back to me ?
cut it and light it ! "
the boy cut and lit .
" <unk> <name> !
a <unk> fuse !
i wish you were in  " in his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran .
the boy was aghast .
" oh , my god !
help .
help !
oh , save me ! "
he implored .
" oh , what can i do !
what can i do ! "
he backed against the wall as tightly as he could ; the sputtering fuse frightened the voice out of him ; his breath stood still ; he stood gazing and impotent ; in two seconds , three seconds , four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments .
then he had an inspiration .
he sprang at the fuse , severed the inch of it that was left above ground , and was saved .
he sank down limp and half lifeless with fright , his strength all gone ; but he muttered with a deep <name> , " he has learnt me !
i knew there was a way , if i would wait . "
after a matter of five minutes buckner stole to the shaft , looking worried and uneasy , and peered down into it .
he took in the situation ; he saw what had happened .
he lowered the ladder , and the boy dragged himself weakly up it .
he was very white .
his appearance added something to buckner 's uncomfortable state , and he said , with a show of regret and sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice : " it was an accident , you know .
do n't say anything about it to anybody ; i was excited , and did n't notice what i was doing .
you 're not looking well ; you 've worked enough for to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat what you want , and rest .
it 's just an accident , you know , on account of my being excited . "
" it scared me , " said the lad , as he started away ; " but i learnt something , so i do n't mind it . "
" damned easy to please ! "
muttered buckner , following him with his eye .
" i wonder if he 'll tell ?
might n't he ? ...
i wish it had killed him . "
the boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting ; he employed it in work , eager and feverish and happy work .
a thick growth of <unk> extended down the mountainside clear to flint 's cabin ; the most of fetlock 's labor was done in the dark intricacies of that stubborn growth ; the rest of it was done in his own shanty .
at last all was complete , and he said , " if he 's got any suspicions that i 'm going to tell on him , he wo n't keep them long , to-morrow .
he <name> see that i am the same <unk> as i always was  all day and the next .
and the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him ; nobody <name> ever guess who finished him up nor how it was done .
he dropped me the idea his own self , and that 's odd . "
v the next day came and went .
it is now almost midnight , and in five minutes the new morning <name> begin .
the scene is in the tavern billiard-room .
rough men in rough clothing , <unk> , breeches stuffed into <unk> , some with <unk> , none with coats , are grouped about the <unk> stove , which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth ; the <unk> are clacking ; there is no other sound  that is , within ; the wind is fitfully moaning without .
the men look bored ; also expectant .
a <unk> broad-shouldered miner , of middle age , with grizzled whiskers , and an unfriendly eye set in an <unk> face , rises , slips a coil of fuse upon his arm , gathers up some other personal properties , and departs without word or greeting to anybody .
it is flint buckner .
as the door closes behind him a buzz of talk breaks out .
" the <unk> man that ever was , " said <name> <name> , the blacksmith ; " you can tell when it 's twelve just by him leaving , without looking at your waterbury . "
" and it 's the only virtue he 's got , as fur as i know , " said <name> <unk> , miner .
" he 's just a blight on this society , " said <unk> 's man , ferguson .
" if i was running this shop i 'd make him say something , some time or other , or <unk> the ranch . "
this with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper , who did not choose to see it , since the man under discussion was a good customer , and went home pretty well set up , every night , with refreshments furnished from the bar .
" say , " said ham sandwich , miner , " does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you to take a drink ? "
" him ?
flint buckner ?
oh , <name> ! "
this sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or another from the crowd .
after a brief silence , <name> <name> , miner , said , " he 's the <unk> , that cuss .
and his boy 's another one .
i ca n't make them out . "
" nor anybody else , " said ham sandwich ; " and if they are <unk> how are you going to rank up that other one ?
when it comes to a 1 <unk> solid <unk> , he lays over both of them .
easy  do n't he ? "
" you bet ! "
everybody said it .
every man but one .
he was the new-comer  peterson .
he ordered the drinks all round , and asked who no .
3 might be .
all answered at once , " archy stillman ! "
" is he a mystery ? "
asked peterson .
" is he a mystery ?
is archy stillman a mystery ? "
said <unk> 's man , ferguson .
" why , the fourth <unk> 's foolishness to him . "
for ferguson was learned .
peterson wanted to hear all about him ; everybody wanted to tell him ; everybody began .
but <name> stevens , the barkeeper , called the house to order , and said one at a time was best .
he distributed the drinks , and appointed ferguson to lead .
ferguson said , " well , he 's a boy .
and that is just about all we know about him .
you can pump him till you are tired ; it ai n't any use ; you wo n't get anything .
at least about his intentions , or line of business , or where he 's from , and such things as that .
and as for getting at the nature and <unk> of his main big chief mystery , why , he 'll just change the subject , that 's all .
you can guess till you 're black in the face  it 's your privilege  but suppose you do , where do you arrive at ?
nowhere , as near as i can make out . "
" what is his big chief one ? "
" sight , maybe .
hearing , maybe .
instinct , maybe .
magic , maybe .
take your choice  <unk> , twenty-five ; children and servants , half price .
now i 'll tell you what he can do .
you can start here , and just disappear ; you can go and hide wherever you want to , i do n't care where it is , nor how far  and he 'll go straight and put his finger on you . "
" you do n't mean it ! "
" i just do , though .
weather 's nothing to him  elemental conditions is nothing to him  he do n't even take notice of them . "
" oh , come !
dark ?
rain ?
snow ?
hey ? "
" it 's all the same to him .
he do n't give a damn . "
" oh , say  including fog , per'aps ? "
" fog !
he 's got an eye 't can <unk> through it like a bullet . "
" now , boys , honor bright , what 's he giving me ? "
" it 's a fact ! "
they all shouted .
" go on , <unk> . "
" well , sir , you can leave him here , chatting with the boys , and you can slip out and go to any cabin in this camp and open a book  yes , sir , a dozen of them  and take the <name> in your memory , and he 'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open every one of them books at the right <name> , and call it off , and never make a mistake . "
" he must be the devil ! "
" more than one has thought it .
now i 'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he done .
the other night he  " there was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside , the door flew open , and an excited crowd burst in , with the camp 's one white woman in the lead and crying , " my child !
my child !
she 's lost and gone !
for the love of god help me to find archy stillman ; we 've hunted everywhere ! "
said the barkeeper : " sit down , sit down , mrs. hogan , and do n't worry .
he asked for a bed three hours ago , tuckered out tramping the trails the way he 's always doing , and went upstairs .
ham sandwich , run up and <unk> him out ; he's in no .
14 . "
the youth was soon downstairs and ready .
he asked mrs. hogan for particulars .
" bless you , dear , there ai n't any ; i wish there was .
i put her to sleep at seven in the evening , and when i went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself , she was gone .
i rushed for your cabin , dear , and you wasn't there , and i 've hunted for you ever since , at every cabin down the gulch , and now i 've come up again , and i 'm that distracted and scared and <unk> ; but , thanks to god , i 've found you at last , dear heart , and you 'll find my child .
come on !
come quick ! "
" move right along ; i 'm with you , madam .
go to your cabin first . "
the whole company streamed out to join the hunt .
all the southern half of the village was up , a hundred men strong , and waiting outside , a vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns .
the mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road , and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders .
in a few minutes the hogan cabin was reached .
" there 's the bunk , " said mrs. hogan ; " there 's where she was ; it 's where i laid her at seven o'clock ; but where she is now , god only knows . "
" hand me a lantern , " said archy .
he set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it , pretending to examine the ground closely .
" here 's her track , " he said , touching the ground here and there and yonder with his finger .
" do you see ? "
several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see .
one or two thought they discerned something like a track ; the others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover .
one said , " maybe a child 's foot could make a <name> on it , but i do n't see how . "
young stillman stepped outside , held the light to the ground , turned <unk> , and moved three steps , closely examining ; then said , " i 've got the direction  come along ; take the lantern , somebody . "
he strode off swiftly southward , the files following , swaying and bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge .
thus a mile , and the mouth of the gorge was reached ; before them stretched the <unk> plain , dim , vast , and vague .
stillman called a halt , saying , " we mustn't start wrong , now ; we must take the direction again . "
he took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards ; then said , " come on ; it 's all right , " and gave up the lantern .
in and out among the <unk> he marched , a quarter of a mile , bearing gradually to the right ; then took a new direction and made another great semicircle ; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a mile  and stopped .
" she gave it up , here , poor little chap .
hold the lantern .
you can see where she sat . "
but this was in a slick alkali flat which was <unk> like steel , and no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a cushion on a <unk> like that .
the bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot , lamenting .
" but where is she , then ? "
some one said .
" she did n't stay here .
we can see that much , anyway . "
stillman moved about in a circle around the place , with the lantern , pretending to hunt for tracks .
" well ! "
he said presently , in an annoyed tone , " i do n't understand it . "
he examined again .
" no use .
she was here  that 's certain ; she never walked away from here  and that 's certain .
it 's a puzzle ; i ca n't make it out . "
the mother lost heart then .
" oh , my god !
oh , blessed virgin !
some flying beast has got her .
i'll never see her again ! "
" ah , do n't give up , " said archy .
" we 'll find her  do n't give up . "
" god bless you for the words , archy stillman ! "
and she seized his hand and kissed it fervently .
peterson , the new-comer , whispered <unk> in ferguson 's ear : " wonderful performance to find this place , was n't it ?
hardly worth while to come so far , though ; any other <unk> place would have answered just as well  hey ? "
ferguson was not pleased with the <unk> .
he said , with some warmth , " do you mean to insinuate that the child has n't been here ?
i tell you the child has been here !
now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a little fuss as  " " all right ! "
sang out stillman .
" come , everybody , and look at this !
it was right under our noses all the time , and we did n't see it . "
there was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to have rested , and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that archy 's finger was resting upon .
there was a pause , then a <unk> sigh of disappointment .
<name> <name> and ham sandwich said , in the one breath , " what is it , archy ?
there 's nothing here . "
" nothing ?
do you call that nothing ? "
and he swiftly traced upon the ground a form with his finger .
" there  do n't you recognize it now ?
it's injun <name> 's track .
he 's got the child . "
" god be praised ! "
from the mother .
" take away the lantern .
i 've got the direction .
follow ! "
he started on a run , racing in and out among the <unk> a matter of three hundred yards , and disappeared over a <unk> ; the others struggled after him , caught him up , and found him waiting .
ten steps away was a little <unk> , a dim and formless shelter of rags and old <unk> , a dull light showing through its chinks .
" you lead , mrs. hogan , " said the lad .
" it 's your privilege to be first . "
all followed the <unk> she made for the <unk> , and saw , with her , the picture its interior afforded .
injun <name> was sitting on the ground ; the child was asleep beside him .
the mother hugged it with a wild embrace , which included archy stillman , the grateful tears running down her face , and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full richness nowhere but in the <name> heart .
" i find her <unk> it is ten o'clock , " <name> explained .
" she <unk> out yonder , <unk> tired  face wet , been cryin ' , <unk> ; fetch her home , feed her , she heap much hungry  go <unk> <unk> . "
in her limitless gratitude the happy mother <unk> rank and hugged him too , calling him " the <name> of god in disguise . "
and he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of an official .
he was dressed for the character .
at half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing , " when <name> comes marching home , " waving its lanterns , and swallowing the drinks that were brought out all along its course .
it concentrated at the tavern , and made a night of what was left of the morning .
part ii i the next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation .
a grave and dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern , and entered this formidable name upon the register : sherlock holmes .
the news <unk> from cabin to cabin , from claim to claim ; tools were dropped , and the town swarmed toward the center of interest .
a man passing out at the northern end of the village shouted it to <name> <name> , whose claim was the next one to flint buckner 's .
at that time fetlock jones seemed to turn sick .
he muttered to himself , " uncle sherlock !
the mean luck of it !  that he should come just when ... . " he dropped into a reverie , and presently said to himself : " but what 's the use of being afraid of him ?
anybody that knows him the way i do knows he ca n't detect a crime except where he plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and <unk> some fellow to commit it according to instructions ... . now there ai n't going to be any clues this time  so , what show has he got ?
none at all .
no , sir ; <unk> ready .
if i was to risk putting it off ... . no , i wo n't run any risk like that .
flint buckner goes out of this world to-night , for sure . "
then another trouble presented itself .
" uncle sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening , and how am i going to get rid of him ?
for i 've got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight o'clock . "
this was an awkward matter , and cost him much thought .
but he found a way to beat the difficulty .
" we 'll go for a walk , and i 'll leave him in the road a minute , so that he wo n't see what it is i do : the best way to throw a detective off the track , anyway , is to have him along when you are preparing the thing .
yes , that 's the safest  i 'll take him with me . "
meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man .
but he kept his room , and did not appear .
none but ferguson , <name> <name> the blacksmith , and ham sandwich had any luck .
these enthusiastic admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern 's <unk> lockup , which looked into the detective 's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide , ambushed themselves in it , and cut some <unk> in the <unk> .
mr. holmes 's blinds were down ; but by-and-by he raised them .
it gave the spies a <unk> but pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the extraordinary man who had filled the world with the fame of his more than human <unk> .
there he sat  not a myth , not a shadow , but real , alive , compact of substance , and almost within touching distance with the hand .
" look at that head ! "
said ferguson , in an awed voice .
" by gracious !
that 's a head ! "
" you bet ! "
said the blacksmith , with deep reverence .
" look at his nose !
look at his eyes !
intellect ?
just a battery of it ! "
" and that paleness , " said ham sandwich .
" comes from thought  that 's what it comes from .
hell !
<unk> like us do n't know what real thought is . "
" no more we do n't , " said ferguson .
" what we take for thinking is just <unk> . "
" right you are , <unk> .
and look at that frown  that 's deep thinking  away down , down , forty fathom into the bowels of things .
he's on the track of something . "
" well , he is , and do n't you forget it .
say  look at that awful gravity  look at that pallid <unk>  there ai n't any corpse can lay over it . "
" no , sir , not for dollars !
and it 's his'n by hereditary rights , too ; he 's been dead four times <unk> , and there 's history for it .
three times natural , once by accident .
i 've heard say he smells damp and cold , like a grave .
and he  " " <unk> !
watch him !
there  he 's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his forehead , and his forefinger on the off one .
his <unk> is just <unk> now , you bet your other shirt . "
" that 's so .
and now he 's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow , and  " " now he has rose up standing , and is putting his clues together on his left fingers with his right finger .
see ?
he touches the forefinger  now middle finger  now <unk>  " " stuck ! "
" look at him scowl !
he ca n't seem to make out that clue .
so he  " " see him smile !  like a tiger  and tally off the other fingers like nothing !
he 's got it , boys ; he 's got it sure ! "
" well , i should say !
i 'd hate to be in that man 's place that he's after . "
mr. holmes <name> a table to the window , sat down with his back to the spies , and proceeded to write .
the spies withdrew their eyes from the <unk> , lit their pipes , and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk .
ferguson said , with conviction , " boys , it 's no use talking , he 's a wonder !
he 's got the signs of it all over him . "
" you <name> n't ever said a truer word than that , <unk> , " said <name> <name> .
" say , would n't it 'a ' been nuts if he 'd <unk> here last night ? "
" oh , by <name> , but would n't it ! "
said ferguson .
" then we 'd have seen scientific work .
intellect  just pure intellect  away up on the upper levels , <unk> .
archy is all right , and it do n't become anybody to <unk> him , i can tell you .
but his gift is only just eyesight , sharp as an owl 's , as near as i can make it out just a grand natural animal talent , no more , no less , and prime as far as it goes , but no intellect in it , and for <unk> and <unk> no more to be compared to what this man does than  than  why , let me tell you what he 'd have done .
he 'd have stepped over to hogan 's and glanced  just glanced , that's all  at the premises , and that 's enough .
see everything ?
yes , sir , to the last little detail ; and he 'll know more about that place than the <unk> would know in seven years .
next , he would sit down on the bunk , just as ca 'm , and say to mrs. hogan  say , ham , consider that you are mrs. hogan .
i 'll ask the questions ; you answer them . "
" all right ; go on . "
" <unk> , if you please  attention  do not let your mind wander .
now , then  sex of the child ? '
" <unk> , your honor . '
" 'um  female .
very good , very good .
age ? '
" <unk> six , your honor . '
" 'um  young , weak  two miles .
weariness <name> overtake it then .
it <name> sink down and sleep .
we shall find it two miles away , or less .
teeth ? '
" 'five , your honor , and one a-coming . '
" 'very good , very good , very good , indeed . '
you see , boys , he knows a clue when he sees it , when it would n't mean a dern thing to anybody else .
<unk> , madam ?
shoes ? '
" 'yes , your honor  both . '
" <unk> , perhaps ?
morocco ? '
" <unk> , your honor .
and <name> . '
" 'um  <name> .
this <unk> the matter .
however , let it go  we shall manage .
religion ? '
" <unk> , your honor . '
" 'very good .
<unk> me a bit from the bed blanket , please .
ah , thanks .
part wool  foreign make .
very well .
a <unk> from some garment of the child 's , please .
thanks .
cotton .
shows wear .
an excellent clue , excellent .
pass me a pallet of the floor dirt , if you 'll be so kind .
thanks , many thanks .
ah , admirable , admirable !
now we know where we are , i think . '
you see , boys , he 's got all the clues he wants now ; he don't need anything more .
now , then , what does this extraordinary man do ?
he lays those <unk> and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his elbows , and puts them together side by side and studies them  <unk> to himself , <unk> ' ; changes them around  <unk> , <unk> years old ' ; changes them this way and that  again <unk> : 'five teeth  one a-coming  catholic  yarn  cotton  <name>  damn that <name> . '
then he straightens up and gazes toward heaven , and <unk> his hands through his hair  <unk> and <unk> , muttering , <unk> that <name> ! '
then he stands up and frowns , and begins to tally off his clues on his fingers  and gets stuck at the <unk> .
but only just a minute  then his face <unk> all up in a smile like a house afire , and he straightens up stately and majestic , and says to the crowd , 'take a lantern , a couple of you , and go down to injun <name> 's and fetch the child  the rest of you go 'long home to bed ; good-night , madam ; good-night , gents . '
and he bows like the matterhorn , and pulls out for the tavern .
that 's his style , and the only  scientific , intellectual  all over in fifteen minutes  no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a <unk> crowd for him , boys  you hear me ! "
" by <name> , it 's grand ! "
said ham sandwich .
" <unk> , you 've got him down to a <name> .
he ai n't painted up any <unk> to the life in the books .
by <name> , i can just see him  ca n't you , boys ? "
" you bet you !
it 's just a <unk> , that 's what it is . "
ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success , and grateful .
he sat silently enjoying his happiness a little while , then he murmured , with a deep awe in his voice , " i wonder if god made him ? "
there was no response for a moment ; then ham sandwich said , reverently , " not all at one time , i reckon . "
ii at eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past flint buckner 's cabin in the frosty gloom .
they were sherlock holmes and his nephew .
" stop here in the road a moment , uncle , " said fetlock , " while i run to my cabin ; i wo n't be gone a minute . "
he asked for something  the uncle furnished it  then he disappeared in the darkness , but soon returned , and the <unk> was resumed .
by nine o'clock they had wandered back to the tavern .
they worked their way through the billiard-room , where a crowd had gathered in the <name> of getting a glimpse of the extraordinary man .
a <name> cheer was raised .
mr. holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows , and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage , " uncle sherlock 's got some work to do , gentlemen , that 'll keep him till twelve or one ; but he 'll be down again then , or earlier if he can , and hopes some of you 'll be left to take a drink with him . "
" by <name> , he 's just a duke , boys !
three cheers for sherlock holmes , the greatest man that ever lived ! "
shouted ferguson .
" hip , hip , hip  " " hurrah !
hurrah !
hurrah !
tiger ! "
the uproar shook the building , so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their welcome .
upstairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently , saying , " what did you get me into that engagement for ? "
" i reckon you do n't want to be unpopular , do you , uncle ?
well , then , do n't you put on any <unk> in a <unk> , that 's all .
the boys admire you ; but if you was to leave without taking a drink with them , they 'd set you down for a <unk> .
and , besides , you said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night . "
the boy was right , and wise  the uncle acknowledged it .
the boy was wise in another detail which he did not mention  except to himself : " uncle and the others <name> come handy  in the way of <unk> an <unk> where it ca n't be <unk> . "
he and his uncle talked diligently about three hours .
then , about midnight , fetlock stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern , and waited .
five minutes later flint buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and almost brushed him as he passed .
" i 've got him ! "
muttered the boy .
he continued to himself , looking after the shadowy form : " good-by  good-by for good , flint buckner ; you called my mother a  well , never mind what ; it 's all right , now ; you 're taking your last walk , friend . "
he went musing back into the tavern .
" from now till one is an hour .
we 'll spend it with the boys ; it 's good for the <unk> . "
he brought sherlock holmes to the billiard-room , which was jammed with eager and admiring miners ; the guest called the drinks , and the fun began .
everybody was happy ; everybody was complimentary ; the ice was soon broken ; songs , anecdotes , and more drinks followed , and the pregnant minutes flew .
at six minutes to one , when the <unk> was at its highest  boom !
there was silence instantly .
the deep sound came rolling and rumbling from peak to peak up the gorge , then died down , and ceased .
the spell broke , then , and the men made a rush for the door , saying , " something 's blown up ! "
outside , a voice in the darkness said , " it 's away down the gorge ; i saw the flash . "
the crowd poured down the canyon  holmes , fetlock , archy stillman , everybody .
they made the mile in a few minutes .
by the light of a lantern they found the smooth and solid dirt floor of flint <unk> cabin ; of the cabin itself not a vestige remained , not a rag nor a splinter .
nor any sign of flint .
<unk> sought here and there and yonder , and presently a cry went up .
" here he is ! "
it was true .
fifty yards down the gulch they had found him  that is , they had found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him .
fetlock jones hurried thither with the others and looked .
the inquest was a <unk> affair .
ham sandwich , foreman of the jury , handed up the verdict , which was phrased with a certain <unk> literary <name> , and closed with this finding , to wit : that " deceased came to his death by his own act or some other person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind but his cabin which was blown away and god have <name> on his soul amen . "
then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd , for the <unk> of interest was there  sherlock holmes .
the miners stood silent and reverent in a <unk> , <unk> a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late premises .
in this considerable space the extraordinary man was moving about , attended by his nephew with a lantern .
with a tape he took measurements of the cabin site ; of the distance from the wall of <unk> to the road ; of the height of the <unk> bushes ; also various other measurements .
he gathered a rag here , a splinter there , and a pinch of earth yonder , inspected them profoundly , and preserved them .
he took the " lay " of the place with a <unk> , allowing two seconds for magnetic variation .
he took the time ( pacific ) by his watch , correcting it for local time .
he paced off the distance from the cabin site to the corpse , and corrected that for tidal differentiation .
he took the altitude with a <unk> , and the temperature with a <unk> .
finally he said , with a stately bow : " it is finished .
shall we return , gentlemen ? "
he took up the line of march for the tavern , and the crowd fell into his wake , earnestly discussing and admiring the extraordinary man , and <unk> guesses as to the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he .
" my , but it 's grand luck having him here  hey , boys ? "
said ferguson .
" it 's the biggest thing of the century , " said ham sandwich .
" it 'll go all over the world ; you <name> my words . "
" you bet ! "
said <name> <name> , the blacksmith .
" it 'll boom this camp .
ai n't it so , <unk> ? "
" well , as you want my opinion  if it 's any sign of how i think about it , i can tell you this : yesterday i was holding the straight flush claim at two dollars a foot ; i 'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen today . "
" right you are , <unk> !
it 's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck .
say , did you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things ?
what an eye !
he just ca n't overlook a clue  'tai n't in him . "
" that 's so .
and they would n't mean a thing to anybody else ; but to him , why , they 're just a book  large print at that . "
" sure 's you 're born !
them odds and ends have got their little old secret , and they think there ai n't anybody can pull it ; but , land !
when he sets his grip there they 've got to squeal , and do n't you forget it . "
" boys , i ai n't sorry , now , that he was n't here to <unk> out the child ; this is a bigger thing , by a long sight .
yes , sir , and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual . "
" i reckon we 're all of us glad it 's turned out this way .
glad ?
<unk> !
it ai n't any name for it .
<unk> , archy could 've learnt something if he 'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system .
but no ; he went poking up into the <unk> and just missed the whole thing . "
" it 's true as gospel ; i seen it myself .
well , archy 's young .
he 'll know better one of these days . "
" say , boys , who do you reckon done it ? "
that was a difficult question , and brought out a world of <unk> conjecture .
various men were mentioned as possibilities , but one by one they were discarded as not being eligible .
no one but young <unk> had been intimate with flint buckner ; no one had really had a quarrel with him ; he had <unk> every man who had tried to make up to him , although not quite <unk> enough to require bloodshed .
there was one name that was upon every tongue from the start , but it was the last to get utterance  fetlock jones 's .
it was <name> <name> that mentioned it .
" oh , well , " the boys said , " of course we 've all thought of him , because he had a million rights to kill flint buckner , and it was just his plain duty to do it .
but all the same there 's two things we ca n't get around , for one thing , he has n't got the sand ; and for another , he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened . "
" i know it , " said <name> .
" he was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened . "
" yes , and was there all the time for an hour before it happened . "
" it 's so .
and lucky for him , too .
he 'd have been suspected in a minute if it had n't been for that . "
iii the tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine table and a chair .
this table was against one end of the room ; the chair was on it ; sherlock holmes , stately , imposing , impressive , sat in the chair .
the public stood .
the room was full .
the <unk> was dense , the stillness profound .
the extraordinary man raised his hand to command additional silence ; held it in the air a few moments ; then , in brief , crisp terms he put forward question after question , and noted the answers with " <unk> , " nods of the head , and so on .
by this process he learned all about flint buckner , his character , conduct , and habits , that the people were able to tell him .
it thus transpired that the extraordinary man 's nephew was the only person in the camp who had a <unk> against flint buckner .
mr. holmes smiled <unk> upon the witness , and asked , languidly  " do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad fetlock jones was at the time of the explosion ? "
a thunderous response followed  " in the billiard-room of this house ! "
" ah .
and had he just come in ? "
" been there all of an hour ! "
" ah .
it is about  about  well , about how far might it be to the scene of the explosions . "
" all of a mile ! "
" ah .
it is n't much of an <unk> , 't is true , but  " a <unk> of laughter , mingled with shouts of " by <unk> , but he's <unk> ! "
and " ai n't you sorry you spoke , <name> ? "
shut off the rest of the sentence , and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame .
the <unk> resumed : " the lad jones 's somewhat distant connection with the case " ( laughter ) " having been disposed of , let us now call the <unk> of the tragedy , and listen to what they have to say . "
he got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee .
the house held its breath and watched .
" we have the longitude and the latitude , corrected for magnetic variation , and this gives us the exact location of the tragedy .
we have the altitude , the temperature , and the degree of <unk> prevailing  <unk> valuable , since they enable us to estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night . "
( buzz of admiration ; muttered remark , " by <name> , but he 's deep ! " )
he fingered his clues .
" and now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak to us .
" here we have an empty linen <unk> .
what is its message ?
this : that robbery was the motive , not revenge .
what is its further message ?
this : that the assassin was of inferior intelligence  shall we say <unk> , or perhaps approaching that ?
how do we know this ?
because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to <name> the man buckner , who never had much money with him .
but the assassin might have been a stranger ?
let the bag speak again .
i take from it this article .
it is a bit of <unk> quartz .
it is peculiar .
examine it , please  you  and you  and you .
now pass it back , please .
there is but one <unk> on this coast which produces just that character and color of quartz ; and that is a <unk> which crops out for nearly two miles on a stretch , and in my opinion is destined , at no distant day , to confer upon its locality a <unk> celebrity , and upon its two hundred owners riches beyond the dreams of avarice .
name that <unk> , please . "
" the consolidated <name> science and <name> <name> ! "
was the prompt response .
a wild crash of <unk> followed , and every man reached for his neighbor 's hand and wrung it , with tears in his eyes ; and <unk> ferguson shouted , " the straight flush is on the <unk> , and up she goes to a <unk> and fifty a foot  you hear me ! "
when quiet fell , mr. holmes resumed : " we perceive , then , that three facts are established , to wit : the assassin was approximately <unk> ; he was not a stranger ; his motive was robbery , not revenge .
let us proceed .
i hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse , with the recent smell of fire upon it .
what is its testimony ?
taken with the <unk> evidence of the quartz , it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner .
what does it tell us further ?
this , gentlemen : that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive .
what else does it say ?
this : that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin nearest the road  the front side  for within six feet of that spot i found it .
" i hold in my fingers a burnt swedish match  the kind one rubs on a <unk> .
i found it in the road , six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin .
what does it say ?
this : that the train was fired from that point .
what further does it tell us ?
this : that the assassin was left-handed .
how do i know this ?
i should not be able to explain to you , gentlemen , how i know it , the signs being so subtle that only long experience and deep study can enable one to detect them .
but the signs are here , and they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective narratives  that all assassins are left-handed . "
" by <name> , that 's so ! "
said ham sandwich , bringing his great hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh ; " blamed if i ever thought of it before . "
" nor i ! "
" nor i ! "
cried several .
" oh , there ca n't anything escape him  look at his eye ! "
" gentlemen , distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim , he did not wholly escape injury .
this fragment of wood which i now exhibit to you struck him .
it <name> blood .
wherever he is , he bears the <unk> <name> .
i picked it up where he stood when he fired the fatal train . "
he looked out over the house from his high perch , and his countenance began to darken ; he slowly raised his hand , and pointed  " there stands the assassin ! "
for a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement ; then twenty voices burst out with : " <name> <unk> ?
oh , hell , no !
him ?
it 's pure foolishness ! "
" take care , gentlemen  be not hasty .
observe  he has the <unk> on his brow . "
<unk> turned white with fright .
he was near to crying .
he turned this way and that , appealing to every face for help and sympathy ; and held out his supplicating hands toward holmes and began to plead , " do n't , oh , do n't !
i never did it ; i give my word i never did it .
the way i got this hurt on my forehead was  " " arrest him , constable ! "
cried holmes .
" i <name> swear out the warrant . "
the constable moved reluctantly forward  hesitated  stopped .
<unk> broke out with another appeal .
" oh , archy , do n't let them do it ; it would kill mother !
you know how i got the hurt .
tell them , and save me , archy ; save me ! "
stillman worked his way to the front , and said , " yes , i 'll save you .
do n't be afraid . "
then he said to the house , " never mind how he got the hurt ; it has n't anything to do with this case , and is n't of any consequence . "
" god bless you , archy , for a true friend ! "
" hurrah for archy !
go in , boy , and play 'em a <unk> flush to their two pair 'n ' a <name> ! "
shouted the house , pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the situation .
young stillman waited for the noise to cease ; then he said , " i <name> ask <name> <unk> to stand by that door yonder , and constable <name> to stand by the other one here , and not let anybody leave the room .
" said and done .
go on , old man ! "
" the criminal is present , i believe .
i <name> show him to you before long , in case i am right in my guess .
now i <name> tell you all about the tragedy , from start to finish .
the motive was n't robbery ; it was revenge .
the murderer was n't <unk> .
he did n't stand six hundred and twenty-two feet away .
he did n't get hit with a piece of wood .
he did n't place the explosive against the cabin .
he did n't bring a <unk> with him , and he was n't left-handed .
with the exception of these errors , the distinguished guest 's statement of the case is substantially correct . "
a comfortable laugh rippled over the house ; friend nodded to friend , as much as to say , " that 's the word , with the bark on it .
good lad , good boy .
he ai n't lowering his flag any ! "
the guest 's serenity was not disturbed .
stillman resumed : " i also have some witnesses ; and i <name> presently tell you where you can find some more . "
he held up a piece of coarse wire ; the crowd <unk> their necks to see .
" it has a smooth coating of melted tallow on it .
and here is a candle which is burned half-way down .
the remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart .
soon i <name> tell you where i found these things .
i <name> now put aside reasonings , guesses , the impressive <unk> of odds and ends of clues together , and the other showy theatricals of the detective trade , and tell you in a plain , straightforward way just how this dismal thing happened . "
he paused a moment , for effect  to allow silence and suspense to <unk> and concentrate the house 's interest ; then he went on : " the assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains .
it was a good plan , very ingenious , and showed an intelligent mind , not a feeble one .
it was a plan which was well calculated to <name> off all suspicion from its inventor .
in the first place , he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart , and lit it and timed it .
he found it took three hours to burn four inches of it .
i tried it myself for half an hour , awhile ago , up-stairs here , while the inquiry into flint buckner 's character and ways was being conducted in this room , and i arrived in that way at the rate of a candle 's consumption when sheltered from the wind .
having proved his trial candle 's rate , he blew it out  i have already shown it to you  and put his <unk> on a fresh one .
" he put the fresh one into a tin candlestick .
then at the <unk> <name> he bored a hole through the candle with a red-hot wire .
i have already shown you the wire , with a smooth coat of tallow on it  tallow that had been melted and had cooled .
" with labor  very hard labor , i should say  he struggled up through the stiff <unk> that clothes the steep hillside back of flint <unk> place , tugging an empty <unk> with him .
he placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place , and in the bottom of it he set the candlestick .
then he measured off about thirty-five feet of fuse  the barrel 's distance from the back of the cabin .
he bored a hole in the side of the barrel  here is the large <unk> he did it with .
he went on and finished his work ; and when it was done , one end of the fuse was in buckner 's cabin , and the other end , with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder , was in the hole in the candle  timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning , provided the candle was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening  which i am betting it was  and provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the fuse  which i am also betting there was , though i ca n't prove it .
boys , the barrel is there in the <unk> , the candle 's remains are in it in the tin stick ; the <unk> fuse is in the <unk> , the other end is down the hill where the late cabin stood .
i saw them all an hour or two ago , when the professor here was measuring off <unk> vacancies and collecting relics that had n't anything to do with the case . "
he paused .
the house <name> a long , deep breath , shook its strained cords and muscles free and burst into cheers .
" <unk> him ! "
said ham sandwich , " that 's why he was <unk> around in the <unk> , instead of picking up points out of the <unk> 's game .
looky here  he ai n't no fool , boys . "
" no , sir !
why , great <name>  " but stillman was resuming : " while we were out yonder an hour or two ago , the owner of the <unk> and the <unk> took them from a place where he had concealed them  it was not a good place  and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one , two hundred yards up in the pine woods , and hid them there , covering them over with pine needles .
it was there that i found them .
the <unk> exactly fits the hole in the barrel .
and now  " the extraordinary man interrupted him .
he said , sarcastically , " we have had a very pretty <name> tale , gentlemen  very pretty indeed .
now i would like to ask this young man a question or two . "
some of the boys winced , and ferguson said , " i 'm afraid archy 's going to catch it now . "
the others lost their smiles and sobered down .
mr. holmes said , " let us proceed to examine into this <unk> in a consecutive and orderly way  by geometrical progression , so to speak  linking detail to detail in a steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel <unk> of error , the dream fabric of a <unk> .
to begin with , young sir , i <name> to ask you but three questions at present  at present .
did i understand you to say it was your opinion that the <unk> candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening ? "
" yes , sir  about eight . "
" could you say exactly eight ? "
" well , no , i could n't be that exact . "
" um .
if a person had been passing along there just about that time , he would have been almost sure to encounter that assassin , do you think ? "
" yes , i should think so . "
" thank you , that is all .
for the present .
i say , all for the present . "
" dern him , he 's laying for archy , " said ferguson .
" it 's so , " said ham sandwich .
" i do n't like the look of it . "
stillman said , glancing at the guest , " i was along there myself at half past eight  no , about nine . "
" indeed ?
this is interesting  this is very interesting .
perhaps you encountered the assassin ? "
" no , i encountered no one . "
" ah .
then  if you <name> excuse the remark  i do not quite see the relevancy of the information . "
" it has none .
at present .
i say it has none  at present . "
he paused .
presently he resumed : " i did not encounter the assassin , but i am on his track , i am sure , for i believe he is in this room .
i <name> ask you all to pass one by one in front of me  here , where there is a good light  so that i can see your feet . "
a buzz of excitement swept the place , and the march began , the guest looking on with an iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success .
stillman stooped , shaded his eyes with his hand , and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed .
fifty men tramped monotonously by  with no result .
sixty .
seventy .
the thing was beginning to look absurd .
the guest remarked , with <unk> irony , " assassins appear to be scarce this evening . "
the house saw the humor if it , and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh .
ten or twelve more candidates tramped by  no , danced by , with airy and ridiculous <unk> which convulsed the spectators  then suddenly stillman put out his hand and said , " this is the assassin ! "
" fetlock jones , by the great <unk> ! "
roared the crowd ; and at once let fly a <unk> explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the situation .
at the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand , commanding peace .
the authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon the house , and it obeyed .
out of the panting calm which succeeded , the guest spoke , saying , with dignity and feeling , " this is serious .
it strikes at an innocent life .
innocent beyond suspicion !
innocent beyond peradventure !
hear me prove it ; observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie .
listen .
my friends , that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at any time ! "
it made a deep impression .
men turned their eyes upon stillman with grave inquiry in them .
his face brightened , and he said , " i knew there was another one ! "
he stepped briskly to the table and glanced at the guest 's feet , then up at his face , and said : " you were with him !
you were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle that by-and-by fired the powder ! "
( sensation . )
" and what is more , you furnished the matches yourself ! "
plainly the guest seemed hit ; it looked so to the public .
he opened his mouth to speak ; the words did not come freely .
" this  er  this is insanity  this  " stillman pressed his evident advantage home .
he held up a charred match .
" here is one of them .
i found it in the barrel  and there 's another one there . "
the guest found his voice at once .
" yes  and put them there yourself ! "
it was recognized a good shot .
stillman retorted .
" it is wax  a breed unknown to this camp .
i am ready to be searched for the box .
are you ? "
the guest was staggered this time  the dullest eye could see it .
he fumbled with his hands ; once or twice his lips moved , but the words did not come .
the house waited and watched , in tense suspense , the stillness adding effect to the situation .
presently stillman said , gently , " we are waiting for your decision . "
there was silence again during several moments ; then the guest answered , in a low voice , " i refuse to be searched . "
there was no noisy demonstration , but all about the house one voice after another muttered , " that settles it !
he 's archy 's meat . "
what to do now ?
nobody seemed to know .
it was an embarrassing situation for the moment  merely , of course , because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected turn that these <unk> minds were not prepared for it , and had come to a standstill , like a stopped clock , under the shock .
but after a little the machinery began to work again , <unk> , and by twos and threes the men put their heads together and privately <unk> over this and that and the other proposition .
one of these propositions met with much favor ; it was , to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks for removing flint buckner , and let him go .
but the cooler heads opposed it , pointing out that <unk> brains in the eastern states would pronounce it a scandal , and make no end of foolish noise about it .
finally the cool heads got the upper hand , and obtained general consent to a proposition of their own ; their leader then called the house to order and stated it  to this effect : that fetlock jones be jailed and put upon trial .
the motion was carried .
apparently there was nothing further to do now , and the people were glad , for , privately , they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the tragedy , and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not .
but no  the <unk> got a check .
the surprises were not over yet .
for a while fetlock jones had been silently sobbing , unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which had been following one another so persistently for some time ; but when his arrest and trial were decreed , he broke out despairingly , and said , " no !
it 's no use .
i do n't want any jail , i do n't want any trial ; i've had all the hard luck i want , and all the miseries .
<name> me now , and let me out !
it would all come out , anyway  there could n't anything save me .
he has told it all , just as if he 'd been with me and seen it  i don't know how he found out ; and you 'll find the barrel and things , and then i would n't have any chance any more .
i killed him ; and you 'd have done it too , if he 'd treated you like a dog , and you only a boy , and weak and poor , and not a friend to help you . "
" and served him damned well right ! "
broke in ham sandwich .
" looky here , boys  " from the constable : " order !
order , gentlemen ! "
a voice : " did your uncle know what you was up to ? "
" no , he did n't . "
" did he give you the matches , sure enough ? "
" yes , he did ; but he did n't know what i wanted them for . "
" when you was out on such a business as that , how did you venture to risk having him along  and him a detective ?
how 's that ? "
the boy hesitated , fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way , then said , shyly , " i know about detectives , on account of having them in the family ; and if you do n't want them to find out about a thing , it 's best to have them around when you do it . "
the cyclone of laughter which greeted this <unk> discharge of wisdom did not modify the poor little waif 's embarrassment in any large degree .
iv from a letter to mrs. stillman , dated merely " tuesday . "
fetlock jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin , and left there to await his trial .
constable <name> provided him with a couple of days ' rations , instructed him to keep a good guard over himself , and promised to look in on him as soon as further supplies should be due .
next morning a score of us went with <unk> , out of friendship , and helped him bury his late relative , the <unk> buckner , and i acted as first assistant <unk> , <unk> acting as chief .
just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger , carrying an old hand-bag , limped by with his head down , and i caught the scent i had chased around the globe !
it was the odor of paradise to my perishing <name> !
in a moment i was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder .
he <unk> to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks ; and as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to me , and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more , and said , " you have hunted me around the world , sherlock holmes , yet god is my witness i have never done any man harm ! "
a glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane .
that was my work , mother !
the tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery i felt in that moment , but nothing else can ever do it .
the boys lifted him up , and gathered about him , and were full of pity of him , and said the gentlest and <unk> things to him , and said cheer up and don't be troubled , he was among friends now , and they would take care of him , and protect him , and <name> any man that laid a hand on him .
they are just like so many mothers , the rough <unk> boys are , when you wake up the south side of their hearts ; yes , and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up the opposite of that muscle .
they did everything they could think of to comfort him , but nothing succeeded until <unk> ferguson , who is a clever strategist , said , " if it 's only sherlock holmes that 's troubling you , you need n't worry any more . "
" why ? "
asked the forlorn lunatic , eagerly .
" because he 's dead again . "
" dead !
dead !
oh , do n't trifle with a poor wreck like me .
is he dead ?
on honor , now  is he telling me true , boys ? "
" true as you 're standing there ! "
said ham sandwich , and they all backed up the statement in a body .
" they <name> him in san <unk> last week , " added ferguson , <unk> the matter , " whilst he was searching around after you .
mistook him for another man .
they 're sorry , but they ca n't help it now . "
" they 're <unk> him a monument , " said ham sandwich , with the air of a person who had contributed to it , and knew .
" <name> <name> " <name> a deep sigh  evidently a sigh of relief  and said nothing ; but his eyes lost something of their wildness , his countenance cleared visibly , and its drawn look relaxed a little .
we all went to our cabin , and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for , and while they were about it <unk> and i <unk> him from hat to <unk> with new clothes of ours , and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him .
" old " is the right word , and a pity , too ; old by the droop of him , and the frost upon his hair , and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face ; though he is only in his prime in the matter of years .
while he ate , we smoked and chatted ; and when he was finishing he found his voice at last , and of his own accord broke out with his personal history .
i can not furnish his exact words , but i <name> come as near it as i can .
the " wrong man 's " story it happened like this : i was in <name> .
i had been there many years ; sometimes i remember how many , sometimes i do n't  but it is n't any matter .
all of a sudden i got a notice to leave , or i would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long before  years and years before  in the east .
i knew about that crime , but i was not the criminal ; it was a cousin of mine of the same name .
what should i better do ?
my head was all disordered by fear , and i did n't know .
i was allowed very little time  only one day , i think it was .
i would be ruined if i was published , and the people would lynch me , and not believe what i said .
it is always the way with <unk> : when they find out it is a mistake they are sorry , but it is too late  the same as it was with mr. holmes , you see .
so i said i would sell out and get money to live on , and run away until it blew over and i could come back with my proofs .
then i escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains somewhere , and lived disguised and had a false name .
i got more and more troubled and worried , and my troubles made me see spirits and hear voices , and i could not think straight and clear on any subject , but got confused and involved and had to give it up , because my head hurt so .
it got to be worse and worse ; more spirits and more voices .
they were about me all the time ; at first only in the night , then in the day too .
they were always whispering around my bed and plotting against me , and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out , because i got no good rest .
and then came the worst .
one night the whispers said , " we 'll never manage , because we ca n't see him , and so ca n't point him out to the people . "
they sighed ; then one said : " we must bring sherlock holmes .
he can be here in twelve days . "
they all agreed , and whispered and <unk> with <name> .
but my heart broke ; for i had read about that man , and knew what it would be to have him upon my track , with his superhuman penetration and tireless energies .
the spirits went away to fetch him , and i got up at once in the middle of the night and fled away , carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it  thirty thousand dollars ; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet .
it was forty days before that man caught up on my track .
i just escaped .
from habit he had written his real name on a tavern register , but had scratched it out and written " <unk> barclay " in the place of it .
but fear gives you a watchful eye and keen , and i read the true name through the scratches , and fled like a deer .
he has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half  the pacific states , australasia , <name>  everywhere you can think of ; then back to mexico and up to california again , giving me hardly any rest ; but that name on the <unk> always saved me , and what is left of me is alive yet .
and i am so tired !
a cruel time he has given me , yet i give you my honor i have never harmed him nor any man .
that was the end of the story , and it stirred those boys to <unk> , be sure of it .
as for me  each word burnt a hole in me where it struck .
we voted that the old man should bunk with us , and be my guest and <unk> 's .
i shall keep my own counsel , naturally ; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished , i shall take him to <name> and <unk> his fortunes .
the boys gave the old fellow the <unk> good-fellowship handshake of the mines , and then scattered away to spread the news .
at <name> next morning <unk> ferguson and ham sandwich called us softly out , and said , privately , " that news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around , and the camps are up .
they are piling in from everywhere , and are going to lynch the <unk> .
constable <name> is in a dead funk , and has telephoned the sheriff .
come along ! "
we started on a run .
the others were privileged to feel as they chose , but in my heart 's privacy i hoped the sheriff would arrive in time ; for i had small <name> that sherlock holmes should <name> for my deeds , as you can easily believe .
i had heard a good deal about the sheriff , but for <unk> 's sake i asked , " can he stop a mob ? "
" can he stop a mob !
can <name> <unk> stop a mob !
well , i should smile !
<unk>  nineteen scalps on his string .
can he !
oh , i say ! "
as we tore up the gulch , distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the still air , and grew steadily in strength as we raced along .
roar after roar burst out , stronger and stronger , nearer and nearer ; and at last , when we closed up upon the multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern , the crash of sound was deafening .
some brutal roughs from daly 's gorge had holmes in their grip , and he was the <unk> man there ; a contemptuous smile played about his lips , and if any fear of death was in his british heart , his iron personality was master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear .
" come to a vote , men ! "
this from one of the daly gang , <unk> higgins .
" quick !
is it <name> , or shoot ? "
" neither ! "
shouted one of his comrades .
" he 'll be alive again in a week ; burning 's the only permanency for him . "
the gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a <unk> of approval , and went struggling and surging toward the prisoner , and closed around him , shouting , " fire !
fire 's the ticket ! "
they dragged him to the <unk> , backed him against it , chained him to it , and piled wood and pine cones around him <unk> .
still the strong face did not <unk> , and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips .
" a match !
fetch a match ! "
<unk> struck it , shaded it with his hand , stooped , and held it under a pine cone .
a deep silence fell upon the mob .
the cone caught , a <name> flame flickered about it a moment or two .
i seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs  it grew more distinct  still more and more distinct , more and more definite , but the absorbed crowd did not appear to notice it .
the match went out .
the man struck another , stooped , and again the flame rose ; this time it took hold and began to spread  here and there men turned away their faces .
the executioner stood with the charred match in his fingers , watching his work .
the <unk> turned a projecting crag , and now they came thundering down upon us .
almost the next moment there was a shout  " the sheriff ! "
and straightway he came tearing into the midst , stood his horse almost on his hind feet , and said , " fall back , you <unk> ! "
he was obeyed .
by all but their leader .
he stood his ground , and his hand went to his revolver .
the sheriff covered him promptly , and said , " drop your hand , you <unk> .
kick the fire away .
now <unk> the stranger . "
the <unk> obeyed .
then the sheriff made a speech ; sitting his horse at martial ease , and not warming his words with any touch of fire , but delivering them in a measured and deliberate way , and in a tone which <unk> with their character and made them impressively disrespectful .
" you 're a nice lot  now ai n't you ?
just about eligible to travel with this <unk> here  <unk> higgins  this <unk> sneak that shoots people in the back and calls himself a desperado .
if there 's anything i do particularly despise , it 's a <unk> mob ; i 've never seen one that had a man in it .
it has to tally up a hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor .
it 's made up of cowards , and so is the community that breeds it ; and ninety-nine times out of a hundred the sheriff 's another one . "
he paused  apparently to turn that last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it  then he went on : " the sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the <unk> coward there is .
by the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in <name> last year .
by the way it 's going , pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the <unk>  sheriff complaint . "
that idea pleased him  any one could see it .
" people <name> say , <unk> sick again ? '
'yes ; got the same old thing . '
and next there 'll be a new title .
people wo n't say , <unk> running for sheriff of <unk> county , ' for instance ; they 'll say , <unk> running for coward of <unk> . '
lord , the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob ! "
he turned an eye on the captive , and said , " stranger , who are you , and what have you been doing ? "
" my name is sherlock holmes , and i have not been doing anything . "
it was wonderful , the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff , notwithstanding he must have come posted .
he spoke up with feeling , and said it was a blot on the country that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their fame and their ingenuity , and whose histories of them had won every reader 's heart by the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting , should be visited under the stars and stripes by an outrage like this .
he apologized in the name of the whole nation , and made holmes a most handsome bow , and told constable <name> to see him to his quarters , and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again .
then he turned to the mob and said , " hunt your holes , you scum ! "
which they did ; then he said : " follow me , <unk> ; i 'll take care of your case myself .
no  keep your <unk> ; whenever i see the day that i 'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing , it 'll be time for me to join last year 's hundred and eighty-two " ; and he rode off in a walk , <unk> following .
when we were on our way back to our cabin , toward <unk> , we ran upon the news that fetlock jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone !
nobody is sorry .
let his uncle track him out if he likes ; it is in his line ; the camp is not interested .
v ten days later  " <name> <name> " is all right in body now , and his mind shows improvement too .
i start with him for <name> to-morrow morning .
next night .
brief note , mailed at a <unk>  as we were starting , this morning , <unk> whispered to me : " keep this news from <name> until you think it safe and not likely to disturb his mind and check his improvement : the ancient crime he spoke of was really committed  and by his cousin , as he said .
we buried the real criminal the other day  the <unk> man that has lived in a century  flint buckner .
his real name was <name> fuller ! "
there , mother , by help of me , an <unk> mourner , your husband and my father is in his grave .
let him rest .
a horse 's tale chapter i  soldier boy  privately to himself i am buffalo <name> 's horse .
i have spent my life under his saddle  with him in it , too , and he is good for two hundred pounds , without his clothes ; and there is no telling how much he does weigh when he is out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on .
he is over six feet , is young , has n't an ounce of waste flesh , is straight , graceful , <unk> in his motions , quick as a cat , and has a handsome face , and black hair dangling down on his shoulders , and is beautiful to look at ; and nobody is braver than he is , and nobody is stronger , except myself .
yes , a person that doubts that he is fine to see should see him in his <unk> <unk> , on my back and his rifle peeping above his shoulder , chasing a hostile trail , with me going like the wind and his hair streaming out behind from the shelter of his broad slouch .
yes , he is a sight to look at then  and i 'm part of it myself .
i am his favorite horse , out of dozens .
big as he is , i have carried him <unk> miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout ; and i am good for fifty , day in and day out , and all the time .
i am not large , but i am built on a business basis .
i have carried him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for the army , and there 's not a gorge , nor a pass , nor a valley , nor a fort , nor a trading post , nor a <unk> in the whole sweep of the <name> mountains and the great plains that we do n't know as well as we know the <unk> .
he is chief of scouts to the army of the frontier , and it makes us very important .
in such a position as i hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess an education much above the common to be worthy of the place .
i am the <unk> horse outside of the hippodrome , everybody says , and the <unk> .
it may be so , it is not for me to say ; modesty is the best policy , i think .
buffalo <name> taught me the most of what i know , my mother taught me much , and i taught myself the rest .
lay a row of moccasins before me  pawnee , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , <unk> , and as many other tribes as you please  and i can name the tribe every <unk> belongs to by the make of it .
name it in <unk> , and could do it in american if i had speech .
i know some of the indian signs  the signs they make with their hands , and by <unk> at night and columns of smoke by day .
buffalo <name> taught me how to drag wounded soldiers out of the line of fire with my teeth ; and i 've done it , too ; at least i 've dragged him out of the battle when he was wounded .
and not just once , but twice .
yes , i know a lot of things .
i remember forms , and <unk> , and faces ; and you ca n't disguise a person that 's done me a kindness so that i wo n't know him thereafter wherever i find him .
i know the <name> of searching for a trail , and i know the stale track from the fresh .
i can keep a trail all by myself , with buffalo <name> asleep in the saddle ; ask him  he <name> tell you so .
many a time , when he has ridden all night , he has said to me at <name> , " take the watch , boy ; if the trail <unk> , call me . "
then he goes to sleep .
he knows he can trust me , because i have a reputation .
a scout horse that has a reputation does not play with it .
my mother was all american  no <unk> about her , i can tell you ; she was of the best blood of kentucky , the <unk> <unk> aristocracy , very proud and <unk>  or maybe it is ceremonious .
i do n't know which it is .
but it is no matter ; size is the main thing about a word , and that one 's up to standard .
she spent her military life as colonel of the tenth dragoons , and saw a deal of rough service  distinguished service it was , too .
i mean , she carried the colonel ; but it 's all the same .
where would he be without his horse ?
he would n't arrive .
it takes two to make a colonel of dragoons .
she was a fine <unk> horse , but never got above that .
she was strong enough for the scout service , and had the endurance , too , but she could n't quite come up to the speed required ; a scout horse has to have steel in his muscle and lightning in his blood .
my father was a bronco .
nothing as to lineage  that is , nothing as to recent lineage  but plenty good enough when you go a good way back .
when professor marsh was out here hunting bones for the chapel of yale university he found skeletons of horses no bigger than a fox , bedded in the rocks , and he said they were ancestors of my father .
my mother heard him say it ; and he said those skeletons were two million years old , which astonished her and made her kentucky pretensions look small and pretty <unk> , not to say oblique .
let me see .
.
.
.
i used to know the meaning of those words , but .
.
.
well , it was years ago , and 't is n't as vivid now as it was when they were fresh .
that sort of words does n't keep , in the kind of climate we have out here .
professor marsh said those skeletons were fossils .
so that makes me part blue grass and part fossil ; if there is any older or better stock , you <name> have to look for it among the four hundred , i reckon .
i am satisfied with it .
and am a happy horse , too , though born out of <unk> .
and now we are back at fort paxton once more , after a <unk> scout , away up as far as the big horn .
everything quiet .
crows and <unk> <unk>  as usual  but no <unk> , and settlers feeling fairly easy .
the seventh cavalry still in garrison , here ; also the ninth dragoons , two artillery companies , and some infantry .
all glad to see me , including general <name> , commandant .
the officers ' ladies and children well , and called upon me  with sugar .
colonel drake , seventh cavalry , said some pleasant things ; mrs. drake was very complimentary ; also captain and mrs. marsh , company b , seventh cavalry ; also the chaplain , who is always kind and pleasant to me , because i kicked the lungs out of a trader once .
it was <name> drake and <name> marsh that furnished the sugar  nice children , the nicest at the post , i think .
that poor orphan child is on her way from <name>  everybody is full of the subject .
her father was general <name> 's brother ; married a beautiful young spanish <name> ten years ago , and has never been in <name> since .
they lived in spain a year or two , then went to <name> .
both died some months ago .
this little girl that is coming is the only child .
general <name> is glad to have her .
he has never seen her .
he is a very nice old bachelor , but is an old bachelor just the same and is n't more than about a year this side of retirement by age limit ; and so what does he know about taking care of a little maid nine years old ?
if i could have her it would be another matter , for i know all about children , and they adore me .
buffalo <name> <name> tell you so himself .
i have some of this news from <unk> the <unk> , the rest of it i got from potter , the general 's dog .
potter is the great <name> .
he is privileged , all over the post , like shekels , the seventh cavalry 's dog , and visits everybody 's quarters and picks up everything that is going , in the way of news .
potter has no imagination , and no great deal of culture , perhaps , but he has a historical mind and a good memory , and so he is the person i depend upon mainly to post me up when i get back from a scout .
that is , if shekels is out on <unk> and i ca n't get hold of him .
chapter ii  letter from rouen  to general <name> my dear brother-in-law ,  please let me write again in spanish , i can not trust my english , and i am aware , from what your brother used to say , that army officers educated at the military academy of the united states are taught our tongue .
it is as i told you in my other letter : both my poor sister and her husband , when they found they could not recover , expressed the wish that you should have their little <name>  as knowing that you would presently be retired from the army  rather than that she should remain with me , who am broken in health , or go to your mother in california , whose health is also frail .
you do not know the child , therefore i must tell you something about her .
you <name> not be ashamed of her looks , for she is a copy in little of her beautiful mother  and it is that <unk> beauty which is not <unk> , even in your country .
she has her mother 's charm and <name> and good heart and sense of justice , and she has her father 's vivacity and cheerfulness and pluck and spirit of enterprise , with the affectionate disposition and sincerity of both parents .
my sister pined for her spanish home all these years of exile ; she was always talking of spain to the child , and tending and nourishing the love of spain in the little thing 's heart as a precious flower ; and she died happy in the knowledge that the <unk> of her patriotic labors was as <name> as even she could <name> .
<name> is a sufficiently good little scholar , for her nine years ; her mother taught her spanish herself , and kept it always fresh upon her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with her in any other tongue ; her father was her english teacher , and talked with her in that language almost exclusively ; french has been her everyday speech for more than seven years among her playmates here ; she has a good working use of governess  <name> and italian .
it is true that there is always a faint foreign fragrance about her speech , no matter what language she is talking , but it is only just noticeable , nothing more , and is rather a charm than a mar , i think .
in the ordinary <unk> <name> is neither before nor behind the average child of nine , i should say .
but i can say this for her : in love for her friends and in <unk> and good <unk> she has not many equals , and in my opinion no superiors .
and i beg of you , let her have her way with the dumb animals  they are her worship .
it is an inheritance from her mother .
she knows but little of cruelties and oppressions  keep them from her sight if you can .
she would flare up at them and make trouble , in her small but quite decided and resolute way ; for she has a character of her own , and lacks neither promptness nor initiative .
sometimes her judgment is at fault , but i think her intentions are always right .
once when she was a little creature of three or four years she suddenly brought her <name> foot down upon the floor in an apparent outbreak of indignation , then fetched it a backward wipe , and stooped down to examine the result .
her mother said : " why , what is it , child ?
what has stirred you so ? "
" mamma , the big ant was trying to kill the little one . "
" and so you protected the little one . "
" yes , manure , because he had no friend , and i would n't let the big one kill him . "
" but you have killed them both . "
<name> was distressed , and her lip trembled .
she picked up the remains and laid them upon her palm , and said : " poor little <unk> , i 'm so sorry ; and i did n't mean to kill you , but there was n't any other way to save you , it was such a hurry . "
she is a dear and sweet little <name> , and when she goes it <name> give me a sore heart .
but she <name> be happy with you , and if your heart is old and tired , give it into her keeping ; she <name> make it young again , she <name> refresh it , she <name> make it sing .
be good to her , for all our sakes !
my exile <name> soon be over now .
as soon as i am a little stronger i shall see my spain again ; and that <name> make me young again !
<name> .
chapter iii  general <name> to his mother i am glad to know that you are all well , in san <unk> .
.
.
.
that grandchild of yours has been here  well , i do not quite know how many days it is ; nobody can keep account of days or anything else where she is !
mother , she did what the indians were never able to do .
she took the fort  took it the first day !
took me , too ; took the colonels , the captains , the women , the children , and the dumb brutes ; took buffalo <name> , and all his scouts ; took the garrison  to the last man ; and in forty-eight hours the indian encampment was hers , illustrious old <unk> and all .
do i seem to have lost my solemnity , my gravity , my poise , my dignity ?
you would lose your own , in my circumstances .
mother , you never saw such a winning little devil .
she is all energy , and spirit , and <name> , and interest in everybody and everything , and pours out her prodigal love upon every creature that <name> take it , high or low , <name> or pagan , feathered or <unk> ; and none has declined it to date , and none ever <name> , i think .
but she has a temper , and sometimes it catches fire and flames up , and is likely to burn whatever is near it ; but it is soon over , the passion goes as quickly as it comes .
of course she has an indian name already ; indians always <unk> a stranger early .
<unk> attended to her case .
he gave her the indian equivalent for <unk> , or <unk> .
he said : " <unk> , ver ' quiet , ver ' soft , like summer night , but when she mad she blaze . "
is n't it good ?
ca n't you see the flare ?
she 's beautiful , mother , beautiful as a picture ; and there is a touch of you in her face , and of her father  poor <name> !
and in her <unk> activities , and her fearless ways , and her <unk> and <unk> , she is always bringing <name> back to me .
these impulsive natures are dramatic .
<name> was dramatic , so is this <unk> , so is buffalo <name> .
when <name> first arrived  it was in the forenoon  buffalo <name> was away , carrying orders to <name> fuller , at five forks , up in the <name> hills .
at <unk> i was at my desk , trying to work , and this sprite had been making it impossible for half an hour .
at last i said : " oh , you bewitching little scamp , ca n't you be quiet just a minute or two , and let your poor old uncle attend to a part of his duties ? "
" i 'll try , uncle ; i <name> , indeed , " she said .
" well , then , that 's a good child  kiss me .
now , then , sit up in that chair , and set your eye on that clock .
there  that 's right .
if you stir  if you so much as wink  for four whole minutes , i'll bite you ! "
it was very sweet and humble and obedient she looked , sitting there , still as a mouse ; i could hardly keep from setting her free and telling her to make as much racket as she wanted to .
during as much as two minutes there was a most unnatural and heavenly quiet and repose , then buffalo <name> came thundering up to the door in all his scout finery , flung himself out of the saddle , said to his horse , " wait for me , boy , " and stepped in , and stopped dead in his tracks  gazing at the child .
she forgot orders , and was on the floor in a moment , saying : " oh , you are so beautiful !
do you like me ? "
" no , i do n't , i love you ! "
and he gathered her up with a hug , and then set her on his shoulder  apparently nine feet from the floor .
she was at home .
she played with his long hair , and admired his big hands and his clothes and his carbine , and asked question after question , as fast as he could answer , until i excused them both for half an hour , in order to have a chance to finish my work .
then i heard <name> exclaiming over soldier boy ; and he was worthy of her <unk> , for he is a wonder of a horse , and has a reputation which is as shining as his own silken hide .
chapter iv  <name> to her aunt <name> oh , it is wonderful here , aunty dear , just paradise !
oh , if you could only see it !
everything so wild and lovely ; such grand plains , stretching such miles and miles and miles , all the most delicious velvety sand and sage-brush , and rabbits as big as a dog , and such tall and <name> <unk> ears that that is what they name them by ; and such vast mountains , and so rugged and <unk> and lofty , with <unk> wrapped around their shoulders , and looking so solemn and awful and satisfied ; and the charming indians , oh , how you would <unk> on them , aunty dear , and they would on you , too , and they would let you hold their babies , the way they do me , and they are the <unk> , and <unk> , and sweetest little things , and never cry , and would n't if they had pins sticking in them , which they have n't , because they are poor and ca n't afford it ; and the horses and mules and cattle and dogs  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds , and not an animal that you ca n't do what you please with , except uncle <name> , but i do n't mind him , he's lovely ; and oh , if you could hear the bugles : too  too  <unk>  too  too , and so on  perfectly beautiful !
do you recognize that one ?
it 's the first <unk> of the <unk> ; it goes , dear me , so early in the morning !  then i and every other soldier on the whole place are up and out in a minute , except uncle <name> , who is most unaccountably lazy , i do n't know why , but i have talked to him about it , and i reckon it <name> be better , now .
he has n't any faults much , and is charming and sweet , like buffalo <name> , and <unk> , and mammy <name> , and soldier boy , and shekels , and potter , and <unk> , and  well , they 're all that , just angels , as you may say .
the very first day i came , i do n't know how long ago it was , buffalo <name> took me on soldier boy to <unk> 's camp , not the big one which is out on the plain , which is white cloud 's , he took me to that one next day , but this one is four or five miles up in the hills and crags , where there is a great <unk> meadow , full of indian lodges and dogs and squaws and everything that is interesting , and a <name> of the clearest water running through it , with white pebbles on the bottom and trees all along the banks cool and shady and good to <name> in , and as the sun goes down it is <unk> in there , but away up against the sky you see the big peaks towering up and shining bright and vivid in the sun , and sometimes an eagle sailing by them , not flapping a wing , the same as if he was asleep ; and young indians and girls romping and laughing and carrying on , around the spring and the pool , and not much clothes on except the girls , and dogs fighting , and the squaws busy at work , and the bucks busy resting , and the old men sitting in a bunch smoking , and passing the pipe not to the left but to the right , which means there 's been a row in the camp and they are settling it if they can , and children playing just the same as any other children , and little boys shooting at a <name> with bows , and i cuffed one of them because he hit a dog with a club that wasn't doing anything , and he resented it but before long he wished he had n't : but this sentence is getting too long and i <name> start another .
<unk> put on his <unk> war outfit to let me see him , and he was splendid to look at , with his face painted red and bright and intense like a <unk> and a <unk> of eagle feathers from the top of his head all down his back , and he had his tomahawk , too , and his pipe , which has a stem which is longer than my arm , and i never had such a good time in an indian camp in my life , and i learned a lot of words of the language , and next day bb took me to the camp out on the plains , four miles , and i had another good time and got acquainted with some more indians and dogs ; and the big chief , by the name of white cloud , gave me a pretty little bow and arrows and i gave him my red <unk> , and in four days i could shoot very well with it and beat any white boy of my size at the post ; and i have been to those camps plenty of times since ; and i have learned to ride , too , bb taught me , and every day he <unk> me and praises me , and every time i do better than ever he lets me have a scamper on soldier boy , and that 's the last agony of pleasure !
for he is the <unk> horse , and so beautiful and shiny and black , and has n't another color on him anywhere , except a white <name> in his forehead , not just an imitation <name> , but a real one , with four points , shaped exactly like a <name> that 's <unk> , and if you should cover him all up but his <name> you would know him anywhere , even in jerusalem or australia , by that .
and i got acquainted with a good many of the seventh cavalry , and the dragoons , and officers , and families , and horses , in the first few days , and some more in the next few and the next few and the next few , and now i know more soldiers and horses than you can think , no matter how hard you try .
i am keeping up my studies every now and then , but there is n't much time for it .
i love you so !
and i send you a hug and a kiss .
<name> .
<unk>  i belong to the seventh cavalry and ninth dragoons , i am an officer , too , and do not have to work on account of not getting any wages .
chapter v  general <name> to <name> she has been with us a good nice long time , now .
you are troubled about your sprite because this is such a wild frontier , hundreds of miles from civilization , and peopled only by wandering tribes of savages ?
you fear for her safety ?
give yourself no uneasiness about her .
dear me , she 's in a nursery !
and she 's got more than eighteen hundred nurses .
it would distress the garrison to suspect that you think they ca n't take care of her .
they think they can .
they would tell you so themselves .
you see , the seventh cavalry has never had a child of its very own before , and neither has the ninth dragoons ; and so they are like all new mothers , they think there is no other child like theirs , no other child so wonderful , none that is so worthy to be faithfully and tenderly looked after and protected .
these bronzed veterans of mine are very good mothers , i think , and wiser than some other mothers ; for they let her take lots of risks , and it is a good education for her ; and the more risks she takes and comes successfully out of , the prouder they are of her .
they adopted her , with grave and formal military ceremonies of their own invention  solemnities is the truer word ; solemnities that were so profoundly solemn and <name> , that the spectacle would have been comical if it had n't been so touching .
it was a good show , and as stately and complex as <unk> and the trooping of the colors ; and it had its own special music , composed for the occasion by the bandmaster of the seventh ; and the child was as serious as the most serious <unk> soldier of them all ; and finally when they throned her upon the shoulder of the oldest veteran , and pronounced her " well and truly adopted , " and the bands struck up and all saluted and she saluted in return , it was better and more moving than any kindred thing i have seen on the stage , because stage things are make-believe , but this was real and the players ' hearts were in it .
it happened several weeks ago , and was followed by some additional solemnities .
the men created a couple of new ranks , <unk> unknown to the army regulations , and conferred them upon <name> , with ceremonies suitable to a duke .
so now she is <unk> of the seventh cavalry , and <unk> of the ninth dragoons , with the privilege ( decreed by the men ) of writing <unk> after her name !
also , they presented her a pair of <unk>  both dark blue , the one with f. l. on it , the other with c. g. also , a sword .
she wears them .
finally , they granted her the salute .
i am witness that that ceremony is faithfully observed by both parties  and most gravely and <unk> , too .
i have never seen a soldier smile yet , while delivering it , nor <name> in returning it .
ostensibly i was not present at these proceedings , and am ignorant of them ; but i was where i could see .
i was afraid of one thing  the jealousy of the other children of the post ; but there is nothing of that , i am glad to say .
on the contrary , they are proud of their comrade and her honors .
it is a surprising thing , but it is true .
the children are devoted to <name> , for she has turned their dull frontier life into a sort of continuous festival ; also they know her for a stanch and steady friend , a friend who can always be depended upon , and does not change with the weather .
she has become a rather extraordinary rider , under the <unk> of a more than extraordinary teacher  bb , which is her pet name for buffalo <name> .
she <unk> it <unk> .
he has not only taught her seventeen ways of breaking her neck , but twenty-two ways of avoiding it .
he has infused into her the best and surest protection of a horseman  confidence .
he did it gradually , systematically , little by little , a step at a time , and each step made sure before the next was essayed .
and so he <unk> her along up through terrors that had been <unk> by training before she reached them , and therefore were not recognizable as terrors when she got to them .
well , she is a daring little rider , now , and is perfect in what she knows of horsemanship .
by-and-by she <name> know the <name> like a west point cadet , and <name> exercise it as fearlessly .
she does n't know anything about <unk> .
does that distress you ?
and she is a fine performer , without any saddle at all .
does that discomfort you ?
do not let it ; she is not in any danger , i give you my word .
you said that if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it , and you said truly .
i do not know how i got along without her , before .
i was a forlorn old tree , but now that this <unk> vine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life , it is very different .
as a <unk> of business for me and for mammy <name> she is <unk> competent , but i like my share of it and of course <name> likes hers , for <name> " raised " <name> , and <name> is <name> over again in so many ways that she brings back <name> 's youth and the joys of that <unk> time .
my father tried to set <name> free twenty years ago , when we still lived in <name> , but without success ; she considered herself a member of the family , and would n't go .
and so , a member of the family she remained , and has held that position unchallenged ever since , and holds it now ; for when my mother sent her here from san <unk> when we learned that <name> was coming , she only changed from one division of the family to the other .
she has the warm heart of her race , and its lavish affections , and when <name> arrived the pair were mother and child in five minutes , and that is what they are to date and <name> continue .
<name> really thinks she raised <name> , and that is one of her <unk> , but perhaps it was a mutual raising , for their ages were the same  thirteen years short of mine .
but they were playmates , at any rate ; as regards that , there is no room for dispute .
<name> thinks <name> is the best catholic in <name> except herself .
she could not pay any one a higher compliment than that , and <name> could not receive one that would please her better .
<name> is satisfied that there has never been a more wonderful child than <name> .
she has conceived the curious idea that <name> is twins , and that one of them is a <unk> and failed to get <unk>  got submerged , is the idea .
to argue with her that this is nonsense is a waste of breath  her mind is made up , and arguments do not affect it .
she says : " look at her ; she loves dolls , and <unk> , and everything a girl loves , and she 's gentle and sweet , and ai n't cruel to dumb brutes  now that 's the <unk> , but she loves <unk> , and drums and fifes and soldiering , and <unk> , and ai n't afraid of anybody or anything  and that 's the <unk> ; 'deed you <unk> tell me she 's only one child ; no , sir , she 's twins , and one of them got shet up out of sight .
out of sight , but that do n't make any difference , that boy is in there , and you can see him look out of her eyes when her temper is up . "
then <name> went on , in her simple and <name> way , to furnish illustrations .
" look at that <name> , marse <name> .
would anybody befriend a <name> but that child ?
of course they would n't ; it ai n't natural .
well , the injun boy had the <name> tied up , and was all the time <unk> it and starving it , and she pitied the po ' thing , and tried to buy it from the boy , and the tears was in her eyes .
that was the girl twin , you see .
she offered him her thimble , and he flung it down ; she offered him all the doughnuts she had , which was two , and he flung them down ; she offered him half a paper of pins , worth forty ravens , and he made a mouth at her and <unk> one of them in the <name> 's back .
that was the limit , you know .
it called for the other twin .
her eyes blazed up , and she jumped for him like a <unk> , and when she was done with him she was rags and he wasn't anything but an allegory .
that was most undoubtedly the other twin , you see , coming to the front .
no , sir ; do n't tell me he ai n't in there .
i 've seen him with my own eyes  and plenty of times , at that . "
" allegory ?
what is an allegory ? "
" i do n't know , marse <name> , it 's one of her words ; she loves the big ones , you know , and i pick them up from her ; they sound good and i ca n't help it . "
" what happened after she had converted the boy into an allegory ? "
" why , she untied the <name> and confiscated him by force and fetched him home , and left the doughnuts and things on the ground .
petted him , of course , like she does with every creature .
in two days she had him so stuck after her that she  well , you know how he follows her everywhere , and sets on her shoulder often when she rides her breakneck <unk>  all of which is the <unk> to the front , you see  and he does what he pleases , and is up to all kinds of <unk> , and is a perfect nuisance in the kitchen .
well , they all stand it , but they would n't if it was another person 's bird . "
here she began to chuckle comfortably , and presently she said : " well , you know , she 's a nuisance herself , miss <name> is , she is so busy , and into everything , like that bird .
it 's all just as innocent , you know , and she do n't mean any harm , and is so good and dear ; and it ai n't her fault , it 's her nature ; her interest is always <unk> and always red-hot , and she ca n't keep quiet .
well , yesterday it was 'please , miss <name> , do n't do that ' ; and , 'please , miss <name> , let that alone ' ; and , 'please , miss <name> , do n't make so much noise ' ; and so on and so on , till i reckon i had found fault fourteen times in fifteen minutes ; then she looked up at me with her big brown eyes that can plead so , and said in that odd little foreign way that goes to your heart , " 'please , mammy , make me a compliment . "
" and of course you did it , you old fool ? "
" marse <name> , i just grabbed her up to my breast and says , 'oh , you po ' dear little <unk> thing , you ai n't got a fault in the world , and you can do anything you want to , and tear the house down , and yo ' old black mammy wo n't say a word ! ' "
" why , of course , of course  i knew you 'd spoil the child . "
she brushed away her tears , and said with dignity : " spoil the child ?
spoil that child , marse <name> ?
there ca n't anybody spoil her .
she 's the king <name> of this post , and everybody pets her and is her slave , and yet , as you know , your own self , she ain't the least little bit spoiled . "
then she eased her mind with this retort : " marse <name> , she makes you do anything she wants to , and you ca n't deny it ; so if she could be spoilt , she 'd been spoilt long ago , because you are the very worst !
look at that pile of cats in your chair , and you sitting on a <unk> , just as patient ; it 's because they 're her cats . "
if <name> were a soldier , i could punish her for such large frankness as that .
i changed the subject , and made her resume her illustrations .
she had scored against me fairly , and i wasn't going to <unk> her victory by disputing it .
she proceeded to offer this incident in evidence on her twin theory : " two weeks ago when she got her finger mashed open , she turned pretty pale with the pain , but she never said a word .
i took her in my lap , and the surgeon <unk> off the blood and took a needle and thread and began to sew it up ; it had to have a lot of <unk> , and each one made her <unk> a little , but she never let go a sound .
at last the surgeon was so full of admiration that he said , 'well , you are a brave little thing ! '
and she said , just as ca 'm and simple as if she was talking about the weather , 'there is n't anybody braver but the cid ! '
you see ?
it was the <unk> that the surgeon was <unk> with .
" who is the cid ? "
" i do n't know , sir  at least only what she says .
she 's always talking about him , and says he was the bravest hero spain ever had , or any other country .
they have it up and down , the children do , she standing up for the cid , and they working <name> washington for all he is worth . "
" do they quarrel ? "
" no ; it 's only disputing , and bragging , the way children do .
they want her to be an american , but she ca n't be anything but a spaniard , she says .
you see , her mother was always longing for home , po ' thing !
and thinking about it , and so the child is just as much a spaniard as if she 'd always lived there .
she thinks she remembers how spain looked , but i reckon she do n't , because she was only a baby when they moved to <name> .
she is very proud to be a spaniard . "
does that please you , <name> ?
very well , be content ; your niece is loyal to her allegiance : her mother laid deep the foundations of her love for spain , and she <name> go back to you as good a spaniard as you are yourself .
she has made me promise to take her to you for a long visit when the war office retires me .
i attend to her studies myself ; has she told you that ?
yes , i am her <unk> , and she makes pretty good progress , i think , everything considered .
everything considered  being translated  means holidays .
but the fact is , she was not born for study , and it comes hard .
hard for me , too ; it hurts me like a physical pain to see that free spirit of the air and the <name> laboring and grieving over a book ; and sometimes when i find her gazing far away towards the plain and the blue mountains with the longing in her eyes , i have to throw open the prison doors ; i ca n't help it .
a quaint little scholar she is , and makes plenty of blunders .
once i put the question : " what does the czar govern ? "
she rested her elbow on her knee and her <name> on her hand and took that problem under deep consideration .
presently she looked up and answered , with a rising inflection implying a shade of uncertainty , " the <unk> case ? "
here are a couple of her <unk> which were delivered with tranquil confidence : " chaplain , diminutive of chap .
lass is masculine , <unk> is feminine . "
she is not a genius , you see , but just a normal child ; they all make mistakes of that sort .
there is a glad light in her eye which is pretty to see when she finds herself able to answer a question promptly and accurately , without any hesitation ; as , for instance , this morning : " <name> dear , what is a cube ? "
" why , a native of cuba . "
she still drops a foreign word into her talk now and then , and there is still a subtle foreign flavor or fragrance about even her <unk> english  and long may this abide !
for it has for me a charm that is very pleasant .
sometimes her english is daintily prim and <unk> and <unk> .
she has a child 's sweet tooth , but for her health 's sake i try to keep its inspirations under cheek .
she is obedient  as is proper for a titled and recognized military personage , which she is  but the chain presses sometimes .
for instance , we were out for a walk , and passed by some bushes that were freighted with wild <unk> .
her face brightened and she put her hands together and delivered herself of this speech , most feelingly : " oh , if i was permitted a vice it would be the <unk> ! "
could i resist that ?
no .
i gave her a gooseberry .
you ask about her languages .
they take care of themselves ; they <name> not get <name> here ; our regiments are not made up of natives alone  far from it .
and she is picking up indian tongues diligently .
chapter <name>  soldier boy and the mexican plug " when did you come ? "
" arrived at sundown . "
" where from ? "
" salt lake . "
" are you in the service ? "
" no .
trade . "
" pirate trade , i reckon . "
" what do you know about it ? "
" i saw you when you came .
i recognized your master .
he is a bad sort .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>  <name> <unk> i know him very well .
stole you , did n't he ? "
" well , it amounted to that . "
" i thought so .
where is his pard ? "
" he stopped at white cloud 's camp . "
" he is another of the same stripe , is <name> <unk> . "
( aside . )
they are laying for buffalo <name> again , i guess .
( aloud . )
" what is your name ? "
" which one ? "
" have you got more than one ? "
" i get a new one every time i 'm stolen .
i used to have an honest name , but that was early ; i 've forgotten it .
since then i 've had thirteen <unk> . "
" <unk> ?
what is alias ? "
" a false name . "
" alias .
it 's a fine large word , and is in my line ; it has quite a learned and <unk> incandescent sound .
are you educated ? "
" well , no , i ca n't claim it .
i can take down bars , i can distinguish oats from <unk> , i can <unk> a <unk> with the <unk> , and i know a few other things  not many ; i have had no chance , i have always had to work ; besides , i am of low birth and no family .
you speak my dialect like a native , but you are not a mexican plug , you are a gentleman , i can see that ; and educated , of course . "
" yes , i am of old family , and not illiterate .
i am a fossil . "
" a which ? "
" fossil .
the first horses were fossils .
they date back two million years . "
" <unk> sand and sage-brush !
do you mean it ? "
" yes , it is true .
the bones of my ancestors are held in reverence and worship , even by men .
they do not leave them exposed to the weather when they find them , but <name> them three thousand miles and <unk> them in their temples of learning , and worship them . "
" it is wonderful !
i knew you must be a person of distinction , by your fine presence and courtly address , and by the fact that you are not subjected to the indignity of <unk> , like myself and the rest .
would you tell me your name ? "
" you have probably heard of it  soldier boy . "
" what !  the renowned , the illustrious ? "
" even so . "
" it takes my breath !
little did i dream that ever i should stand face to face with the possessor of that great name .
buffalo <unk> horse !
known from the canadian border to the deserts of arizona , and from the eastern marches of the great plains to the <unk> of the <name> !
truly this is a memorable day .
you still serve the celebrated chief of scouts ? "
" i am still his property , but he has lent me , for a time , to the most <name> , the most gracious , the most excellent , her excellency <name> , <unk> seventh cavalry and <unk> ninth dragoons , <unk> ,  on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
did you say her excellency ? "
" the same .
a spanish <name> , sweet <name> of a ducal house .
and truly a wonder ; knowing everything , capable of everything ; speaking all the languages , master of all sciences , a mind without horizons , a heart of gold , the <name> of her race !
on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
it is marvellous ! "
" verily .
i knew many things , she has taught me others .
i am educated .
i <name> tell you about her . "
" i listen  i am enchanted . "
" i <name> tell a plain tale , calmly , without excitement , without eloquence .
when she had been here four or five weeks she was already <unk> in military things , and they made her an officer  a double officer .
she rode the drill every day , like any soldier ; and she could take the bugle and direct the evolutions herself .
then , on a day , there was a grand race , for prizes  none to enter but the children .
seventeen children entered , and she was the youngest .
three girls , fourteen boys  good riders all .
it was a <unk> , with four <unk> , all pretty high .
the first prize was a most cunning half-grown silver bugle , and mighty pretty , with red silk cord and tassels .
buffalo <name> was very anxious ; for he had taught her to ride , and he did most dearly want her to win that race , for the <name> of it .
so he wanted her to ride me , but she would n't ; and she reproached him , and said it was unfair and <unk> , and taking advantage ; for what horse in this post or any other could stand a chance against me ?
and she was very severe with him , and said , 'you ought to be ashamed  you are proposing to me conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman . '
so he just tossed her up in the air about thirty feet and caught her as she came down , and said he was ashamed ; and put up his handkerchief and pretended to cry , which nearly broke her heart , and she petted him , and begged him to forgive her , and said she would do anything in the world he could ask but that ; but he said he ought to go <name> himself , and he must , if he could get a rope ; it was nothing but right he should , for he never , never could forgive himself ; and then she began to cry , and they both sobbed , the way you could hear him a mile , and she clinging around his neck and pleading , till at last he was comforted a little , and gave his solemn promise he would n't <name> himself till after the race ; and would n't do it at all if she won it , which made her happy , and she said she would win it or die in the saddle ; so then everything was pleasant again and both of them content .
he ca n't help playing jokes on her , he is so fond of her and she is so innocent and unsuspecting ; and when she finds it out she cuffs him and is in a fury , but presently <unk> him because it 's him ; and maybe the very next day she 's caught with another joke ; you see she ca n't learn any better , because she has n't any deceit in her , and that kind are n't ever expecting it in another person .
" it was a grand race .
the whole post was there , and there was such another whooping and shouting when the seventeen kids came flying down the turf and sailing over the <unk>  oh , beautiful to see !
half-way down , it was kind of neck and neck , and anybody 's race and nobody 's .
then , what should happen but a cow steps out and puts her head down to <unk> grass , with her broadside to the battalion , and they a-coming like the wind ; they split apart to flank her , but she ?  why , she drove the spurs home and soared over that cow like a bird !
and on she went , and cleared the last <unk> solitary and alone , the army letting loose the grand yell , and she skipped from the horse the same as if he had been standing still , and made her bow , and everybody crowded around to congratulate , and they gave her the bugle , and she put it to her lips and blew <unk> and saddles ' to see how it would go , and bb was as proud as you can't think !
and he said , 'take soldier boy , and do n't pass him back till i ask for him ! '
and i can tell you he would n't have said that to any other person on this planet .
that was two months and more ago , and nobody has been on my back since but the <unk> seventh cavalry and <unk> of the ninth dragoons , <unk> ,  on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
i listen  tell me more . "
" she set to work and organized the sixteen , and called it the first battalion <name> mountain rangers , <unk> , and she wanted to be bugler , but they elected her lieutenant-general and bugler .
so she ranks her uncle the commandant , who is only a brigadier .
and does n't she train those little people !
ask the indians , ask the traders , ask the soldiers ; they 'll tell you .
she has been at it from the first day .
every morning they go clattering down into the plain , and there she sits on my back with her bugle at her mouth and sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions for an hour or more ; and it is too beautiful for anything to see those ponies dissolve from one formation into another , and waltz about , and break , and scatter , and form again , always moving , always graceful , now trotting , now galloping , and so on , sometimes near by , sometimes in the distance , all just like a state ball , you know , and sometimes she ca n't hold herself any longer , but sounds the <unk> , ' and turns me loose !
and you can take my word for it , if the battalion has n't too much of a start we catch up and go over the <unk> with the front line .
" yes , they are soldiers , those little people ; and healthy , too , not <unk> any more , the way they used to be sometimes .
it 's because of her drill .
she 's got a fort , now  fort <name> marsh .
<name> general <name> drake planned it out , and the seventh and dragoons built it .
<name> is the colonel 's son , and is fifteen and the oldest in the battalion ; <name> marsh is <unk> , and is next oldest  over thirteen .
she is daughter of captain marsh , company b , seventh cavalry .
lieutenant-general <name> is the youngest by considerable ; i think she is about nine and a half or three-quarters .
her military rig , as lieutenant-general , is n't for business , it 's for dress parade , because the ladies made it .
they say they got it out of the middle ages  out of a book  and it is all red and blue and white silks and <unk> and <unk> ; tights , trunks , sword , doublet with slashed sleeves , short cape , cap with just one feather in it ; i 've heard them name these things ; they got them out of the book ; she 's dressed like a <name> , of old times , they say .
it 's the daintiest outfit that ever was  you <name> say so , when you see it .
she 's lovely in it  oh , just a dream !
in some ways she is just her age , but in others she 's as old as her uncle , i think .
she is very learned .
she teaches her uncle his book .
i have seen her sitting by with the book and reciting to him what is in it , so that he can learn to do it himself .
" every saturday she <unk> little injuns to garrison her fort ; then she lays siege to it , and makes military approaches by make-believe trenches in make-believe night , and finally at make-believe <name> she draws her sword and sounds the assault and takes it by storm .
it is for practice .
and she has invented a <unk> all by herself , out of her own head , and it 's a stirring one , and the prettiest in the service .
it 's to call me  it 's never used for anything else .
she taught it to me , and told me what it says : 'it is i , soldier  come ! '
and when those thrilling notes come floating down the distance i hear them without fail , even if i am two miles away ; and then  oh , then you should see my heels get down to business !
" and she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night to her , which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake ; and also how to say good-bye ; i do that with my left foot  but only for practice , because there has n't been any but make-believe good <unk> yet , and i <name> there wo n't ever be .
it would make me cry if i ever had to put up my left foot in <name> .
she has taught me how to salute , and i can do it as well as a soldier .
i bow my head low , and lay my right hoof against my cheek .
she taught me that because i got into disgrace once , through ignorance .
i am privileged , because i am known to be honorable and trustworthy , and because i have a distinguished record in the service ; so they don't hobble me nor tie me to stakes or shut me tight in stables , but let me wander around to suit myself .
well , trooping the colors is a very solemn ceremony , and everybody must stand uncovered when the flag goes by , the commandant and all ; and once i was there , and <unk> walked across right in front of the band , which was an awful disgrace : ah , the lieutenant-general was so ashamed , and so distressed that i should have done such a thing before all the world , that she could n't keep the tears back ; and then she taught me the salute , so that if i ever did any other <unk> act through ignorance i could do my salute and she believed everybody would think it was apology enough and would not press the matter .
it is very nice and distinguished ; no other horse can do it ; often the men salute me , and i return it .
i am privileged to be present when the <name> mountain rangers troop the colors and i stand solemn , like the children , and i salute when the flag goes by .
of course when she goes to her fort her sentries sing out <unk> out the guard ! '
and then .
.
.
do you catch that refreshing early morning whiff from the <unk> and the wild flowers ?
the night is far spent ; we 'll hear the bugles before long .
<name> , the black woman , is very good and nice ; she takes care of the lieutenant-general , and is <unk> <name> 's mother , which makes her mother-in-law to the lieutenant-general .
that is what shekels says .
at least it is what i think he says , though i never can understand him quite clearly .
he  " " who is shekels ? "
" the seventh cavalry dog .
i mean , if he is a dog .
his father was a <unk> and his mother was a <unk> .
it does n't really make a dog out of him , does it ? "
" not a real dog , i should think .
only a kind of a general dog , at most , i reckon .
though this is a matter of <unk> , i suppose ; and if it is , it is out of my depth , and so my opinion is not valuable , and i do n't claim much consideration for it . "
" it is n't <unk> ; it is <unk> , which is still more difficult and tangled up .
<unk> always are . "
" <unk> is quite beyond me , quite ; so i am not competing .
but on general principles it is my opinion that a colt out of a <unk> and a <unk> is no square dog , but doubtful .
that is my hand , and i stand <name> . "
" well , it is as far as i can go myself , and be fair and conscientious .
i have always regarded him as a doubtful dog , and so has potter .
potter is the great <name> .
potter says he is no dog , and not even poultry  though i do not go quite so far as that .
" and i would n't , myself .
poultry is one of those things which no person can get to the bottom of , there is so much of it and such variety .
it is just wings , and wings , and wings , till you are weary : turkeys , and geese , and bats , and butterflies , and angels , and grasshoppers , and flying-fish , and  well , there is really no end to the tribe ; it gives me the heaves just to think of it .
but this one has n't any wings , has he ? "
" no . "
" well , then , in my belief he is more likely to be dog than poultry .
i have not heard of poultry that had n't wings .
wings is the sign of poultry ; it is what you tell poultry by .
look at the mosquito . "
" what do you reckon he is , then ?
he must be something . "
" why , he could be a reptile ; anything that has n't wings is a reptile . "
" who told you that ? "
" nobody told me , but i overheard it . "
" where did you overhear it ? "
" years ago .
i was with the philadelphia institute expedition in the bad lands under professor cope , hunting mastodon bones , and i overheard him say , his own self , that any <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that had n't wings and was uncertain was a reptile .
well , then , has this dog any wings ?
no .
is he a <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> ?
maybe so , maybe not ; but without ever having seen him , and judging only by his illegal and spectacular parentage , i <name> bet the odds of a bale of hay to a bran mash that he looks it .
finally , is he uncertain ?
that is the point  is he uncertain ?
i <name> leave it to you if you have ever heard of a more <unk> dog than what this one is ? "
" no , i never have . "
" well , then , he 's a reptile .
that 's settled . "
" why , look here , <unk> " " last alias , mongrel . "
" a good one , too .
i was going to say , you are better educated than you have been pretending to be .
i like cultured society , and i shall cultivate your acquaintance .
now as to shekels , whenever you want to know about any private thing that is going on at this post or in white cloud 's camp or <unk> 's , he can tell you ; and if you make friends with him he 'll be glad to , for he is a born gossip , and picks up all the <unk> .
being the whole seventh cavalry 's reptile , he does n't belong to anybody in particular , and has n't any military duties ; so he comes and goes as he pleases , and is popular with all the house cats and other authentic sources of private information .
he understands all the languages , and talks them all , too .
with an accent like <unk> your teeth , it is true , and with a grammar that is no improvement on blasphemy  still , with practice you get at the meat of what he says , and it serves .
.
.
hark !
that 's the <unk> .
.
.
.
[ the <unk> ] " faint and far , but is n't it clear , is n't it sweet ?
there 's no music like the bugle to stir the blood , in the still solemnity of the morning twilight , with the dim plain stretching away to nothing and the spectral mountains slumbering against the sky .
you 'll hear another note in a minute  faint and far and clear , like the other one , and sweeter still , you 'll notice .
wait .
.
.
listen .
there it goes !
it says , 'it is i , soldier  come ! '
.
.
.
[ soldier boy 's bugle call ] .
.
.
now then , watch me leave a blue streak behind ! "
chapter vii  soldier boy and shekels " did you do as i told you ?
did you look up the mexican plug ? "
" yes , i made his acquaintance before night and got his friendship . "
" i liked him .
did you ? "
" not at first .
he took me for a reptile , and it troubled me , because i did n't know whether it was a compliment or not .
i could n't ask him , because it would look ignorant .
so i did n't say anything , and soon liked him very well indeed .
was it a compliment , do you think ? "
" yes , that is what it was .
they are very rare , the reptiles ; very few left , <unk> . "
" is that so ?
what is a reptile ? "
" it is a <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that hasn't any wings and is uncertain . "
" well , it  it sounds fine , it surely does . "
" and it is fine .
you may be thankful you are one . "
" i am .
it seems wonderfully grand and elegant for a person that is so humble as i am ; but i am thankful , i am indeed , and <name> try to live up to it .
it is hard to remember .
<name> you say it again , please , and say it slow ? "
" <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that has n't any wings and is uncertain . "
" it is beautiful , anybody must <name> it ; beautiful , and of a <name> sound .
i <name> it <name> not make me proud and <unk>  i should not like to be that .
it is much more distinguished and honorable to be a reptile than a dog , do n't you think , soldier ? "
" why , there 's no comparison .
it is awfully aristocratic .
often a duke is called a reptile ; it is set down so , in history . "
" is n't that grand !
potter would n't ever associate with me , but i reckon he 'll be glad to when he finds out what i am . "
" you can depend upon it . "
" i <name> thank mongrel for this .
he is a very good sort , for a mexican plug .
do n't you think he is ? "
" it is my opinion of him ; and as for his birth , he can not help that .
we can not all be reptiles , we can not all be fossils ; we have to take what comes and be thankful it is no worse .
it is the true philosophy . "
" for those others ? "
" stick to the subject , please .
did it turn out that my suspicions were right ? "
" yes , perfectly right .
mongrel has heard them planning .
they are after bb 's life , for running them out of medicine bow and taking their stolen horses away from them . "
" well , they 'll get him yet , for sure . "
" not if he keeps a sharp look-out . "
" he keep a sharp lookout !
he never does ; he despises them , and all their kind .
his life is always being threatened , and so it has come to be monotonous . "
" does he know they are here ? "
" oh yes , he knows it .
he is always the earliest to know who comes and who goes .
but he cares nothing for them and their threats ; he only laughs when people warn him .
they 'll shoot him from behind a tree the first he knows .
did mongrel tell you their plans ? "
" yes .
they have found out that he starts for fort <name> day after to-morrow , with one of his scouts ; so they <name> leave to morrow , letting on to go south , but they <name> fetch around north all in good time . "
" shekels , i do n't like the look of it . "
chapter viii  the <unk> .
bb and lieutenant-general <name> bb ( saluting ) .
" good !
handsomely done !
the seventh could n't beat it !
you do certainly handle your rangers like an expert , general .
and where are you bound ? "
" four miles on the trail to fort <name> . "
" glad am i , dear !
what 's the idea of it ? "
" guard of honor for you and <unk> . "
" bless  your  heart !
i 'd rather have it from you than from the commander-in-chief of the armies of the united states , you incomparable little soldier !  and i do n't need to take any oath to that , for you to believe it . "
" i thought you 'd like it , bb . "
" like it ?
well , i should say so !
now then  all ready  sound the advance , and away we go ! "
chapter ix  soldier boy and shekels again " well , this is the way it happened .
we did the escort duty ; then we came back and struck for the plain and put the rangers through a rousing drill  oh , for hours !
then we sent them home under <unk> <name> marsh ; then the lieutenant-general and i went off on a gallop over the plains for about three hours , and were <unk> along home in the middle of the afternoon , when we met <name> slade , the drummer-boy , and he saluted and asked the lieutenant-general if she had heard the news , and she said no , and he said : " <unk> <name> has been ambushed and badly shot this side of <name> , and <unk> the scout , too ; <name> could n't travel , but <unk> could , and he brought the news , and sergeant wilkes and six men of company b are gone , two hours ago , <unk> , to get <name> .
and they say  ' " 'go ! '
she shouts to me  and i went . "
" fast ? "
" do n't ask foolish questions .
it was an awful pace .
for four hours nothing happened , and not a word said , except that now and then she said , 'keep it up , boy , keep it up , sweetheart ; we 'll save him ! '
i kept it up .
well , when the dark shut down , in the rugged hills , that poor little chap had been tearing around in the saddle all day , and i noticed by the slack <unk> that she was tired and <unk> , and i got dreadfully afraid ; but every time i tried to slow down and let her go to sleep , so i could stop , she hurried me up again ; and so , sure enough , at last over she went !
" ah , that was a fix to be in i for she lay there and did n't stir , and what was i to do ?
i could n't leave her to fetch help , on account of the wolves .
there was nothing to do but stand by .
it was dreadful .
i was afraid she was killed , poor little thing !
but she was n't .
she came to , by-and-by , and said , <unk> me , soldier , ' and those were blessed words .
i kissed her  often ; i am used to that , and we like it .
but she did n't get up , and i was worried .
she fondled my nose with her hand , and talked to me , and called me endearing names  which is her way  but she caressed with the same hand all the time .
the other arm was broken , you see , but i didn't know it , and she did n't mention it .
she did n't want to distress me , you know .
" soon the big gray wolves came , and <name> around , and you could hear them snarl , and snap at each other , but you could n't see anything of them except their eyes , which shone in the dark like sparks and stars .
the lieutenant-general said , 'if i had the <name> mountain rangers here , we would make those creatures climb a tree . '
then she made believe that the rangers were in hearing , and put up her bugle and blew the <unk> ' ; and then , <unk> and saddles ' ; then the <unk> ' ; <unk> ' ; <unk> ! '
then she blew the <unk> , ' and said , 'that 's for you , you rebels ; the rangers do n't ever retreat ! '
" the music frightened them away , but they were hungry , and kept coming back .
and of course they got bolder and bolder , which is their way .
it went on for an hour , then the tired child went to sleep , and it was pitiful to hear her moan and nestle , and i could n't do anything for her .
all the time i was laying for the wolves .
they are in my line ; i have had experience .
at last the boldest one ventured within my lines , and i landed him among his friends with some of his skull still on him , and they did the rest .
in the next hour i got a couple more , and they went the way of the first one , down the throats of the detachment .
that satisfied the survivors , and they went away and left us in peace .
" we had n't any more adventures , though i kept awake all night and was ready .
from midnight on the child got very restless , and out of her head , and moaned , and said , <unk> , water  thirsty ' ; and now and then , <unk> me , soldier ' ; and sometimes she was in her fort and giving orders to her garrison ; and once she was in spain , and thought her mother was with her .
people say a horse ca n't cry ; but they do n't know , because we cry inside .
" it was an hour after <unk> that i heard the boys coming , and recognized the <unk> of pomp and caesar and <name> , old mates of mine ; and a <unk> sound there could n't ever be .
buffalo <name> was in a <unk> , with his leg broken by a bullet , and mongrel and <name> <unk> 's horse were doing the work .
buffalo <name> and <unk> had lolled both of those <unk> .
" when they got to us , and buffalo <name> saw the child lying there so white , he said , 'my god ! '
and the sound of his voice brought her to herself , and she gave a little cry of pleasure and struggled to get up , but could n't , and the soldiers gathered her up like the tenderest women , and their eyes were wet and they were not ashamed , when they saw her arm dangling ; and so were buffalo <name> 's , and when they laid her in his arms he said , 'my darling , how does this come ? '
and she said , 'we came to save you , but i was tired , and could n't keep awake , and fell off and hurt myself , and could n't get on again . '
'you came to save me , you dear little rat ?
it was too lovely of you ! '
'yes , and soldier stood by me , which you know he would , and protected me from the wolves ; and if he got a chance he kicked the life out of some of them  for you know he would , bb . '
the sergeant said , 'he laid out three of them , sir , and here 's the bones to show for it . '
'he 's a grand horse , ' said bb ; 'he 's the grandest horse that ever was !
and has saved your life , lieutenant general <name> , and shall protect it the rest of his life  he's yours for a kiss ! '
he got it , along with a passion of delight , and he said , 'you are feeling better now , little spaniard  do you think you could blow the advance ? '
she put up the bugle to do it , but he said wait a minute first .
then he and the sergeant set her arm and put it in <unk> , she <unk> but not whimpering ; then we took up the march for home , and that 's the end of the tale ; and i 'm her horse .
is n't she a brick , shekels ?
" brick ?
she 's more than a brick , more than a thousand bricks  she 's a reptile ! "
" it 's a compliment out of your heart , shekels .
god bless you for it ! "
chapter x  general <name> and <name> " too much company for her , marse <name> .
betwixt you , and shekels , the colonel 's wife , and the cid  " " the cid ?
oh , i remember  the <name> . "
"  and mrs. captain marsh and famine and pestilence the baby <unk> , and <unk> and her <unk> , and <unk> and her kittens  <name> these names she gives the creatures , they warp my jaw  and potter : you  all sitting around in the house , and soldier boy at the window the entire time , it 's a wonder to me she comes along as well as she does .
she  " " you want her all to yourself , you stingy old thing ! "
" marse <name> , you know better .
it 's too much company .
and then the idea of her receiving reports all the time from her officers , and acting upon them , and giving orders , the same as if she was well !
it ai n't good for her , and the surgeon do n't like it , and tried to persuade her not to and could n't ; and when he ordered her , she was that outraged and indignant , and was very severe on him , and accused him of insubordination , and said it did n't become him to give orders to an officer of her rank .
well , he saw he had excited her more and done more harm than all the rest put together , so he was vexed at himself and wished he had kept still .
doctors don't know much , and that 's a fact .
she 's too much interested in things she ought to rest more .
she 's all the time sending messages to bb , and to soldiers and injuns and <unk> , and to the animals . "
" to the animals ? "
" yes , sir . "
" who carries them ? "
" sometimes potter , but mostly it 's shekels . "
" now come !
who can find fault with such pretty make-believe as that ? "
" but it ai n't make-believe , marse <name> .
she does send them . "
" yes , i do n't doubt that part of it . "
" do you doubt they get them , sir ? "
" certainly .
do n't you ? "
" no , sir .
animals talk to one another .
i know it perfectly well , marse <name> , and i ai n't saying it by guess . "
" what a curious superstition ! "
" it ai n't a superstition , marse <name> .
look at that shekels  look at him , now .
is he listening , or ai n't he ?
now you see !
he 's turned his head away .
it 's because he was caught  caught in the act .
i 'll ask you  could a <name> look any more ashamed than what he looks now ?  lay down !
you see ?
he was going to sneak out .
don't tell me , marse <name> !
if animals do n't talk , i miss my guess .
and shekels is the worst .
he goes and tells the animals everything that happens in the officers ' quarters ; and if he 's short of facts , he <unk> them .
he has n't any more principle than a blue <name> ; and as for morals , he 's empty .
look at him now ; look at him <unk> .
he knows what i am saying , and he knows it 's the truth .
you see , yourself , that he can feel shame ; it 's the only virtue he 's got .
it 's wonderful how they find out everything that 's going on  the animals .
they  " " do you really believe they do , <name> ? "
" i do n't only just believe it , marse <name> , i know it .
day before yesterday they knew something was going to happen .
they were that excited , and whispering around together ; why , anybody could see that they  but my !
i must get back to her , and i have n't got to my errand yet . "
" what is it , <name> ? "
" well , it 's two or three things .
one is , the doctor do n't salute when he comes .
.
.
now , marse <name> , it ai n't anything to laugh at , and so  " " well , then , forgive me ; i did n't mean to laugh  i got caught unprepared . "
" you see , she do n't want to hurt the doctor 's feelings , so she do n't say anything to him about it ; but she is always polite , herself , and it hurts that kind for people to be rude to them . "
" i 'll have that doctor hanged . "
" marse <name> , she do n't want him hanged .
she  " " well , then , i 'll have him boiled in oil . "
" but she do n't want him boiled .
i  " " oh , very well , very well , i only want to please her ; i 'll have him skinned . "
" why , she do n't want him skinned ; it would break her heart .
now  " " woman , this is perfectly unreasonable .
what in the nation does she want ? "
" marse <name> , if you would only be a little patient , and not fly off the handle at the least little thing .
why , she only wants you to speak to him . "
" speak to him !
well , upon my word !
all this unseemly rage and row about such a  a  <name> , i never saw you <name> on like this before .
you have alarmed the sentry ; he thinks i am being assassinated ; he thinks there 's a mutiny , a revolt , an insurrection ; he  " " marse <name> , you are just putting on ; you know it perfectly well ; i do n't know what makes you act like that  but you always did , even when you was little , and you ca n't get over it , i reckon .
are you over it now , marse <name> ? "
" oh , well , yes ; but it would try anybody to be doing the best he could , offering every kindness he could think of , only to have it rejected with <unk> and .
.
.
oh , well , let it go ; it 's no matter  i 'll talk to the doctor .
is that satisfactory , or are you going to break out again ? "
" yes , sir , it is ; and it 's only right to talk to him , too , because it 's just as she says ; she 's trying to keep up discipline in the rangers , and this insubordination of his is a bad example for them now ai n't it so , marse <name> ? "
" well , there is reason in it , i ca n't deny it ; so i <name> speak to him , though at bottom i think hanging would be more lasting .
what is the rest of your errand , <name> ? "
" of course her room is ranger headquarters now , marse <name> , while she 's sick .
well , soldiers of the cavalry and the dragoons that are off duty come and get her sentries to let them relieve them and serve in their place .
it 's only out of affection , sir , and because they know military honors please her , and please the children too , for her sake ; and they do n't bring their muskets ; and so  " " i 've noticed them there , but did n't twig the idea .
they are standing guard , are they ? "
" yes , sir , and she is afraid you <name> <unk> them and hurt their feelings , if you see them there ; so she begs , if  if you do n't mind coming in the back way  " " bear me up , <name> ; do n't let me faint . "
" there  sit up and behave , marse <name> .
you are not going to faint ; you are only pretending  you used to act just so when you was little ; it does seem a long time for you to get grown up . "
" <name> , the way the child is progressing , i shall be out of my job before long  she 'll have the whole post in her hands .
i must make a stand , i must not go down without a struggle .
these encroachments .
.
.
.
<name> , what do you think she <name> think of next ? "
" marse <name> , she do n't mean any harm . "
" are you sure of it ? "
" yes , marse <name> . "
" you feel sure she has no ulterior designs ? "
" i do n't know what that is , marse <name> , but i know she has n't . "
" very well , then , for the present i am satisfied .
what else have you come about ? "
" i reckon i better tell you the whole thing first , marse <name> , then tell you what she wants .
there 's been an <unk> , as she calls it .
it was before she got back with bb .
the officer of the day reported it to her this morning .
it happened at her fort .
there was a fuss betwixt <unk> <name> drake and lieutenant-colonel <name> <unk> , and he snatched her doll away , which is made of white kid stuffed with sawdust , and tore every rag of its clothes off , right before them all , and is under arrest , and the charge is conduct <name>  " " yes , i know  conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman  a plain case , too , it seems to me .
this is a serious matter .
well , what is her pleasure ? "
" well , marse <name> , she has summoned a court-martial , but the doctor do n't think she is well enough to preside over it , and she says there ai n't anybody competent but her , because there 's a <name> general concerned ; and so she  she  well , she says , would you preside over it for her ?
.
.
.
marse <name> , sit up !
you ai n't any more going to faint than shekels is . "
" look here , <name> , go along back , and be <unk> .
be persuasive ; do n't fret her ; tell her it 's all right , the matter is in my hands , but it is n't good form to hurry so grave a matter as this .
explain to her that we have to go by precedents , and that i believe this one to be new .
in fact , you can say i know that nothing just like it has happened in our army , therefore i must be guided by european precedents , and must go cautiously and examine them carefully .
tell her not to be impatient , it <name> take me several days , but it <name> all come out right , and i <name> come over and report progress as i go along .
do you get the idea , <name> ? "
" i do n't know as i do , sir . "
" well , it 's this .
you see , it wo n't ever do for me , a brigadier in the regular army , to preside over that infant court-martial  there is n't any precedent for it , do n't you see .
very well .
i <name> go on examining authorities and reporting progress until she is well enough to get me out of this scrape by presiding herself .
do you get it now ? "
" oh , yes , sir , i get it , and it 's good , i 'll go and fix it with her .
lay down !
and stay where you are . "
" why , what harm is he doing ? "
" oh , it ai n't any harm , but it just <unk> me to see him act so . "
" what was he doing ? "
" ca n't you see , and him in such a sweat ?
he was starting out to spread it all over the post .
now i reckon you wo n't deny , any more , that they go and tell everything they hear , now that you've seen it with yo ' own eyes . "
" well , i do n't like to acknowledge it , <name> , but i do n't see how i can consistently stick to my doubts in the face of such overwhelming proof as this dog is furnishing . "
" there , now , you 've got in yo ' right mind at last !
i wonder you can be so stubborn , marse <name> .
but you always was , even when you was little .
i 'm going now . "
" look here ; tell her that in view of the delay , it is my judgment that she ought to enlarge the accused on his parole . "
" yes , sir , i 'll tell her .
marse <name> ? "
" well ? "
" she ca n't get to soldier boy , and he stands there all the time , down in the mouth and lonesome ; and she says <name> you shake hands with him and comfort him ?
everybody does . "
" it 's a curious kind of <unk> ; but , all right , i <name> . "
chapter xi  several months later .
<name> and <unk> " <unk> , is n't that plug you 're riding an assert of the scrap you and buffalo <name> had with the late <name> <unk> and his pal a few months back ? "
" yes , this is mongrel  and not a <unk> horse , either . "
" i 've noticed he keeps up his lick first-rate .
say  is n't it a gaudy morning ? "
" right you are ! "
" <unk> , it 's <unk> !
and when that 's said , all 's said . "
" <unk> and <unk> , <name> !
put it that way , and you have my vote .
being a native up there , i know .
you being <unk> born  " " can speak with authority for that patch of paradise ?
well , i can .
like the <name> !
like <unk> !
this is the correct <unk> <name> now  crisp , fresh , dewy , fragrant , pungent  " " 'what though the <unk> breezes blow soft o'er ceylon 's isle  '  git up , you old cow !
stumbling like that when we 've just been praising you !
out on a scout and ca n't live up to the honor any better than that ?
<name> , how long have you been out here in the plains and the rockies ? "
" more than thirteen years . "
" it 's a long time .
do n't you ever get homesick ? "
" not till now . "
" why now ?  after such a long cure . "
" these preparations of the retiring commandant 's have started it up . "
" of course .
it 's natural . "
" it keeps me thinking about spain .
i know the region where the seventh 's child 's aunt lives ; i know all the lovely country for miles around ; i 'll bet i 've seen her aunt 's villa many a time ; i'll bet i 've been in it in those pleasant old times when i was a spanish gentleman . "
" they say the child is wild to see spain . "
" it 's so ; i know it from what i hear . "
" have n't you talked with her about it ? "
" no .
i 've avoided it .
i should soon be as wild as she is .
that would not be comfortable . "
" i wish i was going , <name> .
there 's two things i 'd give a lot to see .
one 's a railroad . "
" she 'll see one when she strikes missouri . "
" the other 's a <unk> . "
" i 've seen lots of them ; i wish i could see another . "
" i do n't know anything about it , except in a mixed-up , foggy way , <name> , but i know enough to know it 's grand sport . "
" the grandest in the world !
there 's no other sport that begins with it .
i 'll tell you what i 've seen , then you can judge .
it was my first , and it 's as vivid to me now as it was when i saw it .
it was a <name> afternoon , and beautiful weather , and my uncle , the priest , took me as a reward for being a good boy and because of my own accord and without anybody asking me i had <unk> my <unk> and given the money to a mission that was <unk> the chinese and <unk> their lives and softening their hearts with the gentle teachings of our religion , and i wish you could have seen what we saw that day , <unk> .
" the amphitheatre was packed , from the <unk> to the highest row  twelve thousand people in one circling mass , one slanting , solid mass  royalties , nobles , clergy , ladies , gentlemen , state officials , generals , admirals , soldiers , sailors , lawyers , thieves , merchants , brokers , cooks , housemaids , <unk> , doubtful women , <unk> , gamblers , beggars , loafers , tramps , american ladies , gentlemen , preachers , english ladies , gentlemen , preachers , <name> ditto , french ditto , and so on and so on , all the world represented : spaniards to admire and praise , foreigners to enjoy and go home and find fault  there they were , one solid , sloping , circling sweep of rippling and flashing color under the downpour of the summer sun  just a garden , a gaudy , gorgeous flower-garden !
children munching oranges , six thousand fans fluttering and glimmering , everybody happy , everybody chatting gayly with their intimates , lovely <unk> smiling recognition and salutation to other lovely <unk> , gray old ladies and gentlemen dealing in the like exchanges with each other  ah , such a picture of cheery contentment and glad anticipation !
not a mean spirit , nor a sordid soul , nor a sad heart there  ah , <unk> , i wish i could see it again .
" suddenly , the martial note of a bugle <unk> the hum and murmur  clear the ring !
" they clear it .
the great gate is flung open , and the procession marches in , splendidly <unk> and glittering : the <unk> of the day , then the <unk> on horseback , then the <unk> on foot , each surrounded by his <unk> of <unk> .
they march to the box of the city fathers , and formally salute .
the key is thrown , the <unk> is unlocked .
another bugle blast  the gate flies open , the bull plunges in , furious , trembling , blinking in the blinding light , and stands there , a magnificent creature , centre of those multitudinous and admiring eyes , brave , ready for battle , his attitude a challenge .
he sees his enemy : horsemen sitting motionless , with long spears in rest , upon blindfolded broken-down <unk> , <name> and starved , fit only for sport and sacrifice , then the <unk> .
" the bull makes a rush , with murder in his eye , but a <unk> meets him with a <unk> in the shoulder .
he <unk> with the pain , and the <unk> skips out of danger .
a burst of applause for the <unk> , hisses for the bull .
some shout <unk> ! '
at the bull , and call him offensive names .
but he is not listening to them , he is there for business ; he is not minding the <unk> that come fluttering around to confuse him ; he <unk> this way , he <unk> that way , and hither and <name> , scattering the nimble <unk> in every direction like a spray , and receiving their maddening darts in his neck as they dodge and fly  oh , but it 's a lively spectacle , and brings down the house !
ah , you should hear the thundering roar that goes up when the game is at its wildest and brilliant things are done !
" oh , that first bull , that day , was great !
from the moment the spirit of war rose to <unk> in him and he got down to his work , he began to do wonders .
he tore his way through his <unk> , flinging one of them clear over the parapet ; he bowled a horse and his rider down , and plunged straight for the next , got home with his horns , wounding both horse and man ; on again , here and there and this way and that ; and one after another he tore the bowels out of two horses so that they gushed to the ground , and ripped a third one so badly that although they rushed him to cover and shoved his bowels back and stuffed the rents with tow and rode him against the bull again , he could n't make the trip ; he tried to gallop , under the spur , but soon reeled and tottered and fell , all in a heap .
for a while , that <unk> was the most thrilling and glorious and inspiring sight that ever was seen .
the bull absolutely cleared it , and stood there alone !
monarch of the place .
the people went mad for pride in him , and <name> and delight , and you could n't hear yourself think , for the roar and boom and crash of applause . "
" <name> , it carries me clear out of myself just to hear you tell it ; it must have been perfectly splendid .
if i live , i 'll see a <unk> yet before i die .
did they kill him ? "
" oh yes ; that is what the bull is for .
they tired him out , and got him at last .
he kept rushing the <unk> , who always slipped <unk> and gracefully aside in time , waiting for a sure chance ; and at last it came ; the bull made a deadly plunge for him  was avoided neatly , and as he sped by , the long sword glided silently into him , between left shoulder and spine  in and in , to the hilt .
he crumpled down , dying . "
" ah , <name> , it is the noblest sport that ever was .
i would give a year of my life to see it .
is the bull always killed ? "
" yes .
sometimes a bull is timid , finding himself in so strange a place , and he stands trembling , or tries to retreat .
then everybody despises him for his cowardice and wants him punished and made ridiculous ; so they hough him from behind , and it is the funniest thing in the world to see him <unk> around on his severed legs ; the whole vast house goes into <unk> of laughter over it ; i have laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks to see it .
when he has furnished all the sport he can , he is not any longer useful , and is killed . "
" well , it is perfectly grand , <name> , perfectly beautiful .
burning a nigger do n't begin . "
chapter xii  mongrel and the other horse " sage-brush , you have been listening ? "
" yes . "
" is n't it strange ? "
" well , no , mongrel , i do n't know that it is . "
" why do n't you ? "
" i 've seen a good many human beings in my time .
they are created as they are ; they can not help it .
they are only brutal because that is their make ; brutes would be brutal if it was their make . "
" to me , sage-brush , man is most strange and unaccountable .
why should he treat dumb animals that way when they are not doing any harm ? "
" man is not always like that , mongrel ; he is kind enough when he is not excited by religion . "
" is the <unk> a religious service ? "
" i think so .
i have heard so .
it is held on <name> . "
( a reflective pause , lasting some moments . )
then : " when we die , sage-brush , do we go to heaven and dwell with man ? "
" my father thought not .
he believed we do not have to go there unless we deserve it . "
part ii  in spain chapter xiii  general <name> to his mother it was a prodigious trip , but delightful , of course , through the rockies and the black hills and the mighty sweep of the great plains to civilization and the missouri border  where the railroading began and the <unk> ended .
but no one is the worse for the journey ; certainly not <name> , nor <name> , nor soldier boy ; and as for me , i am not complaining .
spain is all that <name> had pictured it  and more , she says .
she is in a fury of delight , the maddest little animal that ever was , and all for <name> .
she thinks she remembers spain , but that is not very likely , i suppose .
the two  <name> and <name>  devour each other .
it is a rapture of love , and beautiful to see .
it is spanish ; that describes it .
<name> this be a short visit ?
no .
it <name> be permanent .
<name> has elected to abide with spain and her aunt .
<name> says she ( <name> ) foresaw that this would happen ; and also says that she wanted it to happen , and says the child 's own country is the right place for her , and that she ought not to have been sent to me , i ought to have gone to her .
i thought it insane to take soldier boy to spain , but it was well that i yielded to <name> 's pleadings ; if he had been left behind , half of her heart would have remained with him , and she would not have been contented .
as it is , everything has fallen out for the best , and we are all satisfied and comfortable .
it may be that <name> and i <name> see <name> again some day ; but also it is a case of maybe not .
we left the post in the early morning .
it was an affecting time .
the women cried over <name> , so did even those stern warriors , the <name> mountain rangers ; shekels was there , and the cid , and <unk> , and potter , and mongrel , and <unk> , famine , and pestilence , and <name> kissed them all and wept ; details of the several arms of the garrison were present to represent the rest , and say good-bye and god bless you for all the soldiery ; and there was a special squad from the seventh , with the oldest veteran at its head , to speed the seventh 's child with grand honors and impressive ceremonies ; and the veteran had a touching speech by heart , and put up his hand in salute and tried to say it , but his lips trembled and his voice broke , but <name> bent down from the saddle and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat to victory , and a cheer went up .
the next act closed the ceremonies , and was a moving surprise .
it may be that you have discovered , before this , that the <unk> of military law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when a soldier or a regiment or the garrison wants to do something that <name> please <name> .
the bands conceived the idea of stirring her soldierly heart with a farewell which would remain in her memory always , beautiful and <unk> , and bring back the past and its love for her whenever she should think of it ; so they got their project placed before general <unk> , my successor , who is <unk> newest slave , and in spite of poverty of precedents they got his permission .
the bands knew the child 's favorite military airs .
by this hint you know what is coming , but <name> did n't .
she was asked to sound the " <unk> , " which she did .
[ <unk> ] with the last note the bands burst out with a crash : and woke the mountains with the " <unk> banner " in a way to make a <unk> heart swell and thump and his hair rise !
it was enough to break a person all up , to see <name> 's radiant face shining out through her gladness and tears .
by request she blew the " assembly , " now .
.
.
.
[ the assembly ] .
.
.
then the bands thundered in , with " rally round the flag , boys , rally once again ! "
next , she blew another call ( " to the standard " ) .
.
.
[ to the standard ] .
.
.
and the bands responded with " when we were marching through <name> . "
straightway she sounded " boots and saddles , " that thrilling and most <unk> call .
.
.
.
[ boots and saddles ] and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note ; then they turned their whole strength loose on " tramp , tramp , tramp , the boys are marching , " and everybody 's excitement rose to <unk> .
now an impressive pause  then the bugle sang " taps "  <unk> , this time , into " good-bye , and god keep us all ! "
for taps is the soldier 's nightly release from duty , and farewell : plaintive , sweet , pathetic , for the morning is never sure , for him ; always it is possible that he is hearing it for the last time .
.
.
.
[ taps ] .
.
.
then the bands turned their instruments towards <name> and burst in with that <unk> frenzy of a tune , " oh , we 'll all get blind drunk when <name> comes marching home  yes , we 'll all get blind drunk when <name> comes marching home ! "
and followed it instantly with " <name> , " that <unk> for melancholy , <unk> and <unk> of all military music on any side of the ocean  and that was the end .
and so  farewell !
i wish you could have been there to see it all , hear it all , and feel it : and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza that swept the place as a finish .
when we rode away , our main body had already been on the road an hour or two  i speak of our camp equipage ; but we did n't move off alone : when <name> blew the " advance " the rangers cantered out in column of fours , and gave us escort , and were joined by white cloud and <unk> in all their gaudy bravery , and by buffalo <name> and four subordinate scouts .
three miles away , in the plains , the lieutenant-general halted , sat her horse like a military statue , the bugle at her lips , and put the rangers through the evolutions for half an hour ; and finally , when she blew the " charge , " she led it herself .
" not for the last time , " she said , and got a cheer , and we said good-bye all around , and faced eastward and rode away .
postscript .
a day later .
soldier boy was stolen last night .
<name> is almost beside herself , and we can not comfort her .
<name> and i are not much alarmed about the horse , although this part of spain is in something of a turmoil , politically , at present , and there is a good deal of lawlessness .
in ordinary times the thief and the horse would soon be captured .
we shall have them before long , i think .
chapter xiv  soldier boy  to himself it is five months .
or is it six ?
my troubles have clouded my memory .
i have been all over this land , from end to end , and now i am back again since day before yesterday , to that city which we passed through , that last day of our long journey , and which is near her country home .
i am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim , but i recognized it .
if she could see me she would know me and sound my call .
i wish i could hear it once more ; it would revive me , it would bring back her face and the mountains and the free life , and i would come  if i were dying i would come !
she would not know me , looking as i do , but she would know me by my <name> .
but she <name> never see me , for they do not let me out of this shabby stable  a foul and miserable place , with most two wrecks like myself for company .
how many times have i changed hands ?
i think it is twelve times  i can not remember ; and each time it was down a step lower , and each time i got a harder master .
they have been cruel , every one ; they have worked me night and day in degraded employments , and beaten me ; they have fed me ill , and some days not at all .
and so i am but bones , now , with a rough and <unk> skin humped and cornered upon my shrunken body  that skin which was once so glossy , that skin which she loved to stroke with her hand .
i was the pride of the mountains and the great plains ; now i am a scarecrow and despised .
these piteous wrecks that are my comrades here say we have reached the bottom of the scale , the final humiliation ; they say that when a horse is no longer worth the weeds and discarded rubbish they feed to him , they sell him to the <unk> for a glass of <name> , to make sport for the people and perish for their pleasure .
to die  that does not disturb me ; we of the service never care for death .
but if i could see her once more !
if i could hear her bugle sing again and say , " it is i , soldier  come ! "
chapter xv  general <name> to mrs. drake , the colonel 's wife to return , now , to where i was , and tell you the rest .
we shall never know how she came to be there ; there is no way to account for it .
she was always watching for black and shiny and spirited horses  watching , hoping , despairing , hoping again ; always giving <name> and sounding her call , upon the <unk> chance of a response , and breaking her heart over the disappointment ; always inquiring , always interested in <unk> and horse accumulations in general .
how she got there must remain a mystery .
at the point which i had reached in a preceding paragraph of this account , the situation was as follows : two horses lay dying ; the bull had scattered his <unk> for the moment , and stood raging , panting , pawing the dust in clouds over his back , when the man that had been wounded returned to the ring on a <unk> , a poor blindfolded wreck that yet had something ironically military about his bearing  and the next moment the bull had ripped him open and his bowls were dragging upon the ground : and the bull was charging his swarm of pests again .
then came <unk> through the air a <unk> that froze my blood  " it is i , soldier  come ! "
i turned ; <name> was flying down through the massed people ; she cleared the parapet at a bound , and sped towards that <unk> horse , who staggered forward towards the remembered sound ; but his strength failed , and he fell at her feet , she <unk> kisses upon him and sobbing , the house rising with one impulse , and white with horror !
before help could reach her the bull was back again  she was never conscious again in life .
we bore her home , all mangled and drenched in blood , and knelt by her and listened to her broken and wandering words , and prayed for her passing spirit , and there was no comfort  nor ever <name> be , i think .
but she was happy , for she was far away under another sky , and <unk> again with her rangers , and her animal friends , and the soldiers .
their names fell softly and caressingly from her lips , one by one , with pauses between .
she was not in pain , but lay with closed eyes , vacantly murmuring , as one who dreams .
sometimes she smiled , saying nothing ; sometimes she smiled when she uttered a name  such as shekels , or bb , or potter .
sometimes she was at her fort , issuing commands ; sometimes she was <unk> over the plain at the head of her men ; sometimes she was training her horse ; once she said , <unk> , " you are giving me the wrong foot ; give me the left  do n't you know it is good-bye ? "
after this , she lay silent some time ; the end was near .
by-and-by she murmured , " tired .
.
.
sleepy .
.
.
take <name> , mamma . "
then , " kiss me , soldier . "
for a little time , she lay so still that we were doubtful if she breathed .
then she put out her hand and began to feel <unk> about ; then said , " i can not find it ; blow <unk> . ' "
it was the end .

after much thought , i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle .
so i determined to do it .
this was in march , 1878 .
i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent , and finally hired a mr. <name> for this service .
it was also my purpose to study <name> while in europe .
mr. <name> was in sympathy with me in this .
he was as much of an enthusiast in <name> as i was , and not less anxious to learn to paint .
i desired to learn the <name> language ; so did <name> .
toward the middle of <name> we sailed in the <unk> , captain <unk> , and had a very pleasant trip , indeed .
after a brief rest at hamburg , we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather , but at the last moment we changed the program , for private reasons , and took the <unk> .
we made a short halt at <unk> , and found it an interesting city .
i would have liked to visit the birthplace of <unk> , but it could not be done , as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept .
so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead .
the city permits this house to belong to private parties , instead of <unk> and <unk> herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it .
frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred .
charlemagne , while chasing the saxons ( as he said ) , or being chased by them ( as they said ) , arrived at the bank of the river at <name> , in a fog .
the enemy were either before him or behind him ; but in any case he wanted to get across , very badly .
he would have given anything for a guide , but none was to be had .
presently he saw a deer , followed by her young , approach the water .
he watched her , judging that she would seek a ford , and he was right .
she waded over , and the army followed .
so a great <unk> victory or defeat was gained or avoided ; and in order to commemorate the episode , charlemagne commanded a city to be built there , which he named frankfort  the ford of the <unk> .
none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it .
this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at .
frankfort has another distinction  it is the birthplace of the <name> alphabet ; or at least of the <name> word for alphabet  <unk> .
they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks  <unk>  hence the name .
i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort .
i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars .
by way of experiment , i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street , took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars , and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents .
the man gave me 43 cents change .
in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes , and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg , too , and in the villages along the road .
even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule .
the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body 's lap .
and as for the uniforms of the soldiers , they were newness and brightness carried to perfection .
one could never detect a <unk> or a grain of dust upon them .
the <unk> conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the <unk> , and their manners were as fine as their clothes .
in one of the shops i had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death .
it is entitled the legends of the rhine from basle to rotterdam , by f. j. <unk> ; translated by l. w. <unk> , b.a .
all tourists mention the rhine legends  in that sort of way which quietly pretends that the <unk> has been familiar with them all his life , and that the reader can not possibly be ignorant of them  but no tourist ever tells them .
so this little book fed me in a very hungry place ; and i , in my turn , intend to feed my reader , with one or two little <unk> from the same larder .
i shall not mar <unk> translation by meddling with its english ; for the most <unk> thing about it is its quaint fashion of building english sentences on the <name> plan  and <unk> them accordingly to no plan at all .
in the chapter devoted to " legends of frankfort , " i find the following : " the knave of <unk> " " in frankfort at the <unk> was a great <unk> , at the coronation festival , and in the illuminated saloon , the clanging music invited to dance , and splendidly appeared the <name> <unk> and charms of the ladies , and the <unk> <unk> princes and knights .
all seemed pleasure , <name> , and <unk> gaiety , only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior ; but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention , and his tall figure , as well as the <name> propriety of his movements , attracted especially the regards of the ladies .
who the knight was ?
nobody could guess , for his vizier was well closed , and nothing made him recognizable .
proud and yet modest he advanced to the empress ; bowed on one knee before her seat , and begged for the favor of a waltz with the <name> of the festival .
and she allowed his request .
with light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon , with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent <unk> .
but also by the <name> of his manner , and fine conversation he knew to win the <name> , and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged , a third , and a fourth , as well as others were not refused him .
how all regarded the happy <unk> , how many envied him the high favor ; how increased curiosity , who the masked knight could be .
" also the emperor became more and more excited with curiosity , and with great suspense one awaited the hour , when according to <unk> , each masked guest must make himself known .
this moment came , but although all other <unk> ; the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen , till at last the <name> driven by curiosity , and vexed at the obstinate refusal ; commanded him to open his vizier .
he opened it , and none of the high ladies and knights knew him .
but from the crowded spectators , 2 officials advanced , who recognized the black <unk> , and horror and terror spread in the saloon , as they said who the supposed knight was .
it was the executioner of <unk> .
but glowing with rage , the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death , who had ventured to dance , with the <name> ; so disgraced the empress , and insulted the crown .
the <unk> threw himself at the emperor , and said  " 'indeed i have heavily sinned against all <name> guests assembled here , but most heavily against you my sovereign and my <name> .
the <name> is insulted by my <unk> equal to treason , but no punishment even blood , <name> not be able to wash out the disgrace , which you have suffered by me .
therefore oh king !
allow me to propose a remedy , to efface the shame , and to render it as if not done .
draw your sword and knight me , then i <name> throw down my gauntlet , to everyone who dares to speak <unk> of my king . '
" the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal , however it appeared the wisest to him ; 'you are a knave , ' he replied after a moment's consideration , <unk> your advice is good , and displays <name> , as your offense shows adventurous courage .
well then , ' and gave him the <unk> 'so i raise you to nobility , who begged for <name> for your offense now <unk> before me , rise as knight ; <unk> you have acted , and knave of <unk> shall you be called henceforth , ' and gladly the black knight rose ; three cheers were given in honor of the emperor , and loud cries of <name> testified the approbation with which the <name> danced still once with the knave of <unk> . "
chapter ii heidelberg [ landing a monarch at heidelberg ] we stopped at a hotel by the <unk> .
next morning , as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up , we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way , in front of another hotel .
first , the personage who is called the portier ( who is not the <name> , but is a sort of <unk> of a hotel ) [ 1 .
see appendix a ] appeared at the door in a <unk> new blue cloth uniform , decorated with shining brass buttons , and with bands of gold lace around his cap and <unk> ; and he wore white gloves , too .
he shed an official glance upon the situation , and then began to give orders .
two <unk> came out with pails and <unk> and brushes , and gave the sidewalk a thorough <unk> ; meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door ; beyond these we could see some <unk> taking up the carpet of the grand staircase .
this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it ; then brought back and put down again .
the brass <unk> received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places .
now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase .
other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners ; others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there .
now came some more <unk> and <unk> the sidewalk , and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes .
now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the <unk> .
the portier cast his eye along it , and found it was not absolutely straight ; he commanded it to be straightened ; the servants made the effort  made several efforts , in fact  but the portier was not satisfied .
he finally had it taken up , and then he put it down himself and got it right .
at this stage of the proceedings , a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the <unk> , along the center of the black carpet .
this red path cost the portier more trouble than even the black one had done .
but he patiently fixed and <unk> it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet .
in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators ; but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement , some with their <unk> on their backs and their hands in their pockets , others with arms full of bundles , and all absorbed in the show .
occasionally one of them skipped <unk> over the carpet and took up a position on the other side .
this always visibly annoyed the portier .
now came a waiting interval .
the landlord , in plain clothes , and bareheaded , placed himself on the bottom marble step , abreast the portier , who stood on the other end of the same steps ; six or eight waiters , gloved , bareheaded , and wearing their whitest linen , their whitest <unk> , and their finest <unk> , grouped themselves about these chiefs , but leaving the <unk> clear .
nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited .
in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard , and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street .
two or three open carriages arrived , and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel .
presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of <unk> , a stately man in uniform , who wore the handsome <unk> , <unk> helmet of the army on his head .
last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of <unk> in a closed carriage ; these passed through the <unk> groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel , exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads , and then the show was over .
it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship .
but as to heidelberg .
the weather was growing pretty warm ,  very warm , in fact .
so we left the valley and took quarters at the <unk> hotel , on the hill , above the castle .
heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge  a gorge the shape of a shepherd 's crook ; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight , for a mile and a half , then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears .
this gorge  along whose bottom pours the swift neckar  is confined between ( or cloven through ) a couple of long , steep ridges , a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits , with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation .
these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands , with heidelberg nestling between them ; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley , and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view .
now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more , he <name> see the <unk> hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckar  a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears .
the building seems very <unk> situated .
it has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way up the wooded mountainside ; and as it is remote and isolated , and very white , it makes a strong <name> against the lofty leafy rampart at its back .
this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty , and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation .
this feature may be described as a series of <unk> parlors clinging to the outside of the house , one against each and every bed-chamber and drawing-room .
they are like long , narrow , <unk> <unk> <name> against the building .
my room was a corner room , and had two of these things , a north one and a west one .
from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge ; from the west one he looks down it .
this last affords the most extensive view , and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined , too .
out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage , a <unk> removed , rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle , [ 2 .
see appendix b ] with empty window arches , <unk> battlements , <unk> towers  the lear of inanimate nature  deserted , <unk> , beaten by the storms , but <name> still , and beautiful .
it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castle 's base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray , while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow .
behind the castle swells a great <unk> hill , <unk> , and beyond that a nobler and loftier one .
the castle looks down upon the compact <unk> town ; and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river .
now the view <unk> ; through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain , which stretches away , softly and richly tinted , grows gradually and dreamily indistinct , and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon .
i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives .
the first night we were there , we went to bed and to sleep early ; but i awoke at the end of two or three hours , and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows .
i took it to be rain , but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar , tumbling over her dikes and <unk> far below , in the gorge .
i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight .
away down on the level under the black mass of the castle , the town lay , stretched along the river , its intricate cobweb of streets <unk> with twinkling lights ; there were rows of lights on the bridges ; these flung lances of light upon the water , in the black shadows of the arches ; and away at the extremity of all this <name> spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of <unk> which seemed to cover acres of ground ; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there .
i did not know before , that a half-mile of <unk> <unk> could be made such an adornment .
one thinks heidelberg by day  with its surroundings  is the last possibility of the beautiful ; but when he sees heidelberg by night , a fallen milky way , with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border , he requires time to consider upon the verdict .
one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops .
the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country ; but <name> legends and <name> tales have given these an added charm .
they have peopled all that region with <unk> , and dwarfs , and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures .
at the time i am writing of , i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the <unk> and fairies as realities .
one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel , and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk , and <unk> , and enchanted folk , and the rest of the pleasant <unk> stuff ; and so , by stimulating my fancy , i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the <unk> aisles of the forest .
it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion .
it was a pine wood , with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that one 's footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool ; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars , and stood close together ; they were bare of branches to a point about twenty-five feet <unk> , and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a <name> of sunlight could pierce through .
the world was bright with <name> outside , but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there , and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own <unk> .
when i had stood ten minutes , thinking and imagining , and getting my spirit in tune with the place , and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural , a <name> suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head .
it made me start ; and then i was angry because i started .
i looked up , and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me , looking down at me .
i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been <unk> inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him .
i eyed the <name> , and the <name> eyed me .
nothing was said during some seconds .
then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation , lifted his wings , stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again  a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it .
if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in <name> , " well , what do you want here ? "
i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being , and reproved for it .
however , i made no reply ; i would not <unk> words with a <name> .
the adversary waited a while , with his shoulders still lifted , his head thrust down between them , and his keen bright eye fixed on me ; then he threw out two or three more insults , which i could not understand , further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church .
i still made no reply .
now the adversary raised his head and called .
there was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood  evidently a croak of inquiry .
the adversary explained with enthusiasm , and the other <name> dropped everything and came .
the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and <unk> as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug .
the thing became more and more embarrassing .
they called in another friend .
this was too much .
i saw that they had the advantage of me , and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it .
they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done .
they <unk> their necks and laughed at me ( for a <name> can laugh , just like a man ) , they <unk> insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me .
they were nothing but ravens  i knew that  what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence  and yet when even a <name> shouts after you , " what a hat ! "
" oh , pull down your vest ! "
and that sort of thing , it hurts you and <unk> you , and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments .
animals talk to each other , of course .
there can be no question about that ; but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them .
i never knew but one man who could .
i knew he could , however , because he told me so himself .
he was a middle-aged , <unk> miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california , among the woods and mountains , a good many years , and had studied the ways of his only neighbors , the beasts and the birds , until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made .
this was <name> baker .
according to <name> baker , some animals have only a limited education , and some use only simple words , and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure ; whereas , certain other animals have a large vocabulary , a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery ; consequently these latter talk a great deal ; they like it ; they are so conscious of their talent , and they enjoy " showing off . "
baker said , that after long and careful observation , he had come to the conclusion that the <unk> were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts .
said he : " there 's more to a <unk> than any other creature .
he has got more moods , and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures ; and , mind you , whatever a <unk> feels , he can put into language .
and no mere commonplace language , either , but rattling , out-and-out <unk>  and bristling with metaphor , too  just bristling !
and as for command of language  why you never see a <unk> get stuck for a word .
no man ever did .
they just boil out of him !
and another thing : i've noticed a good deal , and there 's no bird , or cow , or anything that uses as good grammar as a <unk> .
you may say a cat uses good grammar .
well , a cat does  but you let a cat get excited once ; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed , nights , and you 'll hear grammar that <name> give you the <unk> .
ignorant people think it 's the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating , but it ai n't so ; it's the sickening grammar they use .
now i 've never heard a <name> use bad grammar but very seldom ; and when they do , they are as ashamed as a human ; they shut right down and leave .
" you may call a <name> a bird .
well , so he is , in a measure  but he 's got feathers on him , and do n't belong to no church , perhaps ; but otherwise he is just as much human as you be .
and i 'll tell you for why .
a <unk> gifts , and instincts , and feelings , and interests , cover the whole ground .
a <name> has n't got any more principle than a congressman .
a <name> <name> lie , a <name> <name> steal , a <name> <name> deceive , a <name> <name> betray ; and four times out of five , a <name> <name> go back on his <unk> promise .
the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you ca n't cram into no <unk> 's head .
now , on top of all this , there 's another thing ; a <name> can <unk> any gentleman in the mines .
you think a cat can swear .
well , a cat can ; but you give a <unk> a subject that calls for his <unk> , and where is your cat ?
do n't talk to me  i know too much about this thing ; in the one little particular of scolding  just good , clean , out-and-out scolding  a <unk> can lay over anything , human or divine .
yes , sir , a <name> is everything that a man is .
a <name> can cry , a <name> can laugh , a <name> can feel shame , a <name> can reason and plan and discuss , a <name> likes gossip and scandal , a <name> has got a sense of humor , a <name> knows when he is an ass just as well as you do  maybe better .
if a <name> ai n't human , he better take in his sign , that 's all .
now i 'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some <unk> . "
chapter iii baker 's <unk> yarn [ what stumped the blue jays ] " when i first begun to understand <name> language correctly , there was a little incident happened here .
seven years ago , the last man in this region but me moved away .
there stands his house  been empty ever since ; a log house , with a plank roof  just one big room , and no more ; no ceiling  nothing between the rafters and the floor .
well , one <name> morning i was sitting out here in front of my cabin , with my cat , taking the sun , and looking at the blue hills , and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees , and thinking of the home away yonder in the states , that i had n't heard from in thirteen years , when a <unk> lit on that house , with an acorn in his mouth , and says , <unk> , i reckon i 've struck something . '
when he spoke , the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof , of course , but he did n't care ; his mind was all on the thing he had struck .
it was a <unk> in the roof .
he cocked his head to one side , shut one eye and put the other one to the hole , like a <unk> looking down a jug ; then he glanced up with his bright eyes , gave a wink or two with his wings  which signifies gratification , you understand  and says , 'it looks like a hole , it's located like a hole  blamed if i do n't believe it is a hole ! '
" then he cocked his head down and took another look ; he glances up perfectly joyful , this time ; winks his wings and his tail both , and says , 'oh , no , this ai n't no fat thing , i reckon !
if i ai n't in luck !
 why it 's a perfectly elegant hole ! '
so he flew down and got that acorn , and fetched it up and dropped it in , and was just tilting his head back , with the <unk> smile on his face , when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor , and the queerest look of surprise took its place .
then he says , 'why , i didn't hear it fall ! '
he cocked his eye at the hole again , and took a long look ; raised up and shook his head ; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side ; shook his head again .
he studied a while , then he just went into the details  walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass .
no use .
now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute , and finally says , 'well , it 's too many for me , that 's certain ; must be a mighty long hole ; however , i ai n't got no time to fool around here , i got to " tend to business " ; i reckon it 's all right  chance it , anyway . '
" so he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in , and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it , but he was too late .
he held his eye there as much as a minute ; then he raised up and sighed , and says , <unk> it , i do n't seem to understand this thing , no way ; however , i 'll tackle her again . '
he fetched another acorn , and done his level best to see what become of it , but he could n't .
he says , 'well , i never struck no such a hole as this before ; i 'm of the opinion it 's a totally new kind of a hole . '
then he begun to get mad .
he held in for a spell , walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself ; but his feelings got the upper hand of him , presently , and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face .
i never see a bird take on so about a little thing .
when he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute ; then he says , 'well , you 're a long hole , and a deep hole , and a mighty singular hole altogether  but i 've started in to fill you , and i 'm damned if i do n't fill you , if it takes a hundred years ! '
" and with that , away he went .
you never see a bird work so since you was born .
he laid into his work like a nigger , and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles i ever struck .
he never stopped to take a look <unk>  he just hove 'em in and went for more .
well , at last he could hardly flop his wings , he was so tuckered out .
he comes <unk> down , once more , sweating like an <unk> , dropped his acorn in and says , 'now i guess i 've got the bulge on you by this time ! '
so he bent down for a look .
if you 'll believe me , when his head come up again he was just pale with rage .
he says , 'i 've <unk> acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years , and if i can see a sign of one of 'em i wish i may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes ! '
" he just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and <name> his back agin the <unk> , and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind .
i see in a second that what i had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments , as you may say .
" another <name> was going by , and heard him doing his devotions , and stops to inquire what was up .
the sufferer told him the whole circumstance , and says , 'now yonder 's the hole , and if you do n't believe me , go and look for yourself . '
so this fellow went and looked , and comes back and says , 'how many did you say you put in there ? '
'not any less than two tons , ' says the sufferer .
the other <name> went and looked again .
he could n't seem to make it out , so he raised a yell , and three more jays come .
they all examined the hole , they all made the sufferer tell it over again , then they all discussed it , and got off as many <unk> opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done .
" they called in more jays ; then more and more , till pretty soon this whole region <unk> to have a blue flush about it .
there must have been five thousand of them ; and such another <unk> and disputing and ripping and cussing , you never heard .
every <name> in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more <unk> opinion about the mystery than the <name> that went there before him .
they examined the house all over , too .
the door was standing half open , and at last one old <name> happened to go and light on it and look in .
of course , that knocked the mystery <unk> in a second .
there lay the acorns , scattered all over the <unk>
he flopped his wings and raised a whoop .
'come here ! '
he says , 'come here , everybody ; <name> 'd if this fool has n't been trying to fill up a house with acorns ! '
they all came <unk> down like a blue cloud , and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance , the whole absurdity of the contract that that first <name> had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter , and the next <name> took his place and done the same .
" well , sir , they <unk> around here on the <unk> and the trees for an hour , and <unk> over that thing like human beings .
it ai n't any use to tell me a <unk> has n't got a sense of humor , because i know better .
and memory , too .
they brought jays here from all over the united states to look down that hole , every summer for three years .
other birds , too .
and they could all see the point except an owl that come from <name> scotia to visit the yo <unk> , and he took this thing in on his way back .
he said he could n't see anything funny in it .
but then he was a good deal disappointed about yo <unk> , too . "
chapter iv student life [ the laborious beer king ] the summer <unk> was in full tide ; consequently the most frequent figure in and about heidelberg was the student .
most of the students were germans , of course , but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous .
they hailed from every corner of the globe  for instruction is cheap in heidelberg , and so is living , too .
the <unk> club , composed of british and american students , had twenty-five members , and there was still much material left to draw from .
nine-tenths of the heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform ; the other tenth wore caps of various colors , and belonged to social organizations called " corps . "
there were five corps , each with a color of its own ; there were white caps , blue caps , and red , yellow , and green ones .
the famous <unk> is confined to the " corps " boys .
the " <unk> " seems to be a specialty of theirs , too .
<unk> are held , now and then , to celebrate great occasions , like the election of a beer king , for instance .
the solemnity is simple ; the five corps assemble at night , and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer , out of <unk> , as fast as possible , and each man keeps his own count  usually by laying aside a <unk> match for each mug he empties .
the election is soon decided .
when the candidates can hold no more , a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king .
i was told that the last beer king elected by the corps  or by his own <unk>  emptied his mug seventy-five times .
no stomach could hold all that quantity at one time , of course  but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum , which those who have been much at sea <name> understand .
one sees so many students abroad at all hours , that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any <unk> .
some of them have , some of them have n't .
each can choose for himself whether he <name> work or play ; for <name> university life is a very free life ; it seems to have no restraints .
the student does not live in the college buildings , but <unk> his own lodgings , in any locality he prefers , and he takes his meals when and where he pleases .
he goes to bed when it suits him , and does not get up at all unless he wants to .
he is not entered at the university for any particular length of time ; so he is likely to change about .
he passes no examinations upon entering college .
he merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars , receives a card <unk> him to the privileges of the university , and that is the end of it .
he is now ready for business  or play , as he shall prefer .
if he <unk> to work , he finds a large list of lectures to choose from .
he selects the subjects which he <name> study , and enters his name for these studies ; but he can skip attendance .
the result of this system is , that <unk> upon <unk> of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences , while those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are delivered to very large ones .
i heard of one case where , day after day , the lecturer 's audience consisted of three students  and always the same three .
but one day two of them remained away .
the lecturer began as usual  " gentlemen , "  then , without a smile , he corrected himself , saying  " sir , "  and went on with his discourse .
it is said that the vast majority of the heidelberg students are hard workers , and make the most of their opportunities ; that they have no surplus means to spend in dissipation , and no time to spare for frolicking .
one lecture follows right on the heels of another , with very little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next ; but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot .
the professors assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their little <unk> pulpits when the hours strike , and as promptly out again when the hour finishes .
i entered an empty <unk> one day just before the clock struck .
the place had simple , unpainted pine desks and benches for about two hundred persons .
about a minute before the clock struck , a hundred and fifty students swarmed in , rushed to their seats , immediately spread open their <unk> and dipped their pens in ink .
when the clock began to strike , a burly professor entered , was received with a round of applause , moved swiftly down the center aisle , said " gentlemen , " and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps ; and by the time he had arrived in his box and faced his audience , his lecture was well under way and all the pens were going .
he had no notes , he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hour  then the students began to remind him in certain <unk> ways that his time was up ; he seized his hat , still talking , proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps , got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor ; everybody rose respectfully , and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared .
an instant rush for some other <unk> followed , and in a minute i was alone with the empty benches once more .
yes , without doubt , idle students are not the rule .
out of eight hundred in the town , i knew the faces of only about fifty ; but these i saw everywhere , and daily .
they walked about the streets and the wooded hills , they drove in cabs , they <unk> on the river , they <unk> beer and coffee , afternoons , in the <unk> gardens .
a good many of them wore colored caps of the corps .
they were finely and <unk> dressed , their manners were quite superb , and they led an easy , careless , comfortable life .
if a dozen of them sat together and a <name> or a gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted , they all rose to their feet and took off their caps .
the members of a corps always received a <unk> in this way , too ; but they paid no attention to members of other corps ; they did not seem to see them .
this was not a discourtesy ; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps etiquette .
there seems to be no chilly distance existing between the <name> students and the professor ; but , on the contrary , a companionable intercourse , the opposite of <unk> and reserve .
when the professor enters a <unk> in the evening where students are gathered together , these rise up and take off their caps , and invite the old gentleman to sit with them and partake .
he accepts , and the pleasant talk and the beer flow for an hour or two , and by and by the professor , properly charged and comfortable , gives a cordial good night , while the students stand bowing and uncovered ; and then he moves on his happy way homeward with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold .
nobody finds fault or feels outraged ; no harm has been done .
it seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so , too .
i mean a corps dog  the common property of the organization , like the corps steward or head servant ; then there are other dogs , owned by individuals .
on a summer afternoon in the castle gardens , i have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds , in single file , each carrying a bright chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string .
it was a very imposing spectacle .
sometimes there would be as many dogs around the pavilion as students ; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness .
these dogs had a rather dry time of it ; for they were tied to the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except what they could get out of pawing at the <unk> , or trying to sleep and not succeeding .
however , they got a lump of sugar occasionally  they were fond of that .
it seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs ; but everybody else had them , too  old men and young ones , old women and nice young ladies .
if there is one spectacle that is <unk> than another , it is that of an elegantly dressed young <name> towing a dog by a string .
it is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love .
it seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised , which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties .
it would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going <unk> student carries an empty head .
just the contrary .
he has spent nine years in the gymnasium , under a system which allowed him no freedom , but vigorously compelled him to work like a slave .
consequently , he has left the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete , that the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its <unk> <unk> .
it is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium , he not only has a comprehensive education , but he knows what he knows  it is not <unk> with uncertainty , it is burnt into him so that it <name> stay .
for instance , he does not merely read and write greek , but speaks it ; the same with the latin .
foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium ; its rules are too severe .
they go to the university to put a mansard roof on their whole general education ; but the <name> student already has his mansard roof , so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some specialty , such as a particular branch of law , or diseases of the eye , or special study of the ancient gothic tongues .
so this <name> attends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch , and drinks his beer and <unk> his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day .
he has been in rigid bondage so long that the large <name> of the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly appreciates ; and as it can not last forever , he makes the most of it while it does last , and so lays up a good rest against the day that must see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or professional life .
chapter v at the students ' <unk> [ <unk> by wholesale ] one day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students ' <unk> .
we crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards , then turned to the left , entered a narrow alley , followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public house ; we were acquainted with its outside aspect , for it was visible from the hotel .
we went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty-five high .
it was a <unk> place .
there was no carpet .
across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables , and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students [ 1 .
see appendix c ] were sitting .
some of them were sipping wine , others were playing cards , others chess , other groups were chatting together , and many were smoking cigarettes while they waited for the coming duels .
nearly all of them wore colored caps ; there were white caps , green caps , blue caps , red caps , and <unk> ones ; so , all the five corps were present in strong force .
in the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight , <unk> swords with large protecting guards for the hand , and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone .
he understood his business ; for when a sword left his hand one could shave himself with it .
it was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke with students whose caps differed in color from their own .
this did not mean hostility , but only an armed <unk> .
it was considered that a person could strike harder in the duel , and with a more <name> interest , if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his antagonist ; therefore , comradeship between the corps was not permitted .
at intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official intercourse with each other , but nothing further .
for example , when the regular <unk> of one of the corps approaches , its president calls for volunteers from among the membership to offer battle ; three or more respond  but there must not be less than three ; the president lays their names before the other presidents , with the request that they furnish antagonists for these <unk> from among their corps .
this is promptly done .
it chanced that the present occasion was the <unk> of the red cap corps .
they were the <unk> , and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them .
the students fight duels in the room which i have described , two days in every week during seven and a half or eight months in every year .
this custom had continued in germany two hundred and fifty years .
to return to my narrative .
a student in a white cap met us and introduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps , and while we stood conversing , two <unk> figures were led in from another room .
they were students <unk> for the duel .
they were bareheaded ; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more , the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick <unk> which a sword could not cut through ; from <name> to ankle they were padded thoroughly against injury ; their arms were bandaged and <unk> , layer upon layer , until they looked like solid black logs .
these weird apparitions had been handsome youths , clad in fashionable attire , fifteen minutes before , but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in <unk> .
they strode along , with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies ; they did not hold them out themselves , but <unk> walked beside them and gave the needed support .
there was a rush for the vacant end of the room , now , and we followed and got good places .
the combatants were placed face to face , each with several members of his own corps about him to assist ; two seconds , well padded , and with swords in their hands , took their stations ; a student belonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good position to umpire the combat ; another student stood by with a watch and a <unk> to keep record of the time and the number and nature of the wounds ; a <unk> surgeon was present with his <unk> , his bandages , and his instruments .
after a moment 's pause the <unk> saluted the umpire respectfully , then one after another the several officials stepped forward , gracefully removed their caps and saluted him also , and returned to their places .
everything was ready now ; students stood crowded together in the foreground , and others stood behind them on chairs and tables .
every face was turned toward the center of attraction .
the combatants were watching each other with alert eyes ; a perfect stillness , a breathless interest reigned .
i felt that i was going to see some wary work .
but not so .
the instant the word was given , the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that i could not quite tell whether i saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air ; the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or <unk> was something wonderfully stirring , and they were struck with such terrific force that i could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault .
presently , in the midst of the <unk> , i saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim 's head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away .
the seconds cried " halt ! "
and knocked up the combatants ' swords with their own .
the <unk> sat down ; a student official stepped forward , examined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or twice ; the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound  and revealed a crimson gash two or three inches long , and proceeded to bind an oval piece of leather and a bunch of <unk> over it ; the <unk> stepped up and <unk> one for the opposition in his book .
then the <unk> took position again ; a small stream of blood was flowing down the side of the injured man 's head , and over his shoulder and down his body to the floor , but he did not seem to mind this .
the word was given , and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before ; once more the blows rained and rattled and flashed ; every few moments the <unk> seconds would notice that a sword was bent  then they called " halt ! "
struck up the contending weapons , and an assisting student straightened the bent one .
the wonderful turmoil went on  presently a bright spark sprung from a blade , and that blade broken in several pieces , sent one of its fragments flying to the ceiling .
a new sword was provided and the fight proceeded .
the exercise was tremendous , of course , and in time the fighters began to show great fatigue .
they were allowed to rest a moment , every little while ; they got other rests by wounding each other , for then they could sit down while the doctor applied the <unk> and bandages .
the law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if the men can hold out ; and as the pauses do not count , this duel was protracted to twenty or thirty minutes , i judged .
at last it was decided that the men were too much wearied to do battle longer .
they were led away drenched with crimson from head to foot .
that was a good fight , but it could not count , partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen minutes ( of actual fighting ) , and partly because neither man was disabled by his wound .
it was a drawn battle , and corps law requires that drawn battles shall be <unk> as soon as the adversaries are well of their hurts .
during the conflict , i had talked a little , now and then , with a young gentleman of the white cap corps , and he had mentioned that he was to fight next  and had also pointed out his <unk> , a young gentleman who was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and <unk> observing the duel then in progress .
my acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of giving me a kind of personal interest in it ; i naturally wished he might win , and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would not , because , although he was a notable <unk> , the <unk> was held to be his superior .
the duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked the previous one .
i stood close by , but could not tell which blows told and which did not , they fell and vanished so like flashes of light .
they all seemed to tell ; the swords always bent over the opponents ' heads , from the forehead back over the crown , and seemed to touch , all the way ; but it was not so  a protecting blade , invisible to me , was always interposed between .
at the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve or fifteen blows , and <unk> off twelve or fifteen , and no harm done ; then a sword became disabled , and a short rest followed whilst a new one was brought .
early in the next round the white corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it .
in the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head , and the former had his <unk> divided .
after that , the white corps student gave many severe wounds , but got none of the consequence in return .
at the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it ; the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any addition to them might be dangerous .
these injuries were a fearful spectacle , but are better left <unk> .
so , against expectation , my acquaintance was the <name> .
chapter <name> [ a sport that sometimes kills ] the third duel was brief and bloody .
the surgeon stopped it when he saw that one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight longer without <unk> his life .
the fourth duel was a tremendous encounter ; but at the end of five or six minutes the surgeon interfered once more : another man so severely hurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms .
i watched this engagement as i watched the others  with rapt interest and strong excitement , and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid open a cheek or a forehead ; and a conscious paling of my face when i occasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted .
my eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and <unk> wound  it was in his face and it carried away his  but no matter , i must not enter into details .
i had but a glance , and then turned quickly , but i would not have been looking at all if i had known what was coming .
no , that is probably not true ; one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming , but the interest and the excitement are so powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings ; and so , under the fierce exhilaration of the <unk> steel , he would yield and look after all .
sometimes spectators of these duels faint  and it does seem a very reasonable thing to do , too .
both parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the surgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour  a fact which is suggestive .
but this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by the assembled students .
it was past noon , therefore they ordered their landlord , downstairs , to send up hot <unk> , chickens , and such things , and these they ate , sitting comfortable at the several tables , whilst they chatted , disputed and laughed .
the door to the <unk> room stood open , meantime , but the cutting , sewing , <unk> , and <unk> going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb anyone 's appetite .
i went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile , but could not enjoy ; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended ; the stir and turmoil , and the music of the steel , were wanting here  one 's nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle , whilst the duel 's compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking .
finally the doctor finished , and the men who were to fight the closing battle of the day came forth .
a good many dinners were not completed , yet , but no matter , they could be eaten cold , after the battle ; therefore everybody crowded forth to see .
this was not a love duel , but a " satisfaction " affair .
these two students had quarreled , and were here to settle it .
they did not belong to any of the corps , but they were furnished with weapons and armor , and permitted to fight here by the five corps as a courtesy .
evidently these two young men were unfamiliar with the <unk> ceremonies , though they were not unfamiliar with the sword .
when they were placed in position they thought it was time to begin  and then did begin , too , and with a most impetuous energy , without waiting for anybody to give the word .
this vastly amused the spectators , and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter .
of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again .
at the word , the deluge of blows began , but before long the surgeon once more interfered  for the only reason which ever permits him to interfere  and the day 's war was over .
it was now two in the afternoon , and i had been present since half past nine in the morning .
the field of battle was indeed a red one by this time ; but some sawdust soon righted that .
there had been one duel before i arrived .
in it one of the men received many injuries , while the other one escaped without a scratch .
i had seen the heads and faces of ten youths <unk> in every direction by the keen <unk> blades , and yet had not seen a victim wince , nor heard a moan , or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting .
this was good fortitude , indeed .
such endurance is to be expected in savages and <unk> , for they are born and educated to it ; but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly <unk> young fellows is matter for surprise .
it was not merely under the excitement of the <unk> that this fortitude was shown ; it was shown in the surgeon 's room where an <unk> quiet reigned , and where there was no audience .
the doctor's <unk> brought out neither grimaces nor moans .
and in the fights it was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same tremendous spirit , after they were covered with streaming wounds , which they had shown in the beginning .
the world in general looks upon the college duels as very <unk> affairs : true , but considering that the college duel is fought by boys ; that the swords are real swords ; and that the head and face are exposed , it seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it .
people laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered up with armor that he can not be hurt .
but it is not so ; his eyes and ears are protected , but the rest of his face and head are bare .
he can not only be badly wounded , but his life is in danger ; and he would sometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon .
it is not intended that his life shall be <unk> .
fatal accidents are possible , however .
for instance , the student 's sword may break , and the end of it fly up behind his antagonist 's ear and cut an artery which could not be reached if the sword remained whole .
this has happened , sometimes , and death has resulted on the spot .
formerly the <unk> armpits were not protected  and at that time the swords were pointed , whereas they are blunt , now ; so an artery in the armpit was sometimes cut , and death followed .
then in the days of <unk> swords , a spectator was an occasional victim  the end of a broken sword flew five or ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart , and death ensued instantly .
the student duels in germany occasion two or three deaths every year , now , but this arises only from the carelessness of the wounded men ; they eat or drink <unk> , or commit excesses in the way of <unk> ; inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that it can not be arrested .
indeed , there is blood and pain and danger enough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of respect .
all the customs , all the laws , all the details , pertaining to the student duel are quaint and naive .
the grave , precise , and courtly ceremony with which the thing is conducted , <unk> it with a sort of antique charm .
this dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament , not the <unk> .
the laws are as curious as they are strict .
for instance , the <unk> may step forward from the line he is placed upon , if he chooses , but never back of it .
if he steps back of it , or even leans back , it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an advantage ; so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace .
it would seem natural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously , and against one 's <name> and intent  yet this unconsciousness is not allowed .
again : if under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a <unk> , he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows ; his corps are ashamed of him : they call him " hare foot , " which is the <name> equivalent for <unk> .
chapter vii [ how <unk> fought ] in addition to the corps laws , there are some corps usages which have the force of laws .
perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who is no longer an exempt  that is a freshman  has remained a sophomore some little time without <unk> to fight ; some day , the president , instead of calling for volunteers , <name> appoint this sophomore to measure swords with a student of another corps ; he is free to decline  everybody says so  there is no compulsion .
this is all true  but i have not heard of any student who did decline ; to decline and still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous , and properly so , since he knew , when he joined , that his main business , as a member , would be to fight .
no , there is no law against declining  except the law of custom , which is <unk> stronger than written law , everywhere .
the ten men whose duels i had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed , as i had supposed they would , but came back , one after another , as soon as they were free of the surgeon , and mingled with the assemblage in the <unk> .
the <unk> student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three , and talked with us during the <unk> .
he could not talk very well , because his opponent 's sword had cut his <unk> in two , and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches ; neither could he eat easily , still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome luncheon while the last duel was preparing .
the man who was the worst hurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement .
a good part of his face was covered with patches and bandages , and all the rest of his head was covered and concealed by them .
it is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other public places in this kind of array , and that this <unk> often keeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him .
newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public gardens of heidelberg .
it is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face , because the scars they leave <name> show so well there ; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible .
it does not look reasonable , but it is roundly asserted and maintained , nevertheless ; i am sure of one thing  scars are plenty enough in germany , among the young men ; and very grim ones they are , too .
they <unk> the face in angry red <unk> , and are permanent and <unk> .
some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect ; and the effect is striking when several such accent the milder ones , which form a city map on a man 's face ; they suggest the " burned district " then .
we had often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts .
it transpired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision was reached  duels in which he either whipped or was whipped  for drawn battles do not count .
[ 1 ] after a student has received his ribbon , he is " free " ; he can cease from fighting , without reproach  except some one insult him ; his president can not appoint him to fight ; he can volunteer if he wants to , or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so .
statistics show that he does not prefer to remain quiescent .
they show that the duel has a singular fascination about it somewhere , for these free men , so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge , are always <unk> .
a corps student told me it was of record that <name> <unk> fought thirty-two of these duels in a single summer term when he was in college .
so he fought twenty-nine after his badge had given him the right to retire from the field .
1 .
from my <unk>  dined in a hotel a few miles up the neckar , in a room whose walls were <name> all over with framed <unk> of the five corps ; some were recent , but many <unk> <unk> , and were pictured in <unk>  the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years ago .
nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast .
in one <unk> representing ( as each of these pictures did ) an entire corps , i took pains to count the ribbons : there were twenty-seven members , and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge .
the statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars .
two days in every week are devoted to <unk> .
the rule is rigid that there must be three duels on each of these days ; there are generally more , but there can not be fewer .
there were six the day i was present ; sometimes there are seven or eight .
it is insisted that eight duels a week  four for each of the two days  is too low an average to draw a calculation from , but i <name> reckon from that basis , preferring an <unk> to an <unk> of the case .
this requires about four hundred and eighty or five hundred <unk> a year  for in summer the college term is about three and a half months , and in <name> it is four months and sometimes longer .
of the seven hundred and fifty students in the university at the time i am writing of , only eighty belonged to the five corps , and it is only these corps that do the <unk> ; occasionally other students borrow the arms and <unk> of the five corps in order to settle a quarrel , but this does not happen every <unk> .
[ 2 ] consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred and fifty duels a year .
this average gives six fights a year to each of the eighty .
this large work could not be accomplished if the <unk> stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer .
2 .
they have to borrow the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise .
as i understand it , the public authorities , all over germany , allow the five corps to keep swords , but do not allow them to use them .
this is law is rigid ; it is only the execution of it that is lax .
of course , where there is so much fighting , the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil .
one often sees them , at the tables in the castle grounds , using their whips or canes to illustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about ; and between the duels , on the day whose history i have been writing , the swords were not always idle ; every now and then we heard a succession of the keen hissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its paces in the air , and this informed us that a student was practicing .
necessarily , this unceasing attention to the <name> develops an expert occasionally .
he becomes famous in his own university , his renown spreads to other universities .
he is invited to <unk> , to fight with a <unk> expert ; if he is victorious , he <name> be invited to other colleges , or those colleges <name> send their experts to him .
americans and englishmen often join one or another of the five corps .
a year or two ago , the principal heidelberg expert was a big <unk> ; he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory behind him all about germany ; but at last a little student in <unk> defeated him .
there was formerly a student in heidelberg who had picked up somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead of cleaving down from above .
while the trick lasted he won in sixteen successive duels in his university ; but by that time observers had discovered what his charm was , and how to break it , therefore his championship ceased .
a rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different corps is strict .
in the <unk> , in the parks , on the street , and anywhere and everywhere that the students go , caps of a color group themselves together .
if all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one , and that one had two <unk> students at it and ten vacant places , the <unk> , the <unk> , the white caps , and the green caps , seeking seats , would go by that table and not seem to see it , nor seem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds .
the student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the <unk> , wore the white cap  prussian corps .
he introduced us to many white caps , but to none of another color .
the corps etiquette extended even to us , who were strangers , and required us to group with the white corps only , and speak only with the white corps , while we were their guests , and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors .
once i wished to examine some of the swords , but an american student said , " it would not be quite polite ; these now in the windows all have red <unk> or blue ; they <name> bring in some with white <unk> presently , and those you can handle freely . "
when a sword was broken in the first duel , i wanted a piece of it ; but its hilt was the wrong color , so it was considered best and <unk> to await a <unk> season .
it was brought to me after the room was cleared , and i <name> now make a " <unk> " sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen , to show the width of the weapon .
[ figure 1 ] the length of these swords is about three feet , and they are quite heavy .
one 's disposition to cheer , during the course of the duels or at their close , was naturally strong , but corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort .
however brilliant a contest or a victory might be , no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved .
a dignified gravity and repression were maintained at all times .
when the <unk> was finished and we were ready to go , the gentlemen of the prussian corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps in the courteous <name> way , and also shook hands ; their brethren of the same order took off their caps and bowed , but without shaking hands ; the gentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated white caps  they fell apart , apparently unconsciously , and left us an unobstructed pathway , but did not seem to see us or know we were there .
if we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps , the white caps , without meaning any offense , would have observed the etiquette of their order and ignored our presence .
[ how strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life !
i had not been home a full half-hour , after witnessing those playful <unk> , when circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real one  a duel with no <unk> limitation in the matter of results , but a battle to the death .
an account of it , in the next chapter , <name> show the reader that duels between boys , for fun , and duels between men in <name> , are very different affairs . ]

since it is always fought in the open air , the combatants are nearly sure to catch cold .
m. <name> de <unk> , the most inveterate of the french <unk> , had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a confirmed invalid ; and the best physician in <name> has expressed the opinion that if he goes on <unk> for fifteen or twenty years more  unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where <unk> and draughts can not intrude  he <name> eventually endanger his life .
this ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn in maintaining that the french duel is the most <unk> of <unk> because of the <unk> exercise it affords .
and it ought also to moderate that foolish talk about french <unk> and <unk> monarchs being the only people who are immoral .
but it is time to get at my subject .
as soon as i heard of the late fiery outbreak between m. <unk> and m. <unk> in the french assembly , i knew that trouble must follow .
i knew it because a long personal friendship with m. <unk> revealed to me the desperate and implacable nature of the man .
vast as are his physical proportions , i knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest frontiers of his person .
i did not wait for him to call on me , but went at once to him .
as i had expected , i found the brave fellow steeped in a profound french calm .
i say french calm , because french calmness and english calmness have points of difference .
he was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture , now and then <unk> chance fragments of it across the room with his foot ; grinding a constant <unk> of curses through his set teeth ; and halting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the pile which he had been building of it on the table .
he threw his arms around my neck , bent me over his stomach to his breast , kissed me on both cheeks , hugged me four or five times , and then placed me in his own arm-chair .
as soon as i had got well again , we began business at once .
i said i supposed he would wish me to act as his second , and he said , " of course . "
i said i must be allowed to act under a french name , so that i might be <unk> from <unk> in my country , in case of fatal results .
he winced here , probably at the suggestion that <unk> was not regarded with respect in <name> .
however , he agreed to my requirement .
this accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports m. <unk> 's second was apparently a frenchman .
first , we <name> up my principal 's <name> .
i insisted upon this , and stuck to my point .
i said i had never heard of a man in his right mind going out to fight a duel without first making his <name> .
he said he had never heard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind .
when he had finished the <name> , he wished to proceed to a choice of his " last words . "
he wanted to know how the following words , as a dying exclamation , struck me : " i die for my god , for my country , for freedom of speech , for progress , and the universal brotherhood of man ! "
i objected that this would require too lingering a death ; it was a good speech for a <unk> , but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor .
we <unk> over a good many <unk> <unk> , but i finally got him to cut his obituary down to this , which he copied into his <unk> , purposing to get it by heart : " i die that <name> might live . "
i said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy ; but he said relevancy was a matter of no consequence in last words , what you wanted was thrill .
the next thing in order was the choice of weapons .
my principal said he was not feeling well , and would leave that and the other details of the proposed meeting to me .
therefore i wrote the following note and carried it to m. <unk> 's friend : sir : m. <unk> accepts m. <unk> 's challenge , and <unk> me to propose <unk> as the place of meeting ; tomorrow morning at daybreak as the time ; and axes as the weapons .
i am , sir , with great respect , <name> twain .
m. <unk> 's friend read this note , and shuddered .
then he turned to me , and said , with a suggestion of severity in his tone : " have you considered , sir , what would be the inevitable result of such a meeting as this ? "
" well , for instance , what would it be ? "
" bloodshed ! "
" that 's about the size of it , " i said .
" now , if it is a fair question , what was your side proposing to shed ? "
i had him there .
he saw he had made a blunder , so he hastened to explain it away .
he said he had spoken <unk> .
then he added that he and his principal would enjoy axes , and indeed prefer them , but such weapons were barred by the french code , and so i must change my proposal .
i walked the floor , turning the thing over in my mind , and finally it occurred to me that <unk> at fifteen paces would be a likely way to get a verdict on the field of honor .
so i framed this idea into a proposition .
but it was not accepted .
the code was in the way again .
i proposed rifles ; then double-barreled shotguns ; then colt 's navy revolvers .
these being all rejected , i reflected awhile , and sarcastically suggested <unk> at three-quarters of a mile .
i always hate to fool away a humorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor ; and it filled me with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last proposition to his principal .
he came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea of <unk> at three-quarters of a mile , but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them .
then i said : " well , i am at the end of my string , now .
perhaps you would be good enough to suggest a weapon ?
perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time ? "
his countenance brightened , and he said with alacrity : " oh , without doubt , monsieur ! "
so he fell to hunting in his pockets  pocket after pocket , and he had plenty of them  muttering all the while , " now , what could i have done with them ? "
at last he was successful .
he fished out of his vest pocket a couple of little things which i carried to the light and ascertained to be pistols .
they were <unk> and <unk> , and very dainty and pretty .
i was not able to speak for emotion .
i silently <name> one of them on my watch-chain , and returned the other .
my companion in crime now unrolled a <unk> containing several cartridges , and gave me one of them .
i asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were to be allowed but one shot apiece .
he replied that the french code permitted no more .
i then begged him to go and suggest a distance , for my mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been put upon it .
he named sixty-five yards .
i nearly lost my <name> .
i said : " sixty-five yards , with these instruments ?
<unk> would be <unk> at fifty .
consider , my friend , you and i are banded together to destroy life , not make it eternal . "
but with all my persuasions , all my arguments , i was only able to get him to reduce the distance to thirty-five yards ; and even this concession he made with reluctance , and said with a sigh , " i wash my hands of this slaughter ; on your head be it . "
there was nothing for me but to go home to my old <unk> and tell my humiliating story .
when i entered , m. <unk> was laying his last lock of hair upon the altar .
he sprang toward me , exclaiming : " you have made the fatal arrangements  i see it in your eye ! "
" i have . "
his face paled a trifle , and he leaned upon the table for support .
he breathed thick and heavily for a moment or two , so tumultuous were his feelings ; then he hoarsely whispered : " the weapon , the weapon !
quick !
what is the weapon ? "
" this ! "
and i displayed that <unk> thing .
he cast but one glance at it , then swooned <unk> to the floor .
when he came to , he said mournfully : " the unnatural calm to which i have subjected myself has told upon my nerves .
but away with weakness !
i <name> confront my fate like a man and a frenchman . "
he rose to his feet , and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has never been approached by man , and has seldom been surpassed by statues .
then he said , in his deep bass tones : " behold , i am calm , i am ready ; reveal to me the distance . "
" thirty-five yards . "
...
i could not lift him up , of course ; but i rolled him over , and poured water down his back .
he presently came to , and said : " thirty-five yards  without a rest ?
but why ask ?
since murder was that man 's intention , why should he <unk> with small details ?
but <name> you one thing : in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of <name> meets death . "
after a long silence he asked : " was nothing said about that man 's family standing up with him , as an offset to my bulk ?
but no matter ; i would not stoop to make such a suggestion ; if he is not <name> enough to suggest it himself , he is welcome to this advantage , which no honorable man would take . "
he now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection , which lasted some minutes ; after which he broke silence with : " the hour  what is the hour fixed for the collision ? "
" <name> , tomorrow . "
he seemed greatly surprised , and immediately said : " insanity !
i never heard of such a thing .
nobody is abroad at such an hour . "
" that is the reason i named it .
do you mean to say you want an audience ? "
" it is no time to <unk> words .
i am astonished that m. <unk> should ever have agreed to so strange an innovation .
go at once and require a later hour . "
i ran downstairs , threw open the front door , and almost plunged into the arms of m. <unk> 's second .
he said : " i have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the hour chosen , and begs you <name> consent to change it to half past nine . "
" any courtesy , sir , which it is in our power to extend is at the service of your excellent principal .
we agree to the proposed change of time . "
" i beg you to accept the thanks of my client . "
then he turned to a person behind him , and said , " you hear , m. <unk> , the hour is altered to half past nine . "
whereupon m. <unk> bowed , expressed his thanks , and went away .
my accomplice continued : " if agreeable to you , your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the field in the same carriage as is customary . "
" it is entirely agreeable to me , and i am obliged to you for mentioning the surgeons , for i am afraid i should not have thought of them .
how many shall i want ?
i supposed two or three <name> be enough ? "
" two is the customary number for each party .
i refer to <unk> surgeons ; but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients , it <name> be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting surgeons , from among the highest in the profession .
these <name> come in their own private carriages .
have you engaged a hearse ? "
" bless my stupidity , i never thought of it !
i <name> attend to it right away .
i must seem very ignorant to you ; but you must try to overlook that , because i have never had any experience of such a swell duel as this before .
i have had a good deal to do with duels on the pacific coast , but i see now that they were crude affairs .
a hearse  sho !
we used to leave the elected lying around loose , and let anybody cord them up and cart them off that wanted to .
have you anything further to suggest ? "
" nothing , except that the head <unk> shall ride together , as is usual .
the subordinates and <unk> <name> go on foot , as is also usual .
i <name> see you at eight o'clock in the morning , and we <name> then arrange the order of the procession .
i have the honor to bid you a good day . "
i returned to my client , who said , " very well ; at what hour is the engagement to begin ? "
" half past nine . "
" very good indeed .
have you sent the fact to the newspapers ? "
" sir !
if after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment deem me capable of so base a treachery  " " tut , tut !
what words are these , my dear friend ?
have i wounded you ?
ah , forgive me ; i am <unk> you with labor .
therefore go on with the other details , and drop this one from your list .
the <unk> <unk> <name> be sure to attend to it .
or i myself  yes , to make certain , i <name> drop a note to my journalistic friend , m. <unk>  " " oh , come to think of it , you may save yourself the trouble ; that other second has informed m .
<unk> . "
" h 'm !
i might have known it .
it is just like that <unk> , who always wants to make a display . "
at half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of <unk> in the following order : first came our carriage  nobody in it but m. <unk> and myself ; then a carriage containing m. <unk> and his second ; then a carriage containing two <unk> who did not believe in god , and these had ms. funeral orations projecting from their breast pockets ; then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their cases of instruments ; then eight private carriages containing consulting surgeons ; then a hack containing a coroner ; then the two <unk> ; then a carriage containing the head <unk> ; then a train of assistants and <unk> on foot ; and after these came plodding through the fog a long procession of camp followers , police , and citizens generally .
it was a <name> turnout , and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner weather .
there was no conversation .
i spoke several times to my principal , but i judge he was not aware of it , for he always referred to his note-book and muttered absently , " i die that <name> might live . "
arrived on the field , my <unk> and i paced off the thirty-five yards , and then <name> lots for choice of position .
this latter was but an ornamental ceremony , for all the <unk> were alike in such weather .
these preliminaries being ended , i went to my principal and asked him if he was ready .
he spread himself out to his full width , and said in a stern voice , " ready !
let the batteries be charged . "
the loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted witnesses .
we considered it best to perform this delicate service with the assistance of a lantern , on account of the state of the weather .
we now placed our men .
at this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves together on the right and left of the field ; they therefore begged a delay , while they should put these poor people in a place of safety .
the request was granted .
the police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind the <unk> , we were once more ready .
the weather growing still more opaque , it was agreed between myself and the other second that before giving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable the combatants to ascertain each other 's whereabouts .
i now returned to my principal , and was distressed to observe that he had lost a good deal of his spirit .
i tried my best to hearten him .
i said , " indeed , sir , things are not as bad as they seem .
considering the character of the weapons , the limited number of shots allowed , the generous distance , the impenetrable solidity of the fog , and the added fact that one of the combatants is one-eyed and the other <unk> and <unk> , it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be fatal .
there are chances that both of you may survive .
therefore , cheer up ; do not be downhearted . "
this speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately stretched forth his hand and said , " i am myself again ; give me the weapon . "
i laid it , all lonely and forlorn , in the center of the vast solitude of his palm .
he gazed at it and shuddered .
and still mournfully contemplating it , he murmured in a broken voice : " alas , it is not death i dread , but mutilation . "
i <unk> him once more , and with such success that he presently said , " let the tragedy begin .
stand at my back ; do not desert me in this solemn hour , my friend . "
i gave him my promise .
i now assisted him to point his pistol toward the spot where i judged his adversary to be standing , and cautioned him to listen well and further guide himself by my <unk> 's whoop .
then i propped myself against m. <unk> 's back , and raised a rousing " <unk> ! "
this was answered from out the far distances of the fog , and i immediately shouted : " one  two  three  fire ! "
two little sounds like spit !
spit !
broke upon my ear , and in the same instant i was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh .
bruised as i was , i was still able to catch a faint accent from above , to this effect : " i die for ... for ... perdition take it , what is it i die for ?
... oh , yes  <name> !
i die that <name> may live ! "
the surgeons swarmed around with their <unk> in their hands , and applied their <unk> to the whole area of m. <unk> 's person , with the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound .
then a scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and <unk> .
the two gladiators fell upon each other 's neck , with floods of proud and happy tears ; that other second embraced me ; the surgeons , the orators , the <unk> , the police , everybody embraced , everybody congratulated , everybody cried , and the whole atmosphere was filled with praise and with <name> unspeakable .
it seems to me then that i would rather be a hero of a french duel than a crowned and <unk> monarch .
when the commotion had somewhat subsided , the body of surgeons held a consultation , and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper care and nursing there was reason to believe that i would survive my injuries .
my internal hurts were deemed the most serious , since it was apparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung , and that many of my organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where they belonged , that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform their functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities .
they then set my left arm in two places , pulled my right hip into its socket again , and <unk> my nose .
i was an object of great interest , and even admiration ; and many sincere and <unk> persons had themselves introduced to me , and said they were proud to know the only man who had been hurt in a french duel in forty years .
i was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession ; and thus with gratifying <unk> i was marched into <name> , the most conspicuous figure in that great spectacle , and deposited at the hospital .
the cross of the legion of honor has been conferred upon me .
however , few escape that distinction .
such is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the age .
i have no complaints to make against any one .
i acted for myself , and i can stand the consequences .
without boasting , i think i may say i am not afraid to stand before a modern french <unk> , but as long as i keep in my right mind i <name> never consent to stand behind one again .
chapter ix [ what the beautiful maiden said ] one day we took the train and went down to <unk> to see " king lear " played in <name> .
it was a mistake .
we sat in our seats three whole hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning ; and even that was reversed to suit <name> ideas , for the thunder came first and the lightning followed after .
the behavior of the audience was perfect .
there were no <unk> , or whisperings , or other little disturbances ; each act was listened to in silence , and the applauding was done after the curtain was down .
the doors opened at half past four , the play began promptly at half past five , and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their seats , and quiet reigned .
a <name> gentleman in the train had said that a <unk> play was an appreciated treat in germany and that we should find the house filled .
it was true ; all the six tiers were filled , and remained so to the end  which suggested that it is not only balcony people who like shakespeare in germany , but those of the pit and gallery , too .
another time , we went to <unk> and attended a <unk>  otherwise an opera  the one called " <unk> . "
the banging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond belief .
the racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time that i had my teeth fixed .
there were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the four hours to the end , and i stayed ; but the recollection of that long , dragging , relentless season of suffering is indestructible .
to have to endure it in silence , and sitting still , made it all the harder .
i was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers , of the two sexes , and this compelled repression ; yet at times the pain was so exquisite that i could hardly keep the tears back .
at those times , as the howlings and <unk> and shrieking of the singers , and the <unk> and <unk> and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher , and wilder and wilder , and fiercer and fiercer , i could have cried if i had been alone .
those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being gradually skinned , but they would have marveled at it here , and made remarks about it no doubt , whereas there was nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being skinned .
there was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act , and i could have gone out and rested during that time , but i could not trust myself to do it , for i felt that i should desert to stay out .
there was another wait of half an hour toward nine o'clock , but i had gone through so much by that time that i had no spirit left , and so had no <name> but to be let alone .
i do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me , for , indeed , they were not .
whether it was that they naturally liked that noise , or whether it was that they had learned to like it by getting used to it , i did not at the time know ; but they did like it  this was plain enough .
while it was going on they sat and looked as rapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs ; and whenever the curtain fell they rose to their feet , in one solid mighty multitude , and the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs , and <unk> of applause swept the place .
this was not comprehensible to me .
of course , there were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay ; yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning .
this showed that the people liked it .
it was a curious sort of a play .
in the manner of costumes and scenery it was fine and showy enough ; but there was not much action .
that is to say , there was not much really done , it was only talked about ; and always violently .
it was what one might call a narrative play .
everybody had a narrative and a grievance , and none were reasonable about it , but all in an offensive and ungovernable state .
there was little of that sort of customary thing where the tenor and the <unk> stand down by the <unk> , <unk> , with blended voices , and keep holding out their arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both hands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a pressure  no , it was every <unk> for himself and no blending .
each sang his <unk> narrative in turn , accompanied by the whole orchestra of sixty instruments , and when this had continued for some time , and one was hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise , a great chorus composed entirely of <unk> would suddenly break forth , and then during two minutes , and sometimes three , i lived over again all that i suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down .
we only had one brief little season of heaven and heaven 's sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and <unk> reproduction of the other place .
this was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around , in the third act , and sang the wedding chorus .
to my <unk> ear that was music  almost divine music .
while my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds , it seemed to me that i could almost <unk> the torments which had gone before , in order to be so healed again .
there is where the deep ingenuity of the <unk> idea is betrayed .
it deals so largely in pain that its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts .
a pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere else , i suppose , just as an honest man in politics shines more than he would elsewhere .
i have since found out that there is nothing the germans like so much as an opera .
they like it , not in a mild and moderate way , but with their whole hearts .
this is a legitimate result of habit and education .
our nation <name> like the opera , too , by and by , no doubt .
one in fifty of those who attend our operas likes it already , perhaps , but i think a good many of the other forty-nine go in order to learn to like it , and the rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it .
the latter usually hum the airs while they are being <name> , so that their neighbors may perceive that they have been to operas before .
the funerals of these do not occur often enough .
a gentle , <unk> person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat right in front of us that night at the <unk> opera .
these people talked , between the acts , and i understood them , though i understood nothing that was uttered on the distant stage .
at first they were guarded in their talk , but after they had heard my agent and me conversing in english they dropped their reserve and i picked up many of their little confidences ; no , i mean many of her little confidences  meaning the elder party  for the young girl only listened , and gave <unk> nods , but never said a word .
how pretty she was , and how sweet she was !
i wished she would speak .
but evidently she was absorbed in her own thoughts , her own <unk> dreams , and found a dearer pleasure in silence .
but she was not dreaming sleepy dreams  no , she was awake , alive , alert , she could not sit still a moment .
she was an enchanting study .
her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung to her round young figure like a fish 's skin , and it was rippled over with the <unk> little <unk> films of lace ; she had deep , tender eyes , with long , curved lashes ; and she had <unk> cheeks , and a dimpled <name> , and such a dear little <unk> of a mouth ; and she was so <unk> , so pure , and so gracious , so sweet and so bewitching .
for long hours i did mightily wish she would speak .
and at last she did ; the red lips parted , and out leaps her thought  and with such a guileless and pretty enthusiasm , too : " auntie , i just know i 've got five hundred fleas on me ! "
that was probably over the average .
yes , it must have been very much over the average .
the average at that time in the grand duchy of <unk> was forty-five to a young person ( when alone ) , according to the official estimate of the home secretary for that year ; the average for older people was shifty and <unk> , for whenever a wholesome young girl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their average and raised her own .
she became a sort of <unk> .
this dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there unconsciously taking up a collection .
many a skinny old being in our neighborhood was the happier and the <unk> for her coming .
in that large audience , that night , there were eight very conspicuous people .
these were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on .
what a blessed thing it would be if a <name> could make herself conspicuous in our theaters by wearing her hat .
it is not usual in europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets , hats , overcoats , canes , or umbrellas into the <unk> , but in <unk> this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely made up of people from a distance , and among these were always a few timid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to get their things when the play was over , they would miss their train .
but the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk and took the chances , preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good manners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a stretch of three or four hours .
chapter x [ how wagner operas bang along ] three or four hours .
that is a long time to sit in one place , whether one be conspicuous or not , yet some of wagner 's operas bang along for six whole hours on a stretch !
but the people sit there and enjoy it all , and wish it would last longer .
a <name> <name> in munich told me that a person could not like wagner 's music at first , but must go through the deliberate process of learning to like it  then he would have his sure reward ; for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and never be able to get enough of it .
she said that six hours of wagner was by no means too much .
she said that this <unk> had made a complete revolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one .
and she said that wagner 's operas differed from all others in one notable respect , and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here and there , but were all music , from the first strain to the last .
this surprised me .
i said i had attended one of his insurrections , and found hardly any music in it except the wedding chorus .
she said " <unk> " was <unk> than wagner 's other operas , but that if i would keep on going to see it i would find by and by that it was all music , and therefore would then enjoy it .
i could have said , " but would you advise a person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit of his stomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to enjoy it ? "
but i reserved that remark .
this <name> was full of the praises of the <unk> who had performed in a wagner opera the night before , and went on to enlarge upon his old and prodigious fame , and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the princely houses of germany .
here was another surprise .
i had attended that very opera , in the person of my agent , and had made close and accurate observations .
so i said : " why , madam , my experience <unk> me in stating that that <unk> voice is not a voice at all , but only a shriek  the shriek of a hyena . "
" that is very true , " she said ; " he can not sing now ; it is already many years that he has lost his voice , but in other times he sang , yes , divinely !
so whenever he comes now , you shall see , yes , that the theater <name> not hold the people .
<unk> bei gott !
his voice is <unk> in that past time . "
i said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the germans which was worth <unk> .
i said that over the water we were not quite so generous ; that with us , when a singer had lost his voice and a <unk> had lost his legs , these parties ceased to draw .
i said i had been to the opera in hanover , once , and in <unk> once , and in munich ( through my authorized agent ) once , and this large experience had nearly persuaded me that the germans preferred singers who could n't sing .
this was not such a very extravagant speech , either , for that burly <unk> tenor 's praises had been the talk of all heidelberg for a week before his performance took place  yet his voice was like the distressing noise which a nail makes when you <unk> it across a <unk> .
i said so to heidelberg friends the next day , and they said , in the <unk> and simplest way , that that was very true , but that in earlier times his voice had been wonderfully fine .
and the tenor in hanover was just another example of this sort .
the english-speaking <name> gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that tenor .
he said : " ach gott !
a great man !
you shall see him .
he is so celebrate in all germany  and he has a pension , yes , from the government .
he not obliged to sing now , only twice every year ; but if he not sing twice each year they take him his pension away . "
very well , we went .
when the renowned old tenor appeared , i got a <unk> and an excited whisper : " now you see him ! "
but the " celebrate " was an astonishing disappointment to me .
if he had been behind a screen i should have supposed they were performing a surgical operation on him .
i looked at my friend  to my great surprise he seemed intoxicated with pleasure , his eyes were dancing with eager delight .
when the curtain at last fell , he burst into the <unk> applause , and kept it up  as did the whole house  until the <unk> tenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow .
while the glowing enthusiast was <unk> the perspiration from his face , i said : " i do n't mean the least harm , but really , now , do you think he can sing ? "
" him ?
no !
gott im <unk> , aber , how he has been able to sing twenty-five years ago ? "
[ then pensively . ]
" ach , no , now he not sing any more , he only cry .
when he think he sing , now , he not sing at all , no , he only make like a cat which is unwell . "
where and how did we get the idea that the germans are a stolid , <unk> race ?
in truth , they are widely removed from that .
they are <unk> , emotional , impulsive , enthusiastic , their tears come at the <unk> touch , and it is not hard to move them to laughter .
they are the very children of impulse .
we are cold and self-contained , compared to the germans .
they hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing ; and where we use one loving , petting expression , they pour out a score .
their language is full of endearing <unk> ; nothing that they love escapes the application of a petting diminutive  neither the house , nor the dog , nor the horse , nor the grandmother , nor any other creature , animate or inanimate .
in the theaters at hanover , hamburg , and <unk> , they had a wise custom .
the moment the curtain went up , the light in the body of the house went down .
the audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight , which greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage .
it saved gas , too , and people were not sweated to death .
when i saw " king lear " played , nobody was allowed to see a scene shifted ; if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the way and expose a <name> beyond , one did not see that forest split itself in the middle and go shrieking away , with the accompanying <unk> spectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulse  no , the curtain was always dropped for an instant  one heard not the least movement behind it  but when it went up , the next instant , the forest was gone .
even when the stage was being entirely <unk> , one heard no noise .
during the whole time that " king lear " was playing the curtain was never down two minutes at any one time .
the orchestra played until the curtain was ready to go up for the first time , then they departed for the evening .
where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is no occasion for music .
i had never seen this <unk> business between acts but once before , and that was when the " <unk> " was played at <unk> 's .
i was at a concert in munich one night , the people were streaming in , the <unk> pointed to seven , the music struck up , and instantly all movement in the body of the house ceased  nobody was standing , or walking up the aisles , or fumbling with a seat , the stream of <unk> had suddenly dried up at its source .
i listened undisturbed to a piece of music that was fifteen minutes long  always expecting some tardy <unk> to come crowding past my knees , and being continuously and pleasantly disappointed  but when the last note was struck , here came the stream again .
you see , they had made those late comers wait in the comfortable <unk> from the time the music had begun until it was ended .
it was the first time i had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the privilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters .
some of these were pretty fine birds , but no matter , they had to tarry outside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of <unk> footmen and <unk> who supported the two walls with their backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and <unk> on their arms .
we had no footmen to hold our things , and it was not <unk> to take them into the <unk> ; but there were some men and women to take charge of them for us .
they gave us checks for them and charged a fixed price , payable in advance  five cents .
in germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet been heard in <name> , perhaps  i mean the closing strain of a fine <unk> or <unk> .
we always smash into it with an earthquake of applause .
the result is that we <name> ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat ; we get the whiskey , but we do n't get the sugar in the bottom of the glass .
our way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be better than the <unk> way of saving it all up till the act is ended .
i do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion before a cold still audience .
i should think he would feel foolish .
it is a pain to me to this day , to remember how that old <name> lear raged and wept and howled around the stage , with never a response from that hushed house , never a single outburst till the act was ended .
to me there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead silences that always followed this old person 's tremendous <unk> of his feelings .
i could not help putting myself in his place  i thought i knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences , because i remembered a case which came under my observation once , and which  but i <name> tell the incident : one evening on board a mississippi steamboat , a boy of ten years lay asleep in a berth  a long , <unk> boy , he was , encased in quite a short shirt ; it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a steamboat , and so he was troubled , and scared , and had gone to bed with his head filled with impending <unk> , and explosions , and conflagrations , and sudden death .
about ten o'clock some twenty ladies were sitting around about the ladies ' saloon , quietly reading , sewing , <unk> , and so on , and among them sat a sweet , benignant old dame with round spectacles on her nose and her busy <unk> in her hands .
now all of a sudden , into the midst of this peaceful scene burst that <unk> boy in the brief shirt , <unk> , <unk> , and shouting , " fire , fire !
jump and run , the boat 's afire and there ai n't a minute to lose ! "
all those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled , nobody stirred , the old <name> pulled her spectacles down , looked over them , and said , gently : " but you must n't catch cold , child .
run and put on your <unk> , and then come and tell us all about it . "
it was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devil 's gushing vehemence .
he was expecting to be a sort of hero  the creator of a wild panic  and here everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile , and an old woman made fun of his <unk> .
i turned and crept away  for i was that boy  and never even cared to discover whether i had dreamed the fire or actually seen it .
i am told that in a <name> concert or opera , they hardly ever encore a song ; that though they may be dying to hear it again , their good breeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition .
kings may encore ; that is quite another matter ; it delights everybody to see that the king is pleased ; and as to the actor <unk> , his pride and gratification are simply boundless .
still , there are circumstances in which even a <name> encore  but it is better to illustrate .
the king of <unk> is a poet , and has a poet 's eccentricities  with the advantage over all other poets of being able to gratify them , no matter what form they may take .
he is fond of opera , but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience ; therefore , it has sometimes occurred , in munich , that when an opera has been concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery , a command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again .
presently the king would arrive , solitary and alone , and the players would begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with only that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience .
once he took an odd freak into his head .
high up and out of sight , over the prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of <unk> <unk> , so pierced that in case of fire , innumerable little <unk> streams of water can be caused to descend ; and in case of need , this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood .
american managers might want to make a note of that .
the king was sole audience .
the opera proceeded , it was a piece with a storm in it ; the mimic thunder began to mutter , the mimic wind began to wail and <unk> , and the mimic rain to patter .
the king 's interest rose higher and higher ; it developed into enthusiasm .
he cried out : " it is very , very good , indeed !
but i <name> have real rain !
turn on the water ! "
the manager pleaded for a reversal of the command ; said it would ruin the costly scenery and the splendid costumes , but the king cried : " no matter , no matter , i <name> have real rain !
turn on the water ! "
so the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances to the mimic flower-beds and gravel walks of the stage .
the richly dressed <unk> and actors tripped about singing bravely and pretending not to mind it .
the king was delighted  his enthusiasm grew higher .
he cried out : " bravo , bravo !
more thunder !
more lightning !
turn on more rain ! "
the thunder boomed , the lightning glared , the <unk> raged , the deluge poured down .
the mimic royalty on the stage , with their soaked <unk> clinging to their bodies , <unk> about <unk> in water , <unk> their sweetest and best , the <unk> under the eaves of the stage sawed away for dear life , with the cold overflow spouting down the backs of their necks , and the dry and happy king sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding .
" more yet ! "
cried the king ; " more yet  let loose all the thunder , turn on all the water !
i <name> <name> the man that raises an umbrella ! "
when this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been produced in any theater was at last over , the king 's approbation was measureless .
he cried : " magnificent , magnificent !
encore !
do it again ! "
but the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore , and said the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented in the mere fact that the encore was desired by his majesty , without fatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity .
during the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose parts required changes of dress ; the others were a soaked , <unk> , and uncomfortable lot , but in the last degree picturesque .
the stage scenery was ruined , <unk> were so swollen that they would n't work for a week afterward , the fine costumes were spoiled , and no end of minor damages were done by that remarkable storm .
it was a <name> idea  that storm  and royally carried out .
but observe the moderation of the king ; he did not insist upon his encore .
if he had been a <unk> , <unk> american <unk> , he probably would have had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those people .
chapter xi [ i paint a " turner " ] the summer days passed pleasantly in heidelberg .
we had a skilled <unk> , and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the right condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours ; we were well satisfied with the progress which we had made in the <name> language , [ 1 .
see appendix d for information concerning this fearful tongue . ]
and more than satisfied with what we had accomplished in <name> .
we had had the best instructors in drawing and painting in germany  <unk> , <unk> , mueller , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> taught us <unk> .
<unk> taught us <unk> , mueller taught us to do <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> gave us a finishing course in two <unk>  <unk> and <unk> .
whatever i am in <name> i owe to these men .
i have something of the manner of each and all of them ; but they all said that i had also a manner of my own , and that it was conspicuous .
they said there was a marked individuality about my style  insomuch that if i ever painted the commonest type of a dog , i should be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which would keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist .
secretly i wanted to believe all these kind sayings , but i could not ; i was afraid that my masters ' partiality for me , and pride in me , <unk> their judgment .
so i resolved to make a test .
privately , and unknown to any one , i painted my great picture , " heidelberg castle illuminated "  my first really important work in oils  and had it <name> up in the midst of a wilderness of <unk> in the <name> exhibition , with no name attached to it .
to my great gratification it was instantly recognized as mine .
all the town flocked to see it , and people even came from neighboring localities to visit it .
it made more stir than any other work in the exhibition .
but the most gratifying thing of all was , that chance strangers , passing through , who had not heard of my picture , were not only drawn to it , as by a <unk> , the moment they entered the gallery , but always took it for a " turner . "
apparently nobody had ever done that .
there were ruined castles on the overhanging cliffs and crags all the way ; these were said to have their legends , like those on the rhine , and what was better still , they had never been in print .
there was nothing in the books about that lovely region ; it had been neglected by the tourist , it was virgin soil for the literary pioneer .
meantime the knapsacks , the rough <unk> and the stout <unk> which we had ordered , were finished and brought to us .
a mr. x and a young mr. z had agreed to go with us .
we went around one evening and bade good-by to our friends , and afterward had a little farewell banquet at the hotel .
we got to bed early , for we wanted to make an early start , so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning .
we were out of bed at break of day , feeling fresh and vigorous , and took a hearty breakfast , then plunged down through the leafy <unk> of the castle grounds , toward the town .
what a glorious summer morning it was , and how the flowers did pour out their fragrance , and how the birds did sing !
it was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains .
we were all dressed alike : broad slouch hats , to keep the sun off ; gray knapsacks ; blue army shirts ; blue <unk> ; leathern gaiters buttoned tight from knee down to ankle ; <unk> coarse shoes snugly laced .
each man had an <unk> , a canteen , and a guide-book case slung over his shoulder , and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a <unk> in the other .
around our hats were wound many folds of soft white muslin , with the ends hanging and flapping down our backs  an idea brought from the orient and used by tourists all over europe .
<name> carried the little <unk> machine called a " <unk> , " whose office is to keep count of a man 's steps and tell how far he has walked .
everybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty " pleasant march to you ! "
when we got downtown i found that we could go by rail to within five miles of <unk> .
the train was just starting , so we jumped aboard and went tearing away in splendid spirits .
it was agreed all around that we had done wisely , because it would be just as enjoyable to walk down the neckar as up it , and it could not be needful to walk both ways .
there were some nice <name> people in our compartment .
i got to talking some pretty private matters presently , and <name> became nervous ; so he nudged me and said : " speak in <name>  these germans may understand english . "
i did so , it was well i did ; for it turned out that there was not a <name> in that party who did not understand english perfectly .
it is curious how <unk> our language is in germany .
after a while some of those folks got out and a <name> gentleman and his two young daughters got in .
i spoke in <name> of one of the latter several times , but without result .
finally she said : " ich <unk> nur <unk> und <unk> , "  or words to that effect .
that is , " i do n't understand any language but <name> and english . "
and sure enough , not only she but her father and sister spoke english .
so after that we had all the talk we wanted ; and we wanted a good deal , for they were agreeable people .
they were greatly interested in our customs ; especially the alpenstocks , for they had not seen any before .
they said that the neckar road was perfectly level , so we must be going to switzerland or some other rugged country ; and asked us if we did not find the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather .
but we said no .
we reached <unk>  i think it was <unk>  in about three hours , and got out , not the least tired ; found a good hotel and ordered beer and dinner  then took a stroll through the venerable old village .
it was very picturesque and <unk> , and dirty and interesting .
it had queer houses five hundred years old in it , and a military tower 115 feet high , which had stood there more than ten centuries .
i made a little sketch of it .
i kept a copy , but gave the original to the burgomaster .
i think the original was better than the copy , because it had more windows in it and the grass stood up better and had a <unk> look .
there was none around the tower , though ; i composed the grass myself , from studies i made in a field by heidelberg in <unk> 's time .
the man on top , looking at the view , is apparently too large , but i found he could not be made smaller , conveniently .
i wanted him there , and i wanted him visible , so i thought out a way to manage it ; i composed the picture from two points of view ; the spectator is to observe the man from <unk> where that flag is , and he must observe the tower itself from the ground .
this <unk> the seeming discrepancy .
[ figure 2 ] near an old cathedral , under a shed , were three crosses of stone  <unk> and damaged things , bearing <unk> stone figures .
the two thieves were dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the sixteenth century , while the saviour was <unk> , with the exception of a cloth around the loins .
we had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel and overlooking the neckar ; then , after a smoke , we went to bed .
we had a refreshing nap , then got up about three in the afternoon and put on our <unk> .
as we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town , we overtook a peasant 's cart , partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages and similar vegetable rubbish , and drawn by a small cow and a smaller donkey yoked together .
it was a pretty slow concern , but it got us into <unk> before dark  five miles , or possibly it was seven .
we stopped at the very same inn which the famous old <unk> and rough fighter <unk> <name> <unk> , abode in after he got out of captivity in the square tower of <unk> between three hundred and fifty and four hundred years ago .
<name> and i occupied the same room which he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the walls yet .
the furniture was quaint old carved stuff , full four hundred years old , and some of the smells were over a thousand .
there was a hook in the wall , which the landlord said the terrific old <unk> used to <name> his iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed .
this room was very large  it might be called immense  and it was on the first floor ; which means it was in the second story , for in europe the houses are so high that they do not count the first story , else they would get tired climbing before they got to the top .
the <unk> was a fiery red , with huge gold figures in it , well <unk> by time , and it covered all the doors .
these doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the paper so <unk> , that when they were closed one had to go feeling and searching along the wall to find them .
there was a stove in the corner  one of those tall , square , stately white porcelain things that looks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to be enjoying your travels .
the windows looked out on a little alley , and over that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of some <unk> .
there were the customary two beds in the room , one in one end , the other in the other , about an old-fashioned <unk> , <unk> <unk> apart .
they were fully as narrow as the usual <name> bed , too , and had the <name> <unk> ineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you forgot yourself and went to sleep .
a round table as large as king <name> 's stood in the center of the room ; while the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we all went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal buildings .
chapter xii [ what the wives saved ] the <unk> , or municipal building , is of the <unk> and most picturesque <unk> architecture .
it has a massive portico and steps , before it , heavily <unk> , and adorned with <unk> <name> iron knights in complete armor .
the <unk> on the front of the building is very large and of curious pattern .
ordinarily , a gilded <name> strikes the hour on a big <name> with a hammer ; as the striking ceases , a <unk> figure of time raises its <unk> and turns it ; two golden rams advance and butt each other ; a gilded cock lifts its wings ; but the main features are two great angels , who stand on each side of the dial with long horns at their lips ; it was said that they blew melodious blasts on these horns every hour  but they did not do it for us .
we were told , later , that they blew only at night , when the town was still .
within the <unk> were a number of huge wild boars ' heads , preserved , and mounted on brackets along the wall ; they bore inscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it was done .
one room in the building was devoted to the preservation of ancient archives .
there they showed us no end of aged documents ; some were signed by popes , some by <unk> and other great generals , and one was a letter written and subscribed by <unk> <name> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> just after his release from the square tower .
this fine old <unk> was a devoutly and sincerely religious man , hospitable , charitable to the poor , fearless in fight , active , enterprising , and possessed of a large and generous nature .
he had in him a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries , and being able to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly <unk> the authors of them .
he was prompt to take up any poor <unk> quarrel and risk his neck to right him .
the common folk held him dear , and his memory is still green in ballad and tradition .
he used to go on the highway and <name> <name> <unk> ; and other times he would swoop down from his high castle on the hills of the neckar and capture passing cargoes of merchandise .
in his memoirs he piously thanks the giver of all good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such cargoes into his hands at times when only special <unk> could have relieved him .
he was a doughty warrior and found a deep <name> in battle .
in an assault upon a stronghold in <unk> when he was only twenty-three years old , his right hand was shot away , but he was so interested in the fight that he did not observe it for a while .
he said that the iron hand which was made for him afterward , and which he wore for more than half a century , was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been .
i was glad to get a <unk> of the letter written by this fine old <name> <name> hood , though i was not able to read it .
he was a better artist with his sword than with his pen .
we went down by the river and saw the square tower .
it was a very venerable structure , very strong , and very ornamental .
there was no opening near the ground .
they had to use a ladder to get into it , no doubt .
we visited the principal church , also  a curious old structure , with a <unk> spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images .
the inner walls of the church were <unk> with large <unk> tablets of copper , bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old <unk> <unk> of two or three centuries ago , and also bearing rudely painted effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer costumes of those days .
the head of the family sat in the foreground , and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons ; facing him sat his wife , and beyond her extended a low row of diminishing daughters .
the family was usually large , but the perspective bad .
then we hired the hack and the horse which <unk> <name> <unk> used to use , and drove several miles into the country to visit the place called <unk>  wife 's fidelity i suppose it means .
it was a feudal castle of the middle ages .
when we reached its neighborhood we found it was beautifully situated , but on top of a mound , or hill , round and tolerably steep , and about two hundred feet high .
therefore , as the sun was blazing hot , we did not climb up there , but took the place on trust , and observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a fence and rested .
the place has no interest except that which is lent it by its legend , which is a very pretty one  to this effect : the legend in the middle ages , a couple of young dukes , brothers , took opposite sides in one of the wars , the one fighting for the emperor , the other against him .
one of them owned the castle and village on top of the mound which i have been speaking of , and in his absence his brother came with his knights and soldiers and began a siege .
it was a long and tedious business , for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense .
but at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work ; more fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy .
they by and by surrendered , and begged for charitable terms .
but the <unk> <name> was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he said he would spare none but the women and children  all men should be put to the sword without exception , and all their goods destroyed .
then the women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their husbands .
" no , " said the <name> , " not a man of them shall escape alive ; you yourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless banishment ; but that you may not starve i <name> you this one <name> , that each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most valuable property as she is able to <name> . "
very well , presently the gates swung open and out filed those women carrying their husbands on their shoulders .
the besiegers , furious at the trick , rushed forward to slaughter the men , but the duke stepped between and said : " no , put up your swords  a <name> 's word is inviolable . "
when we got back to the hotel , king <name> 's round table was ready for us in its white drapery , and the head waiter and his first assistant , in <unk> and white <unk> , brought in the soup and the hot plates at once .
mr. x had ordered the dinner , and when the wine came on , he picked up a bottle , glanced at the label , and then turned to the grave , the melancholy , the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of wine he had asked for .
the head waiter picked up the bottle , cast his <unk> on it and said : " it is true ; i beg pardon . "
then he turned on his subordinate and calmly said , " bring another label . "
at the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it aside ; it had been newly put on , its paste was still wet .
when the new label came , he put it on ; our french wine being now turned into <name> wine , according to <name> , the head waiter went blandly about his other duties , as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy thing to him .
mr. x said he had not known , before , that there were people honest enough to do this miracle in public , but he was aware that thousands upon thousands of labels were imported into <name> from europe every year , to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and <unk> way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might require .
we took a turn around the town , after dinner , and found it fully as interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime .
the streets were narrow and roughly paved , and there was not a sidewalk or a <unk> anywhere .
the dwellings were centuries old , and vast enough for hotels .
they widened all the way up ; the stories projected further and further forward and aside as they ascended , and the long rows of lighted windows , filled with little bits of panes , curtained with figured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers , made a pretty effect .
the moon was bright , and the light and shadow very strong ; and nothing could be more picturesque than those curving streets , with their rows of huge high <unk> leaning far over toward each other in a friendly gossiping way , and the crowds below drifting through the alternating <unk> of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight .
nearly everybody was abroad , chatting , singing , romping , or massed in lazy comfortable attitudes in the doorways .
in one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a thick , <name> chain , which <unk> from post to post in a succession of low swings .
the pavement , here , was made of heavy blocks of stone .
in the glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on those chains and having a noisy good time .
they were not the first ones who have done that ; even their <unk> had not been the first to do it when they were children .
the strokes of the bare feet had worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags ; it had taken many generations of swinging children to accomplish that .
everywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity , and evidence of it ; but i do not know that anything else gave us so vivid a sense of the old age of <unk> as those <unk> grooves in the <unk> .
chapter xiii [ my long crawl in the dark ] when we got back to the hotel i wound and set the <unk> and put it in my pocket , for i was to <name> it next day and keep record of the miles we made .
the work which we had given the instrument to do during the day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly .
we were in bed by ten , for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp homeward with the <name> .
i <name> fire , but <name> went to sleep at once .
i hate a man who goes to sleep at once ; there is a sort of indefinable something about it which is not exactly an insult , and yet is an insolence ; and one which is hard to bear , too .
i lay there fretting over this injury , and trying to go to sleep ; but the harder i tried , the wider awake i grew .
i got to feeling very lonely in the dark , with no company but an <unk> dinner .
my mind got a start by and by , and began to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been thought of ; but it never went further than the beginning ; it was touch and go ; it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed .
at the end of an hour my head was in a perfect whirl and i was dead tired , fagged out .
the fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head against the nervous excitement ; while imagining myself wide awake , i would really doze into momentary unconsciousness , and come suddenly out of it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apart  the delusion of the instant being that i was tumbling backward over a precipice .
after i had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus found out that one half of my <name> had been asleep eight or nine times without the wide-awake , hard-working other half suspecting it , the periodical <unk> began to extend their spell gradually over more of my <unk> , and at last i sank into a <unk> which grew deeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a solid , blessed <unk> stupor , when  what was that ?
my dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a receptive attitude .
now out of an immense , a limitless distance , came a something which grew and grew , and approached , and presently was recognizable as a sound  it had rather seemed to be a feeling , before .
this sound was a mile away , now  perhaps it was the murmur of a storm ; and now it was nearer  not a quarter of a mile away ; was it the muffled rasping and grinding of distant machinery ?
no , it came still nearer ; was it the measured tramp of a marching troop ?
but it came nearer still , and still nearer  and at last it was right in the room : it was merely a mouse gnawing the woodwork .
so i had held my breath all that time for such a trifle .
well , what was done could not be helped ; i would go to sleep at once and make up the lost time .
that was a thoughtless thought .
without intending it  hardly knowing it  i fell to listening intently to that sound , and even unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouse 's <unk> .
presently i was <unk> exquisite suffering from this employment , yet maybe i could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to his work ; but he did not do that ; he stopped every now and then , and i suffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than i did while he was gnawing .
along at first i was mentally offering a reward of five  six  seven  ten  dollars for that mouse ; but toward the last i was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means .
i <unk> my ears  that is to say , i bent the <unk> of them down and furled them into five or six folds , and pressed them against the <unk>  but it did no good : the faculty was so sharpened by nervous excitement that it was become a <unk> and could hear through the <unk> without trouble .
my anger grew to a frenzy .
i finally did what all persons before me have done , clear back to <name> ,  resolved to throw something .
i reached down and got my <unk> , then sat up in bed and listened , in order to exactly locate the noise .
but i could n't do it ; it was as <unk> as a cricket 's noise ; and where one thinks that that is , is always the very place where it is n't .
so i presently hurled a shoe at random , and with a vicious vigor .
it struck the wall over <name> 's head and fell down on him ; i had not imagined i could throw so far .
it woke <name> , and i was glad of it until i found he was not angry ; then i was sorry .
he soon went to sleep again , which pleased me ; but straightway the mouse began again , which roused my temper once more .
i did not want to wake <name> a second time , but the gnawing continued until i was compelled to throw the other shoe .
this time i broke a mirror  there were two in the room  i got the largest one , of course .
<name> woke again , but did not complain , and i was <unk> than ever .
i resolved that i would suffer all possible torture before i would disturb him a third time .
the mouse eventually retired , and by and by i was sinking to sleep , when a clock began to strike ; i counted till it was done , and was about to <unk> again when another clock began ; i counted ; then the two great <unk> clock angels began to send forth soft , <name> , melodious blasts from their long trumpets .
i had never heard anything that was so lovely , or weird , or mysterious  but when they got to blowing the <unk> , they seemed to me to be <unk> the thing .
every time i dropped off for the moment , a new noise woke me .
each time i woke i missed my <unk> , and had to reach down to the floor and get it again .
at last all <unk> forsook me .
i recognized the fact that i was hopelessly and permanently wide awake .
wide awake , and feverish and thirsty .
when i had lain tossing there as long as i could endure it , it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain , and smoke and reflect there until the remnant of the night was gone .
i believed i could dress in the dark without waking <name> .
i had banished my shoes after the mouse , but my slippers would do for a summer night .
so i rose softly , and gradually got on everything  down to one sock .
i could n't seem to get on the track of that sock , any way i could fix it .
but i had to have it ; so i went down on my hands and knees , with one slipper on and the other in my hand , and began to paw gently around and rake the floor , but with no success .
i enlarged my circle , and went on pawing and raking .
with every pressure of my knee , how the floor creaked !
and every time i chanced to rake against any article , it seemed to give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would have done in the daytime .
in those cases i always stopped and held my breath till i was sure <name> had not awakened  then i crept along again .
i moved on and on , but i could not find the sock ; i could not seem to find anything but furniture .
i could not remember that there was much furniture in the room when i went to bed , but the place was alive with it now  especially chairs  chairs everywhere  had a couple of families moved in , in the mean time ?
and i never could seem to glance on one of those chairs , but always struck it full and square with my head .
my temper rose , by steady and sure degrees , and as i pawed on and on , i fell to making vicious comments under my breath .
finally , with a venomous access of irritation , i said i would leave without the sock ; so i rose up and made straight for the door  as i supposed  and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken mirror .
it startled the breath out of me , for an instant ; it also showed me that i was lost , and had no sort of idea where i was .
when i realized this , i was so angry that i had to sit down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of opinion .
if there had been only one mirror , it might possibly have helped to locate me ; but there were two , and two were as bad as a thousand ; besides , these were on opposite sides of the room .
i could see the dim blur of the windows , but in my <unk> condition they were exactly where they ought not to be , and so they only confused me instead of helping me .
i started to get up , and knocked down an umbrella ; it made a noise like a <unk> when it struck that hard , slick , <unk> floor ; i grated my teeth and held my breath  <name> did not stir .
i set the umbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall , but as soon as i took my hand away , its heel slipped from under it , and down it came again with another bang .
i shrunk together and listened a moment in silent fury  no harm done , everything quiet .
with the most painstaking care and nicety , i stood the umbrella up once more , took my hand away , and down it came again .
i have been strictly reared , but if it had not been so dark and solemn and awful there in that lonely , vast room , i do believe i should have said something then which could not be put into a sunday-school book without injuring the sale of it .
if my reasoning powers had not been already <unk> dry by my <unk> , i would have known better than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy <name> floors in the dark ; it ca n't be done in the daytime without four failures to one success .
i had one comfort , though  <name> was yet still and silent  he had not stirred .
the umbrella could not locate me  there were four standing around the room , and all alike .
i thought i would feel along the wall and find the door in that way .
i rose up and began this operation , but raked down a picture .
it was not a large one , but it made noise enough for a panorama .
<name> gave out no sound , but i felt that if i experimented any further with the pictures i should be sure to wake him .
better give up trying to get out .
yes , i would find king <name> 's round table once more  i had already found it several times  and use it for a base of departure on an exploring tour for my bed ; if i could find my bed i could then find my water pitcher ; i would <unk> my raging thirst and turn in .
so i started on my hands and knees , because i could go faster that way , and with more confidence , too , and not knock down things .
by and by i found the table  with my head  rubbed the bruise a little , then rose up and started , with hands abroad and fingers spread , to balance myself .
i found a chair ; then a wall ; then another chair ; then a sofa ; then an alpenstock , then another sofa ; this confounded me , for i had thought there was only one sofa .
i hunted up the table again and took a fresh start ; found some more chairs .
it occurred to me , now , as it ought to have done before , that as the table was round , it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from ; so i moved off once more , and at random among the wilderness of chairs and sofas  wandering off into unfamiliar regions , and presently knocked a candlestick and knocked off a lamp , grabbed at the lamp and knocked off a water pitcher with a rattling crash , and thought to myself , " i 've found you at last  i judged i was close upon you . "
<name> shouted " murder , " and " thieves , " and finished with " i 'm absolutely drowned . "
the crash had roused the house .
mr. x pranced in , in his long <unk> , with a candle , young z after him with another candle ; a procession swept in at another door , with candles and lanterns  landlord and two <name> guests in their <unk> and a chambermaid in hers .
i looked around ; i was at <name> 's bed , a <unk> 's journey from my own .
there was only one sofa ; it was against the wall ; there was only one chair where a body could get at it  i had been revolving around it like a planet , and <unk> with it like a comet half the night .
i explained how i had been employing myself , and why .
then the landlord 's party left , and the rest of us set about our preparations for breakfast , for the <name> was ready to break .
i glanced furtively at my <unk> , and found i had made 47 miles .
but i did not care , for i had come out for a pedestrian tour anyway .
chapter xiv [ <unk> down the neckar ] when the landlord learned that i and my agents were artists , our party rose perceptibly in his esteem ; we rose still higher when he learned that we were making a pedestrian tour of europe .
he told us all about the heidelberg road , and which were the best places to avoid and which the best ones to tarry at ; he charged me less than cost for the things i broke in the night ; he put up a fine luncheon for us and added to it a quantity of great <unk> plums , the pleasantest fruit in germany ; he was so anxious to do us honor that he would not allow us to walk out of <unk> , but called up <unk> <name> <unk> 's horse and cab and made us ride .
i made a sketch of the turnout .
it is not a work , it is only what artists call a " study "  a thing to make a finished picture from .
this sketch has several <unk> in it ; for instance , the wagon is not traveling as fast as the horse is .
this is wrong .
again , the person trying to get out of the way is too small ; he is out of perspective , as we say .
the two upper lines are not the horse 's back , they are the reigns ; there seems to be a wheel missing  this would be corrected in a finished work , of course .
this thing flying out behind is not a flag , it is a curtain .
that other thing up there is the sun , but i did n't get enough distance on it .
i do not remember , now , what that thing is that is in front of the man who is running , but i think it is a haystack or a woman .
this study was exhibited in the <name> salon of 1879 , but did not take any medal ; they do not give medals for studies .
we discharged the carriage at the bridge .
the river was full of logs  long , slender , <unk> pine logs  and we leaned on the rails of the bridge , and watched the men put them together into rafts .
these rafts were of a shape and construction to suit the <unk> and extreme narrowness of the neckar .
they were from fifty to one hundred yards long , and they gradually <unk> from a <unk> breadth at their <unk> , to a <unk> breadth at their <unk> .
the main part of the steering is done at the bow , with a pole ; the <unk> breadth there furnishes room for only the steersman , for these little logs are not larger around than an average young <name> 's waist .
the connections of the several sections of the raft are slack and <unk> , so that the raft may be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the river .
the neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog across it , if he has one ; when it is also sharply curved in such places , the <unk> has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns .
the river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed  which is as much as thirty , and sometimes forty yards wide  but is split into three equal bodies of water , by stone dikes which throw the main volume , depth , and current into the central one .
in low water these neat <unk> dikes project four or five inches above the surface , like the comb of a submerged roof , but in high water they are overflowed .
a hatful of rain makes high water in the neckar , and a <unk> produces an overflow .
there are dikes abreast the <unk> hotel , and the current is violently swift at that point .
i used to sit for hours in my glass cage , watching the long , narrow rafts slip along through the central channel , grazing the <unk> dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the stone bridge below ; i watched them in this way , and lost all this time hoping to see one of them hit the <unk> and wreck itself sometime or other , but was always disappointed .
one was smashed there one morning , but i had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe , so i lost it .
while i was looking down upon the rafts that morning in <unk> , the <unk> spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me , and i said to my comrades : " i am going to heidelberg on a raft .
<name> you venture with me ? "
their faces paled a little , but they assented with as good a <name> as they could .
<name> wanted to cable his mother  thought it his duty to do that , as he was all she had in this world  so , while he attended to this , i went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain with a hearty " ahoy , <unk> ! "
which put us upon pleasant terms at once , and we entered upon business .
i said we were on a pedestrian tour to heidelberg , and would like to take passage with him .
i said this partly through young z , who spoke <name> very well , and partly through mr. x , who spoke it peculiarly .
i can understand <name> as well as the maniac that invented it , but i talk it best through an interpreter .
the captain hitched up his trousers , then shifted his quid thoughtfully .
presently he said just what i was expecting he would say  that he had no license to <name> passengers , and therefore was afraid the law would be after him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened .
so i chartered the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities on myself .
with a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove the cable short , then got the anchor home , and our bark moved off with a stately stride , and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour .
our party were grouped amidships .
at first the talk was a little gloomy , and ran mainly upon the shortness of life , the uncertainty of it , the perils which beset it , and the need and wisdom of being always prepared for the worst ; this shaded off into <unk> references to the dangers of the deep , and kindred matters ; but as the gray east began to redden and the mysterious solemnity and silence of the <name> to give place to the <unk> of the birds , the talk took a <unk> tone , and our spirits began to rise steadily .
germany , in the summer , is the perfection of the beautiful , but nobody has understood , and realized , and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of this soft and peaceful beauty unless he has <unk> down the neckar on a raft .
the motion of a raft is the needful motion ; it is gentle , and gliding , and smooth , and noiseless ; it <unk> down all feverish activities , it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience ; under its restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that harass the mind vanish away , and existence becomes a dream , a charm , a deep and tranquil ecstasy .
how it contrasts with hot and perspiring <unk> , and <name> and deafening railroad rush , and tedious jolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads !
we went slipping silently along , between the green and fragrant banks , with a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew , and grew , all the time .
sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind ; sometimes we had <name> hills on one hand , clothed densely with foliage to their tops , and on the other hand open levels blazing with poppies , or clothed in the <name> blue of the <unk> ; sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests , and sometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass , fresh and green and bright , a tireless charm to the eye .
and the birds !  they were everywhere ; they swept back and forth across the river constantly , and their jubilant music was never stilled .
it was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new morning , and gradually , patiently , lovingly , clothe it on with splendor after splendor , and <name> after <name> , till the miracle was complete .
how different is this <name> observed from a raft , from what it is when one observes it through the dingy windows of a <unk> in some wretched village while he <unk> a petrified sandwich and waits for the train .

the people often stepped aboard the raft , as we glided along the grassy shores , and <unk> with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or so , then stepped ashore again , refreshed by the ride .
only the men did this ; the women were too busy .
the women do all kinds of work on the continent .
they dig , they hoe , they reap , they sow , they bear monstrous burdens on their backs , they shove similar ones long distances on wheelbarrows , they drag the cart when there is no dog or <name> cow to drag it  and when there is , they assist the dog or cow .
age is no matter  the older the woman the stronger she is , apparently .
on the farm a woman 's duties are not defined  she does a little of everything ; but in the towns it is different , there she only does certain things , the men do the rest .
for instance , a hotel chambermaid has nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms , bring towels and candles , and fetch several tons of water up several flights of stairs , a hundred pounds at a time , in prodigious metal <unk> .
she does not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day , and she can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and closets when she is tired and needs a rest .
as the morning advanced and the weather grew hot , we took off our outside clothing and sat in a row along the edge of the raft and enjoyed the scenery , with our <unk> over our heads and our legs dangling in the water .
every now and then we plunged in and had a swim .
every projecting grassy cape had its joyous group of naked children , the boys to themselves and the girls to themselves , the latter usually in care of some motherly dame who sat in the shade of a tree with her knitting .
the little boys swam out to us , sometimes , but the little maids stood knee-deep in the water and stopped their splashing and frolicking to inspect the raft with their innocent eyes as it drifted by .
once we turned a corner suddenly and surprised a slender girl of twelve years or upward , just stepping into the water .
she had not time to run , but she did what answered just as well ; she promptly <name> a lithe young <name> bough athwart her white body with one hand , and then contemplated us with a simple and untroubled interest .
thus she stood while we glided by .
she was a pretty creature , and she and her <name> bough made a very pretty picture , and one which could not offend the modesty of the most fastidious spectator .
her white skin had a low bank of fresh green willows for background and effective contrast  for she stood against them  and above and out of them projected the eager faces and white shoulders of two smaller girls .
toward noon we heard the <unk> cry ,  " sail ho ! "
" where away ? "
shouted the captain .
" three points off the weather bow ! "
we ran forward to see the vessel .
it proved to be a steamboat  for they had begun to run a steamer up the neckar , for the first time in may .
she was a tug , and one of a very peculiar build and aspect .
i had often watched her from the hotel , and wondered how she propelled herself , for apparently she had no propeller or paddles .
she came churning along , now , making a deal of noise of one kind or another , and aggravating it every now and then by blowing a hoarse whistle .
she had nine <unk> hitched on behind and following after her in a long , slender rank .
we met her in a narrow place , between dikes , and there was hardly room for us both in the cramped passage .
as she went grinding and groaning by , we perceived the secret of her moving impulse .
she did not drive herself up the river with paddles or propeller , she pulled herself by hauling on a great chain .
this chain is laid in the bed of the river and is only fastened at the two ends .
it is seventy miles long .
it comes in over the boat 's bow , passes around a drum , and is <unk> out astern .
she pulls on that chain , and so drags herself up the river or down it .
she has neither bow or stern , strictly speaking , for she has a <unk> rudder on each end and she never turns around .
she uses both <unk> all the time , and they are powerful enough to enable her to turn to the right or the left and steer around curves , in spite of the strong resistance of the chain .
i would not have believed that that impossible thing could be done ; but i saw it done , and therefore i know that there is one impossible thing which can be done .
what miracle <name> man attempt next ?
we met many big <unk> on their way up , using sails , mule power , and profanity  a tedious and laborious business .
a wire rope led from the <unk> to the file of mules on the <unk> a hundred yards ahead , and by dint of much banging and swearing and urging , the detachment of drivers managed to get a speed of two or three miles an hour out of the mules against the stiff current .
the neckar has always been used as a canal , and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals ; but now that this steamboat is able , with a small crew and a bushel or so of coal , to take nine <unk> farther up the river in one hour than thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two , it is believed that the old-fashioned towing industry is on its death-bed .
a second steamboat began work in the neckar three months after the first one was put in service .
[ figure 4 ] at noon we stepped ashore and bought some bottled beer and got some chickens cooked , while the raft waited ; then we immediately put to sea again , and had our dinner while the beer was cold and the chickens hot .
there is no pleasanter place for such a meal than a raft that is gliding down the winding neckar past green meadows and wooded hills , and slumbering villages , and <unk> heights graced with crumbling towers and battlements .
in one place we saw a nicely dressed <name> gentleman without any spectacles .
before i could come to anchor he had got <unk> .
it was a great pity .
i so wanted to make a sketch of him .
the captain comforted me for my loss , however , by saying that the man was without any doubt a fraud who had spectacles , but kept them in his pocket in order to make himself conspicuous .
below <unk> we passed <unk> , <unk> <name> <unk> 's old castle .
it stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface of the river ; it has high <unk> walls enclosing trees , and a peaked tower about seventy-five feet high .
the steep hillside , from the castle clear down to the water 's edge , is terraced , and clothed thick with grape vines .
this is like farming a mansard roof .
all the <unk> along that part of the river which furnish the proper exposure , are given up to the grape .
that region is a great <unk> of rhine wines .
the germans are exceedingly fond of rhine wines ; they are put up in tall , slender bottles , and are considered a pleasant beverage .
one tells them from vinegar by the label .
the <unk> hill is to be <unk> , and the new railway <name> pass under the castle .
the cave of the <unk> two miles below <unk> castle is a cave in a low <name> , which the captain of the raft said had once been occupied by a beautiful heiress of <unk>  the <name> <name>  in the old times .
it was seven hundred years ago .
she had a number of <name> and <name> lovers and one poor and obscure one , sir <unk> <unk> .
with the native <unk> of the heroine of romance , she preferred the poor and obscure lover .
with the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance , the <name> <unk> of that day shut his daughter up in his <unk> keep , or his <unk> , or his <unk> , or some such place , and resolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from among her <name> and <name> lovers .
the latter visited her and persecuted her with their supplications , but without effect , for her heart was true to her poor despised crusader , who was fighting in the holy land .
finally , she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the <name> lovers no longer ; so one <name> night she escaped and went down the river and hid herself in the cave on the other side .
her father ransacked the country for her , but found not a trace of her .
as the days went by , and still no tidings of her came , his conscience began to torture him , and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet living and would return , he would oppose her no longer , she might marry whom she would .
the months dragged on , all <name> forsook the old man , he ceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures , he devoted himself to pious works , and longed for the deliverance of death .
now just at midnight , every night , the lost heiress stood in the mouth of her cave , arrayed in white robes , and sang a little love ballad which her crusader had made for her .
she judged that if he came home alive the superstitious peasants would tell him about the ghost that sang in the cave , and that as soon as they described the ballad he would know that none but he and she knew that song , therefore he would suspect that she was alive , and would come and find her .
as time went on , the people of the region became sorely distressed about the <unk> of the haunted cave .
it was said that ill luck of one kind or another always overtook any one who had the misfortune to hear that song .
eventually , every calamity that happened thereabouts was laid at the door of that music .
consequently , no boatmen would consent to pass the cave at night ; the peasants shunned the place , even in the daytime .
but the faithful girl sang on , night after night , month after month , and patiently waited ; her reward must come at last .
five years dragged by , and still , every night at midnight , the plaintive tones floated out over the silent land , while the distant boatmen and peasants thrust their fingers into their ears and shuddered out a prayer .
and now came the crusader home , bronzed and <unk> , but bringing a great and splendid fame to lay at the feet of his bride .
the old lord of <unk> received him as his son , and wanted him to stay by him and be the comfort and blessing of his age ; but the tale of that young girl 's devotion to him and its pathetic consequences made a changed man of the knight .
he could not enjoy his <unk> rest .
he said his heart was broken , he would give the remnant of his life to high deeds in the cause of humanity , and so find a worthy death and a blessed reunion with the brave true heart whose love had more honored him than all his victories in war .
when the people heard this resolve of his , they came and told him there was a pitiless dragon in human disguise in the haunted cave , a dread creature which no knight had yet been bold enough to face , and begged him to rid the land of its desolating presence .
he said he would do it .
they told him about the song , and when he asked what song it was , they said the memory of it was gone , for nobody had been hardy enough to listen to it for the past four years and more .
toward midnight the crusader came floating down the river in a boat , with his trusty <unk> in his hands .
he drifted silently through the dim reflections of the crags and trees , with his intent eyes fixed upon the low <name> which he was approaching .
as he <name> nearer , he discerned the black mouth of the cave .
now  is that a white figure ?
yes .
the plaintive song begins to well forth and float away over meadow and river  the <unk> is slowly raised to position , a steady aim is taken , the bolt flies straight to the <name>  the figure sinks down , still singing , the knight takes the wool out of his ears , and recognizes the old ballad  too late !
ah , if he had only not put the wool in his ears !
the crusader went away to the wars again , and presently fell in battle , fighting for the cross .
tradition says that during several centuries the spirit of the unfortunate girl sang nightly from the cave at midnight , but the music carried no curse with it ; and although many listened for the mysterious sounds , few were favored , since only those could hear them who had never failed in a trust .
it is believed that the singing still continues , but it is known that nobody has heard it during the present century .
chapter xvi an ancient legend of the rhine [ the <name> ] the last legend reminds one of the " <name> "  a legend of the rhine .
there is a song called " the <name> . "
germany is <name> in <unk> , and the words and airs of several of them are peculiarly beautiful  but " the <name> " is the people 's favorite .
i could not endure it at first , but by and by it began to take hold of me , and now there is no tune which i like so well .
it is not possible that it is much known in <name> , else i should have heard it there .
the fact that i never heard it there , is evidence that there are others in my country who have fared likewise ; therefore , for the sake of these , i mean to print the words and music in this chapter .
and i <name> refresh the reader 's memory by printing the legend of the <name> , too .
i have it by me in the legends of the rhine , done into english by the wildly gifted <unk> , bachelor of arts .
i print the legend partly to refresh my own memory , too , for i have never read it before .
the legend <name> ( two syllables ) was a water <unk> who used to sit on a high rock called the <unk> or <unk> ( pronounced like our word lie ) in the rhine , and lure boatmen to destruction in a furious rapid which marred the channel at that spot .
she so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her wonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze up at her , and so they presently drifted among the broken reefs and were lost .
in those old , old times , the count <name> lived in a great castle near there with his son , the count hermann , a youth of twenty .
hermann had heard a great deal about the beautiful <name> , and had finally fallen very deeply in love with her without having seen her .
so he used to wander to the neighborhood of the <unk> , evenings , with his <unk> and " express his longing in low singing , " as <unk> says .
on one of these occasions , " suddenly there hovered around the top of the rock a brightness of <unk> clearness and color , which , in increasingly smaller circles thickened , was the enchanting figure of the beautiful <name> .
" an unintentional cry of <name> escaped the youth , he let his <unk> fall , and with extended arms he called out the name of the <unk> being , who seemed to stoop lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly manner ; indeed , if his ear did not deceive him , she called his name with unutterable sweet whispers , proper to love .
beside himself with delight the youth lost his senses and sank senseless to the earth . "
after that he was a changed person .
he went dreaming about , thinking only of his <name> and caring for naught else in the world .
" the old count saw with affliction this <unk> in his son , " whose cause he could not divine , and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels , but to no purpose .
then the old count used authority .
he commanded the youth to <unk> himself to the camp .
obedience was promised .
<unk> says : " it was on the evening before his departure , as he wished still once to visit the <unk> and offer to the <unk> of the rhine his sighs , the tones of his <unk> , and his songs .
he went , in his boat , this time accompanied by a faithful squire , down the stream .
the moon shed her silvery light over the whole country ; the steep bank mountains appeared in the most <unk> shapes , and the high oaks on either side bowed their branches on hermann 's passing .
as soon as he approached the <unk> , and was aware of the <unk> , his attendant was seized with an inexpressible anxiety and he begged permission to land ; but the knight swept the strings of his guitar and sang : " once i saw thee in dark night , in supernatural beauty bright ; of <unk> , was the figure wove , to share its light , <unk> strove .
" thy garment color <unk> by thy hand the sign of love , thy eyes sweet enchantment , <unk> to me , oh !
enchantment .
" o , wert thou but my sweetheart , how willingly thy love to part !
with delight i should be bound to thy <name> house in deep ground . "
that hermann should have gone to that place at all , was not wise ; that he should have gone with such a song as that in his mouth was a most serious mistake .
the <name> did not " call his name in unutterable sweet whispers " this time .
no , that song naturally worked an instant and thorough " <unk> " in her ; and not only that , but it stirred the bowels of the whole afflicted region around about there  for  " scarcely had these tones sounded , everywhere there began tumult and sound , as if voices above and below the water .
on the <unk> rose flames , the <name> stood above , at that time , and beckoned with her right hand clearly and urgently to the infatuated knight , while with a staff in her left hand she called the waves to her service .
they began to mount heavenward ; the boat was upset , mocking every exertion ; the waves rose to the gunwale , and splitting on the hard stones , the boat broke into pieces .
the youth sank into the depths , but the squire was thrown on shore by a powerful wave . "
the bitterest things have been said about the <name> during many centuries , but surely her conduct upon this occasion <unk> her to our respect .
one feels drawn tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her many crimes and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed her career .
" the <name> was never more seen ; but her enchanting tones have often been heard .
in the beautiful , refreshing , still nights of spring , when the moon pours her silver light over the country , the listening <unk> hears from the rushing of the waves , the echoing clang of a wonderfully charming voice , which sings a song from the <name> castle , and with sorrow and fear he thinks on the young count hermann , seduced by the <unk> . "
here is the music , and the <name> words by <unk> <unk> .
this song has been a favorite in germany for forty years , and <name> remain a favorite always , maybe .
[ figure 5 ] i have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language and add no translation .
when i am the reader , and the author considers me able to do the translating myself , he pays me quite a nice compliment  but if he would do the translating for me i would try to get along without the compliment .
if i were at home , no doubt i could get a translation of this poem , but i am abroad and ca n't ; therefore i <name> make a translation myself .
it may not be a good one , for poetry is out of my line , but it <name> serve my purpose  which is , to give the <unk> young girl a jingle of words to <name> the tune on until she can get hold of a good version , made by some one who is a poet and knows how to convey a poetical thought from one language to another .
the <name> i can not divine what it <unk> , this haunting nameless pain : a tale of the bygone ages keeps brooding through my <name> : the faint air cools in the <unk> , and peaceful flows the rhine , the thirsty summits are drinking the sunset 's flooding wine ; the loveliest maiden is sitting <unk> in <name> blue air , her golden jewels are shining , she combs her golden hair ; she combs with a comb that is golden , and sings a weird refrain that <unk> in a deadly enchantment the <unk> 's <unk> <name> : the doomed in his drifting <unk> , is <unk> with the sad sweet tone , he sees not the yawning breakers , he sees but the maid alone : the pitiless billows <unk> him !  so perish sailor and bark ; and this , with her <unk> singing , is the <name> 's <unk> work .
i have a translation by <unk> , bachelor of arts , in the legends of the rhine , but it would not answer the purpose i mentioned above , because the measure is too nobly irregular ; it do n't fit the tune snugly enough ; in places it hangs over at the ends too far , and in other places one runs out of words before he gets to the end of a bar .
still , <unk> translation has high merits , and i am not dreaming of leaving it out of my book .
i believe this poet is wholly unknown in <name> and england ; i take peculiar pleasure in bringing him forward because i consider that i discovered him : the <name> translated by l. w. <unk> , b.a .
i do not know what it signifies .
that i am so sorrowful ?
a fable of old times so <unk> , leaves my heart so thoughtful .
the air is cool and it <unk> , and calmly flows the rhine ; the summit of the mountain <unk> in evening <name> line .
the most beautiful maiden entrances above wonderfully there , her beautiful golden attire glances , she combs her golden hair .
with golden comb so lustrous , and thereby a song sings , it has a tone so wondrous , that powerful <name> rings .
the <unk> in the little ship it effects with woe sad might ; he does not see the <name> slip , he only regards dreaded height .
i believe the turbulent waves swallow the last <unk> and boat ; she with her singing <unk> all to visit <unk> moat .
no translation could be closer .
he has got in all the facts ; and in their regular order , too .
there is not a <unk> wanting .
it is as <unk> as an <unk> .
that is what a translation ought to be ; it should exactly reflect the thought of the original .
you ca n't sing " above wonderfully there , " because it simply wo n't go to the tune , without damaging the singer ; but it is a most <unk> exact translation of <unk> <unk> <unk>  fits it like a blister .
mr. <unk> 's reproduction has other merits  a hundred of them  but it is not necessary to point them out .
they <name> be detected .
no one with a specialty can <name> to have a monopoly of it .
even <unk> has a rival .
mr. x had a small pamphlet with him which he had bought while on a visit to munich .
it was entitled a catalogue of pictures in the old <unk> , and was written in a peculiar kind of english .
here are a few extracts : " it is not permitted to make use of the work in question to a publication of the same contents as well as to the <unk> edition of it . "
" an evening landscape .
in the foreground near a pond and a group of white <unk> is leading a footpath animated by travelers . "
" a learned man in a cynical and torn dress holding an open book in his hand . "
" st. <unk> and the executioner with the knife to fulfil the martyr . "

" <name> bathing , surprised by the two old man .
in the background the <unk> of the condemned . "
( " <unk> " is good ; it is much more elegant than " <unk> . " )
" st. <unk> sitting in a landscape with an <name> who looks at his <unk> , whilst the dog the bread in his mouth <unk> him . "
" spring .

" the virgin holding the infant .
it is very painted in the manner of <unk> . "
" a larder with greens and dead game animated by a <unk> and two <unk> . "
however , the english of this catalogue is at least as happy as that which distinguishes an inscription upon a certain picture in rome  to wit : " <unk> .
st. <name> in patterson 's island . "
but meanwhile the raft is moving on .
chapter xvii [ why germans wear spectacles ] a mile or two above <unk> we saw a peculiar ruin projecting above the foliage which clothed the peak of a high and very steep hill .
this ruin consisted of merely a couple of crumbling masses of masonry which bore a rude resemblance to human faces ; they leaned forward and touched foreheads , and had the look of being absorbed in conversation .
this ruin had nothing very imposing or picturesque about it , and there was no great deal of it , yet it was called the " spectacular ruin . "
legend of the " spectacular ruin " the captain of the raft , who was as full of history as he could stick , said that in the middle ages a most prodigious <unk> dragon used to live in that region , and made more trouble than a <unk> .
he was as long as a <unk> , and had the customary impenetrable green scales all over him .
his breath bred pestilence and conflagration , and his appetite bred famine .
he ate men and cattle impartially , and was exceedingly unpopular .
the <name> emperor of that day made the usual offer : he would <name> to the destroyer of the dragon , any one solitary thing he might ask for ; for he had a <unk> of daughters , and it was customary for <unk> to take a daughter for pay .
so the most renowned knights came from the four corners of the earth and retired down the dragon 's throat one after the other .
a panic arose and spread .
heroes grew cautious .
the procession ceased .
the dragon became more destructive than ever .
the people lost all <name> of succor , and fled to the mountains for refuge .
at last sir wissenschaft , a poor and obscure knight , out of a far country , arrived to do battle with the monster .
a pitiable object he was , with his armor hanging in rags about him , and his <unk> knapsack strapped upon his back .
everybody turned up their noses at him , and some openly jeered him .
but he was calm .
he simply inquired if the emperor 's offer was still in force .
the emperor said it was  but <unk> advised him to go and hunt hares and not endanger so precious a life as his in an attempt which had brought death to so many of the world 's most illustrious heroes .
but this tramp only asked  " were any of these heroes men of science ? "
this raised a laugh , of course , for science was despised in those days .
but the tramp was not in the least ruffled .
he said he might be a little in advance of his age , but no matter  science would come to be honored , some time or other .
he said he would march against the dragon in the morning .
out of compassion , then , a decent spear was offered him , but he declined , and said , " spears were useless to men of science . "
they allowed him to sup in the servants ' hall , and gave him a bed in the stables .
when he started forth in the morning , thousands were gathered to see .
the emperor said : " do not be rash , take a spear , and leave off your knapsack . "
but the tramp said : " it is not a knapsack , " and moved straight on .
the dragon was waiting and ready .
he was breathing forth vast volumes of sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame .
the ragged knight stole warily to a good position , then he unslung his cylindrical knapsack  which was simply the common <unk> known to modern times  and the first chance he got he turned on his hose and shot the dragon square in the center of his cavernous mouth .
out went the fires in an instant , and the dragon curled up and died .
this man had brought brains to his aid .
he had reared dragons from the egg , in his laboratory , he had watched over them like a mother , and patiently studied them and experimented upon them while they grew .
thus he had found out that fire was the life principle of a dragon ; put out the dragon 's fires and it could make steam no longer , and must die .
he could not put out a fire with a spear , therefore he invented the <unk> .
the dragon being dead , the emperor fell on the hero 's neck and said : " deliverer , name your request , " at the same time beckoning out behind with his heel for a detachment of his daughters to form and advance .
but the tramp gave them no observance .
he simply said : " my request is , that upon me be conferred the monopoly of the manufacture and sale of spectacles in germany . "
the emperor sprang aside and exclaimed : " this transcends all the impudence i ever heard !
a modest demand , by my <unk> !
why did n't you ask for the imperial revenues at once , and be done with it ? "
but the monarch had given his word , and he kept it .
to <unk> surprise , the unselfish <unk> immediately reduced the price of spectacles to such a degree that a great and crushing burden was removed from the nation .
the emperor , to commemorate this generous act , and to testify his appreciation of it , issued a decree commanding everybody to buy this benefactor 's spectacles and wear them , whether they needed them or not .
so originated the wide-spread custom of wearing spectacles in germany ; and as a custom once established in these old lands is imperishable , this one remains universal in the empire to this day .
such is the legend of the <unk> 's once stately and sumptuous castle , now called the " spectacular ruin . "
on the right bank , two or three miles below the spectacular ruin , we passed by a <name> pile of <unk> buildings overlooking the water from the crest of a lofty elevation .
a stretch of two hundred yards of the high front wall was heavily draped with <name> , and out of the mass of buildings within rose three picturesque old towers .
the place was in fine order , and was inhabited by a family of princely rank .
this castle had its legend , too , but i should not feel justified in repeating it because i doubted the truth of some of its minor details .
along in this region a multitude of italian laborers were blasting away the frontage of the hills to make room for the new railway .
they were fifty or a hundred feet above the river .
as we turned a sharp corner they began to wave signals and shout warnings to us to look out for the explosions .
it was all very well to warn us , but what could we do ?
you ca n't back a raft upstream , you ca n't hurry it downstream , you can't scatter out to one side when you have n't any room to speak of , you won't take to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to be blasting there , too .
your resources are limited , you see .
there is simply nothing for it but to watch and pray .
for some hours we had been making three and a half or four miles an hour and we were still making that .
we had been dancing right along until those men began to shout ; then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me that i had never seen a raft go so slowly .
when the first blast went off we raised our <unk> and waited for the result .
no harm done ; none of the stones fell in the water .
another blast followed , and another and another .
some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern of us .
we ran that whole battery of nine blasts in a row , and it was certainly one of the most exciting and uncomfortable weeks i ever spent , either <unk> or ashore .
of course we frequently manned the poles and shoved earnestly for a second or so , but every time one of those spurts of dust and debris shot aloft every man dropped his pole and looked up to get the bearings of his share of it .
it was very busy times along there for a while .
it appeared certain that we must perish , but even that was not the bitterest thought ; no , the <unk> <unk> nature of the death  that was the sting  that and the bizarre wording of the resulting obituary : " shot with a rock , on a raft . "
there would be no poetry written about it .
none could be written about it .
example : not by war 's shock , or war 's shaft ,  shot , with a rock , on a raft .
no poet who valued his reputation would touch such a theme as that .
i should be distinguished as the only " distinguished dead " who went down to the grave <unk> , in 1878 .
but we escaped , and i have never regretted it .
the last blast was a peculiarly strong one , and after the small rubbish was done raining around us and we were just going to shake hands over our deliverance , a later and larger stone came down amongst our little group of pedestrians and wrecked an umbrella .
it did no other harm , but we took to the water just the same .
it seems that the heavy work in the <unk> and the new railway <unk> is done mainly by italians .
that was a revelation .
we have the notion in our country that italians never do heavy work at all , but confine themselves to the lighter arts , like <unk> , <unk> singing , and assassination .
we have blundered , that is plain .
all along the river , near every village , we saw little <unk> for the future railway .
they were finished and waiting for the rails and business .
they were as trim and snug and pretty as they could be .
they were always of brick or stone ; they were of graceful shape , they had vines and flowers about them already , and around them the grass was bright and green , and showed that it was carefully looked after .
they were a decoration to the beautiful landscape , not an offense .
wherever one saw a pile of gravel or a pile of broken stone , it was always heaped as <unk> and exactly as a new grave or a stack of cannon-balls ; nothing about those stations or along the railroad or the <unk> was allowed to look shabby or be <unk> .
the keeping a country in such beautiful order as germany exhibits , has a wise practical side to it , too , for it keeps thousands of people in work and bread who would otherwise be idle and mischievous .
as the night shut down , the captain wanted to tie up , but i thought maybe we might make <unk> , so we went on .
presently the sky became overcast , and the captain came aft looking uneasy .
he cast his eye aloft , then shook his head , and said it was coming on to blow .
my party wanted to land at once  therefore i wanted to go on .
the captain said we ought to shorten sail anyway , out of common <name> .
consequently , the larboard watch was ordered to lay in his pole .
it grew quite dark , now , and the wind began to rise .
it wailed through the swaying branches of the trees , and swept our decks in fitful gusts .
things were taking on an ugly look .
the captain shouted to the steersman on the forward log : " how 's she landing ? "
the answer came faint and hoarse from far forward : " <unk> '  <unk> , <unk> , sir . "
" let her go off a point ! "
" <unk> , sir ! "
" what water have you got ? "
" shoal , sir .
two foot large , on the <unk> , two and a half scant on the <unk> ! "
" let her go off another point ! "
" <unk> , sir ! "
" forward , men , all of you !
lively , now !
stand by to crowd her round the weather corner ! "
" <unk> , sir ! "
then followed a wild running and trampling and hoarse shouting , but the forms of the men were lost in the darkness and the sounds were distorted and confused by the roaring of the wind through the <unk> .
by this time the sea was running inches high , and threatening every moment to <unk> the frail bark .
now came the mate , hurrying aft , and said , close to the captain 's ear , in a low , agitated voice : " prepare for the worst , sir  we have sprung a leak ! "
" heavens !
where ? "
" right aft the second row of logs . "
" nothing but a miracle can save us !
do n't let the men know , or there <name> be a panic and mutiny !
lay her in shore and stand by to jump with the <unk> the moment she touches .
gentlemen , i must look to you to second my endeavors in this hour of peril .
you have hats  go forward and bail for your lives ! "
down swept another mighty blast of wind , clothed in spray and thick darkness .
at such a moment as this , came from away forward that most appalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea : " man overboard ! "
the captain shouted : " hard <unk> !
never mind the man !
let him climb aboard or <name> ashore ! "
another cry came down the wind : " breakers ahead ! "
" where away ? "
" not a log 's length off her port <unk> ! "
we had groped our slippery way forward , and were now bailing with the frenzy of despair , when we heard the mate 's terrified cry , from far aft : " stop that dashed bailing , or we shall be aground ! "
but this was immediately followed by the glad shout : " land aboard the starboard <unk> ! "
" saved ! "
cried the captain .
" jump ashore and take a turn around a tree and pass the bight aboard ! "
the next moment we were all on shore weeping and embracing for <name> , while the rain poured down in torrents .
the captain said he had been a mariner for forty years on the neckar , and in that time had seen storms to make a man 's cheek <name> and his pulses stop , but he had never , never seen a storm that even approached this one .
how familiar that sounded !
for i have been at sea a good deal and have heard that remark from captains with a frequency accordingly .
we framed in our minds the usual resolution of thanks and admiration and gratitude , and took the first opportunity to vote it , and put it in writing and present it to the captain , with the customary speech .
we tramped through the darkness and the drenching summer rain full three miles , and reached " the naturalist tavern " in the village of <unk> just an hour before midnight , almost exhausted from hardship , fatigue , and terror .
i can never forget that night .
the landlord was <name> , and therefore could afford to be <unk> and <unk> ; he did not at all like being turned out of his warm bed to open his house for us .
but no matter , his household got up and cooked a quick supper for us , and we brewed a hot punch for ourselves , to keep off consumption .
after supper and punch we had an hour 's soothing smoke while we fought the naval battle over again and voted the resolutions ; then we retired to exceedingly neat and pretty chambers upstairs that had clean , comfortable beds in them with <unk> <unk> most elaborately and tastefully embroidered by hand .
such rooms and beds and embroidered linen are as frequent in <name> village inns as they are rare in ours .
our villages are superior to <name> villages in more merits , excellences , conveniences , and privileges than i can enumerate , but the hotels do not belong in the list .
" the naturalist tavern " was not a meaningless name ; for all the halls and all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled with all sorts of birds and animals , <unk> , ably stuffed , and set up in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes .
the moment we were abed , the rain cleared away and the moon came out .
i dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great white stuffed owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who thought he had met me before , but could not make out for certain .
but young z did not get off so easily .
he said that as he was sinking deliciously to sleep , the moon lifted away the shadows and developed a huge cat , on a <unk> , dead and stuffed , but crouching , with every muscle tense , for a spring , and with its glittering glass eyes aimed straight at him .
it made z uncomfortable .
he tried closing his own eyes , but that did not answer , for a natural instinct kept making him open them again to see if the cat was still getting ready to launch at him  which she always was .
he tried turning his back , but that was a failure ; he knew the sinister eyes were on him still .
so at last he had to get up , after an hour or two of worry and experiment , and set the cat out in the hall .
so he won , that time .
chapter xviii [ the kindly courtesy of germans ] in the morning we took breakfast in the garden , under the trees , in the delightful <name> summer fashion .
the air was filled with the fragrance of flowers and wild animals ; the living portion of the menagerie of the " naturalist tavern " was all about us .
there were great cages populous with fluttering and chattering foreign birds , and other great cages and greater wire pens , populous with quadrupeds , both native and foreign .
there were some free creatures , too , and quite sociable ones they were .
white rabbits went <unk> about the place , and occasionally came and sniffed at our shoes and shins ; a <name> , with a red ribbon on its neck , walked up and examined us fearlessly ; rare breeds of chickens and doves begged for crumbs , and a poor old tailless <name> hopped about with a humble , <unk> mein which said , " please do not notice my exposure  think how you would feel in my circumstances , and be charitable . "
if he was observed too much , he would retire behind something and stay there until he judged the party 's interest had found another object .
i never have seen another dumb creature that was so <unk> sensitive .
bayard <name> , who could interpret the dim reasonings of animals , and understood their moral natures better than most men , would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget his troubles for a while , but we have not his kindly <name> , and so had to leave the <name> to his griefs .
after breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of <unk> , and the ruined church near it .
there were some curious old <unk> leaning against the inner walls of the church  sculptured lords of <unk> in complete armor , and ladies of <unk> in the picturesque court costumes of the middle ages .
these things are suffering damage and passing to decay , for the last <unk> has been dead two hundred years , and there is nobody now who cares to preserve the family relics .
in the chancel was a twisted stone column , and the captain told us a legend about it , of course , for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself ; but i do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the hero wrenched this column into its present <unk> with his hands  just one single wrench .
all the rest of the legend was doubtful .
but <unk> is best seen from a distance , down the river .
then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop , and the old <unk> stone wall , stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond , make a picture whose <name> and beauty entirely satisfy the eye .
we descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village .
it was a quarter well stocked with deformed , <unk> , unkempt and <unk> idiots , who held out hands or caps and begged piteously .
the people of the quarter were not all idiots , of course , but all that begged seemed to be , and were said to be .
i was thinking of going by skiff to the next town , <unk> ; so i ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire .
i suppose i must have spoken high <name>  court <name>  i intended it for that , anyway  so he did not understand me .
i turned and twisted my question around and about , trying to strike that man 's average , but failed .
he could not make out what i wanted .
now mr. x arrived , faced this same man , looked him in the eye , and emptied this sentence on him , in the most <unk> and confident way : " can man boat get here ? "
the mariner promptly understood and promptly answered .
i can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence , because by mere accident all the words in it except " get " have the same sound and the same meaning in <name> that they have in english ; but how he managed to understand mr. x 's next remark puzzled me .
i <name> insert it , presently .
x turned away a moment , and i asked the mariner if he could not find a board , and so construct an additional seat .
i spoke in the purest <name> , but i might as well have spoken in the purest <unk> for all the good it did .
the man tried his best to understand me ; he tried , and kept on trying , harder and harder , until i saw it was really of no use , and said : " there , do n't strain yourself  it is of no consequence . "
then x turned to him and <unk> said : " <unk> sie a flat board . "
i wish my <unk> may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once , and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling .
we changed our mind about taking a boat , so we did not have to go .
i have given mr. x 's two remarks just as he made them .
four of the five words in the first one were english , and that they were also <name> was only accidental , not intentional ; three out of the five words in the second remark were english , and english only , and the two <name> ones did not mean anything in particular , in such a connection .
x always spoke english to germans , but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down , according to <name> construction , and <unk> in a <name> word without any essential meaning to it , here and there , by way of flavor .
yet he always made himself understood .
he could make those <unk> <unk> understand him , sometimes , when even young z had failed with them ; and young z was a pretty good <name> scholar .
for one thing , x always spoke with such confidence  perhaps that helped .
and possibly the <unk> 's dialect was what is called <unk> , and so they found his english more familiar to their ears than another man 's <name> .
quite indifferent students of <name> can read <name> <unk> 's charming <unk> tales with some little facility because many of the words are english .
i suppose this is the tongue which our saxon ancestors carried to england with them .
by and by i <name> inquire of some other <unk> .
however , in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to <unk> the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all , but only a crack between the logs  a crack that belonged there , and was not dangerous , but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate .
therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence , and presently got to sea without accident .
as we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores , we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in germany and elsewhere .
as i write , now , many months later , i perceive that each of us , by observing and noting and inquiring , diligently and day by day , had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of <unk> .
but this is not surprising ; it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country .
for example , i had the idea once , in heidelberg , to find out all about those five <unk> .
i started with the white cap corps .
i began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen , and here is what i found out : 1 .
it is called the prussian corps , because none but <unk> are admitted to it .
2 .
it is called the prussian corps for no particular reason .
it has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some <name> state .
3 .
it is not named the prussian corps at all , but only the white cap corps .
4 .
any student can belong to it who is a <name> by birth .
5 .
any student can belong to it who is european by birth .
6 .
any <unk> student can belong to it , except he be a frenchman .
7 .
any student can belong to it , no matter where he was born .
8 .
no student can belong to it who is not of <name> blood .
9 .
no student can belong to it who can not show three full generations of <name> descent .
10 .
nobility is not a necessary qualification .
11 .
no <unk> student can belong to it .
12 .
money qualification is nonsense  such a thing has never been thought of .
i got some of this information from students themselves  students who did not belong to the corps .
i finally went to headquarters  to the white caps  where i would have gone in the first place if i had been acquainted .
but even at headquarters i found difficulties ; i perceived that there were things about the white cap corps which one member knew and another one did n't .
it was natural ; for very few members of any organization know all that can be known about it .
i doubt there is a man or a woman in heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the white cap corps which a stranger might ask ; yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time .
there is one <name> custom which is universal  the bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it .
this bow <unk> a stranger out of his self-possession , the first time it occurs , and he is likely to fall over a chair or something , in his embarrassment , but it pleases him , nevertheless .
one soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it ; but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow one 's self is a difficult matter for a diffident man .
one thinks , " if i rise to go , and tender my bow , and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation , and not return it , how shall i feel , in case i survive to feel anything . "
therefore he is afraid to venture .
he sits out the dinner , and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing .
a table d'hôte dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses ; therefore i used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears .
it took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless , but i did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent .
i made <name> get up and bow and leave ; invariably his bow was returned , then i got up and bowed myself and retired .
thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me , but not for <name> .
three courses of a table d'hôte dinner were enough for me , but <name> preferred thirteen .
even after i had acquired full confidence , and no longer needed the agent 's help , i sometimes encountered difficulties .
once at baden-baden i nearly lost a train because i could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were germans , since i had not heard them speak ; they might be american , they might be english , it was not safe to venture a bow ; but just as i had got that far with my thought , one of them began a <name> remark , to my great relief and gratitude ; and before she got out her third word , our bows had been delivered and graciously returned , and we were off .
there is a friendly something about the <name> character which is very winning .
when <name> and i were making a pedestrian tour through the black forest , we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day ; two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us .
they were pedestrians , too .
our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs , but they had a sturdy youth along to <name> theirs for them .
all parties were hungry , so there was no talking .
by and by the usual bows were exchanged , and we separated .
as we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at <unk> , next morning , these young people entered and took places near us without observing us ; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled ; not <unk> , but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers .
then they spoke of the weather and the roads .
we also spoke of the weather and the roads .
next , they said they had had an enjoyable walk , notwithstanding the weather .
we said that that had been our case , too .
then they said they had walked thirty english miles the day before , and asked how many we had walked .
i could not lie , so i told <name> to do it .
<name> told them we had made thirty english miles , too .
that was true ; we had " made " them , though we had had a little assistance here and there .
after breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes , and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well , they went and got their maps and things , and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a new york detective could have followed it .
and when we started they spoke out a hearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey .
perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native <unk> because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land ; i do n't know ; i only know it was lovely to be treated so .
very well , i took an american young <name> to one of the fine balls in baden-baden , one night , and at the <unk> upstairs we were halted by an official  something about miss jones 's dress was not according to rule ; i do n't remember what it was , now ; something was wanting  her back hair , or a shawl , or a fan , or a shovel , or something .
the official was ever so polite , and ever so sorry , but the rule was strict , and he could not let us in .
it was very embarrassing , for many eyes were on us .
but now a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom , inquired into the trouble , and said she could fix it in a moment .
she took miss jones to the <unk> , and soon brought her back in regulation trim , and then we entered the ballroom with this <unk> unchallenged .
being safe , now , i began to puzzle through my sincere but <unk> thanks , when there was a sudden mutual recognition  the <unk> and i had met at <unk> .
two weeks had not altered her good face , and plainly her heart was in the right place yet , but there was such a difference between these clothes and the clothes i had seen her in before , when she was walking thirty miles a day in the black forest , that it was quite natural that i had failed to recognize her sooner .
i had on my other suit , too , but my <name> would betray me to a person who had heard it once , anyway .
she brought her brother and sister , and they made our way smooth for that evening .
well  months afterward , i was driving through the streets of munich in a cab with a <name> <name> , one day , when she said : " there , that is <name> <unk> and his wife , walking along there . "
everybody was bowing to them  <unk> , little children , and everybody else  and they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody , when a young <name> met them and made a deep courtesy .
" that is probably one of the ladies of the court , " said my <name> friend .
i said : " she is an honor to it , then .
i know her .
i do n't know her name , but i know her .
i have known her at <unk> and baden-baden .
she ought to be an empress , but she may be only a duchess ; it is the way things go in this way . "
if one asks a <name> a civil question , he <name> be quite sure to get a civil answer .
if you stop a <name> in the street and ask him to direct you to a certain place , he shows no sign of feeling offended .
if the place be difficult to find , ten to one the man <name> drop his own matters and go with you and show you .
in london , too , many a time , strangers have walked several blocks with me to show me my way .
there is something very real about this sort of politeness .
quite often , in germany , shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article i wanted have sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where it could be had .
chapter xix [ the deadly jest of <unk> ] however , i wander from the raft .
we made the port of <unk> in good season , and went to the hotel and ordered a trout dinner , the same to be ready against our return from a <unk> pedestrian excursion to the village and castle of <unk> , a mile distant , on the other side of the river .
i do not mean that we proposed to be two hours making two miles  no , we meant to employ most of the time in inspecting <unk> .
for <unk> is a quaint place .
it is most quaintly and picturesquely situated , too .
imagine the beautiful river before you ; then a few rods of brilliant green <unk> on its opposite shore ; then a sudden hill  no preparatory gently rising slopes , but a sort of instantaneous hill  a hill two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet high , as round as a bowl , with the same taper upward that an inverted bowl has , and with about the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a bowl of good honest depth  a hill which is thickly clothed with green bushes  a comely , shapely hill , rising abruptly out of the dead level of the surrounding green plains , visible from a great distance down the bends of the river , and with just exactly room on the top of its head for its <unk> and <unk> and <unk> cap of architecture , which same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round hoop of the ancient village wall .
there is no house outside the wall on the whole hill , or any vestige of a former house ; all the houses are inside the wall , but there is n't room for another one .
it is really a finished town , and has been finished a very long time .
there is no space between the wall and the first circle of buildings ; no , the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first circle of buildings , and the roofs <unk> a little over the wall and thus furnish it with eaves .
the general level of the massed roofs is gracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined castle and the tall spires of a couple of churches ; so , from a distance <unk> has rather more the look of a king 's crown than a cap .
that lofty green eminence and its quaint coronet form quite a striking picture , you may be sure , in the flush of the evening sun .
we crossed over in a boat and began the ascent by a narrow , steep path which plunged us at once into the leafy deeps of the bushes .
but they were not cool deeps by any means , for the sun 's rays were weltering hot and there was little or no breeze to temper them .
as we panted up the sharp ascent , we met brown , bareheaded and barefooted boys and girls , occasionally , and sometimes men ; they came upon us without warning , they gave us good day , flashed out of sight in the bushes , and were gone as suddenly and mysteriously as they had come .
they were bound for the other side of the river to work .
this path had been traveled by many generations of these people .
they have always gone down to the valley to earn their bread , but they have always climbed their hill again to eat it , and to sleep in their snug town .
it is said that the <unk> do not emigrate much ; they find that living up there above the world , in their peaceful nest , is pleasanter than living down in the <unk> world .
the seven hundred inhabitants are all <unk> to each other , too ; they have always been <unk> to each other for fifteen hundred years ; they are simply one large family , and they like the home folks better than they like strangers , hence they persistently stay at home .
it has been said that for ages <unk> has been merely a thriving and diligent <unk> .
i saw no idiots there , but the captain said , " because of late years the government has taken to <unk> them off to <unk> and <unk> ; and government wants to cripple the factory , too , and is trying to get these <unk> to marry out of the family , but they do n't like to . "
the captain probably imagined all this , as modern science denies that the <unk> of relatives <unk> the stock .
arrived within the wall , we found the usual village sights and life .
we moved along a narrow , crooked <name> which had been paved in the middle ages .
a strapping , ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff in a little bit of a <unk> of a barn , and she swung her <unk> with a <name>  if it was a <unk> ; i was not farmer enough to know what she was at ; a <unk> , <unk> girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stick  driving them along the <name> and keeping them out of the dwellings ; a cooper was at work in a shop which i know he did not make so large a thing as a hogshead in , for there was not room .
in the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning , and ducks and chickens were <unk> in and out , over the threshold , picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse ; a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door , with his <name> upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap ; soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the <name> , unmindful of the sun .
except the sleeping old man , everybody was at work , but the place was very still and peaceful , nevertheless ; so still that the distant cackle of the successful hen smote upon the ear but little dulled by intervening sounds .
that commonest of village sights was lacking here  the public pump , with its great stone tank or trough of limpid water , and its group of gossiping <unk> ; for there is no well or fountain or spring on this tall hill ; <unk> of rain-water are used .
our alpenstocks and muslin tails compelled attention , and as we moved through the village we gathered a considerable procession of little boys and girls , and so went in some state to the castle .
it proved to be an extensive pile of crumbling walls , arches , and towers , massive , properly grouped for picturesque effect , <unk> , <unk> , and satisfactory .
the children acted as guides ; they walked us along the top of the highest walls , then took us up into a high tower and showed us a wide and beautiful landscape , made up of wavy distances of woody hills , and a nearer prospect of undulating expanses of green lowlands , on the one hand , and <unk> crags and ridges on the other , with the shining curves of the neckar flowing between .
but the principal show , the chief pride of the children , was the ancient and empty well in the <unk> court of the castle .
its massive stone curb stands up three or four feet <unk> , and is whole and uninjured .
the children said that in the middle ages this well was four hundred feet deep , and furnished all the village with an abundant supply of water , in war and peace .
they said that in the old day its bottom was below the level of the neckar , hence the water-supply was inexhaustible .
but there were some who believed it had never been a well at all , and was never deeper than it is now  eighty feet ; that at that depth a subterranean passage branched from it and descended gradually to a remote place in the valley , where it opened into somebody 's cellar or other hidden recess , and that the secret of this locality is now lost .
those who hold this belief say that herein lies the explanation that <unk> , besieged by <unk> and many a soldier before him , was never taken : after the longest and closest sieges the besiegers were astonished to perceive that the besieged were as fat and hearty as ever , and were well furnished with munitions of war  therefore it must be that the <unk> had been bringing these things in through the subterranean passage all the time .
the children said that there was in truth a subterranean outlet down there , and they would prove it .
so they set a great truss of straw on fire and threw it down the well , while we leaned on the curb and watched the glowing mass descend .
it struck bottom and gradually burned out .
no smoke came up .
the children clapped their hands and said : " you see !
nothing makes so much smoke as burning straw  now where did the smoke go to , if there is no subterranean outlet ? "
so it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed .
but the finest thing within the ruin 's limits was a <name> <unk> , which the children said was four hundred years old , and no doubt it was .
it had a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage .
the limbs near the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel .
that tree had witnessed the assaults of men in mail  how remote such a time seems , and how <unk> is the fact that real men ever did fight in real armor !  and it had seen the time when these broken arches and crumbling battlements were a trim and strong and stately fortress , fluttering its <name> banners in the sun , and peopled with vigorous humanity  how <unk> long ago that seems !  and here it stands yet , and possibly may still be standing here , <unk> itself and dreaming its historical dreams , when today shall have been joined to the days called " ancient . "
well , we sat down under the tree to smoke , and the captain delivered himself of his legend : the legend of <unk> castle it was to this effect .
in the old times there was once a great company assembled at the castle , and festivity ran high .
of course there was a haunted chamber in the castle , and one day the talk fell upon that .
it was said that whoever slept in it would not wake again for fifty years .
now when a young knight named <name> <name> <unk> heard this , he said that if the castle were his he would destroy that chamber , so that no foolish person might have the chance to bring so dreadful a misfortune upon himself and afflict such as loved him with the memory of it .
straightway , the company privately laid their heads together to contrive some way to get this superstitious young man to sleep in that chamber .
and they succeeded  in this way .
they persuaded his betrothed , a lovely mischievous young creature , niece of the lord of the castle , to help them in their plot .
she presently took him aside and had speech with him .
she used all her persuasions , but could not shake him ; he said his belief was firm , that if he should sleep there he would wake no more for fifty years , and it made him shudder to think of it .
catharina began to weep .
this was a better argument ; <name> could not hold out against it .
he yielded and said she should have her wish if she would only smile and be happy again .
she flung her arms about his neck , and the kisses she gave him showed that her thankfulness and her pleasure were very real .
then she flew to tell the company her success , and the applause she received made her glad and proud she had undertaken her mission , since all alone she had accomplished what the multitude had failed in .
at midnight , that night , after the usual feasting , <name> was taken to the haunted chamber and left there .
he fell asleep , by and by .
when he awoke again and looked about him , his heart stood still with horror !
the whole aspect of the chamber was changed .
the walls were <unk> and <name> with ancient cobwebs ; the curtains and <unk> were rotten ; the furniture was rickety and ready to fall to pieces .
he sprang out of bed , but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the floor .
" this is the weakness of age , " he said .
he rose and sought his clothing .
it was clothing no longer .
the colors were gone , the garments gave way in many places while he was putting them on .
he fled , shuddering , into the corridor , and along it to the great hall .
here he was met by a middle-aged stranger of a kind countenance , who stopped and gazed at him with surprise .
<name> said : " good sir , <name> you send hither the lord ulrich ? "
the stranger looked puzzled a moment , then said : " the lord ulrich ? "
" yes  if you <name> be so good . "
the stranger called  " wilhelm ! "
a young <unk> came , and the stranger said to him : " is there a lord ulrich among the guests ? "
" i know none of the name , so please your honor . "
<name> said , hesitatingly : " i did not mean a guest , but the lord of the castle , sir . "
the stranger and the servant exchanged wondering glances .
then the former said : " i am the lord of the castle . "
" since when , sir ? "
" since the death of my father , the good lord ulrich more than forty years ago . "
<name> sank upon a bench and covered his face with his hands while he rocked his body to and fro and moaned .
the stranger said in a low voice to the servant : " i fear me this poor old creature is mad .
call some one . "
in a moment several people came , and grouped themselves about , talking in whispers .
<name> looked up and scanned the faces about him wistfully .
then he shook his head and said , in a grieved voice : " no , there is none among ye that i know .
i am old and alone in the world .
they are dead and gone these many years that cared for me .
but sure , some of these aged ones i see about me can tell me some little word or two concerning them . "
several bent and tottering men and women came nearer and answered his questions about each former friend as he mentioned the names .
this one they said had been dead ten years , that one twenty , another thirty .
each succeeding blow struck heavier and heavier .
at last the sufferer said : " there is one more , but i have not the courage to  o my lost catharina ! "
one of the old dames said : " ah , i knew her well , poor soul .
a misfortune overtook her lover , and she died of sorrow nearly fifty years ago .
she lieth under the <unk> tree without the court . "
<name> bowed his head and said : " ah , why did i ever wake !
and so she died of grief for me , poor child .
so young , so sweet , so good !
she never <unk> did a <unk> thing in all the little summer of her life .
her loving debt shall be repaid  for i <name> die of grief for her . "
his head drooped upon his breast .
in the moment there was a wild burst of joyous laughter , a pair of round young arms were flung about <unk> neck and a sweet voice cried : " there , <name> mine , thy kind words kill me  the farce shall go no further !
look up , and laugh with us  't was all a jest ! "
and he did look up , and gazed , in a dazed <unk>  for the disguises were stripped away , and the aged men and women were bright and young and <name> again .
catharina 's happy tongue ran on : " 't was a marvelous jest , and bravely carried out .
they gave you a heavy <unk> before you went to bed , and in the night they bore you to a ruined chamber where all had fallen to decay , and placed these rags of clothing by you .
and when your sleep was spent and you came forth , two strangers , well instructed in their parts , were here to meet you ; and all we , your friends , in our disguises , were close at hand , to see and hear , you may be sure .
ah , 't was a gallant jest !
come , now , and make thee ready for the pleasures of the day .
how real was thy misery for the moment , thou poor lad !
look up and have thy laugh , now ! "
he looked up , searched the <name> faces about him in a dreamy way , then sighed and said : " i am <unk> , good strangers , i pray you lead me to her grave . "
all the smile vanished away , every cheek blanched , catharina sunk to the ground in a swoon .
all day the people went about the castle with troubled faces , and <unk> together in <unk> .
a painful hush pervaded the place which had lately been so full of cheery life .
each in his turn tried to arouse <name> out of his <unk> and bring him to himself ; but all the answer any got was a meek , bewildered stare , and then the words : " good stranger , i have no friends , all are at rest these many years ; ye speak me fair , ye mean me well , but i know ye not ; i am alone and forlorn in the world  prithee lead me to her grave . "
during two years <name> spent his days , from the early morning till the night , under the <unk> tree , mourning over the imaginary grave of his catharina .
catharina was the only company of the harmless madman .
he was very friendly toward her because , as he said , in some ways she reminded him of his catharina whom he had lost " fifty years ago . "
he often said : " she was so <name> , so <unk>  but you never smile ; and always when you think i am not looking , you cry . "
when <name> died , they buried him under the <unk> , according to his directions , so that he might rest " near his poor catharina . "
then catharina sat under the <unk> alone , every day and all day long , a great many years , speaking to no one , and never smiling ; and at last her long repentance was rewarded with death , and she was buried by <unk> side .
<name> pleased the captain by saying it was good legend ; and pleased him further by adding : " now that i have seen this mighty tree , vigorous with its four hundred years , i feel a <name> to believe the legend for its sake ; so i <name> humor the <name> , and consider that the tree really watches over those poor hearts and feels a sort of human tenderness for them . "
we returned to <unk> , plunged our hot heads into the trough at the town pump , and then went to the hotel and ate our trout dinner in leisurely comfort , in the garden , with the beautiful neckar flowing at our feet , the quaint <unk> looming beyond , and the graceful towers and battlements of a couple of medieval castles ( called the " <unk> nest " [ 1 ] and " the brothers . " )
assisting the rugged scenery of a bend of the river down to our right .
we got to sea in season to make the <unk> run to heidelberg before the night shut down .
we sailed by the hotel in the mellow glow of sunset , and came slashing down with the mad current into the narrow passage between the dikes .
i believed i could shoot the bridge myself , and i went to the forward <unk> of logs and relieved the pilot of his pole and his responsibility .
1 .
the seeker after information is referred to appendix e for our captain 's legend of the " swallow 's nest " and " the brothers . "
we went tearing along in a most exhilarating way , and i performed the delicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt ; but perceiving , presently , that i really was going to shoot the bridge itself instead of the archway under it , i judiciously stepped ashore .
the next moment i had my <unk> <name> : i saw a raft wrecked .
it hit the pier in the center and went all to smash and <unk> like a box of matches struck by lightning .
i was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight ; the others were <unk> , for the benefit of the long rank of young ladies who were <unk> on the bank , and so they lost it .
but i helped to fish them out of the river , down below the bridge , and then described it to them as well as i could .
they were not interested , though .
they said they were wet and felt ridiculous and did not care anything for descriptions of scenery .
the young ladies , and other people , crowded around and showed a great deal of sympathy , but that did not help matters ; for my friends said they did not want sympathy , they wanted a back alley and solitude .
chapter xx [ my precious , priceless <unk> ] next morning brought good news  our trunks had arrived from hamburg at last .
let this be a warning to the reader .
the germans are very conscientious , and this trait makes them very particular .
therefore if you tell a <name> you want a thing done immediately , he takes you at your word ; he thinks you mean what you say ; so he does that thing immediately  according to his idea of immediately  which is about a week ; that is , it is a week if it refers to the building of a garment , or it is an hour and a half if it refers to the cooking of a trout .
very well ; if you tell a <name> to send your trunk to you by " slow freight , " he takes you at your word ; he sends it by " slow freight , " and you can not imagine how long you <name> go on enlarging your admiration of the <unk> of that phrase in the <name> tongue , before you get that trunk .
the hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful , when i got it ready for <unk> in hamburg ; it was <unk> when it reached heidelberg .
however , it was still sound , that was a comfort , it was not battered in the least ; the <unk> seemed to be conscientiously careful , in germany , of the baggage entrusted to their hands .
there was nothing now in the way of our departure , therefore we set about our preparations .
naturally my chief solicitude was about my collection of <unk> .
of course i could not take it with me , that would be inconvenient , and dangerous besides .
i took advice , but the best <unk> were divided as to the wisest course to pursue ; some said pack the collection and warehouse it ; others said try to get it into the grand ducal museum at <unk> for safe keeping .
so i divided the collection , and followed the advice of both parties .
i set aside , for the museum , those articles which were the most frail and precious .
among these was my <unk> <unk> .
i have made a little sketch of it here ; that thing creeping up the side is not a bug , it is a hole .
i bought this <unk> of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and fifty dollars .
it is very rare .
the man said the <unk> used to keep tears or something in these things , and that it was very hard to get hold of a broken one , now .
i also set aside my henri ii .
plate .
see sketch from my pencil ; it is in the main correct , though i think i have <unk> one end of it a little too much , perhaps .
this is very fine and rare ; the shape is exceedingly beautiful and unusual .
it has wonderful decorations on it , but i am not able to reproduce them .
it cost more than the <unk> , as the dealer said there was not another plate just like it in the world .
he said there was much false henri ii ware around , but that the genuineness of this piece was unquestionable .
he showed me its pedigree , or its history , if you please ; it was a document which traced this plate 's movements all the way down from its birth  showed who bought it , from whom , and what he paid for it  from the first buyer down to me , whereby i saw that it had gone steadily up from thirty-five cents to seven hundred dollars .
he said that the whole <unk> world would be informed that it was now in my possession and would make a note of it , with the price paid .
[ figure 8 ] there were masters in those days , but , alas  it is not so now .
of course the main <unk> of this piece lies in its color ; it is that old <unk> , pervading , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> blue which is the despair of modern <name> .
the little sketch which i have made of this gem can not and does not do it justice , since i have been obliged to leave out the color .
but i 've got the expression , though .
however , i must not be <unk> away the reader 's time with these details .
i did not intend to go into any detail at all , at first , but it is the failing of the true <unk> , or the true <unk> in any department of <unk> , that once he gets his tongue or his pen started on his darling theme , he can not well stop until he drops from exhaustion .
he has no more sense of the flight of time than has any other lover when talking of his sweetheart .
the very " marks " on the bottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a <unk> ecstasy ; and i could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about whether the <unk> of a departed <unk> <unk> <unk> was genuine or <unk> .
many people say that for a male person , bric-a-brac hunting is about as robust a business as making <unk> , or decorating japanese pots with <unk> butterflies would be , and these people fling mud at the elegant englishman , <unk> , who wrote a book called the bric-a-brac <name> , and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose to call " his despicable trifles " ; and for " gushing " over these trifles ; and for exhibiting his " deep infantile delight " in what they call his " <unk> collection of <unk> trivialities " ; and for beginning his book with a picture of himself seated , in a " <unk> , <unk> attitude , in the midst of his poor little ridiculous bric-a-brac junk shop . "
it is easy to say these things ; it is easy to <unk> us , easy to despise us ; therefore , let these people rail on ; they can not feel as <unk> and i feel  it is their loss , not ours .
for my part i am content to be a <unk> and a <unk>  more , i am proud to be so named .
i am proud to know that i lose my reason as immediately in the presence of a rare jug with an illustrious <name> on the bottom of it , as if i had just emptied that jug .
very well ; i packed and stored a part of my collection , and the rest of it i placed in the care of the grand ducal museum in <unk> , by permission .
my old blue <name> cat remains there yet .
i presented it to that excellent institution .
i had but one misfortune with my things .
an egg which i had kept back from breakfast that morning , was broken in packing .
it was a great pity .
i had shown it to the best <unk> in heidelberg , and they all said it was an antique .
we spent a day or two in farewell visits , and then left for baden-baden .
we had a pleasant trip to it , for the rhine valley is always lovely .
the only trouble was that the trip was too short .
if i remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours , therefore i judge that the distance was very little , if any , over fifty miles .
we quitted the train at <unk> , and walked the entire remaining distance to baden-baden , with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon , the weather being <unk> warm .
we came into town on foot .
one of the first persons we encountered , as we walked up the street , was the rev .
mr.    , an old friend from <name>  a lucky encounter , indeed , for his is a most gentle , refined , and sensitive nature , and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment .
we knew he had been in europe some time , but were not at all expecting to run across him .
both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms , and rev .
mr.    said : " i have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you , and an empty one ready and <unk> to receive what you have got ; we <name> sit up till midnight and have a good satisfying <unk> , for i leave here early in the morning . "
we agreed to that , of course .
i had been vaguely conscious , for a while , of a person who was walking in the street abreast of us ; i had glanced furtively at him once or twice , and noticed that he was a fine , large , vigorous young fellow , with an open , independent countenance , faintly shaded with a pale and even almost imperceptible crop of early down , and that he was clothed from head to heel in cool and enviable snow-white linen .
i thought i had also noticed that his head had a sort of listening tilt to it .
now about this time the rev .
mr.    said : " the sidewalk is hardly wide enough for three , so i <name> walk behind ; but keep the talk going , keep the talk going , there 's no time to lose , and you may be sure i <name> do my share . "
he ranged himself behind us , and straightway that stately snow-white young fellow closed up to the sidewalk alongside him , fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with his broad palm , and <name> out with a hearty <unk> : " americans for <unk> and the money up !
hey ? "
the reverend winced , but said mildly : " yes  we are americans . "
" lord love you , you can just bet that 's what i am , every time !
put it there ! "
he held out his sahara of his palm , and the reverend laid his diminutive hand in it , and got so cordial a shake that we heard his glove burst under it .
" say , did n't i put you up right ? "
" oh , yes . "
" sho !
i spotted you for my kind the minute i heard your clack .
you been over here long ? "
" about four months .
have you been over long ? "
" long ?
well , i should say so !
going on two years , by <unk> !
say , are you homesick ? "
" no , i ca n't say that i am .
are you ? "
" oh , hell , yes ! "
this with immense enthusiasm .
the reverend shrunk a little , in his clothes , and we were aware , rather by instinct than otherwise , that he was throwing out signals of distress to us ; but we did not interfere or try to succor him , for we were quite happy .
the young fellow hooked his arm into the reverend 's , now , with the confiding and grateful air of a waif who has been longing for a friend , and a sympathetic ear , and a chance to <unk> once more the sweet accents of the <unk>  and then he <unk> up the muscles of his mouth and turned himself loose  and with such a relish !
some of his words were not sunday-school words , so i am obliged to put blanks where they occur .
" yes <unk> !
if i ai n't an american there ai n't any americans , that's all .
and when i heard you fellows <unk> away in the good old american language , i 'm    if it was n't all i could do to keep from hugging you !
my tongue 's all warped with trying to curl it around these    forsaken <unk> <unk> <name> words here ; now i tell you it's awful good to lay it over a <name> word once more and kind of let the old taste soak it .
i 'm from western new york .
my name is <unk> adams .
i 'm a student , you know .
been here going on two years .
i 'm learning to be a horse-doctor !
i like that part of it , you know , but    these people , they wo n't learn a fellow in his own language , they make him learn in <name> ; so before i could tackle the <unk> i had to tackle this miserable language .
" first off , i thought it would certainly give me the <unk> , but i don't mind now .
i 've got it where the hair 's short , i think ; and <unk> , they made me learn latin , too .
now between you and me , i would n't give a    for all the latin that was ever <unk> ; and the first thing i calculate to do when i get through , is to just sit down and forget it .
'two n't take me long , and i do n't mind the time , anyway .
and i tell you what !
the difference between <unk> over yonder and <unk> over here  sho !
we do n't know anything about it !
here you 've got to <name> and <name> and <name> and there just ai n't any <unk>  and what you learn here , you 've got to know , <unk>  or else you'll have one of these    <unk> , spectacles , <unk> , <unk> old professors in your hair .
i 've been here long enough , and i 'm getting blessed tired of it , mind i tell you .
the old man wrote me that he was coming over in <name> , and said he 'd take me home in <name> , whether i was done with my education or not , but <unk> him , he did n't come ; never said why ; just sent me a hamper of sunday-school books , and told me to be good , and hold on a while .
i do n't take to sunday-school books , <unk>  i do n't <unk> after them when i can get pie  but i read them , anyway , because whatever the old man tells me to do , that 's the thing that i 'm a-going to do , or tear something , you know .
i buckled in and read all those books , because he wanted me to ; but that kind of thing do n't excite me , i like something hearty .
but i 'm awful homesick .
i 'm homesick from <unk> to <unk> , and from <unk> to <unk> ; but it ai n't any use , i 've got to stay here , till the old man drops the rag and give the word  yes , sir , right here in this    country i 've got to linger till the old man says come !  and you bet your bottom dollar , <name> , it ai n't just as easy as it is for a cat to have twins ! "
at the end of this profane and cordial explosion he fetched a prodigious " <unk> ! "
to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat , and then he straightway dived into his narrative again for " <name> 's " benefit , beginning , " well ,    it ai n't any use talking , some of those old american words do have a kind of a bully swing to them ; a man can express himself with 'em  a man can get at what he wants to say , <unk> . "
when we reached our hotel and it seemed that he was about to lose the reverend , he showed so much sorrow , and begged so hard and so earnestly that the reverend 's heart was not hard enough to hold out against the pleadings  so he went away with the <unk> student , like a right <name> , and took supper with him in his lodgings , and sat in the <unk> of his slang and profanity till near midnight , and then left him  left him pretty well talked out , but grateful " clear down to his frogs , " as he expressed it .
the reverend said it had transpired during the interview that " <unk> " adams 's father was an extensive dealer in horses in western new york ; this accounted for <unk> choice of a profession .
the reverend brought away a pretty high opinion of <unk> as a manly young fellow , with stuff in him for a useful citizen ; he considered him rather a rough gem , but a gem , nevertheless .
chapter xxi [ insolent shopkeepers and <unk> americans ] baden-baden sits in the lap of the hills , and the natural and artificial beauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly .
the level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is laid out in handsome pleasure grounds , shaded by <name> trees and adorned at intervals with lofty and sparkling <unk> .
thrice a day a fine band makes music in the public promenade before the conversation house , and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with <unk> dressed people of both sexes , who march back and forth past the great <unk> and look very much bored , though they make a show of feeling otherwise .
it seems like a rather aimless and stupid existence .
a good many of these people are there for a real purpose , however ; they are racked with rheumatism , and they are there to stew it out in the hot baths .
these invalids looked melancholy enough , limping about on their canes and crutches , and apparently brooding over all sorts of cheerless things .
people say that germany , with her damp stone houses , is the home of rheumatism .
if that is so , providence must have foreseen that it would be so , and therefore filled the land with the healing baths .
perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with medicinal springs as germany .
some of these baths are good for one ailment , some for another ; and again , peculiar ailments are conquered by combining the individual virtues of several different baths .
for instance , for some forms of disease , the patient drinks the native hot water of baden-baden , with a spoonful of salt from the <unk> springs dissolved in it .
that is not a dose to be forgotten right away .
they do n't sell this hot water ; no , you go into the great <unk> , and stand around , first on one foot and then on the other , while two or three young girls sit <unk> at some sort of <unk> <unk> in your neighborhood and ca n't seem to see you  polite as <unk> clerks in government offices .
by and by one of these rises painfully , and " stretches "  stretches fists and body heavenward till she raises her heels from the floor , at the same time refreshing herself with a yawn of such <unk> that the bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to see how she is constructed inside  then she slowly closes her cavern , brings down her fists and her heels , comes languidly forward , <unk> you contemptuously , draws you a glass of hot water and sets it down where you can get it by reaching for it .
you take it and say : " how much ? "
 and she returns you , with elaborate indifference , a beggar 's answer : " nach <unk> " ( what you please . )
this thing of using the common beggar 's trick and the common <unk> <unk> to put you on your liberality when you were expecting a simple straightforward commercial transaction , adds a little to your <unk> sense of irritation .
you ignore her reply , and ask again : " how much ? "
 and she calmly , indifferently , repeats : " nach <unk> . "
you are getting angry , but you are trying not to show it ; you resolve to keep on asking your question till she changes her answer , or at least her <unk> indifferent manner .
therefore , if your case be like mine , you two fools stand there , and without perceptible emotion of any kind , or any emphasis on any syllable , you look blandly into each other's eyes , and hold the following idiotic conversation : " how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
" how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
" how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
" how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
" how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
" how much ? "
" nach <unk> . "
i do not know what another person would have done , but at this point i gave up ; that cast-iron indifference , that tranquil <unk> , conquered me , and i struck my colors .
now i knew she was used to receiving about a <name> from manly people who care nothing about the opinions of <unk> , and about <unk> from moral cowards ; but i laid a silver twenty-five cent piece within her reach and tried to <unk> her up with this sarcastic speech : " if it is n't enough , <name> you stoop sufficiently from your official dignity to say so ? "
she did not <unk> .
without <unk> to look at me at all , she languidly lifted the coin and bit it !  to see if it was good .
then she turned her back and placidly <unk> to her former roost again , tossing the money into an open till as she went along .
she was <name> to the last , you see .
i have enlarged upon the ways of this girl because they are typical ; her manners are the manners of a goodly number of the baden-baden shopkeepers .
the shopkeeper there <unk> you if he can , and insults you whether he succeeds in <unk> you or not .
the keepers of baths also take great and patient pains to insult you .
the <unk> woman who sat at the desk in the lobby of the great <unk> and sold bath tickets , not only insulted me twice every day , with rigid fidelity to her great trust , but she took trouble enough to cheat me out of a shilling , one day , to have fairly entitled her to ten .
<unk> splendid gamblers are gone , only her microscopic knaves remain .
an english gentleman who had been living there several years , said : " if you could disguise your nationality , you would not find any insolence here .
these shopkeepers detest the english and despise the americans ; they are rude to both , more especially to ladies of your nationality and mine .
if these go shopping without a gentleman or a <unk> , they are tolerably sure to be subjected to petty <unk>  <unk> of manner and tone , rather than word , though words that are hard to bear are not always wanting .
i know of an instance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an american <name> with the remark , <unk> uttered , 'we do n't take french money here . '
and i know of a case where an english <name> said to one of these shopkeepers , 'do n't you think you ask too much for this article ? '
and he replied with the question , 'do you think you are obliged to buy it ? '
however , these people are not impolite to russians or germans .
and as to rank , they worship that , for they have long been used to generals and nobles .
if you wish to see what abysses servility can descend , present yourself before a baden-baden shopkeeper in the character of a russian <name> . "
it is an <unk> town , filled with sham , and petty fraud , and <unk> , but the baths are good .
i spoke with many people , and they were all agreed in that .
i had the <unk> of rheumatism unceasingly during three years , but the last one departed after a fortnight 's bathing there , and i have never had one since .
i fully believe i left my rheumatism in baden-baden .
baden-baden is welcome to it .
it was little , but it was all i had to give .
i would have preferred to leave something that was catching , but it was not in my power .
there are several hot springs there , and during two thousand years they have poured forth a <unk> abundance of the healing water .
this water is conducted in pipe to the numerous <unk> , and is reduced to an <unk> temperature by the addition of cold water .
the new <unk> is a very large and beautiful building , and in it one may have any sort of bath that has ever been invented , and with all the additions of herbs and drugs that his ailment may need or that the physician of the establishment may consider a useful thing to put into the water .
you go there , enter the great door , get a bow graduated to your style and clothes from the gorgeous portier , and a bath ticket and an insult from the <unk> woman for a quarter ; she strikes a <name> and a <unk> conducts you down a long hall and shuts you into a commodious room which has a washstand , a mirror , a <unk> , and a sofa in it , and there you undress at your leisure .
the room is divided by a great curtain ; you draw this curtain aside , and find a large white marble <unk> , with its rim sunk to the level of the floor , and with three white marble steps leading down to it .
this tub is full of water which is as clear as <name> , and is tempered to 28 degrees <unk> ( about 95 degrees <unk> ) .
sunk into the floor , by the tub , is a covered copper box which contains some warm towels and a sheet .
you look fully as white as an <name> when you are stretched out in that limpid bath .
you remain in it ten minutes , the first time , and afterward increase the duration from day to day , till you reach twenty-five or thirty minutes .
there you stop .
the appointments of the place are so luxurious , the benefit so marked , the price so moderate , and the insults so sure , that you very soon find yourself adoring the <unk> and <unk> it .
we had a plain , simple , unpretending , good hotel , in baden-baden  the <unk> de <name>  and alongside my room i had a giggling , <unk> , chattering family who always went to bed just two hours after me and always got up two hours ahead of me .
but this is common in <name> hotels ; the people generally go to bed long after eleven and get up long before eight .
the partitions convey sound like a <unk> , and everybody knows it ; but no matter , a <name> family who are all kindness and consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate their noises for your benefit at night .
they <name> sing , laugh , and talk loudly , and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way .
if you knock on your wall appealingly , they <name> quiet down and discuss the matter softly among themselves for a moment  then , like the mice , they fall to persecuting you again , and as vigorously as before .
they keep cruelly late and early hours , for such noisy folk .
of course , when one begins to find fault with foreign people 's ways , he is very likely to get a reminder to look nearer home , before he gets far with it .
i open my note-book to see if i can find some more information of a valuable nature about baden-baden , and the first thing i fall upon is this : " baden-baden ( no date ) .
lot of <unk> americans at breakfast this morning .
talking at everybody , while pretending to talk among themselves .
on their first travels , manifestly .
showing off .
the usual signs  airy , easy-going references to grand distances and foreign places .
'well good-by , old fellow  if i do n't run across you in italy , you hunt me up in london before you sail . ' "
the next item which i find in my note-book is this one : " the fact that a band of 6,000 indians are now murdering our frontiersmen at their impudent leisure , and that we are only able to send 1,200 soldiers against them , is <unk> here to discourage emigration to <name> .
the common people think the indians are in new jersey . "
this is a new and peculiar argument against keeping our army down to a ridiculous figure in the matter of <name> .
it is rather a striking one , too .
i have not distorted the truth in saying that the facts in the above item , about the army and the indians , are made use of to discourage emigration to <name> .
that the common people should be rather foggy in their geography , and foggy as to the location of the indians , is a matter for amusement , maybe , but not of surprise .
there is an interesting old cemetery in baden-baden , and we spent several pleasant hours in wandering through it and spelling out the inscriptions on the aged <unk> .
apparently after a man has laid there a century or two , and has had a good many people buried on top of him , it is considered that his tombstone is not needed by him any longer .
i judge so from the fact that hundreds of old <unk> have been removed from the graves and placed against the inner walls of the cemetery .
what artists they had in the old times !
they <unk> angels and <unk> and devils and skeletons on the <unk> in the most lavish and generous way  as to supply  but curiously grotesque and outlandish as to form .
it is not always easy to tell which of the figures belong among the blest and which of them among the opposite party .
but there was an inscription , in french , on one of those old stones , which was quaint and pretty , and was plainly not the work of any other than a poet .
it was to this effect : here <unk> in god , <name> de <unk> , a <unk> of st. <name> aged 83 years  and blind .
the light was restored to her in <unk> the 5th of <name> , 1839 we made several excursions on foot to the neighboring villages , over winding and beautiful roads and through enchanting woodland scenery .
the woods and roads were similar to those at heidelberg , but not so bewitching .
i suppose that roads and woods which are up to the heidelberg <name> are rare in the world .
once we wandered clear away to la <unk> palace , which is several miles from baden-baden .
the grounds about the palace were fine ; the palace was a curiosity .
it was built by a <unk> in <unk> , and remains as she left it at her death .
we wandered through a great many of its rooms , and they all had striking peculiarities of decoration .
for instance , the walls of one room were pretty completely covered with small pictures of the <unk> in all conceivable varieties of fanciful costumes , some of them male .
the walls of another room were covered with <unk> and elaborately figured <unk> tapestry .
the musty ancient beds remained in the chambers , and their <unk> and curtains and <unk> were decorated with curious <unk> , and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical and <unk> scenes in glaring colors .
there was enough crazy and rotten rubbish in the building to make a true <unk> green with envy .
a painting in the <unk> <unk> upon the indelicate  but then the <unk> was herself a trifle indelicate .
it is in every way a wildly and picturesquely decorated house , and brimful of interest as a reflection of the character and tastes of that rude bygone time .
in the grounds , a few rods from the palace , stands the <unk> chapel , just as she left it  a coarse wooden structure , wholly barren of ornament .
it is said that the <unk> would give herself up to <unk> and exceedingly fast living for several months at a time , and then retire to this miserable wooden den and spend a few months in <unk> and getting ready for another good time .
she was a devoted catholic , and was perhaps quite a model sort of a <name> as christians went then , in high life .
tradition says she spent the last two years of her life in the strange den i have been speaking of , after having indulged herself in one final , triumphant , and satisfying spree .
she shut herself up there , without company , and without even a servant , and so <unk> and forsook the world .
in her little bit of a kitchen she did her own cooking ; she wore a hair shirt next the skin , and <unk> herself with whips  these aids to <name> are exhibited there yet .
she prayed and told her beads , in another little room , before a waxen virgin <unk> in a little box against the wall ; she bedded herself like a slave .
in another small room is an unpainted wooden table , and behind it sit <unk> waxen figures of the holy family , made by the very worst artist that ever lived , perhaps , and clothed in gaudy , flimsy drapery .
[ 1 ] the <unk> used to bring her meals to this table and dine with the holy family .
what an idea that was !
what a grisly spectacle it must have been !
imagine it : those rigid , <unk> figures , with <unk> complexions and fish glass eyes , occupying one side of the table in the constrained attitudes and dead <unk> that distinguish all men that are born of wax , and this wrinkled , <unk> old <unk> occupying the other side , mumbling her prayers and munching her sausages in the ghostly stillness and shadowy <unk> of a <name> twilight .
it makes one feel <unk> even to think of it .
[ 1 ] the savior was represented as a lad of about fifteen years of age .
this figure had lost one eye .
in this sordid place , and clothed , bedded , and fed like a pauper , this strange <name> lived and worshiped during two years , and in it she died .
two or three hundred years ago , this would have made the poor den holy ground ; and the church would have set up a <unk> there and made plenty of money out of it .
the den could be moved into some portions of <name> and made a good property even now .

we were on foot most of the time .
one can not describe those <name> woods , nor the feeling with which they inspire him .
a feature of the feeling , however , is a deep sense of contentment ; another feature of it is a buoyant , boyish gladness ; and a third and very conspicuous feature of it is one 's sense of the remoteness of the <unk> world and his entire emancipation from it and its affairs .
those woods stretch unbroken over a vast region ; and everywhere they are such dense woods , and so still , and so <unk> and fragrant .
the stems of the trees are trim and straight , and in many places all the ground is hidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color , with not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface , and not a fallen leaf or twig to mar its immaculate <unk> .
a <name> cathedral gloom pervades the pillared aisles ; so the stray <unk> of sunlight that strike a trunk here and a bough yonder are strongly <unk> , and when they strike the moss they fairly seem to burn .
but the <unk> effect , and the most enchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon sun ; no single <name> is able to pierce its way in , then , but the diffused light takes color from moss and foliage , and pervades the place like a faint , <unk> mist , the theatrical fire of fairyland .
the suggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at all times is intensified by this unearthly glow .
we found the black forest farmhouses and villages all that the black forest stories have pictured them .
the first genuine specimen which we came upon was the mansion of a <name> farmer and member of the common council of the parish or district .
he was an important personage in the land and so was his wife also , of course .
his daughter was the " catch " of the region , and she may be already entering into immortality as the heroine of one of <unk> 's novels , for all i know .
we shall see , for if he puts her in i shall recognize her by her black forest clothes , and her burned complexion , her plump figure , her fat hands , her dull expression , her gentle spirit , her generous feet , her <unk> head , and the plaited tails of <unk> hair hanging down her back .
the house was big enough for a hotel ; it was a hundred feet long and fifty wide , and ten feet high , from ground to eaves ; but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet , or maybe even more .
this roof was of ancient <unk> straw thatch a foot thick , and was covered all over , except in a few trifling spots , with a thriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation , mainly moss .
the <unk> spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new masses of yellow straw .
the eaves projected far down , like sheltering , hospitable wings .
across the gable that fronted the road , and about ten feet above the ground , ran a narrow porch , with a wooden railing ; a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon the porch .
above were two or three other little windows , one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof .
before the <unk> door was a huge pile of manure .
the door of the <unk> room on the side of the house was open , and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow .
was this probably the drawing-room ?
all of the front half of the house from the ground up seemed to be occupied by the people , the cows , and the chickens , and all the rear half by <unk> and hay .
but the chief feature , all around this house , was the big heaps of manure .
we became very familiar with the <unk> in the forest .
we fell unconsciously into the habit of judging of a man 's station in life by this outward and eloquent sign .
sometimes we said , " here is a poor devil , this is manifest . "
when we saw a stately accumulation , we said , " here is a banker . "
when we encountered a <unk> surrounded by an alpine pomp of manure , we said , " doubtless a duke lives here . "
the importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the black forest stories .
manure is evidently the <unk> 's main treasure  his coin , his <name> , his pride , his old master , his <unk> , his bric-a-brac , his darling , his title to public consideration , envy , veneration , and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his <name> .
the true black forest novel , if it is ever written , <name> be <unk> somewhat in this way : skeleton for a black forest novel <name> old farmer , named <unk> .
has inherited great wealth of manure , and by diligence has added to it .
it is <unk> in baedeker .
[ 1 ] the black forest artist paints it  his masterpiece .
the king comes to see it .
<name> <unk> , daughter and heiress .
<name> <unk> , young neighbor , suitor for <unk> hand  ostensibly ; he really wants the manure .
<unk> has a good many <unk> of the black forest currency himself , and therefore is a good catch ; but he is sordid , mean , and without sentiment , whereas <name> is all sentiment and poetry .
<name> schmidt , young neighbor , full of sentiment , full of poetry , loves <name> , <name> loves him .
but he has no manure .
old <unk> forbids him in the house .
his heart breaks , he goes away to die in the woods , far from the cruel world  for he says , bitterly , " what is man , without manure ? "

bookkeeper : " i have found it . "
" where ? "

<name> : " listen then .

i fed upon roots , and in my bitterness i dug for the bitterest , loathing the sweeter kind .
digging , three days <unk> , i struck a manure mine !  a <unk> , a limitless bonanza , of solid manure !
i can buy you all , and have mountain ranges of manure left !
<unk> , now thou <unk> a smile ! "
[ immense sensation . ]

old <unk> ( enthusiastically ) : " wake her up , shake her up , <name> young man , she is yours ! "
wedding takes place on the spot ; bookkeeper restored to his office and <unk> ; <name> <unk> led off to jail .
the bonanza king of the black forest lives to a good old age , blessed with the love of his wife and of his twenty-seven children , and the still sweeter envy of everybody around .
we took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the plow inn , in a very pretty village ( <unk> ) , and then went into the public room to rest and smoke .
there we found nine or ten black forest grandees assembled around a table .
they were the common council of the parish .
they had gathered there at eight o'clock that morning to elect a new member , and they had now been drinking beer four hours at the new member 's expense .
they were men of fifty or sixty years of age , with grave good-natured faces , and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the black forest stories ; broad , <unk> black felt hats with the <unk> curled up all round ; long red <unk> with large metal buttons , black alpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders .
there were no speeches , there was but little talk , there were no <unk> ; the council filled themselves gradually , steadily , but surely , with beer , and conducted themselves with sedate decorum , as became men of position , men of influence , men of manure .
we had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley , along the grassy bank of a rushing stream of clear water , past farmhouses , <unk> , and no end of wayside <unk> and saints and virgins .
these <unk> , etc. , are set up in memory of departed friends , by survivors , and are almost as frequent as <unk> are in other lands .
we followed the <unk> , and had our usual luck ; we traveled under a beating sun , and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we could get to them .
in all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike a piece of road at its time for being shady .
we had a particularly hot time of it on that particular afternoon , and with no comfort but what we could get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep <unk> above our heads were even worse off than we were .
by and by it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat any longer ; so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool twilight of the forest , to hunt for what the guide-book called the " old road . "
we found an old road , and it proved eventually to be the right one , though we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the wrong one .
if it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying ; therefore we did not hurry , but sat down frequently on the soft moss and enjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes .
there had been <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> , peasants , wagons , troops of <unk> students from all over germany  but we had the old road to ourselves .
now and then , while we rested , we watched the laborious ant at his work .
i found nothing new in him  certainly nothing to change my opinion of him .
it seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a strangely overrated bird .
during many summers , now , i have watched him , when i ought to have been in better business , and i have not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one .
i refer to the ordinary ant , of course ; i have had no experience of those wonderful swiss and african ones which vote , keep drilled armies , hold slaves , and dispute about religion .
those particular ants may be all that the naturalist paints them , but i am persuaded that the average ant is a sham .
i admit his industry , of course ; he is the <unk> creature in the world  when anybody is looking  but his <unk> is the point i make against him .
he goes out <unk> , he makes a capture , and then what does he do ?
go home ?
no  he goes anywhere but home .
he does n't know where home is .
his home may be only three feet away  no matter , he ca n't find it .
he makes his capture , as i have said ; it is generally something which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else ; it is usually seven times bigger than it ought to be ; he hunts out the <unk> place to take hold of it ; he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force , and starts ; not toward home , but in the opposite direction ; not calmly and wisely , but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength ; he fetches up against a pebble , and instead of going around it , he climbs over it backward dragging his booty after him , tumbles down on the other side , jumps up in a passion , kicks the dust off his clothes , <unk> his hands , <unk> his property viciously , <unk> it this way , then that , <unk> it ahead of him a moment , turns tail and <unk> it after him another moment , gets madder and madder , then presently <unk> it into the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction ; comes to a weed ; it never occurs to him to go around it ; no , he must climb it ; and he does climb it , dragging his worthless property to the top  which is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to <name> a sack of flour from heidelberg to <name> by way of <unk> steeple ; when he gets up there he finds that that is not the place ; takes a cursory glance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down , and starts off once more  as usual , in a new direction .
at the end of half an hour , he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his burden down ; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards around , and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across .
now he <unk> the sweat from his brow , strokes his limbs , and then marches aimlessly off , in as violently a hurry as ever .
he does not remember to have ever seen it before ; he looks around to see which is not the way home , <unk> his bundle and starts ; he goes through the same adventures he had before ; finally stops to rest , and a friend comes along .
evidently the friend remarks that a last year 's grasshopper leg is a very <name> acquisition , and <unk> where he got it .
evidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it , but thinks he got it " around here somewhere . "
evidently the friend contracts to help him freight it home .
then , with a judgment peculiarly <unk> ( pun not intended ) , they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions .
presently they take a rest and confer together .
they decide that something is wrong , they ca n't make out what .
then they go at it again , just as before .
same result .
mutual recriminations follow .
evidently each <unk> the other of being an <unk> .
they lock themselves together and chew each other 's jaws for a while ; then they roll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs .
they make up and go to work again in the same old insane way , but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage ; tug as he may , the other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it .
instead of giving up , he hangs on , and gets his shins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way .
by and by , when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old ground once more , it is finally dumped at about the spot where it originally lay , the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after all , and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he ca n't find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want to own it .
there in the black forest , on the mountainside , i saw an ant go through with such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times his own weight .
the spider was not quite dead , but too far gone to resist .
he had a round body the size of a pea .
the little ant  observing that i was noticing  turned him on his back , sunk his fangs into his throat , lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him , stumbling over little pebbles , stepping on the spider 's legs and tripping himself up , dragging him backward , shoving him bodily ahead , dragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them , climbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their summits  and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be confiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him .
i measured the ground which this ass traversed , and arrived at the conclusion that what he had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some such job as this  relatively speaking  for a man ; to wit : to strap two <unk> horses together , <name> them eighteen hundred feet , mainly over ( not around ) boulders <unk> six feet high , and in the course of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice like niagara , and three <unk> , each a hundred and twenty feet high ; and then put the horses down , in an exposed place , without anybody to watch them , and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for vanity 's sake .
science has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything for <name> use .
this <name> knock him out of literature , to some extent .
he does not work , except when people are looking , and only then when the observer has a green , <unk> look , and seems to be taking notes .
this amounts to deception , and <name> injure him for the <unk> .
he has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what is n't .
this amounts to ignorance , and <name> impair the world 's respect for him .
he can not stroll around a stump and find his way home again .
this amounts to <unk> , and once the damaging fact is established , thoughtful people <name> cease to look up to him , the sentimental <name> cease to <unk> him .
his <unk> industry is but a vanity and of no effect , since he never gets home with anything he starts with .
this disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent , since it <name> make the <unk> hesitate to go to him any more .
it is strange , beyond comprehension , that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out .
the ant is strong , but we saw another strong thing , where we had not suspected the presence of much muscular power before .
a <unk>  that vegetable which springs to full growth in a single night  had torn loose and lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk into the air , and supported it there , like a column supporting a shed .
ten thousand <unk> , with the right purchase , could lift a man , i suppose .
but what good would it do ?
all our afternoon 's progress had been uphill .
about five or half past we reached the summit , and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun and their <unk> sides dimmed with purple shade .
the gorge under our feet  called <unk>  afforded room in the grassy level at its head for a cozy and delightful human nest , shut away from the world and its <unk> , and consequently the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out ; and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven hundred years ago in <unk> out the choicest nooks and corners in a land as priests have today .
a big hotel crowds the ruins a little , now , and drives a brisk trade with summer tourists .
we descended into the gorge and had a supper which would have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled .
the germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to their own devices .
this is an argument of some value in support of the theory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the coast of scotland .
a schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one of those islands a few years ago , and the gentle savages rendered the captain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as they wanted .
next day he asked them how they liked them .
they shook their heads and said : " baked , they were tough ; and even boiled , they war n't things for a hungry man to <unk> after . "
we went down the <name> after supper .
it is beautiful  a mixture of sylvan loveliness and <unk> wildness .
a limpid torrent goes whistling down the <name> , and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between lofty precipices and <unk> itself over a succession of falls .
after one passes the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which is very pleasing  they rise in a <unk> stairway of <unk> and glittering cascades , and make a picture which is as charming as it is unusual .
chapter xxiii [ nicodemus dodge and the skeleton ] we were satisfied that we could walk to <unk> in one day , now that we were in practice ; so we set out the next morning after breakfast determined to do it .
it was all the way downhill , and we had the loveliest summer weather for it .
so we set the <unk> and then stretched away on an easy , regular stride , down through the cloven forest , drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing draughts , and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but walk to <unk> and keep on doing it and then doing it over again .
now , the true charm of <unk> does not lie in the walking , or in the scenery , but in the talking .
the walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by , and to keep the blood and the <name> stirred up and active ; the scenery and the <unk> smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense ; but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk .
it is no matter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense , the case is the same , the bulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the <unk> jaw and the flapping of the sympathetic ear .
and what motley variety of subjects a couple of people <name> casually rake over in the course of a day 's tramp !
there being no constraint , a change of subject is always in order , and so a body is not likely to keep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome .
we discussed everything we knew , during the first fifteen or twenty minutes , that morning , and then branched out into the glad , free , boundless realm of the things we were not certain about .
<name> said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly habit of doubling up his " <unk> " he could never get rid of it while he lived .
that is to say , if a man gets the habit of saying " i should have liked to have known more about it " instead of saying simply and sensibly , " i should have liked to know more about it , " that man's disease is incurable .
<name> said that his sort of lapse is to be found in every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in english , and in almost all of our books .
he said he had observed it in <unk> grammar and in macaulay .
<name> believed that <unk> are commoner in men 's mouths than those " <unk> <unk> . "
i do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the present session when i should have been very glad to have accepted the proposal of my <name> friend , and to have exchanged parts in some of our evenings of <unk>  [ from a speech of the english chancellor of the <unk> , <name> , 1879 . ]
that changed the subject to <unk> .
i said i believed the average man dreaded <unk> more than amputation , and that he would yell quicker under the former operation than he would under the latter .
the philosopher <name> said that the average man would not yell in either case if he had an audience .
then he continued : " when our brigade first went into camp on the <unk> , we used to be brought up standing , occasionally , by an <unk> howl of anguish .
that meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent .
but the surgeons soon changed that ; they instituted <unk> <unk> .
there never was a howl afterward  that is , from the man who was having the tooth pulled .
at the daily <unk> hour there would always be about five hundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that <unk> chair waiting to see the performance  and help ; and the moment the surgeon took a grip on the candidate 's tooth and began to lift , every one of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and begin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had !
it was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous unanimous <unk> burst out !
with so big and so derisive an audience as that , a sufferer wouldn't emit a sound though you pulled his head off .
the surgeons said that pretty often a patient was compelled to laugh , in the midst of his pangs , but that they had never caught one crying out , after the <unk> exhibition was instituted . "
<unk> surgeons suggested doctors , doctors suggested death , death suggested skeletons  and so , by a logical process the conversation melted out of one of these subjects and into the next , until the topic of skeletons raised up nicodemus dodge out of the deep grave in my memory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twenty-five years .
when i was a boy in a printing-office in missouri , a <unk> , long-legged , <unk> , <unk> <unk> cub of about sixteen lounged in one day , and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat , whose broken rim <name> limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a <unk> cabbage leaf , stared indifferently around , then leaned his hip against the editor 's table , crossed his mighty <unk> , aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth , laid him low , and said with composure : " whar 's the boss ? "
" i am the boss , " said the editor , following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its <unk> with his eye .
" do n't want anybody fur to learn the business , 'tai n't likely ? "
" well , i do n't know .
would you like to learn it ? "
" pap 's so po ' he <unk> n't run me no mo ' , so i want to git a show somers if i kin , <unk> no <unk> what  i 'm strong and hearty , and i do n't turn my back on no kind of work , hard nur soft . "
" do you think you would like to learn the printing business ? "
" well , i do n't <unk> <unk> a <unk> what i do learn , so 's i git a chance fur to make my way .
i 'd jist as soon learn <unk> 's anything . "
" can you read ? "
" yes  middlin ' . "
" write ? "
" well , i 've seed people could lay over me thar . "
" cipher ? "
" not good enough to keep store , i do n't reckon , but up as fur as <unk> i ai n't no slouch .
<unk> side of that is what gits me . "
" where is your home ? "
" i 'm f 'm old <name> . "
" what 's your father 's religious denomination ? "
" him ?
oh , he 's a blacksmith . "
" no , no  i do n't mean his trade .
what 's his religious denomination ? "
" oh  i did n't understand you befo ' .
he 's a <unk> . "
" no , no , you do n't get my meaning yet .
what i mean is , does he belong to any church ? "
" now you 're talkin ' !
could n't make out what you was <unk> ' to git through yo ' head no way .
<unk> to a church !
why , boss , he 's <name> the <unk> kind of <unk> <unk> ' for forty year .
they ai n't no <unk> ones 'n what he is .
mighty good man , pap is .
everybody says that .
if they said any <unk> they would n't say it whar i wuz  not much they would n't . "
" what is your own religion ? "
" well , boss , you 've kind o ' got me , there  and yit you <name> n't got me so mighty much , nuther .
i think 't if a feller <unk> another feller when he 's in trouble , and do n't cuss , and do n't do no mean things , nur noth'n ' he ain ' no business to do , and do n't spell the saviour 's name with a little g , he ai n't runnin ' no <unk>  he 's about as <unk> as he <unk> to a church . "
" but suppose he did spell it with a little g  what then ? "
" well , if he done it <unk> , i reckon he would n't stand no chance  he ought n't to have no chance , anyway , i 'm most rotten certain 'bout that . "
" what is your name ? "
" nicodemus dodge . "
" i think maybe you 'll do , nicodemus .
we 'll give you a trial , anyway . "
" all right . "
" when would you like to begin ? "
" now . "
so , within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us , and with his coat off and hard at it .
beyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street , was a deserted garden , <unk> , and thickly grown with the <unk> and villainous " <unk> " weed and its common friend the stately sunflower .
in the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little " frame " house with but one room , one window , and no ceiling  it had been a <unk> a generation before .
nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber .
the village <unk> recognized a treasure in nicodemus , right away  a butt to play jokes on .
it was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding .
<name> jones had the <name> of <unk> the first joke on him ; he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and winked to the crowd to come ; the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of nicodemus 's eyebrows and eyelashes .
he simply said : " i consider them kind of <unk> <unk> , "  and seemed to suspect nothing .
the next evening nicodemus waylaid <name> and poured a bucket of ice-water over him .
one day , while nicodemus was in swimming , <name> <unk> " tied " his clothes .
nicodemus made a bonfire of <name> 's by way of retaliation .
a third joke was played upon nicodemus a day or two later  he walked up the middle aisle of the village church , <name> night , with a staring <unk> pinned between his shoulders .
the joker spent the remainder of the night , after church , in the cellar of a deserted house , and nicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward <unk> to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made , some rough treatment would be the consequence .
the cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it , and was <unk> with six inches of soft mud .
but i wander from the point .
it was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection .
before a very long time had elapsed , the village <unk> began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from " old <name> . "
<unk> grew scarce and <unk> .
now the young doctor came to the rescue .
there was delight and applause when he proposed to scare nicodemus to death , and explained how he was going to do it .
he had a <name> new skeleton  the skeleton of the late and only local celebrity , <name> finn , the village drunkard  a grisly piece of property which he had bought of <name> finn himself , at auction , for fifty dollars , under great competition , when <name> lay very sick in the <unk> a fortnight before his death .
the fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton .
the doctor would put <name> finn 's skeleton in nicodemus 's bed !
this was done  about half past ten in the evening .
about <unk> usual bedtime  midnight  the village <unk> came creeping stealthily through the <unk> weeds and <unk> toward the lonely frame den .
they reached the window and peeped in .
there sat the long-legged pauper , on his bed , in a very short shirt , and nothing more ; he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth , and wheezing the music of " camptown races " out of a <unk> comb which he was pressing against his mouth ; by him lay a new <unk> , a new top , and solid india-rubber ball , a handful of painted marbles , five pounds of " store " <name> , and a <unk> slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of <unk> .
he had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result !
just as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into the subject of fossils , <name> and i heard a shout , and glanced up the steep hillside .
we saw men and women standing away up there looking frightened , and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down the steep slope toward us .
we got out of the way , and when the object landed in the road it proved to be a boy .
he had tripped and fallen , and there was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might come .
when one starts to roll down a place like that , there is no stopping till the bottom is reached .
think of people farming on a slant which is so steep that the best you can say of it  if you want to be <unk> accurate  is , that it is a little steeper than a ladder and not quite so steep as a mansard roof .
but that is what they do .
some of the little farms on the hillside opposite heidelberg were stood up " <unk> . "
the boy was wonderfully jolted up , and his head was bleeding , from cuts which it had got from small stones on the way .
<name> and i gathered him up and set him on a stone , and by that time the men and women had scampered down and brought his cap .
men , women , and children flocked out from neighboring cottages and joined the crowd ; the pale boy was petted , and stared at , and <unk> , and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his bruises in .
and such another clatter of tongues !
all who had seen the catastrophe were describing it at once , and each trying to talk louder than his neighbor ; and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way up the hill , called attention , tripped , fell , rolled down among us , and thus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done .
<name> and i were included in all the descriptions ; how we were coming along ; how <name> gross shouted ; how we looked up startled ; how we saw <name> coming like a <unk> ; how judiciously we got out of the way , and let him come ; and with what presence of mind we picked him up and brushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over .
we were as much heroes as anybody else , except <name> , and were so recognized ; we were taken with <name> and the populace to peter's mother 's cottage , and there we ate bread and cheese , and drank milk and beer with everybody , and had a most sociable good time ; and when we left we had a handshake all around , and were receiving and shouting back <unk> wohl 's until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly new friends forever .
we accomplished our undertaking .
at half past eight in the evening we stepped into <unk> , just eleven hours and a half out of <unk>  one hundred and forty-six miles .
this is the distance by <unk> ; the guide-book and the imperial ordinance maps make it only ten and a quarter  a surprising blunder , for these two authorities are usually singularly accurate in the matter of distances .
chapter xxiv [ i protect the empress of germany ] that was a thoroughly satisfactory walk  and the only one we were ever to have which was all the way downhill .
we took the train next morning and returned to baden-baden through fearful fogs of dust .
every seat was crowded , too ; for it was <name> , and consequently everybody was taking a " pleasure " excursion .
hot !
the sky was an oven  and a sound one , too , with no cracks in it to let in any air .
an odd time for a pleasure excursion , certainly !
<name> is the great day on the continent  the free day , the happy day .
one can break the sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin .
we do not work on <name> , because the commandment forbids it ; the germans do not work on <name> , because the commandment forbids it .
we rest on <name> , because the commandment requires it ; the germans rest on <name> because the commandment requires it .
but in the definition of the word " rest " lies all the difference .
with us , its <name> meaning is , stay in the house and keep still ; with the germans its <name> and week-day meanings seem to be the same  rest the tired part , and never mind the other parts of the frame ; rest the tired part , and use the means best calculated to rest that particular part .
thus : if one's duties have kept him in the house all the week , it <name> rest him to be out on <name> ; if his duties have required him to read weighty and serious matter all the week , it <name> rest him to read light matter on <name> ; if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the week , it <name> rest him to go to the theater <name> night and put in two or three hours laughing at a comedy ; if he is tired with digging ditches or <unk> trees all the week , it <name> rest him to lie quiet in the house on <name> ; if the hand , the arm , the <name> , the tongue , or any other member , is fatigued with <unk> , it is not to be rested by <unk> a day 's <unk> ; but if a member is fatigued with exertion , <unk> is the right rest for it .
such is the way in which the germans seem to define the word " rest " ; that is to say , they rest a member by <unk> , <unk> , restoring its forces .
but our definition is less broad .
we all rest alike on <name>  by <unk> ourselves and keeping still , whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or not .
the germans make the actors , the preachers , etc. , work on <name> .
we encourage the preachers , the editors , the printers , etc. , to work on <name> , and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us ; but i do not know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for the printer to work at his trade on <name> it must be equally wrong for the preacher to work at his , since the commandment has made no exception in his favor .
we buy monday morning 's paper and read it , and thus encourage <name> printing .
but i shall never do it again .
the germans remember the <unk> to keep it holy , by <unk> from work , as commanded ; we keep it holy by <unk> from work , as commanded , and by also <unk> from play , which is not commanded .
perhaps we <unk> break the command to rest , because the resting we do is in most cases only a name , and not a fact .
these reasonings have sufficed , in a measure , to mend the rent in my conscience which i made by traveling to baden-baden that <name> .
we arrived in time to <unk> up and get to the english church before services began .
we arrived in considerable style , too , for the landlord had ordered the first carriage that could be found , since there was no time to lose , and our coachman was so splendidly <unk> that we were probably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes ; why else were we honored with a pew all to ourselves , away up among the very elect at the left of the chancel ?
that was my first thought .
in the pew directly in front of us sat an elderly <name> , plainly and cheaply dressed ; at her side sat a young <name> with a very sweet face , and she also was quite simply dressed ; but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it would do anybody 's heart good to worship in .
i thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly <name> was embarrassed at finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap apparel ; i began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her .
she tried to seem very busy with her <unk> and her responses , and unconscious that she was out of place , but i said to myself , " she is not succeeding  there is a distressed <unk> in her voice which betrays increasing embarrassment . "
presently the savior 's name was mentioned , and in her flurry she lost her head completely , and rose and <unk> , instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did .
the sympathetic blood surged to my temples and i turned and gave those fine birds what i intended to be a beseeching look , but my feelings got the better of me and changed it into a look which said , " if any of you pets of fortune laugh at this poor soul , you <name> deserve to be flayed for it . "
things went from bad to worse , and i shortly found myself mentally taking the <unk> <name> under my protection .
my mind was wholly upon her .
i forgot all about the sermon .
her embarrassment took stronger and stronger hold upon her ; she got to snapping the lid of her <unk>  it made a loud , sharp sound , but in her trouble she snapped and snapped away , unconscious of what she was doing .
the last extremity was reached when the <unk> began its rounds ; the moderate people threw in pennies , the nobles and the <name> contributed silver , but she laid a <unk> gold piece upon the <unk> before her with a sounding slap !
i said to myself , " she has parted with all her little hoard to buy the consideration of these <unk> people  it is a sorrowful spectacle . "
i did not venture to look around this time ; but as the service closed , i said to myself , " let them laugh , it is their opportunity ; but at the door of this church they shall see her step into our fine carriage with us , and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home . "
then she rose  and all the congregation stood while she walked down the aisle .
she was the empress of germany !
no  she had not been so much embarrassed as i had supposed .
my imagination had got started on the wrong scent , and that is always hopeless ; one is sure , then , to go straight on <unk> everything , clear through to the end .
the young <name> with her imperial majesty was a maid of honor  and i had been taking her for one of her boarders , all the time .
this is the only time i have ever had an empress under my personal protection ; and considering my inexperience , i wonder i got through with it so well .
i should have been a little embarrassed myself if i had known earlier what sort of a contract i had on my hands .
we found that the empress had been in baden-baden several days .
it is said that she never attends any but the english form of church service .
i lay abed and read and rested from my journey 's fatigues the remainder of that <name> , but i sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon service , for i never allow anything to interfere with my habit of attending church twice every <name> .
there was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band play the " <unk> . "
this piece tells one of the old legends of the region ; how a great <name> of the middle ages got lost in the mountains , and wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm , until at last the faint tones of a monastery <name> , calling the monks to a midnight service , caught his ear , and he followed the direction the sounds came from and was saved .
a beautiful air ran through the music , without ceasing , sometimes loud and strong , sometimes so soft that it could hardly be distinguished  but it was always there ; it swung grandly along through the shrill whistling of the <unk> , the rattling patter of the rain , and the boom and crash of the thunder ; it wound soft and low through the lesser sounds , the distant ones , such as the throbbing of the convent <name> , the melodious winding of the <name> 's horn , the distressed <unk> of his dogs , and the solemn chanting of the monks ; it rose again , with a jubilant ring , and mingled itself with the country songs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to cheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper .
the instruments imitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness .
more than one man started to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets of mimic rain came driving by ; it was hardly possible to keep from putting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and shriek ; and it was not possible to refrain from starting when those sudden and charmingly real <unk> were let loose .
i suppose the " <unk> " is a very <unk> music ; i know , indeed , that it must be <unk> music , because it delighted me , warmed me , moved me , stirred me , uplifted me , <unk> me , that i was full of cry all the time , and mad with enthusiasm .
my soul had never had such a scouring out since i was born .
the solemn and majestic chanting of the monks was not done by instruments , but by men 's voices ; and it rose and fell , and rose again in that <name> confusion of warring sounds , and pulsing bells , and the stately swing of that <unk> enchanting air , and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of <unk> music could be so divinely beautiful .
the great crowd which the " <unk> " had called out was another evidence that it was <unk> music ; for only the few are educated up to a point where <unk> music gives pleasure .
i have never heard enough classic music to be able to enjoy it .
i dislike the opera because i want to love it and ca n't .
i suppose there are two kinds of music  one kind which one feels , just as an oyster might , and another sort which requires a higher faculty , a faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching .
yet if base music gives certain of us wings , why should we want any other ?
but we do .
we want it because the higher and better like it .
we want it without giving it the necessary time and trouble ; so we climb into that upper tier , that <unk> , by a lie ; we pretend we like it .
i know several of that sort of people  and i propose to be one of them myself when i get home with my fine european education .
and then there is painting .
what a red rag is to a bull , turner 's " slave ship " was to me , before i studied <name> .
mr. ruskin is educated in <name> up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage , last year , when i was ignorant .
his cultivation enables him  and me , now  to see water in that glaring yellow mud , and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame , and crimson sunset glories ; it <unk> him  and me , now  to the floating of iron <unk> and other <unk> things ; it <unk> us to fishes swimming around on top of the mud  i mean the water .
the most of the picture is a manifest impossibility  that is to say , a lie ; and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie .
but it enabled mr. ruskin to do it , and it has enabled me to do it , and i am thankful for it .
a boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the slave ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and <unk> , and said it reminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes .
in my then uneducated state , that went home to my <unk> , and i thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye .
mr. ruskin would have said : this person is an ass .
that is what i would say , now .
months after this was written , i happened into the national gallery in london , and soon became so fascinated with the turner pictures that i could hardly get away from the place .
i went there often , afterward , meaning to see the rest of the gallery , but the turner spell was too strong ; it could not be shaken off .
however , the <unk> which attracted me most did not remind me of the slave ship .
however , our business in baden-baden this time , was to join our courier .
i had thought it best to hire one , as we should be in italy , by and by , and we did not know the language .
neither did he .
we found him at the hotel , ready to take charge of us .
i asked him if he was " all fixed . "
he said he was .
that was very true .
he had a trunk , two small satchels , and an umbrella .
i was to pay him fifty-five dollars a month and railway fares .
on the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same it is on a man .
couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging .
this seems a great saving to the tourist  at first .
it does not occur to the tourist that somebody pays that man 's board and lodging .
it occurs to him by and by , however , in one of his lucid moments .
chapter xxv [ hunted by the little chamois ] next morning we left in the train for switzerland , and reached lucerne about ten o'clock at night .
the first discovery i made was that the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated .
within a day or two i made another discovery .
this was , that the <unk> chamois is not a wild goat ; that it is not a horned animal ; that it is not shy ; that it does not avoid human society ; and that there is no peril in hunting it .
the chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed ; you do not have to go after it , it comes after you ; it arrives in vast herds and skips and <unk> all over your body , inside your clothes ; thus it is not shy , but extremely sociable ; it is not afraid of man , on the contrary , it <name> attack him ; its bite is not dangerous , but neither is it pleasant ; its activity has not been <unk>  if you try to put your finger on it , it <name> skip a thousand times its own length at one jump , and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights .
a great deal of romantic nonsense has been written about the swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it , whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it , and fearlessly ; indeed , everybody hunts it ; the hunting is going on all the time , day and night , in bed and out of it .
it is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun ; very few people do that ; there is not one man in a million who can hit it with a gun .
it is much easier to catch it than it is to shoot it , and only the experienced <unk> can do either .
another common piece of exaggeration is that about the " scarcity " of the chamois .
it is the reverse of scarce .
droves of one hundred million chamois are not unusual in the swiss hotels .
indeed , they are so numerous as to be a great pest .
the <unk> always dress up the <unk> in a fanciful and picturesque costume , whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all .
the article of commerce called <unk> is another fraud ; nobody could skin a chamois , it is too small .
the creature is a humbug in every way , and everything which has been written about it is sentimental exaggeration .
it was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out , for he had been one of my pet illusions ; all my life it had been my dream to see him in his native wilds some day , and engage in the adventurous sport of chasing him from <name> to <name> .
it is no pleasure to me to expose him , now , and destroy the reader 's delight in him and respect for him , but still it must be done , for when an honest writer discovers an <unk> it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from its place of honor , no matter who suffers by it ; any other course would render him unworthy of the public confidence .
lucerne is a charming place .
it begins at the water 's edge , with a fringe of hotels , and <unk> up and spreads itself over two or three sharp hills in a crowded , disorderly , but picturesque way , offering to the eye a <unk> confusion of red roofs , quaint <unk> , dormer windows , toothpick <unk> , with here and there a bit of ancient <unk> wall bending itself over the ridges , <unk> , and here and there an old square tower of heavy masonry .
and also here and there a town clock with only one hand  a hand which stretches across the dial and has no joint in it ; such a clock helps out the picture , but you can not tell the time of day by it .
between the curving line of hotels and the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade trees .
the <unk> is walled with masonry like a pier , and has a railing , to keep people from walking overboard .
all day long the vehicles dash along the avenue , and nurses , children , and tourists sit in the shade of the trees , or <name> on the railing and watch the schools of fishes darting about in the clear water , or gaze out over the lake at the stately border of <unk> mountain peaks .
little pleasure steamers , black with people , are coming and going all the time ; and everywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful rowboats , or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind .
the front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies , where one may take his private luncheon in calm , cool comfort and look down upon this busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the work connected with it .
most of the people , both male and female , are in walking costume , and <name> alpenstocks .
evidently , it is not considered safe to go about in switzerland , even in town , without an alpenstock .
if the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets it , and stands it up in the corner .
when his touring in switzerland is finished , he does not throw that <unk> away , but <unk> it home with him , to the far corners of the earth , although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could .
you see , the alpenstock is his trophy ; his name is burned upon it ; and if he has climbed a hill , or jumped a <name> , or traversed a <unk> with it , he has the names of those places burned upon it , too .
thus it is his regimental flag , so to speak , and bears the record of his achievements .
it is worth three francs when he buys it , but a bonanza could not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it .
there are artisans all about switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things upon the alpenstock of the tourist .
and observe , a man is respected in switzerland according to his alpenstock .
i found i could get no attention there , while i carried an <unk> one .
however , <unk> is not expected , so i soon remedied that .
the effect upon the next detachment of tourists was very marked .
i felt repaid for my trouble .
half of the summer horde in switzerland is made up of english people ; the other half is made up of many nationalities , the germans leading and the americans coming next .
the americans were not as numerous as i had expected they would be .
the <unk> table d'hôte at the great <unk> furnished a mighty array and variety of nationalities , but it offered a better opportunity to observe costumes than people , for the multitude sat at immensely long tables , and therefore the faces were mainly seen in perspective ; but the breakfasts were served at small round tables , and then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could <name> .
we used to try to guess out the nationalities , and generally succeeded tolerably well .
sometimes we tried to guess people 's names ; but that was a failure ; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of practice .
we presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult particulars .
one morning i said : " there is an american party . "
<name> said : " yes  but name the state . "
i named one state , <name> named another .
we agreed upon one thing , however  that the young girl with the party was very beautiful , and very tastefully dressed .
but we disagreed as to her age .
i said she was eighteen , <name> said she was twenty .
the dispute between us waxed warm , and i finally said , with a pretense of being in <name> : " well , there is one way to settle the matter  i <name> go and ask her . "
<name> said , sarcastically , " certainly , that is the thing to do .
all you need to do is to use the common formula over here : go and say , 'i 'm an american ! '
of course she <name> be glad to see you . "
then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to speak to her .
i said , " i was only talking  i did n't intend to approach her , but i see that you do not know what an intrepid person i am .
i am not afraid of any woman that walks .
i <name> go and speak to this young girl . "
the thing i had in my mind was not difficult .
i meant to address her in the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me ; and when she should reply that the name i mentioned was not the name she bore , i meant to beg pardon again , most respectfully , and retire .
there would be no harm done .
i walked to her table , bowed to the gentleman , then turned to her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed : " i knew i was n't mistaken  i told <name> it was you !
<name> said it probably was n't , but i knew i was right .
i said you would recognize me presently and come over ; and i 'm glad you did , for i should n't have felt much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me .
sit down , sit down  how odd it is  you are the last person i was ever expecting to see again . "
this was a stupefying surprise .
it took my wits clear away , for an instant .
however , we shook hands cordially all around , and i sat down .
but truly this was the <unk> place i ever was in .
i seemed to vaguely remember the girl 's face , now , but i had no idea where i had seen it before , or what name belonged with it .
i immediately tried to get up a diversion about swiss scenery , to keep her from launching into topics that might betray that i did not know her , but it was of no use , she went right along upon matters which interested her more : " oh dear , what a night that was , when the sea washed the forward boats away  do you remember it ? "
" oh , do n't i ! "
said i  but i did n't .
i wished the sea had washed the rudder and the <unk> and the captain away  then i could have located this questioner .
" and do n't you remember how frightened poor <name> was , and how she cried ? "
" indeed i do ! "
said i .
" dear me , how it all comes back ! "
i fervently wished it would come back  but my memory was a blank .
the wise way would have been to frankly own up ; but i could not bring myself to do that , after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her ; so i went on , deeper and deeper into the mire , hoping for a chance clue but never getting one .
the <unk> continued , with vivacity : " do you know , <name> married <name> , after all ? "
" why , no !
did he ? "
" indeed he did .
he said he did not believe she was half as much to blame as her father was , and i thought he was right .
did n't you ? "
" of course he was .
it was a perfectly plain case .
i always said so . "
" why , no you did n't !  at least that summer . "
" oh , no , not that summer .
no , you are perfectly right about that .
it was the following <name> that i said it . "
" well , as it turned out , <name> was not in the least to blame  it was all her father 's fault  at least his and old <unk> 's . "
it was necessary to say something  so i said : " i always regarded <unk> as a troublesome old thing . "
" so he was , but then they always had a great affection for him , although he had so many eccentricities .
you remember that when the weather was the least cold , he would try to come into the house . "
i was rather afraid to proceed .
evidently <unk> was not a man  he must be some other kind of animal  possibly a dog , maybe an elephant .
however , tails are common to all animals , so i ventured to say : " and what a tail he had ! "
" one !
he had a thousand ! "
this was bewildering .
i did not quite know what to say , so i only said : " yes , he was rather well fixed in the matter of tails . "
" for a negro , and a crazy one at that , i should say he was , " said she .
it was getting pretty sultry for me .
i said to myself , " is it possible she is going to stop there , and wait for me to speak ?
if she does , the conversation is blocked .
a negro with a thousand tails is a topic which a person can not talk upon fluently and <unk> without more or less preparation .
as to diving rashly into such a vast subject  " but here , to my gratitude , she interrupted my thoughts by saying : " yes , when it came to tales of his crazy woes , there was simply no end to them if anybody would listen .
his own quarters were comfortable enough , but when the weather was cold , the family were sure to have his company  nothing could keep him out of the house .
but they always bore it kindly because he had saved <name> 's life , years before .
you remember <name> ?
" oh , perfectly .
fine fellow he was , too . "
" yes he was .
and what a pretty little thing his child was ! "
" you may well say that .
i never saw a prettier child . "
" i used to delight to pet it and <unk> it and play with it . "
" so did i . "
" you named it .
what was that name ?
i ca n't call it to mind . "
it appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin , here .
i would have given something to know what the child 's was .
however , i had the good luck to think of a name that would fit either sex  so i brought it out : " i named it <name> . "
" from a relative , i suppose ?
but you named the one that died , too  one that i never saw .
what did you call that one ? "
i was out of neutral names , but as the child was dead and she had never seen it , i thought i might risk a name for it and trust to luck .
therefore i said : " i called that one <name> <name> . "
she said , musingly : " that is very singular ... very singular . "
i sat still and let the cold sweat run down .
i was in a good deal of trouble , but i believed i could worry through if she would n't ask me to name any more children .
i wondered where the lightning was going to strike next .
she was still <unk> over that last child 's title , but presently she said : " i have always been sorry you were away at the time  i would have had you name my child . "
" your child !
are you married ? "
" i have been married thirteen years . "
" christened , you mean . "
<unk> " no , married .
the youth by your side is my son . "
" it seems incredible  even impossible .
i do not mean any harm by it , but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen ?  that is to say , <name> you tell me how old you are ? "
" i was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about .
that was my birthday . "
that did not help matters , much , as i did not know the date of the storm .
i tried to think of some non-committal thing to say , to keep up my end of the talk , and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences as little noticeable as possible , but i seemed to be about out of non-committal things .
i was about to say , " you have n't changed a bit since then "  but that was risky .
i thought of saying , " you have improved ever so much since then "  but that would n't answer , of course .
i was about to try a shy at the weather , for a saving change , when the girl slipped in ahead of me and said : " how i have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times  have n't you ? "
" i never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before ! "
said i , with emotion ; and i could have added , with a near approach to truth , " and i would rather be scalped than spend another one like it . "
i was <unk> grateful to be through with the ordeal , and was about to make my <unk> and get out , when the girl said : " but there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me . "
" why , what is that ? "
" that dead child 's name .
what did you say it was ? "
here was another balmy place to be in : i had forgotten the child 's name ; i had n't imagined it would be needed again .
however , i had to pretend to know , anyway , so i said : " <name> <name> . "
the youth at my side corrected me , and said : " no , <name> <name> . "
i thanked him  in words  and said , with trepidation : " o yes  i was thinking of another child that i named  i have named a great many , and i get them confused  this one was named <name> thompson  " " <name> <name> , " calmly interposed the boy .
i thanked him again  strictly in words  and stammered out : " <name> <name>  yes , <name> <name> was the poor child 's name .
i named him for <name>  er  <name> carlyle , the great author , you know  and <name>  er  er  <name> the eighth .
the parents were very grateful to have a child named <name> <name> . "
" that makes it more singular than ever , " murmured my beautiful friend .
" does it ?
why ? "
" because when the parents speak of that child now , they always call it <name> <name> . "
that spiked my gun .
i could not say anything .
i was entirely out of verbal <unk> ; to go further would be to lie , and that i would not do ; so i simply sat still and suffered  sat mutely and resignedly there , and <unk>  for i was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes .
presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said : " i have enjoyed this talk over old times , but you have not .
i saw very soon that you were only pretending to know me , and so as i had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning , i made up my mind to punish you .
and i have succeeded pretty well .
i was glad to see that you knew <name> and <name> and <unk> , for i had never heard of them before and therefore could not be sure that you had ; and i was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children , too .
one can get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly .
<name> and the storm , and the sweeping away of the forward boats , were facts  all the rest was fiction .
<name> was my sister ; her full name was <name>    .
now do you remember me ? "
" yes , " i said , " i do remember you now ; and you are as <unk> as you were thirteen years ago in that ship , else you would n't have punished me so .
you have n't changed your nature nor your person , in any way at all ; you look as young as you did then , you are just as beautiful as you were then , and you have transmitted a deal of your <unk> to this fine boy .
there  if that speech moves you any , let 's fly the flag of truce , with the understanding that i am conquered and confess it . "
all of which was agreed to and accomplished , on the spot .
when i went back to <name> , i said : " now you see what a person with talent and address can do . "
" excuse me , i see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can do .
the idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers , that way , and talking for half an hour ; why i never heard of a man in his right mind doing such a thing before .
what did you say to them ? "
" i never said any harm .
i merely asked the girl what her name was . "
" i do n't doubt it .
upon my word i do n't .
i think you were capable of it .
it was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition of yourself .
but you know i could n't really believe you would do such an inexcusable thing .
what <name> those people think of us ?
but how did you say it ?  i mean the manner of it .
i <name> you were not abrupt . "
" no , i was careful about that .
i said , 'my friend and i would like to know what your name is , if you do n't mind . ' "
" no , that was not abrupt .
there is a polish about it that does you infinite credit .
and i am glad you put me in ; that was a delicate attention which i appreciate at its full value .
what did she do ? "
" she did n't do anything in particular .
she told me her name . "
" simply told you her name .
do you mean to say she did not show any surprise ? "
" well , now i come to think , she did show something ; maybe it was surprise ; i had n't thought of that  i took it for gratification . "
" oh , undoubtedly you were right ; it must have been gratification ; it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that .
then what did you do ? "
" i offered my hand and the party gave me a shake . "
" i saw it !
i did not believe my own eyes , at the time .
did the gentleman say anything about cutting your throat ? "
" no , they all seemed glad to see me , as far as i could judge . "
" and do you know , i believe they were .
i think they said to themselves , <unk> this curiosity has got away from his keeper  let us amuse ourselves with him . '
there is no other way of accounting for their facile <unk> .
you sat down .
did they ask you to sit down ? "
" no , they did not ask me , but i suppose they did not think of it . "
" you have an unerring instinct .
what else did you do ?
what did you talk about ? "
" well , i asked the girl how old she was . "
" undoubtedly .
your delicacy is beyond praise .
go on , go on  do n't mind my apparent misery  i always look so when i am steeped in a profound and reverent <name> .
go on  she told you her age ? "
" yes , she told me her age , and all about her mother , and her grandmother , and her other relations , and all about herself . "
" did she volunteer these statistics ? "
" no , not exactly that .
i asked the questions and she answered them . "
" this is divine .
go on  it is not possible that you forgot to inquire into her politics ? "
" no , i thought of that .
she is a democrat , her husband is a republican , and both of them are <unk> . "
" her husband ?
is that child married ? "
" she is not a child .
she is married , and that is her husband who is there with her . "
" has she any children . "
" yes  seven and a half . "
" that is impossible . "
" no , she has them .
she told me herself . "
" well , but seven and a half ?
how do you make out the half ?
where does the half come in ? "
" there is a child which she had by another husband  not this one but another one  so it is a <unk> , and they do not count in full measure . "
" another husband ?
has she another husband ? "
" yes , four .
this one is number four . "
" i do n't believe a word of it .
it is impossible , upon its face .
is that boy there her brother ? "
" no , that is her son .
he is her youngest .
he is not as old as he looked ; he is only eleven and a half . "
" these things are all manifestly impossible .
this is a wretched business .
it is a plain case : they simply took your measure , and concluded to fill you up .
they seem to have succeeded .
i am glad i am not in the mess ; they may at least be charitable enough to think there ai n't a pair of us .
are they going to stay here long ? "
" no , they leave before noon . "
" there is one man who is deeply grateful for that .
how did you find out ?
you asked , i suppose ? "
" no , along at first i inquired into their plans , in a general way , and they said they were going to be here a week , and make trips round about ; but toward the end of the interview , when i said you and i would tour around with them with pleasure , and offered to bring you over and introduce you , they hesitated a little , and asked if you were from the same establishment that i was .
i said you were , and then they said they had changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and visit a sick relative in siberia . "
" ah , me , you struck the summit !
you struck the loftiest altitude of stupidity that human effort has ever reached .
you shall have a monument of <unk> ' skulls as high as the <unk> spire if you die before i do .
they wanted to know i was from the same <unk> ' that you hailed from , did they ?
what did they mean by <unk> ' ? "
" i do n't know ; it never occurred to me to ask . "
" well i know .
they meant an asylum  an idiot asylum , do you understand ?
so they do think there 's a pair of us , after all .
now what do you think of yourself ? "
" well , i do n't know .
i did n't know i was doing any harm ; i did n't mean to do any harm .
they were very nice people , and they seemed to like me . "
<name> made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom  to break some furniture , he said .
he was a singularly <unk> man ; any little thing would disturb his temper .
i had been well scorched by the young woman , but no matter , i took it out on <name> .
one should always " get even " in some way , else the sore place <name> go on hurting .
chapter xxvi [ the nest of the <unk> ] the <unk> is celebrated for its organ <unk> .
all summer long the tourists flock to that church about six o'clock in the evening , and pay their franc , and listen to the noise .
they do n't stay to hear all of it , but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor , meeting late comers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way .
this tramping back and forth is kept up nearly all the time , and is <unk> by the continuous slamming of the door , and the coughing and barking and sneezing of the crowd .
meantime , the big organ is booming and crashing and thundering away , doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and best organ in europe , and that a tight little box of a church is the most favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in .
it is true , there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally , but the <unk> of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of them , so to speak .
then right away the <unk> would let go another avalanche .
the commerce of lucerne consists mainly in <unk> of the souvenir sort ; the shops are packed with alpine crystals , photographs of scenery , and wooden and <name> carvings .
i <name> not conceal the fact that miniature figures of the lion of lucerne are to be had in them .
millions of them .
but they are <unk> upon him , every one of them .
there is a subtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the <unk> can not get .
even the sun fails to get it ; both the photographer and the <unk> give you a dying lion , and that is all .
the shape is right , the attitude is right , the proportions are right , but that indescribable something which makes the lion of lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world , is wanting .
the lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low <name>  for he is carved from the living rock of the <name> .
his size is colossal , his attitude is <name> .
his head is bowed , the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder , his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of <name> .
vines <name> down the <name> and wave in the wind , and a clear stream <unk> from above and empties into a pond at the base , and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is <unk> , among the water-lilies .
around about are green trees and grass .
the place is a sheltered , reposeful woodland nook , remote from noise and stir and confusion  and all this is fitting , for lions do die in such places , and not on granite <unk> in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings .
the lion of lucerne would be impressive anywhere , but nowhere so impressive as where he is .
martyrdom is the <unk> fate that can befall some people .
<name> xvi did not die in his bed , consequently history is very gentle with him ; she is charitable toward his failings , and she finds in him high virtues which are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in kings .
she makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit , the heart of a female saint , and a wrong head .
none of these qualities are kingly but the last .
taken together they make a character which would have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had the ill luck to miss martyrdom .
with the best intentions to do the right thing , he always managed to do the wrong one .
moreover , nothing could get the female saint out of him .
he knew , well enough , that in national emergencies he must not consider how he ought to act , as a man , but how he ought to act as a king ; so he honestly tried to sink the man and be the king  but it was a failure , he only succeeded in being the female saint .
he was not instant in season , but out of season .
he could not be persuaded to do a thing while it could do any good  he was iron , he was <unk> in his <unk> then  but as soon as the thing had reached a point where it would be positively harmful to do it , do it he would , and nothing could stop him .
he did not do it because it would be harmful , but because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good which it would have done if applied earlier .
his comprehension was always a train or two <unk> .
if a national toe required <unk> , he could not see that it needed anything more than <unk> ; when others saw that the mortification had reached the knee , he first perceived that the toe needed cutting off  so he cut it off ; and he severed the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached the thigh .
he was good , and honest , and well meaning , in the matter of chasing national diseases , but he never could overtake one .
as a private man , he would have been lovable ; but viewed as a king , he was strictly contemptible .
his was a most <unk> career , but the most pitiable spectacle in it was his sentimental treachery to his swiss guard on that memorable 10th of <name> , when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause , and forbade them to shed the " sacred french blood " <unk> to be flowing in the veins of the <unk> mob of <unk> that was raging around the palace .
he meant to be kingly , but he was only the female saint once more .
some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit of saint <name> had descended upon him .
it must have found pretty cramped quarters .
if <name> the first had stood in the shoes of <name> xvi that day , instead of being merely a casual and unknown <unk> , there would be no lion of lucerne , now , but there would be a well-stocked <unk> graveyard in <name> which would answer just as well to remember the 10th of <name> by .
martyrdom made a saint of <name> <name> of scots three hundred years ago , and she has hardly lost all of her <unk> yet .
martyrdom made a saint of the trivial and foolish <name> <name> , and her biographers still keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day , while unconsciously proving upon almost every <name> they write that the only <unk> instinct which her husband lacked , she supplied  the instinct to root out and get rid of an honest , able , and loyal official , wherever she found him .
the hideous but beneficent french revolution would have been deferred , or would have fallen short of completeness , or even might not have happened at all , if <name> <name> had made the unwise mistake of not being born .
the world owes a great deal to the french revolution , and consequently to its two chief <unk> , <name> the poor in spirit and his <name> .
we did not buy any wooden images of the lion , nor any <name> or <name> or marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones , or even any <unk> <unk> of him .
the truth is , these copies were so common , so universal , in the shops and everywhere , that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular <name> usually becomes to the harassed ear .
in lucerne , too , the wood carvings of other sorts , which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home , soon began to fatigue us .
we grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around <unk> , and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks , or lying upon them in family groups , or peering <unk> up from behind them .
the first day , i would have bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if i had the money  and i did buy three  but on the third day the disease had run its course , i had <unk> , and was in the market once more  trying to sell .
however , i had no luck ; which was just as well , for the things <name> be pretty enough , no doubt , when i get them home .
for years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock ; now here i was , at last , right in the creature 's home ; so wherever i went that distressing " <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
was always in my ears .
for a nervous man , this was a fine state of things .
some sounds are <unk> than others , but no sound is quite so <unk> , and silly , and aggravating as the " <unk> " of a cuckoo clock , i think .
i bought one , and am carrying it home to a certain person ; for i have always said that if the opportunity ever happened , i would do that man an ill turn .
what i meant , was , that i would break one of his legs , or something of that sort ; but in lucerne i instantly saw that i could impair his mind .
that would be more lasting , and more satisfactory every way .
so i bought the cuckoo clock ; and if i ever get home with it , he is " my meat , " as they say in the mines .
i thought of another candidate  a <unk> whom i could name if i wanted to  but after thinking it over , i didn't buy him a clock .
i could n't injure his mind .
we visited the two long , covered wooden bridges which span the green and brilliant <unk> just below where it goes plunging and <unk> out of the lake .
these rambling , <unk> tunnels are very attractive things , with their <unk> <unk> upon the lovely and <unk> water .
they contain two or three hundred queer old pictures , by old swiss masters  old boss <unk> , who flourished before the <unk> of <name> .
the lake is alive with fishes , plainly visible to the eye , for the water is very clear .
the <unk> in front of the hotels were usually fringed with fishers of all ages .
one day i thought i would stop and see a fish caught .
the result brought back to my mind , very forcibly , a circumstance which i had not thought of before for twelve years .
this one : the man who put up at <unk> when my odd friend <name> and i were newspaper correspondents in washington , in the <name> of <unk> , we were coming down pennsylvania avenue one night , near midnight , in a driving storm of snow , when the flash of a <unk> fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in the opposite direction .
" this is lucky !
you are mr. <name> , ai n't you ? "
<name> was the most self-possessed and solemnly deliberate person in the republic .
he stopped , looked his man over from head to foot , and finally said : " i am mr. <name> .
did you happen to be looking for me ? "
" that 's just what i was doing , " said the man , joyously , " and it 's the biggest luck in the world that i 've found you .
my name is <unk> .
i'm one of the teachers of the high school  san <name> .
as soon as i heard the san <name> <unk> was vacant , i made up my mind to get it  and here i am . "
" yes , " said <name> , slowly , " as you have remarked ... mr. <unk> ... here you are .
and have you got it ? "
" well , not exactly got it , but the next thing to it .
i 've brought a petition , signed by the superintendent of public instruction , and all the teachers , and by more than two hundred other people .
now i want you , if you 'll be so good , to go around with me to the pacific delegation , for i want to rush this thing through and get along home . "
" if the matter is so pressing , you <name> prefer that we visit the delegation tonight , " said <name> , in a voice which had nothing mocking in it  to an unaccustomed ear .
" oh , tonight , by all means !
i have n't got any time to fool around .
i want their promise before i go to bed  i ai n't the talking kind , i 'm the doing kind ! "
" yes ... you 've come to the right place for that .
when did you arrive ? "
" just an hour ago . "
" when are you intending to leave ? "
" for new york tomorrow evening  for san <name> next morning . "
" just so ... . what are you going to do tomorrow ? "
" do !
why , i 've got to go to the president with the petition and the delegation , and get the appointment , have n't i ? "
" yes ... very true ... that is correct .
and then what ? "
" executive session of the senate at 2 p.m.  got to get the appointment confirmed  i reckon you 'll <name> that ? "
" yes ... yes , " said <name> , meditatively , " you are right again .
then you take the train for new york in the evening , and the steamer for san <name> next morning ? "
" that 's it  that 's the way i map it out ! "
<name> considered a while , and then said : " you could n't stay ... a day ... well , say two days longer ? "
" bless your soul , no !
it 's not my style .
i ai n't a man to go fooling around  i 'm a man that does things , i tell you . "
the storm was raging , the thick snow blowing in gusts .
<name> stood silent , apparently deep in a reverie , during a minute or more , then he looked up and said : " have you ever heard about that man who put up at gadsby 's , once ?
...
but i see you have n't . "
he backed mr. <unk> against an iron fence , <unk> him , fastened him with his eye , like the ancient mariner , and proceeded to unfold his narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched comfortably in a <unk> summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a wintry midnight tempest : " i <name> tell you about that man .
it was in <name> 's time .
gadsby 's was the principal hotel , then .
well , this man arrived from tennessee about nine o'clock , one morning , with a black coachman and a splendid <unk> carriage and an elegant dog , which he was evidently fond of and proud of ; he drove up before gadsby 's , and the clerk and the landlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him , but he said , 'never mind , ' and jumped out and told the coachman to wait  said he had n't time to take anything to eat , he only had a little claim against the government to collect , would run across the way , to the treasury , and fetch the money , and then get right along back to tennessee , for he was in considerable of a hurry .
" well , about eleven o'clock that night he came back and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses up  said he would collect the claim in the morning .
this was in <name> , you understand  <name> , 1834  the 3d of <name>  wednesday .
" well , on the 5th of february , he sold the fine carriage , and bought a cheap second-hand one  said it would answer just as well to take the money home in , and he did n't care for style .
" on the 11th of <name> he sold a pair of the fine horses  said he'd often thought a pair was better than four , to go over the rough mountain roads with where a body had to be careful about his driving  and there was n't so much of his claim but he could <unk> the money home with a pair easy enough .
" on the 13th of december he sold another horse  said two warn't necessary to drag that old light vehicle with  in fact , one could snatch it along faster than was absolutely necessary , now that it was good solid <name> weather and the roads in splendid condition .
" on the 17th of february , 1835 , he sold the old carriage and bought a cheap second-hand buggy  said a buggy was just the trick to skim along <unk> , <unk> early spring roads with , and he had always wanted to try a buggy on those mountain roads , anyway .
" on the 1st <name> he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old sulky  said he just wanted to see those green <unk> stare and <unk> when they saw him come <unk> along in a sulky  did n't believe they'd ever heard of a sulky in their lives .
" well , on the 29th of <name> he sold his colored coachman  said he did n't need a coachman for a sulky  would n't be room enough for two in it anyway  and , besides , it was n't every day that providence sent a man a fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a <unk> negro as that  been wanting to get rid of the creature for years , but did n't like to throw him away .
" eighteen months later  that is to say , on the 15th of february , 1837  he sold the sulky and bought a saddle  said <unk> was what the doctor had always recommended him to take , and dog 'd if he wanted to risk his neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in the dead of <name> , not if he knew himself .
" on the 9th of <name> he sold the saddle  said he was n't going to risk his life with any perishable <unk> that ever was made , over a rainy , <unk> <name> road , while he could ride <unk> and know and feel he was safe  always had despised to ride on a saddle , anyway .
" on the 24th of <name> he sold his horse  said 'i 'm just fifty-seven today , hale and hearty  it would be a pretty <unk> for me to be wasting such a trip as that and such weather as this , on a horse , when there ai n't anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through the fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains , to a man that is a man  and i can make my dog <name> my claim in a little bundle , anyway , when it 's collected .
so tomorrow i 'll be up bright and early , make my little old collection , and <unk> off to tennessee , on my own hind legs , with a rousing good-by to gadsby 's . '
" on the <unk> of <name> he sold his dog  said <unk> a dog , anyway , where you 're just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the summer woods and hills  perfect nuisance  <unk> the squirrels , barks at everything , goes <unk> and <unk> around in the fords  man ca n't get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature  and i 'd a blamed sight ruther <name> the claim myself , it 's a mighty sight safer ; a <unk> mighty uncertain in a financial way  always noticed it  well , good-by , boys  last call  i 'm off for tennessee with a good leg and a <name> heart , early in the morning . ' "
there was a pause and a silence  except the noise of the wind and the pelting snow .
mr. <unk> said , impatiently : " well ? "
<name> said : " well ,  that was thirty years ago . "
" very well , very well  what of it ? "
" i 'm great friends with that old patriarch .
he comes every evening to tell me good-by .
i saw him an hour ago  he 's off for tennessee early tomorrow morning  as usual ; said he calculated to get his claim through and be off before <unk> like me have turned out of bed .
the tears were in his eyes , he was so glad he was going to see his old tennessee and his friends once more . "
another silent pause .
the stranger broke it : " is that all ? "
" that is all . "
" well , for the time of night , and the kind of night , it seems to me the story was full long enough .
but what 's it all for ? "
" oh , nothing in particular . "
" well , where 's the point of it ? "
" oh , there is n't any particular point to it .
only , if you are not in too much of a hurry to rush off to san <name> with that post-office appointment , mr. <unk> , i 'd advise you to 'put up at gadsby 's ' for a spell , and take it easy .
good-by .
god bless you ! "
so saying , <name> blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished school-teacher standing there , a musing and motionless snow image shining in the broad glow of the <unk> .
he never got that post-office .
to go back to lucerne and its fishers , i concluded , after about nine hours ' waiting , that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees something hook one of those well-fed and experienced fishes <name> find it wisdom to " put up at gadsby 's " and take it easy .
it is likely that a fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years ; but no matter , the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long , just the same , and seems to enjoy it .
one may see the <unk> just as thick and contented and happy and patient all along the seine at <name> , but tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times is a thing they do n't fish for at all  the recent dog and the translated cat .
chapter xxvii [ i spare an awful bore ] close by the lion of lucerne is what they call the " glacier garden "  and it is the only one in the world .
it is on high ground .
four or five years ago , some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came upon this interesting relic of a <unk> age .
scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period ; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon .
the soil was removed , and there lay the <unk> and <unk> track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey .
this track was perforated by huge <unk> holes in the <unk> , formed by the furious <unk> in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers .
these huge round boulders still remain in the holes ; they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in those old days .
it took a mighty force to <unk> these big lumps of stone around in that vigorous way .
the neighboring country had a very different shape , at that time  the valleys have risen up and become hills , since , and the hills have become valleys .
the boulders discovered in the pots had traveled a great distance , for there is no rock like them nearer than the distant rhone glacier .
for some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake lucerne and at the <unk> masses of <unk> that border it all around  an enticing spectacle , this last , for there is a strange and fascinating beauty and charm about a majestic <unk> with the sun blazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching it  but finally we concluded to try a bit of <unk> around on a steamboat , and a dash on foot at the <unk> .
very well , we had a delightful trip to <unk> , on a breezy , <name> day .
everybody sat on the upper deck , on benches , under an awning ; everybody talked , laughed , and exclaimed at the wonderful scenery ; in truth , a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of <unk> .
the mountains were a <unk> <name> .
sometimes they rose straight up out of the lake , and towered aloft and overshadowed our <unk> steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way .
not snow-clad mountains , these , yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the clouds and veil their foreheads in them .
they were not barren and repulsive , but clothed in green , and restful and pleasant to the eye .
and they were so almost <unk> , sometimes , that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface , yet there are paths , and the swiss people go up and down them every day .
sometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of the huge <unk> in <unk>  then high aloft , toward the sky , it took a little stronger inclination , like that of a mansard roof  and perched on this dizzy mansard one 's eye detected little things like <name> boxes , and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of peasants  an airy place for a home , truly .
and suppose a peasant should walk in his sleep , or his child should fall out of the front yard ?  the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those <unk> before they found the remains .
and yet those far-away homes looked ever so seductive , they were so remote from the troubled world , they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreams  surely no one who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner level .
we swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake , among these colossal green walls , enjoying new delights , always , as the stately panorama unfolded itself before us and <unk> and hid itself behind us ; and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting suddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating jungfrau , or some kindred giant , looming head and shoulders above a tumbled waste of lesser alps .
once , while i was hungrily taking in one of these surprises , and doing my best to get all i possibly could of it while it should last , i was interrupted by a young and <unk> voice : " you 're an american , i think  so 'm i . "
he was about eighteen , or possibly nineteen ; slender and of medium height ; open , <name> , happy face ; a restless but independent eye ; a snub nose , which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky new-born mustache below it until it should be introduced ; a loosely <name> jaw , calculated to work easily in the sockets .
he wore a <unk> , <unk> straw hat , with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front ; <unk> <unk> coat , pantaloons , vest , all trim and neat and up with the fashion ; <unk> stockings , very <unk> patent-leather shoes , tied with black ribbon ; blue ribbon around his neck , wide-open collar ; <name> <name> studs ; <unk> kids ; projecting cuffs , fastened with large oxidized silver <unk> , bearing the device of a <unk> face  english <unk> .
he carried a slim cane , surmounted with an english <unk> 's head with red glass eyes .
under his arm he carried a <name> grammar  <name> 's .
his hair was short , straight , and smooth , and presently when he turned his head a moment , i saw that it was nicely parted behind .
he took a cigarette out of a dainty box , stuck it into a <unk> holder which he carried in a morocco case , and reached for my cigar .
while he was lighting , i said : " yes  i am an american . "
" i knew it  i can always tell them .
what ship did you come over in ? "
" <unk> . "
" we came in the <unk>  <unk> , you know .
what kind of passage did you have ? "
" tolerably rough . "
" so did we .
captain said he 'd hardly ever seen it rougher .
where are you from ? "
" new england . "
" so 'm i. i 'm from new <unk> .
anybody with you ? "
" yes  a friend . "
" our whole family 's along .
it 's awful slow , going around alone  don't you think so ? "
" rather slow . "
" ever been over here before ? "
" yes . "
" i have n't .
my first trip .
but we 've been all around  <name> and everywhere .
i 'm to enter harvard next year .
studying <name> all the time , now .
ca n't enter till i know <name> .
i know considerable french  i get along pretty well in <name> , or anywhere where they speak french .
what hotel are you stopping at ? "
" <unk> . "
" no !
is that so ?
i never see you in the <unk> .
i go to the <unk> a good deal of the time , because there 's so many americans there .
i make lots of acquaintances .
i know an american as soon as i see him  and so i speak to him and make his acquaintance .
i like to be always making acquaintances  do n't you ? "
" lord , yes ! "
" you see it breaks up a trip like this , first rate .
i never got bored on a trip like this , if i can make acquaintances and have somebody to talk to .
but i think a trip like this would be an awful bore , if a body could n't find anybody to get acquainted with and talk to on a trip like this .
i 'm fond of talking , ai n't you ?
" passionately . "
" have you felt bored , on this trip ? "
" not all the time , part of it . "
" that 's it !  you see you ought to go around and get acquainted , and talk .
that 's my way .
that 's the way i always do  i just go 'round , 'round , 'round and talk , talk , talk  i never get bored .
you been up the <unk> yet ? "
" no . "
" going ? "
" i think so . "
" what hotel you going to stop at ? "
" i do n't know .
is there more than one ? "
" three .
you stop at the <unk>  you 'll find it full of americans .
what ship did you say you came over in ? "
" city of <unk> . "
" <name> , i guess .
you going to <name> ? "
" yes . "
" what hotel you going to stop at ? "
" <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . "
" do n't you do it !
no americans there !
you stop at one of those big hotels over the bridge  they 're packed full of americans . "
" but i want to practice my arabic . "
" good gracious , do you speak arabic ? "
" yes  well enough to get along . "
" why , <name> it , you wo n't get along in <name>  they do n't speak arabic , they speak french .
what hotel are you stopping at here ? "
" hotel <unk> . "
" sho , you ought to stop at the <unk> .
did n't you know the <unk> was the best hotel in switzerland ?  look at your baedeker . "
" yes , i know  but i had an idea there war n't any americans there . "
" no americans !
why , bless your soul , it 's just alive with them !
i 'm in the great <unk> most all the time .
i make lots of acquaintances there .
not as many as i did at first , because now only the new ones stop in there  the others go right along through .
where are you from ? "
" arkansaw . "
" is that so ?
i 'm from new england  new <unk> 's my town when i 'm at home .
i 'm having a mighty good time today , ai n't you ? "
" divine . "
" that 's what i call it .
i like this knocking around , loose and easy , and making acquaintances and talking .
i know an american , soon as i see him ; so i go and speak to him and make his acquaintance .
i ai n't ever bored , on a trip like this , if i can make new acquaintances and talk .
i 'm awful fond of talking when i can get hold of the right kind of a person , ain't you ? "
" i prefer it to any other dissipation . "
" that 's my notion , too .
now some people like to take a book and sit down and read , and read , and read , or moon around <unk> at the lake or these mountains and things , but that ai n't my way ; no , sir , if they like it , let 'em do it , i do n't object ; but as for me , talking 's what i like .
you been up the <unk> ? "
" yes . "
" what hotel did you stop at ? "
" <unk> . "
" that 's the place !  i stopped there too .
full of americans , was n't it ?
it always is  always is .
that 's what they say .
everybody says that .
what ship did you come over in ? "
" <unk> de <name> . "
" french , i reckon .
what kind of a passage did ... excuse me a minute , there 's some americans i have n't seen before . "
and away he went .
he went uninjured , too  i had the murderous impulse to harpoon him in the back with my alpenstock , but as i raised the weapon the disposition left me ; i found i had n't the heart to kill him , he was such a joyous , innocent , good-natured <unk> .
half an hour later i was sitting on a bench inspecting , with strong interest , a <name> <unk> which we were skimming by  a <unk> not shaped by man , but by nature 's free great hand  a massy pyramidal rock eighty feet high , devised by nature ten million years ago against the day when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument .
the time came at last , and now this grand <unk> bears <unk> 's name in huge letters upon its face .
curiously enough , this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way .
it is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys , and painted all over it , in blue letters bigger than those in <unk> 's name , these words : " try <unk> ; " " buy sun stove polish ; " " <unk> 's <unk> ; " " try <unk> for the blood . "
he was captured and it turned out that he was an american .
upon his trial the judge said to him : " you are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult nature , and , through her , nature 's god , if by so doing he can put a sordid <name> in his pocket .
but here the case is different .
because you are a foreigner and ignorant , i <name> make your sentence light ; if you were a native i would deal strenuously with you .
hear and obey :  you <name> immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the <unk> monument ; you pay a fine of ten thousand francs ; you <name> suffer two years ' imprisonment at hard labor ; you <name> then be <unk> , tarred and feathered , deprived of your ears , ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton , and banished forever .
the severest penalties are omitted in your case  not as a <name> to you , but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you birth . "
the steamer 's benches were ranged back to back across the deck .
my back hair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of ladies .
presently they were addressed by some one and i overheard this conversation : " you are americans , i think ?
so 'm i . "
" yes  we are americans . "
" i knew it  i can always tell them .
what ship did you come over in ? "
" city of <name> . "
" oh , yes  <unk> line .
we came in the <unk>  <unk> you know .
what kind of a passage did you have ? "
" pretty fair . "
" that was luck .
we had it awful rough .
captain said he 'd hardly seen it rougher .
where are you from ? "
" new jersey . "
" so 'm i .
no  i did n't mean that ; i 'm from new england .
new <unk> my place .
these your children ?  belong to both of you ? "
" only to one of us ; they are mine ; my friend is not married . "
" single , i reckon ?
so 'm i .
are you two ladies traveling alone ? "
" no  my husband is with us . "
" our whole family 's along .
it 's awful slow , going around alone  don't you think so ? "
" i suppose it must be . "
" hi , there 's mount <unk> coming in sight again .
named after <unk> <unk> , you know , that shot the apple off of <name> tell 's head .
guide-book tells all about it , they say .
i did n't read it  an american told me .
i do n't read when i 'm knocking around like this , having a good time .
did you ever see the chapel where <name> tell used to preach ? "
" i did not know he ever preached there . "
" oh , yes , he did .
that american told me so .
he do n't ever shut up his guide-book .
he knows more about this lake than the fishes in it .
besides , they call it 'tell 's chapel '  you know that yourself .
you ever been over here before ? "
" yes . "
" i have n't .
it 's my first trip .
but we 've been all around  <name> and everywhere .
i 'm to enter harvard next year .
studying <name> all the time now .
ca n't enter till i know <name> .
this book 's <name> 's grammar .
it 's a mighty good book to get the ich habe gehabt haben 's out of .
but i don't really study when i 'm knocking around this way .
if the notion takes me , i just run over my little old ich habe gehabt , du hast gehabt , er hat gehabt , wir haben gehabt , <unk> haben gehabt , sie haben gehabt  kind of <unk> ' fashion , you know , and after that , maybe i do n't buckle to it for three days .
it 's awful undermining to the intellect , <name> is ; you want to take it in small doses , or first you know your brains all run together , and you feel them <unk> around in your head same as so much drawn butter .
but french is different ; french ai n't anything .
i ai n't any more afraid of french than a tramp 's afraid of pie ; i can rattle off my little <unk> , <name> as , il a , and the rest of it , just as easy as <unk> .
i get along pretty well in <name> , or anywhere where they speak french .
what hotel are you stopping at ? "
" the <unk> . "
" no !
is that so ?
i never see you in the big <unk> .
i go in there a good deal of the time , because there 's so many americans there .
i make lots of acquaintances .
you been up the <unk> yet ? "
" no . "
" going ? "
" we think of it . "
" what hotel you going to stop at ? "
" i do n't know . "
" well , then you stop at the <unk>  it 's full of americans .
what ship did you come over in ? "
" city of <name> . "
" oh , yes , i remember i asked you that before .
but i always ask everybody what ship they came over in , and so sometimes i forget and ask again .
you going to <name> ? "
" yes . "
" what hotel you going to stop at ? "
" we expect to stop in a pension . "
" i do n't hardly believe you 'll like that ; there 's very few americans in the <unk> .
what hotel are you stopping at here ? "
" the <unk> . "
" oh , yes .
i asked you that before , too .
but i always ask everybody what hotel they 're stopping at , and so i 've got my head all mixed up with hotels .
but it makes talk , and i love to talk .
it <unk> me up so  do n't it you  on a trip like this ? "
" yes  sometimes . "
" well , it does me , too .
as long as i 'm talking i never feel bored  ain't that the way with you ? "
" yes  generally .
but there are exception to the rule . "
" oh , of course .
i do n't care to talk to everybody , myself .
if a person starts in to <unk> about scenery , and history , and pictures , and all sorts of tiresome things , i get the <unk> mighty soon .
i say 'well , i must be going now  <name> i 'll see you again '  and then i take a walk .
where you from ? "
" new jersey . "
" why , bother it all , i asked you that before , too .
have you seen the lion of lucerne ? "
" not yet . "
" nor i , either .
but the man who told me about mount <unk> says it's one of the things to see .
it 's twenty-eight feet long .
it do n't seem reasonable , but he said so , anyway .
he saw it yesterday ; said it was dying , then , so i reckon it 's dead by this time .
but that ai n't any matter , of course they 'll stuff it .
did you say the children are yours  or hers ? "
" mine . "
" oh , so you did .
are you going up the ... no , i asked you that .
what ship ... no , i asked you that , too .
what hotel are you ... no , you told me that .
let me see ... um ... . oh , what kind of <unk> ... no , we've been over that ground , too .
um ... um ... well , i believe that is all .
<unk>  i am very glad to have made your acquaintance , ladies .

chapter xxviii [ the <unk> and its native wilds ] the <unk> is an imposing alpine mass , six thousand feet high , which stands by itself , and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes , green valleys , and snowy mountains  a compact and magnificent picture three hundred miles in circumference .
the ascent is made by rail , or horseback , or on foot , as one may prefer .
i and my agent <unk> ourselves in <unk> , one bright morning , and started down the lake on the steamboat ; we got ashore at the village of <unk> ; three-quarters of an hour distant from lucerne .
this village is at the foot of the mountain .
we were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy <unk> , and then the talk began to flow , as usual .
it was twelve o'clock noon , and a breezy , cloudless day ; the ascent was gradual , and the glimpses , from under the <unk> boughs , of blue water , and <name> <unk> , and <unk> cliffs , were as charming as glimpses of dreamland .
all the circumstances were perfect  and the anticipations , too , for we should soon be enjoying , for the first time , that wonderful spectacle , an alpine sunrise  the object of our journey .
there was ( apparently ) no real need for hurry , for the guide-book made the <unk> from <unk> to the summit only three hours and a quarter .
i say " apparently , " because the guide-book had already fooled us once  about the distance from <unk> to <unk>  and for aught i knew it might be getting ready to fool us again .
we were only certain as to the altitudes  we calculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the bottom to the top .
the summit is six thousand feet above the sea , but only forty-five hundred feet above the lake .
when we had walked half an hour , we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking , so we cleared for action ; that is to say , we got a boy whom we met to <name> our alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us ; that left us free for business .
i suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch out on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy was used to , for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him by the job , or by the year ?
we told him he could move along if he was in a hurry .
he said he was n't in such a very particular hurry , but he wanted to get to the top while he was young .
we told him to clear out , then , and leave the things at the uppermost hotel and say we should be along presently .
he said he would secure us a hotel if he could , but if they were all full he would ask them to build another one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we arrived .
still gently chaffing us , he pushed ahead , up the trail , and soon disappeared .
by six o'clock we were pretty high up in the air , and the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and interest .
we halted awhile at a little public house , where we had bread and cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk , out on the porch , with the big panorama all before us  and then moved on again .
ten minutes afterward we met a hot , red-faced man plunging down the mountain , making mighty strides , swinging his alpenstock ahead of him , and taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these big strides .
he stopped , fanned himself with his hat , <unk> the perspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief , panted a moment or two , and asked how far to <unk> .
i said three hours .
he looked surprised , and said : " why , it seems as if i could toss a biscuit into the lake from here , it 's so close by .
is that an inn , there ? "
i said it was .
" well , " said he , " i ca n't stand another three hours , i 've had enough today ; i 'll take a bed there . "
i asked : " are we nearly to the top ? "
" nearly to the top ?
why , bless your soul , you have n't really started , yet . "
i said we would put up at the inn , too .
so we turned back and ordered a hot supper , and had quite a jolly evening of it with this englishman .
the <name> landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds , and when i and my agent turned in , it was with the resolution to be up early and make the utmost of our first alpine sunrise .
but of course we were dead tired , and slept like policemen ; so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the window it was already too late , because it was half past eleven .
it was a sharp disappointment .
however , we ordered breakfast and told the landlady to call the englishman , but she said he was already up and off at daybreak  and swearing like mad about something or other .
we could not find out what the matter was .
he had asked the landlady the altitude of her place above the level of the lake , and she told him fourteen hundred and ninety-five feet .
that was all that was said ; then he lost his temper .
he said that between    fools and guide-books , a man could acquire ignorance enough in twenty-four hours in a country like this to last him a year .
<name> believed our boy had been loading him up with <unk> ; and this was probably the case , for his epithet described that boy to a <name> .
we got under way about the turn of noon , and pulled out for the summit again , with a fresh and vigorous step .
when we had gone about two hundred yards , and stopped to rest , i glanced to the left while i was lighting my pipe , and in the distance detected a long worm of black smoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain .
of course that was the locomotive .
we propped ourselves on our elbows at once , to gaze , for we had never seen a mountain railway yet .
presently we could make out the train .
it seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a sharp slant like the roof of a house  but there it was , and it was doing that very miracle .
in the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where the little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold them down to the earth when the great storms rage .
the country was wild and <name> about here , but there were plenty of trees , plenty of moss , and grass .
away off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages , and now for the first time we could observe the real difference between their proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they slept .
when one is in one of those villages it seems spacious , and its houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that <unk> them  but from our altitude , what a change !
the mountains were bigger and grander than ever , as they stood there thinking their solemn thoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds , but the villages at their feet  when the painstaking eye could trace them up and find them  were so reduced , almost invisible , and lay so flat against the ground , that the <unk> simile i can devise is to compare them to <unk> of <unk> dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a cathedral .
the steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices were diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys , the <unk> and rowboats to <unk> proper for fairies that keep house in the cups of lilies and ride to court on the backs of <unk> .
presently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high , and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious " <unk> ... l ... l l l <unk> ! "
<unk> joyously from a near but invisible source , and recognized that we were hearing for the first time the famous alpine <unk> in its own native wilds .
and we recognized , also , that it was that sort of quaint commingling of <unk> and <unk> which at home we call " <unk> <unk> . "
the <unk> ( pronounced <unk>  emphasis on the o ) continued , and was very pleasant and <unk> to hear .
now the <unk> appeared  a shepherd boy of sixteen  and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him a franc to <unk> some more .
so he <unk> and we listened .
we moved on , presently , and he generously <unk> us out of sight .
after about fifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was <unk> , and gave him half a franc to keep it up .
he also <unk> us out of sight .
after that , we found a <unk> every ten minutes ; we gave the first one eight cents , the second one six cents , the third one four , the fourth one a <name> , contributed nothing to nos .
5 , 6 , and 7 , and during the remainder of the day hired the rest of the <unk> , at a franc apiece , not to <unk> any more .
there is somewhat too much of the <unk> in the alps .
about the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the <unk> , formed by two enormous upright rocks , with a third lying across the top .
there was a very attractive little hotel close by , but our energies were not conquered yet , so we went on .
three hours afterward we came to the <unk> .
it was planted straight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a house , and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed to travel up it or down it either .
during the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting <unk> with <unk> water from clear streams , the only really satisfying water we had tasted since we left home , for at the hotels on the continent they merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in , and that only <unk> its <unk> , does n't make it cold .
water can only be made cold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or a closed <unk> .
europeans say ice-water <unk> digestion .
how do they know ?  they never drink any .
at ten minutes past six we reached the <unk> station , where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery .
we were pretty well fagged out , now , but as we did not wish to miss the alpine sunrise , we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed .
it was unspeakably comfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool , damp sheets .
and how we did sleep !  for there is no <unk> like alpine <unk> .
in the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant and ran and stripped aside the <unk> ; but we suffered a bitter disappointment again : it was already half past three in the afternoon .
we dressed sullenly and in ill spirits , each accusing the other of <unk> .
<name> said if we had brought the courier along , as we ought to have done , we should not have missed these <unk> .
i said he knew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the courier ; and i added that we were having trouble enough to take care of ourselves , on this climb , without having to take care of a courier besides .
during breakfast our spirits came up a little , since we found by this guide-book that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise , but is roused <unk> by a man who goes through the halls with a great alpine horn , blowing blasts that would raise the dead .
and there was another consoling thing : the guide-book said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much , but seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an indian .
this was good ; this would be romantic ; two hundred and fifty people grouped on the <name> summit , with their hair flying and their red blankets flapping , in the solemn presence of the coming sun , would be a striking and memorable spectacle .
so it was good luck , not ill luck , that we had missed those other <unk> .
we were informed by the guide-book that we were now <unk> feet above the level of the lake  therefore full two-thirds of our journey had been accomplished .
we got away at a quarter past four p.m. ; a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided ; one track went straight up the steep hill , the other one turned square off to the right , with a very slight grade .
we took the latter , and followed it more than a mile , turned a <name> corner , and came in sight of a handsome new hotel .
if we had gone on , we should have arrived at the summit , but <name> preferred to ask a lot of questions  as usual , of a man who did n't know anything  and he told us to go back and follow the other route .
we did so .
we could ill afford this loss of time .
we climbed and climbed ; and we kept on climbing ; we reached about forty summits , but there was always another one just ahead .
it came on to rain , and it rained in dead <name> .
we were soaked through and it was bitter cold .
next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely , and we took to the <unk> to keep from getting lost .
sometimes we <unk> along in a narrow path on the left-hand side of the track , but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy , we gasped , and jumped for the ties again .
the night shut down , dark and <unk> and cold .
about eight in the evening the fog lifted and showed us a well-worn path which led up a very steep rise to the left .
we took it , and as soon as we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility , the fog shut down on us once more .
we were in a bleak , <unk> place , now , and had to <unk> right along , in order to keep warm , though we rather expected to go over a precipice , sooner or later .
about nine o'clock we made an important discovery  that we were not in any path .
we groped around a while on our hands and knees , but we could not find it ; so we sat down in the mud and the wet scant grass to wait .
we were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant was smothered in the fog again .
it was really the hotel we were after , <unk> magnified by the fog , but we took it for the face of a precipice , and decided not to try to claw up it .
we sat there an hour , with chattering teeth and quivering bodies , and quarreled over all sorts of trifles , but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the <unk> .
we sat with our backs to the precipice , because what little wind there was came from that quarter .
at some time or other the fog thinned a little ; we did not know when , for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show ; but at last <name> happened to look around , and there stood a huge , dim , spectral hotel where the precipice had been .
one could faintly discern the windows and chimneys , and a dull blur of lights .
our first emotion was deep , unutterable gratitude , our next was a foolish rage , born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible three-quarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold puddles quarreling .
yes , it was the <unk> hotel  the one that occupies the extreme summit , and whose remote little <name> of lights we had often seen glinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder in lucerne .
the <unk> portier and the <unk> clerks gave us the surly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times , but by <unk> them with an extra display of <unk> and servility we finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for us .
we got into some dry clothing , and while our supper was preparing we loafed <unk> through a couple of vast cavernous drawing-rooms , one of which had a stove in it .
this stove was in a corner , and densely walled around with people .
we could not get near the fire , so we moved at large in the <unk> spaces , among a multitude of people who sat silent , <unk> , forlorn , and shivering  thinking what fools they were to come , perhaps .
there were some americans and some germans , but one could see that the great majority were english .
we lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd , to see what was going on .
it was a <unk> .
the tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of <unk> , marked " souvenir of the <unk> , " with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois ; there were all manner of wooden <unk> and such things , similarly marked .
i was going to buy a <unk> , but i believed i could remember the cold comfort of the <unk> without it , so i smothered the impulse .
supper warmed us , and we went immediately to bed  but first , as mr. baedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which they may find in his guide-books , i dropped him a line to inform him he missed it by just about three days .
i had previously informed him of his mistake about the distance from <unk> to <unk> , and had also informed the <unk> depart of the <name> government of the same error in the imperial maps .
i <name> add , here , that i never got any answer to those letters , or any thanks from either of those sources ; and , what is still more <unk> , these corrections have not been made , either in the maps or the guide-books .
but i <name> write again when i get time , for my letters may have miscarried .
we curled up in the clammy beds , and went to sleep without rocking .
we were so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till the blooming blasts of the alpine horn aroused us .
it may well be imagined that we did not lose any time .
we snatched on a few odds and ends of clothing , <unk> ourselves in the proper red blankets , and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind bareheaded .
we saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the summit , a hundred yards away , and made for it .
we rushed up the stairs to the top of this scaffolding , and stood there , above the vast outlying world , with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the fierce breeze .
" fifteen minutes too late , at last ! "
said <name> , in a vexed voice .
" the sun is clear above the horizon . "
" no matter , " i said , " it is a most magnificent spectacle , and we <name> see it do the rest of its rising anyway . "
in a moment we were deeply absorbed in the <name> before us , and dead to everything else .
the great <unk> disk of the sun stood just above a limitless expanse of tossing <unk>  so to speak  a billowy chaos of massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow , and flooded with an <unk> <name> of changing and dissolving splendors , while through <unk> in a black <unk> above the sun , radiating lances of <name> dust shot to the zenith .
the cloven valleys of the lower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the <unk> of their crags and ribs and ragged forests , and turned all the forbidding region into a soft and <name> and <unk> paradise .
we could not speak .
we could hardly breathe .
we could only gaze in drunken ecstasy and drink in it .
presently <name> exclaimed : " why  nation , it 's going down ! "
perfectly true .
we had missed the morning <unk> , and slept all day .
this was stupefying .
<name> said : " look here , the sun is n't the spectacle  it 's us  stacked up here on top of this gallows , in these idiotic blankets , and two hundred and fifty well-dressed men and women down here <unk> up at us and not caring a straw whether the sun rises or sets , as long as they 've got such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their <unk> .
they seem to be laughing their ribs loose , and there 's one girl there that appears to be going all to pieces .
i never saw such a man as you before .
i think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass . "
" what have i done ? "
i answered , with heat .
" what have you done ?
you 've got up at half past seven o'clock in the evening to see the sun rise , that 's what you 've done . "
" and have you done any better , i 'd like to know ?
i 've always used to get up with the lark , till i came under the <unk> influence of your <unk> intellect . "
" you used to get up with the lark  oh , no doubt  you 'll get up with the <unk> one of these days .
but you ought to be ashamed to be <unk> here like this , in a red blanket , on a <unk> scaffold on top of the alps .
and no end of people down here to boot ; this is n't any place for an exhibition of temper . "
and so the customary quarrel went on .
when the sun was fairly down , we slipped back to the hotel in the charitable <unk> , and went to bed again .
we had encountered the <unk> on the way , and he had tried to collect compensation , not only for announcing the sunset , which we did see , but for the sunrise , which we had totally missed ; but we said no , we only took our solar rations on the " european plan "  pay for what you get .
he promised to make us hear his horn in the morning , if we were alive .

we heard his horn and instantly got up .
it was dark and cold and wretched .
as i fumbled around for the matches , knocking things down with my quaking hands , i wished the sun would rise in the middle of the day , when it was warm and bright and cheerful , and one was n't sleepy .
we proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly candles , but we could hardly button anything , our hands shook so .
i thought of how many happy people there were in europe , <name> , and <name> , and everywhere , who were sleeping peacefully in their beds , and did not have to get up and see the <unk> sunrise  people who did not appreciate their advantage , as like as not , but would get up in the morning wanting more <unk> of providence .
while thinking these thoughts i yawned , in a rather ample way , and my upper teeth got hitched on a nail over the door , and while i was mounting a chair to free myself , <name> <name> the <unk> , and said : " oh , this is luck !
we <name> n't have to go out at all  yonder are the mountains , in full view . "
that was glad news , indeed .
it made us cheerful right away .
one could see the grand alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament , and one or two faint stars blinking through <unk> in the night .
fully clothed , and wrapped in blankets , and huddled ourselves up , by the window , with lighted pipes , and fell into chat , while we waited in exceeding comfort to see how an alpine sunrise was going to look by <unk> .
by and by a delicate , spiritual sort of <unk> spread itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy wastes  but there the effort seemed to stop .
i said , presently : " there is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere .
it does n't seem to go .
what do you reckon is the matter with it ? "
" i do n't know .
it appears to <name> fire somewhere .
i never saw a sunrise act like that before .
can it be that the hotel is playing anything on us ? "
" of course not .
the hotel merely has a property interest in the sun , it has nothing to do with the management of it .
it is a precarious kind of property , too ; a succession of total <unk> would probably ruin this tavern .
now what can be the matter with this sunrise ? "
<name> jumped up and said : " i 've got it !
i know what 's the matter with it !
we 've been looking at the place where the sun set last night ! "
" it is perfectly true !
why could n't you have thought of that sooner ?
now we 've lost another one !
and all through your blundering .
it was exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the west . "
" it was exactly like me to find out the mistake , too .
you never would have found it out .
i find out all the mistakes . "
" you make them all , too , else your most valuable faculty would be wasted on you .
but do n't stop to quarrel , now  maybe we are not too late yet . "
but we were .
the sun was well up when we got to the <unk> .
on our way up we met the crowd returning  men and women dressed in all sorts of queer costumes , and exhibiting all degrees of cold and wretchedness in their <unk> and countenances .
a dozen still remained on the ground when we reached there , huddled together about the scaffold with their backs to the bitter wind .
they had their red guide-books open at the diagram of the view , and were painfully picking out the several mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their memories .
it was one of the saddest sights i ever saw .
two sides of this place were guarded by railings , to keep people from being blown over the precipices .
the view , looking sheer down into the broad valley , eastward , from this great elevation  almost a perpendicular mile  was very quaint and curious .
counties , towns , hilly ribs and ridges , wide stretches of green meadow , great forest tracts , winding streams , a dozen blue lakes , a block of busy steamboats  we saw all this little world in unique <unk> of detail  saw it just as the birds see it  and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving .
the numerous toy villages , with <name> spires projecting out of them , were just as the children might have left them when done with play the day before ; the forest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss ; one or two big lakes were dwarfed to ponds , the smaller ones to puddles  though they did not look like puddles , but like blue <unk> which had fallen and lodged in slight depressions , conformable to their shapes , among the <unk> and the smooth levels of dainty green <unk> ; the microscopic steamboats glided along , as in a city reservoir , taking a mighty time to cover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart ; and the isthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and lie with both elbows in the water , yet we knew invisible wagons were toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one .
this beautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those " relief maps " which reproduce nature precisely , with the heights and depressions and other details graduated to a reduced scale , and with the rocks , trees , lakes , etc. , colored after nature .
i believed we could walk down to <unk> or <unk> in a day , but i knew we could go down by rail in about an hour , so i chose the latter method .
i wanted to see what it was like , anyway .
the train came along about the middle of the afternoon , and an odd thing it was .
the <unk> stood on end , and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply backward .
there were two <unk> , roofed , but wide open all around .
these cars were not tilted back , but the seats were ; this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline .
there are three <unk> ; the central one is <unk> ; the " lantern wheel " of the engine <unk> its way along these <unk> , and pulls the train up the hill or <unk> its motion on the down trip .
about the same speed  three miles an hour  is maintained both ways .
whether going up or down , the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train .
it pushes in the one case , braces back in the other .
the passenger rides backward going up , and faces forward going down .
we got front seats , and while the train moved along about fifty yards on level ground , i was not the least frightened ; but now it started abruptly downstairs , and i caught my breath .
and i , like my neighbors , unconsciously held back all i could , and threw my weight to the rear , but , of course , that did no particular good .
i had <unk> down the <unk> when i was a boy , and thought nothing of it , but to slide down the <unk> in a <unk> is a thing to make one 's flesh creep .
sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground , and this gave us a few full breaths in comfort ; but straightway we would turn a corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us , and the comfort was at an end .
one expected to see the locomotive pause , or slack up a little , and approach this plunge cautiously , but it did nothing of the kind ; it went calmly on , and went it reached the <unk> place it made a sudden bow , and went gliding smoothly downstairs , untroubled by the circumstances .
it was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices , after this grisly fashion , and look straight down upon that far-off valley which i was describing a while ago .
there was no level ground at the <unk> station ; the <unk> was as steep as a roof ; i was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed .
but it was very simple ; the train came sliding down , and when it reached the right spot it just stopped  that was all there was " to it "  stopped on the steep incline , and when the exchange of passengers and baggage had been made , it moved off and went sliding down again .
the train can be stopped anywhere , at a moment 's notice .
there was one curious effect , which i need not take the trouble to describe  because i can <unk> a description of it out of the railway company 's advertising pamphlet , and save my ink : " on the whole tour , particularly at the descent , we undergo an optical illusion which often seems to be incredible .
all the shrubs , fir trees , stables , houses , etc. , seem to be bent in a slanting direction , as by an immense pressure of air .
they are all standing awry , so much awry that the <unk> and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down .
it is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line .
those who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a declivity of twenty to twenty-five degrees ( their seats being adapted to this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs ) .
they mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of the normal plain , and therefore all the objects outside which really are in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to twenty-five degrees declivity , in regard to the mountain . "
by the time one reaches <unk> , he has acquired confidence in the railway , and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding back .
thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity , and gazes out upon the magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment .
there is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze ; it is like inspecting the world on the wing .
however  to be exact  there is one place where the serenity lapses for a while ; this is while one is crossing the <unk> bridge , a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame down through the dizzy air , over a gorge , like a vagrant <unk> .
one has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is creeping down this bridge ; and he <unk> of them , too ; though he sees , when he gets to <unk> , that he need not have done it , the bridge was perfectly safe .
so ends the eventual trip which we made to the <unk> to see an alpine sunrise .
chapter xxx [ <name> climbs mountains for me ] an hour 's sail brought us to lucerne again .
i judged it best to go to bed and rest several days , for i knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of europe on foot must take care of himself .
thinking over my plans , as mapped out , i perceived that they did not take in the <unk> pass , the rhone glacier , the <unk> , the <unk> , etc .
i immediately examined the guide-book to see if these were important , and found they were ; in fact , a pedestrian tour of europe could not be complete without them .
of course that decided me at once to see them , for i never allow myself to do things by halves , or in a <unk> , <unk> way .
i called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a careful examination of these noted places , on foot , and bring me back a written report of the result , for insertion in my book .
i instructed him to go to <unk> as quickly as possible , and make his grand start from there ; to extend his foot expedition as far as the <unk> fall , and return to me from thence by diligence or mule .
i told him to take the courier with him .
he objected to the courier , and with some show of reason , since he was about to venture upon new and untried ground ; but i thought he might as well learn how to take care of the courier now as later , therefore i enforced my point .
i said that the trouble , delay , and inconvenience of traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a courier 's presence commands , and i must insist that as much style be thrown into my journeys as possible .
so the two assumed complete <unk> costumes and departed .
a week later they returned , pretty well used up , and my agent handed me the following : official report of a visit to the <unk> region .
by h. <name> , agent about seven o'clock in the morning , with perfectly fine weather , we started from <unk> , and arrived at the <unk> on the <unk> in a little under <unk> hours .
the want of variety in the scenery from <unk> made the <unk> wearisome ; but let none be discouraged ; no one can fail to be completely <unk> for his fatigue , when he sees , for the first time , the monarch of the <unk> , the tremendous <unk> .
a moment before all was <unk> , but a pas further has placed us on the summit of the <unk> ; and exactly in front of us , at a <unk> of only fifteen miles , this magnificent mountain lifts its <unk> precipices into the deep blue sky .
the inferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord , and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the <unk> is visible from this <unk> ; nothing <unk> the attention from the solitary grandeur of the <unk> and the dependent spurs which form the <unk> of the central peak .
with the addition of some others , who were also bound for the <unk> , we formed a large <unk> as we descended the <unk> which winds round the shoulder of a mountain toward the rhone glacier .
we soon left the path and took to the ice ; and after wandering amongst the crevices <name> <unk> , to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns , and hear the rushing of waters through their <unk> channels , we struck out a course toward <unk> <unk> and crossed the glacier successfully , a little above the cave from which the infant rhone takes its first bound from under the grand precipice of ice .
half a mile below this we began to climb the flowery side of the <unk> .
one of our party started before the rest , but the <unk> was so great , that we found <unk> quite exhausted , and lying at full length in the shade of a large <unk> .
we sat down with him for a time , for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very steep <unk> , and then we set out again together , and arrived at last near the dead man 's lake , at the foot of the <unk> .
this lonely spot , once used for an <unk> <unk> , after a sanguinary <unk> between the french and <unk> , is the perfection of desolation ; there is nothing in sight to <name> the hand of man , except the line of weather-beaten whitened posts , set up to indicate the direction of the pass in the <unk> of <name> .
near this point the footpath joins the wider track , which connects the <unk> with the head of the rhone <unk> ; this has been carefully constructed , and leads with a tortuous course among and over <name> <unk> , down to the bank of the gloomy little <unk> , which almost washes against the walls of the <unk> <unk> .
we arrived a little before four o'clock at the end of our day 's journey , hot enough to justify the step , taking by most of the <unk> , of plunging into the <name> water of the <unk> lake .
the next afternoon we started for a walk up the <unk> glacier , with the intention of , at all events , getting as far as the <unk> which is used as a <unk> by most of those who cross the <unk> pass to grindelwald .
we got over the tedious collection of stones and <unk> which covers the pied of the <unk> , and had walked nearly three hours from the <unk> , when , just as we were thinking of crossing over to the right , to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut , the clouds , which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance , suddenly dropped , and a huge mass of them , driving toward us from the <unk> , poured down a deluge of <unk> and hail .
fortunately , we were not far from a very large <unk> ; it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for <unk> .
a stream of <unk> had furrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base , and we were obliged to stand with one fuss on each side of this , and endeavor to keep ourselves <unk> by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal , so as to get a higher place for standing on , as the <unk> rose rapidly in its trench .
a very cold <unk> accompanied the storm , and made our position far from pleasant ; and presently came a flash of blitzen , apparently in the middle of our little party , with an instantaneous clap of <unk> , sounding like a large gun fired close to our ears ; the effect was startling ; but in a few seconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us .
this was followed by many more bursts , none of <unk> , however , was so dangerously near ; and after waiting a long <unk> in our icy prison , we sallied out to talk through a <unk> which , though not so heavy as before , was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the <unk> .
the <unk> is <unk> a wonderful place ; situated at the bottom of a sort of huge crater , the sides of which are utterly savage <unk> , composed of barren rocks which can not even support a single pine <unk> , and afford only scanty food for a herd of <unk> , it looks as if it must be completely <unk> in the <name> snows .
enormous avalanches fall against it every spring , sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet ; and , in spite of walls four feet thick , and furnished with outside shutters , the two men who stay here when the <unk> are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations .
next morning the <unk> still continued bad , but we made up our minds to go on , and make the best of it .
half an hour after we started , the <unk> thickened unpleasantly , and we attempted to get shelter under a projecting rock , but being far to <unk> already to make standing at all <unk> , we pushed on for the <unk> , consoling ourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river <unk> at our side , we should at all events see the celebrated <unk> in grande perfection .
nor were we <unk> in our expectation ; the water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most magnificent frenzy , while the trees which cling to its <name> sides swayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down with it ; even the stream , which falls into the main cascade at right angles , and <unk> forms a beautiful feature in the scene , was now swollen into a raging torrent ; and the violence of this " meeting of the waters , " about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood , was fearfully grand .
while we were looking at it , <unk> a gleam of <name> came out , and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by the spray , and <name> in <unk> suspended over the awful gorge .
on going into the chalet above the fall , we were informed that a <unk> had broken down near <unk> , and that it would be impossible to proceed for some time ; accordingly we were kept in our drenched condition for ein <unk> , when some <unk> arrived from <unk> , and told us that there had been a trifling accident , aber that we could now cross .
on arriving at the spot , i was much inclined to suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us <unk> and drink the more at the <unk> inn , for only a few planks had been carried away , and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules , the gap was certainly not larger than a <unk> might cross with a very slight leap .
near <unk> the <unk> happily ceased , and we had time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at <unk> , wo we enjoyed a good <unk> at the hotel des alps .
next morning we walked to <unk> , the <name> <unk> of swiss scenery , where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier .
this was more beautiful than words can describe , for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern , as blue as the sky above , and rippled like a frozen ocean .
a few steps cut in the <unk> enabled us to walk completely under this , and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation .
the glacier was all around divided by numberless fissures of the same exquisite color , and the finest <unk> were growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice .
the inn stands in a <unk> spot close to the <unk> de la <unk> , which , lower down , forms the <unk> fall , and <unk> in the richest of pine woods , while the fine form of the <unk> looking down upon it <unk> the enchanting <unk> .
in the afternoon we walked over the great <unk> to grindelwald , stopping to pay a visit to the upper glacier by the way ; but we were again overtaken by bad <unk> and arrived at the hotel in a <unk> a state that the landlord 's wardrobe was in great request .
the clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst , for a lovely day succeeded , which we determined to devote to an ascent of the <unk> .
we left grindelwald just as a thunder-storm was dying away , and we hoped to find <unk> <unk> up above ; but the rain , which had nearly ceased , began again , and we were struck by the rapidly increasing <unk> as we ascended .
two-thirds of the way up were completed when the rain was exchanged for <unk> , with which the <unk> was thickly covered , and before we arrived at the top the <unk> and mist became so thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty <unk> distance , and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and thickly covered ground .
shivering with cold , we turned into bed with a double allowance of clothes , and slept comfortably while the wind howled <unk> de la <unk> ; when i awoke , the wall and the window looked equally dark , but in another hour i found i could just see the form of the latter ; so i jumped out of bed , and forced it open , though with great difficulty from the frost and the quantities of <unk> heaped up against it .
a row of huge icicles <name> down from the edge of the roof , and anything more wintry than the whole <unk> could not well be imagined ; but the sudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling that i felt no inclination to move toward bed again .
the snow which had collected upon la <unk> had increased the <unk> oder der <unk> , so that when i looked out i was surprised to find that the daylight was considerable , and that the <unk> would evidently rise before long .
only the brightest of <name> <unk> were still shining ; the sky was cloudless overhead , though small curling mists lay thousands of feet below us in the valleys , wreathed around the feet of the mountains , and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits .
we were soon dressed and out of the house , watching the gradual approach of <name> , thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the <unk> giants , which broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before .
" <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> ! "
cried some one , as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of <name> ; and in a few moments the double crest of the <unk> followed its example ; peak after peak seemed warmed with life , the jungfrau blushed even more beautifully than her neighbors , and soon , from the <unk> in the east to the <unk> in the west , a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars , truly worthy of the gods .
the <unk> was very severe ; our <unk> could hardly be <unk> from the snow around it , which had fallen to a depth of a <unk> during the past evening , and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble en <unk> to the <unk> falls , where we soon found a warm climate .
at noon the day before grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than 100 degrees fahr .
in the sun ; and in the evening , judging from the icicles formed , and the state of the windows , there must have been at least twelve <unk> of frost , thus giving a change of 80 degrees during a few hours .
i said : " you have done well , <name> ; this report is concise , compact , well expressed ; the language is crisp , the descriptions are vivid and not <unk> elaborated ; your report goes straight to the point , attends strictly to business , and does n't fool around .
it is in many ways an excellent document .
but it has a fault  it is too learned , it is much too learned .
what is <unk> ' ?
" <unk> ' is a fiji word meaning <unk> . ' "
" you knew the english of it , then ? "
" oh , yes . "
" what is <unk> ' ?
" that is the <unk> term for <unk> . ' "
" so you knew the english for that , too ? "
" why , certainly . "
" what does <unk> ' stand for ? "
" that is zulu for <unk> . ' "
" <unk> the form of the <unk> looking down upon it <unk> the enchanting <unk> . '
what is <unk> ' ? "
" <unk> . '
it 's <unk> . "
" what is <unk> ' ? "
" <unk> . '
that is <unk> , also . "
" what is <unk> ' ? "
" that is chinese for <unk> . ' "
" <unk> ' ? "
" <unk> . '
<unk> . "
" 'but we were again overtaken by bad <unk> . '
what does <unk> ' mean ? "
" that is chinese for <unk> . ' "
" is <unk> ' better than the english word ?
is it any more descriptive ? "
" no , it means just the same . "
" and <unk> ' and <unk> , ' and <unk> , ' and <unk> '  are they better than the english words ? "
" no , they mean just what the english ones do . "
" then why do you use them ?
why have you used all this chinese and <unk> and zulu rubbish ? "
" because i did n't know any french but two or three words , and i didn't know any latin or greek at all . "
" that is nothing .
why should you want to use foreign words , anyhow ? "
" they adorn my <name> .
they all do it . "
" who is 'all ' ? "
" everybody .
everybody that writes elegantly .
anybody has a right to that wants to . "
" i think you are mistaken . "
i then proceeded in the following <unk> manner .
" when really learned men write books for other learned men to read , they are justified in using as many learned words as they please  their audience <name> understand them ; but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in <unk> his pages with <unk> foreign expressions .
it is an insolence toward the majority of the <unk> , for it is a very <name> and impudent way of saying , 'get the translations made yourself if you want them , this book is not written for the ignorant classes . '
there are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their english writings unconsciously , and so they omit to translate , as much as half the time .
that is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man's readers .
what is the excuse for this ?
the writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point can not be conveyed in english .
very well , then he writes his best things for the tenth man , and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book .
however , the excuse he offers is at least an excuse ; but there is another set of men who are like you ; they know a word here and there , of a foreign language , or a few <unk> little <unk> phrases , <unk> from the back of the dictionary , and these are continually <unk> into their literature , with a pretense of knowing that language  what excuse can they offer ?
the foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler language  english ; yet they think they <unk> their <name> ' when they say <unk> for street , and <unk> for <unk> , and so on  <unk> these fluttering rags of poverty in the reader 's face and imagining he <name> be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve .
i <name> let your <unk> ' remain in your report ; you have as much right , i suppose , to <unk> your <name> ' with zulu and chinese and <unk> rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends <unk> from half a dozen learned tongues whose <unk> <unk> they do n't even know . "
when the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel , he first exhibits a wild surprise , then he <unk> up .
similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting agent .
i can be dreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me .
chapter xxxi [ <unk> by carriage ] we now prepared for a considerable walk  from lucerne to <unk> , over the <unk> pass .
but at the last moment the weather was so good that i changed my mind and hired a <unk> carriage .
it was a huge vehicle , roomy , as easy in its motion as a palanquin , and exceedingly comfortable .
we got away pretty early in the morning , after a hot breakfast , and went bowling over a hard , smooth road , through the summer loveliness of switzerland , with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye , and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear .
sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of <unk> fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow ; and sometimes , in place of the precipices , the grassy land stretched away , in an apparently endless upward slant , and was dotted everywhere with snug little <unk> , the peculiarly <unk> cottage of switzerland .
the ordinary chalet turns a broad , honest gable end to the road , and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting , caressing way , projecting its sheltering eaves far outward .
the quaint windows are filled with little panes , and garnished with white muslin curtains , and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers .
across the front of the house , and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch , are elaborate carvings  wreaths , fruits , <unk> , verses from scripture , names , dates , etc .
the building is wholly of wood , reddish brown in tint , a very pleasing color .
it generally has vines climbing over it .
set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside , and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque , and is a decidedly graceful addition to the landscape .
one does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him , until he presently comes upon a new house  a house which is <unk> the town fashions of germany and <name> , a prim , hideous , <unk> thing , plastered all over on the outside to look like stone , and altogether so stiff , and formal , and ugly , and forbidding , and so out of tune with the gracious landscape , and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings , that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic , a corpse at a wedding , a puritan in paradise .
in the course of the morning we passed the spot where <unk> <unk> is said to have thrown himself into the lake .
the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him , and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth , weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind .
eventually , he hid himself away , on the heights of mount <unk> , and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years ; but rest and peace were still denied him , so he finally put an end to his misery by drowning himself .
presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born .
this was the children 's friend , <name> claus , or st. <name> .
there are some unaccountable reputations in the world .
this saint 's is an instance .
he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children , yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own .
he had ten of them , and when fifty years old he left them , and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible , and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises from the nursery , doubtless .
judging by <unk> and st. <name> , there exists no rule for the construction of hermits ; they seem made out of all kinds of material .
but <unk> attended to the matter of <unk> his sin while he was alive , whereas st. <name> <name> probably have to go on climbing down <unk> chimneys , christmas <name> , forever , and conferring kindness on other people 's children , to make up for deserting his own .
his bones are kept in a church in a village ( <unk> ) which we visited , and are naturally held in great reverence .
his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region , but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness .
during his hermit life , according to legend , he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month , but all the rest of the month he <unk> .
a constant <name> with us , as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey , was , not that avalanches occur , but that they are not occurring all the time .
one does not understand why rocks and <unk> do not plunge down these declivities daily .
a <unk> occurred three quarters of a century ago , on the route from <unk> to <unk> , which was a formidable thing .
a mass of conglomerate two miles long , a thousand feet broad , and a hundred feet thick , broke away from a <name> three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below , burying four villages and five hundred people , as in a grave .
we had such a beautiful day , and such endless pictures of limpid lakes , and green hills and valleys , and majestic mountains , and milky cataracts dancing down the <unk> and gleaming in the sun , that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world ; so we tried to drink all the milk , and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries , and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale ; but we had to retire from this contract , for it was too heavy .
at short distances  and they were entirely too short  all along the road , were groups of neat and comely children , with their wares nicely and <unk> set forth in the grass under the shade trees , and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road , holding out their baskets and milk bottles , and ran beside the carriage , barefoot and bareheaded , and <unk> us to buy .
they seldom desisted early , but continued to run and insist  beside the wagon while they could , and behind it until they lost breath .
then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their trading-post again .
after several hours of this , without any intermission , it becomes almost annoying .
i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit .
however , there were plenty of these , loaded with <name> tourists and piled high with luggage .
indeed , from lucerne to <unk> we had the spectacle , among other scenery , of an unbroken procession of <unk> and tourists carriages .
our talk was mostly <unk> of what we should see on the <unk> of the <unk> , by and by , after we should pass the summit .
all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon <unk> , and the rushing <unk> river <unk> , and the broad level green valley ; and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley ; and up at the microscopic <unk> perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor ; and still up and up , at the superb <unk> and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights , robed in <unk> spray , ruffled with foam , and <unk> with rainbows  to look upon these things , they say , was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting .
therefore , as i say , we talked mainly of these coming wonders ; if we were conscious of any impatience , it was to get there in favorable season ; if we felt any anxiety , it was that the day might remain perfect , and enable us to see those marvels at their best .
as we approached the <unk> , a part of the harness gave way .
we were in distress for a moment , but only a moment .
it was the <unk> gear that was broken  the thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon .
in <name> this would have been a heavy leathern strap ; but , all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little finger  <unk> is what it is .
cabs use it , private carriages , <unk> and wagons , all sorts of vehicles have it .
in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty-four <unk> of beer ; i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used it  not new rope , but rope that had been in use since <unk> time  and i had felt nervous , sometimes , behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill .
but i had long been accustomed to it now , and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place .
our driver got a fresh piece of <unk> out of his locker and repaired the break in two minutes .
so much for one european fashion .
every country has its own ways .
it may interest the reader to know how they " put horses to " on the continent .
the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon , and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring , and <unk> it aft , and passes the other thing through the other ring and <unk> it aft on the other side of the other horse , opposite to the first one , after crossing them and bringing the loose end back , and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse , and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing i spoke of before , and puts another thing over each horse 's head , with broad <unk> to it to keep the dust out of his eyes , and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on , uphill , and brings the ends of these things aft over his back , after <unk> another one around under his neck to hold his head up , and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill , and then takes the slack of the thing which i mentioned a while ago , and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon , and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with .
i never have buckled up a horse myself , but i do not think we do it that way .
we had four very handsome horses , and the driver was very proud of his turnout .
he would bowl along on a reasonable trot , on the highway , but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run , and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless <unk> that sounded like volleys of musketry .
he tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake , <unk> his volleys as he went , and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children , ducks , cats , and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction ; and as this living wave washed aside , along the walls , its elements , being safe , forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next curve and was lost to sight .
he was a great man to those villagers , with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways .
whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread , the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about , the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage , and the landlord brought out foaming <unk> of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank .
then he mounted his lofty box , swung his explosive whip , and away he went again , like a storm .
i had not seen anything like this before since i was a boy , and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting .
when we reached the base of the <unk> , we took two more horses ; we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours , for the ascent was not very gradual , but when we passed the backbone and approached the station , the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter .
he could not have six horses all the time , so he made the most of his chance while he had it .
up to this point we had been in the heart of the <name> tell region .
the hero is not forgotten , by any means , or held in doubtful veneration .
his wooden image , with his bow drawn , above the doors of taverns , was a frequent feature of the scenery .
about noon we arrived at the foot of the <unk> pass , and made a <unk> stop at the village hotel , another of those clean , pretty , and thoroughly well-kept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote <unk> .
there was a lake here , in the lap of the great mountains , the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens , and from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling cataract .
carriage after carriage , laden with tourists and trunks , arrived , and the quiet hotel was soon populous .
we were early at the table d'hôte and saw the people all come in .
there were twenty-five , perhaps .
they were of various nationalities , but we were the only americans .
next to me sat an english bride , and next to her sat her new husband , whom she called " <unk> , " though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name .
they had a pretty little lovers ' quarrel over what wine they should have .
<unk> was for obeying the guide-book and taking the wine of the country ; but the bride said : " what , that <unk> stuff ! "
" it is n't <unk> , pet , it 's quite good . "
" it is <unk> . "
" no , it is n't <unk> . "
" it 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and i shah n't drink it . "
then the question was , what she must have .
she said he knew very well that she never drank anything but champagne .
she added : " you know very well papa always has champagne on his table , and i've always been used to it . "
<unk> made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense , and this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with laughter  and this pleased him so much that he repeated his jest a couple of times , and added new and killing varieties to it .
when the bride finally recovered , she gave <unk> a <unk> on the arm with her fan , and said with arch severity : " well , you would have me  nothing else would do  so you 'll have to make the best of a bad bargain .
do order the champagne , i 'm <unk> dry . "
so with a mock groan which made her laugh again , <unk> ordered the champagne .
the fact that this young woman had never moistened the <unk> edge of her soul with a less plebeian <unk> than champagne , had a marked and subduing effect on <name> .
he believed she belonged to the <name> family .
but i had my doubts .
we heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the table and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our satisfaction , but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and a young girl who sat opposite us , and with a gentleman of about thirty-five who sat three seats beyond <name> .
we did not hear any of these speak .
but finally the <unk> gentleman left while we were not noticing , but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table .
he stopped there a moment , and made his toilet with a pocket comb .
so he was a <name> ; or else he had lived in <name> hotels long enough to catch the fashion .
when the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave , they bowed respectfully to us .
so they were germans , too .
this national custom is worth six of the other one , for export .
after dinner we talked with several englishmen , and they inflamed our <name> to a hotter degree than ever , to see the sights of <unk> from the heights of the <unk> pass .
they said the view was marvelous , and that one who had seen it once could never forget it .
they also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass , and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock , in such a way that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by ; and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience , for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind , like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew .
i got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need ; and then , to make everything complete , i asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there , in case of necessity .
they threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with <unk> .
we were impatient to get away , now , and the rest of our <unk> stop rather dragged .
but finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent .
indeed it was a wonderful road .
it was smooth , and compact , and clean , and the side next the precipices was guarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high , placed at short distances apart .
the road could not have been better built if <name> the first had built it .
he seems to have been the <unk> of the sort of roads which europe now uses .
all literature which describes life as it existed in england , <name> , and germany up to the close of the last century , is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages wallowing through these three countries in mud and slush <unk> deep ; but after <name> had floundered through a conquered kingdom he generally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow <unk> .
we went on climbing , higher and higher , and curving hither and thither , in the shade of <name> woods , and with a <name> variety and profusion of wild flowers all about us ; and glimpses of rounded grassy <unk> below us occupied by trim <unk> and nibbling sheep , and other glimpses of far lower altitudes , where distance diminished the <unk> to toys and obliterated the sheep altogether ; and every now and then some <unk> monarch of the alps swung magnificently into view for a moment , then drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again .
it was an intoxicating trip altogether ; the exceeding sense of satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment ; the having something especial to look forward to and muse about , like the approaching grandeurs of <unk> , sharpened the zest .
smoking was never so good before , solid comfort was never <unk> ; we lay back against the thick cushions silent , meditative , steeped in felicity .
* * * * * * * * i rubbed my eyes , opened them , and started .
i had been dreaming i was at sea , and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me .
it took me a couple seconds to " come to , " as you may say ; then i took in the situation .
the horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town , the driver was taking beer , <name> was snoring at my side , the courier , with folded arms and bowed head , was sleeping on the box , two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage , with their hands crossed behind , gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun .
several small girls held <unk> babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms , and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of sluggish interest in us .
we had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery !
i did not need anybody to tell me that .
if i had been a girl , i could have cursed for vexation .
as it was , i woke up the agent and gave him a piece of my mind .
instead of being humiliated , he only upbraided me for being so wanting in vigilance .
he said he had expected to improve his mind by coming to europe , but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with me and never see anything , for i was manifestly endowed with the very genius of ill luck .
he even tried to get up some emotion about that poor courier , who never got a chance to see anything , on account of my <unk> .
but when i thought i had borne about enough of this kind of talk , i threatened to make <name> tramp back to the summit and make a report on that scenery , and this suggestion spiked his battery .
we drove sullenly through <unk> , dead to the <unk> of its bewildering array of swiss carvings and the clamorous <unk> of its cuckoo clocks , and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we rattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the pretty town of <unk> .
it was just about sunset , and we had made the trip from lucerne in ten hours .
chapter xxxii [ the jungfrau , the bride , and the piano ] we located ourselves at the jungfrau hotel , one of those huge establishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every attractive spot on the continent .
there was a great gathering at dinner , and , as usual , one heard all sorts of languages .
the table d'hôte was served by <unk> dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the swiss peasants .
this consists of a simple <unk> de <name> , trimmed with ashes of roses , with <unk> of scare <unk> <unk> saint <unk> , cut bias on the <unk> , with facings of <unk> <unk> and narrow <unk> of <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> en <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> .
it gives to the wearer a singularly <unk> and alluring aspect .
one of these <unk> , a woman of forty , had <unk> reaching half-way down her jaws .
they were two fingers broad , dark in color , pretty thick , and the hairs were an inch long .
one sees many women on the continent with quite conspicuous <unk> , but this was the only woman i saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers .
after dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the front porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel , to enjoy the cool air ; but , as the twilight deepened toward darkness , they gathered themselves together in that saddest and <unk> and most constrained of all places , the great blank drawing-room which is the chief feature of all continental summer hotels .
there they grouped themselves about , in couples and threes , and mumbled in bated voices , and looked timid and homeless and forlorn .
there was a small piano in this room , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thing , certainly the very worst <unk> in the way of a piano that the world has seen .
in turn , five or six dejected and homesick ladies approached it <unk> , gave it a single inquiring thump , and retired with the <unk> .
but the boss of that instrument was to come , nevertheless ; and from my own country  from arkansaw .
she was a brand-new bride , innocent , girlish , happy in herself and her grave and worshiping <unk> of a husband ; she was about eighteen , just out of school , free from <unk> , unconscious of that passionless multitude around her ; and the very first time she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its <name> .
her <unk> brought an armful of aged <unk> from their room  for this bride went " <unk> , " as you might say  and bent himself lovingly over and got ready to turn the pages .
the bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the <unk> to the other , just to get her bearings , as it were , and you could see the congregation set their teeth with the agony of it .
then , without any more preliminaries , she turned on all the horrors of the " battle of <unk> , " that venerable <unk> , and waded <unk> in the blood of the slain .
she made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in every five , but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct .
the audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while , but when the <unk> waxed hotter and fiercer , and the discord average rose to four in five , the procession began to move .
a few stragglers held their ground ten minutes longer , but when the girl began to wring the true <unk> out of the " cries of the wounded , " they struck their colors and retired in a kind of panic .
there never was a <unk> victory ; i was the only <unk> left on the field .
i would not have deserted my <unk> anyhow , but indeed i had no desires in that direction .
none of us like <unk> , but we all reverence perfection .
this girl 's music was perfection in its way ; it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by a mere human being .
i moved up close , and never lost a strain .
when she got through , i asked her to play it again .
she did it with a pleased alacrity and a heightened enthusiasm .
she made it all <unk> , this time .
she got an amount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on human suffering .
she was on the war-path all the evening .
all the time , crowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against the windows to look and <name> , but the bravest never ventured in .
the bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow , when her appetite was finally gorged , and the tourists swarmed in again .
what a change has come over switzerland , and in fact all europe , during this century !
seventy or eighty years ago <name> was the only man in europe who could really be called a traveler ; he was the only man who had devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it ; he was the only man who had traveled extensively ; but now everybody goes everywhere ; and switzerland , and many other regions which were <unk> and unknown <unk> a hundred years ago , are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer .
but i <unk> .
in the morning , when we looked out of our windows , we saw a wonderful sight .
across the valley , and apparently quite <unk> and close at hand , the giant form of the jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear sky , beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands .
it reminded me , somehow , of one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside one's ship , at sea , sometimes , with its crest and shoulders snowy white , and the rest of its <name> proportions streaked downward with creamy foam .
i took out my sketch-book and made a little picture of the jungfrau , merely to get the shape .
i do not regard this as one of my finished works , in fact i do not rank it among my works at all ; it is only a study ; it is hardly more than what one might call a sketch .
other artists have done me the <name> to admire it ; but i am severe in my judgments of my own pictures , and this one does not move me .
it was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which so <unk> the jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two , but it was not , of course .
it is only two or three thousand feet high , and of course has no snow upon it in summer , whereas the jungfrau is not much shorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge of snow on her side , which seems nearly down to the valley level , is really about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit of that wooded rampart .
it is the distance that makes the deception .
the wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us , but the jungfrau is four or five times that distance away .
walking down the street of shops , in the <unk> , i was attracted by a large picture , carved , frame and all , from a single block of <unk> wood .
there are people who know everything .
some of these had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices on english and americans .
many people had told us it was expensive to buy things through a courier , whereas i had supposed it was just the reverse .
when i saw this picture , i conjectured that it was worth more than the friend i proposed to buy it for would like to pay , but still it was worth while to inquire ; so i told the courier to step in and ask the price , as if he wanted it for himself ; i told him not to speak in english , and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier .
then i moved on a few yards , and waited .
the courier came presently and reported the price .
i said to myself , " it is a hundred francs too much , " and so dismissed the matter from my mind .
but in the afternoon i was passing that place with <name> , and the picture attracted me again .
we stepped in , to see how much higher broken <name> would raise the price .
the <unk> named a figure just a hundred francs lower than the courier had named .
this was a pleasant surprise .
i said i would take it .
after i had given directions as to where it was to be shipped , the <unk> said , appealingly : " if you please , do not let your courier know you bought it . "
this was an unexpected remark .
i said : " what makes you think i have a courier ? "
" ah , that is very simple ; he told me himself . "
" he was very thoughtful .
but tell me  why did you charge him more than you are charging me ? "
" that is very simple , also : i do not have to pay you a percentage . "
" oh , i begin to see .
you would have had to pay the courier a percentage . "
" undoubtedly .
the courier always has his percentage .
in this case it would have been a hundred francs . "
" then the <unk> does not pay a part of it  the purchaser pays all of it ? "
" there are occasions when the <unk> and the courier agree upon a price which is twice or thrice the value of the article , then the two divide , and both get a percentage . "
" i see .
but it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying , even then . "
" oh , to be sure !
it goes without saying . "
" but i have bought this picture myself ; therefore why should n't the courier know it ? "
the woman exclaimed , in distress : " ah , indeed it would take all my little profit !
he would come and demand his hundred francs , and i should have to pay . "
" he has not done the buying .
you could refuse . "
" i could not dare to refuse .
he would never bring travelers here again .
more than that , he would denounce me to the other couriers , they would divert custom from me , and my business would be injured . "
i went away in a thoughtful frame of mind .
i began to see why a courier could afford to work for fifty-five dollars a month and his fares .
a month or two later i was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging , and why my hotel bills were always larger when i had him with me than when i left him behind , somewhere , for a few days .
another thing was also explained , now , apparently .
in one town i had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when i <name> some money .
i had sat in the reading-room till the transaction was finished .
then a clerk had brought the money to me in person , and had been exceedingly polite , even going so far as to precede me to the door and holding it open for me and bow me out as if i had been a distinguished personage .
it was a new experience .
exchange had been in my favor ever since i had been in europe , but just that one time .
i got simply the face of my draft , and no extra francs , whereas i had expected to get quite a number of them .
this was the first time i had ever used the courier at the bank .
i had suspected something then , and as long as he remained with me afterward i managed bank matters by myself .
still , if i felt that i could afford the tax , i would never travel without a courier , for a good courier is a convenience whose value can not be estimated in dollars and cents .
without him , travel is a bitter <unk> , a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances , a ceaseless and pitiless punishment  i mean to an <unk> man who has no business capacity and is confused by details .
without a courier , travel has n't a <name> of pleasure in it , anywhere ; but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight .
he is always at hand , never has to be sent for ; if your <name> is not answered promptly  and it seldom is  you have only to open the door and speak , the courier <name> hear , and he <name> have the order attended to or raise an insurrection .
you tell him what day you <name> start , and whither you are going  leave all the rest to him .
you need not inquire about trains , or fares , or car changes , or hotels , or anything else .
at the proper time he <name> put you in a cab or an omnibus , and drive you to the train or the boat ; he has packed your luggage and transferred it , he has paid all the bills .
other people have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places and lose their tempers , but you can take your time ; the courier has secured your seats for you , and you can occupy them at your leisure .
at the station , the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the <unk> 's attention to their trunks ; they dispute hotly with these tyrants , who are cool and indifferent ; they get their baggage billets , at last , and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for , and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket ; and now , with their tempers gone to the dogs , they must stand penned up and packed together , laden with wraps and satchels and <unk> , with the weary wife and babies , in the waiting-room , till the doors are thrown open  and then all hands make a grand final rush to the train , find it full , and have to stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on .
they are in a condition to kill somebody by this time .
meantime , you have been sitting in your car , smoking , and observing all this misery in the <unk> comfort .
on the journey the guard is polite and watchful  wo n't allow anybody to get into your compartment  tells them you are just recovering from the small-pox and do not like to be disturbed .
for the courier has made everything right with the guard .
at <unk> the courier comes to your compartment to see if you want a glass of water , or a newspaper , or anything ; at <unk> he sends luncheon out to you , while the other people scramble and worry in the <unk> .
if anything breaks about the car you are in , and a station-master proposes to pack you and your agent into a compartment with strangers , the courier reveals to him confidentially that you are a french duke born deaf and dumb , and the official comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car to be added to the train for you .
at <unk> the multitude file tediously through , hot and irritated , and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and make a mess of everything ; but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still .
perhaps you arrive at your destination in a <unk> at ten at night  you generally do .
the multitude spend half an hour <unk> their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses ; but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moment 's loss of time , and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or three days in advance , everything is ready , you can go at once to bed .
some of those other people <name> have to drift around to two or three hotels , in the rain , before they find accommodations .
i have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good courier , but i think i have set down a sufficiency of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise <unk> .
my courier was the worst one in europe , yet he was a good deal better than none at all .
it could not pay him to be a better one than he was , because i could not afford to buy things through him .
he was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service .
yes , to travel with a courier is bliss , to travel without one is the reverse .
i have had dealings with some very bad couriers ; but i have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection .
he was a young <unk> , named <name> n. <unk> .
he spoke eight languages , and seemed to be equally at home in all of them ; he was shrewd , prompt , posted , and punctual ; he was fertile in resources , and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties ; he not only knew how to do everything in his line , but he knew the best ways and the quickest ; he was handy with children and invalids ; all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier .
his address is , care of <unk> .
<name> & son , strand , london ; he was formerly a conductor of <unk> tourist parties .
excellent couriers are somewhat rare ; if the reader is about to travel , he <name> find it to his advantage to make a note of this one .
chapter xxxiii [ we climb far  by buggy ] the beautiful <unk> fall is near <unk> , on the other side of the lake of <unk> , and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous theatrical fires whose name i can not call just at this moment .
this was said to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss .
i was strongly tempted , but i could not go there with propriety , because one goes in a boat .
the task which i had set myself was to walk over europe on foot , not skim over it in a boat .
i had made a tacit contract with myself ; it was my duty to abide by it .
i was willing to make boat trips for pleasure , but i could not conscientiously make them in the way of business .
it cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight , but i lived down the <name> , and gained in my self-respect through the triumph .
i had a finer and a grander sight , however , where i was .
this was the mighty dome of the jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly silvered by the starlight .
there was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn and awful presence ; one seemed to meet the immutable , the indestructible , the eternal , face to face , and to feel the trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast .
one had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit , not an inert mass of rocks and ice  a spirit which had looked down , through the slow drift of the ages , upon a million vanished races of men , and judged them ; and would judge a million more  and still be there , watching , unchanged and <unk> , after all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant desolation .
while i was feeling these things , i was groping , without knowing it , toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the alps , and in no other mountains  that strange , deep , nameless influence , which , once felt , can not be forgotten  once felt , leaves always behind it a restless longing to feel it again  a longing which is like homesickness ; a grieving , haunting yearning which <name> plead , implore , and persecute till it has its <name> .
i met dozens of people , imaginative and <unk> , cultivated and uncultivated , who had come from far countries and roamed through the swiss alps year after year  they could not explain why .
they had come first , they said , out of idle curiosity , because everybody talked about it ; they had come since because they could not help it , and they should keep on coming , while they lived , for the same reason ; they had tried to break their chains and stay away , but it was futile ; now , they had no <name> to break them .
others came nearer <unk> what they felt ; they said they could find perfect rest and peace nowhere else when they were troubled : all <unk> and worries and <unk> sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the alps ; the great spirit of the mountain breathed his own peace upon their hurt minds and sore hearts , and healed them ; they could not think base thoughts or do mean and sordid things here , before the visible throne of god .
down the road a piece was a <unk>  whatever that may be  and we joined the human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford .
it was the usual <unk> concert , in an ornamental garden , with wines , beer , milk , whey , grapes , etc.  the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to certain invalids whom physicians can not repair , and who only continue to exist by the <name> of whey or grapes .
one of these departed spirits told me , in a sad and lifeless way , that there is no way for him to live but by whey , and dearly , dearly loved whey , he did n't know whey he did , but he did .
after making this pun he died  that is the whey it served him .
some other remains , preserved from decomposition by the grape system , told me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed , highly medicinal in their nature , and that they were counted out and administered by the <unk> as methodically as if they were pills .
the new patient , if very feeble , began with one grape before breakfast , took three during breakfast , a couple between meals , five at luncheon , three in the afternoon , seven at dinner , four for supper , and part of a grape just before going to bed , by way of a general <unk> .
the quantity was gradually and regularly increased , according to the needs and capacities of the patient , until by and by you would find him disposing of his one grape per second all the day long , and his regular barrel per day .
he said that men cured in this way , and enabled to discard the grape system , never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were dictating to a slow <unk> , because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape .
he said these were tedious people to talk with .
he said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back , between every two words , and swallowed a <unk> of imaginary whey .
he said it was an impressive thing to observe two men , who had been cured by the two processes , engaged in conversation  said their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines .
one finds out a great many wonderful things , by traveling , if he stumbles upon the right person .
i did not remain long at the <unk> ; the music was good enough , but it seemed rather tame after the cyclone of that arkansaw expert .
besides , my adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprise  nothing less than a trip from <unk> , by the <unk> and <unk> , clear to zermatt , on foot !
so it was necessary to plan the details , and get ready for an early start .
the courier ( this was not the one i have just been speaking of ) thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell us how to find our way .
and so it turned out .
he showed us the whole thing , on a <unk> , and we could see our route , with all its elevations and depressions , its villages and its rivers , as clearly as if we were sailing over it in a balloon .
a <unk> is a great thing .
the portier also wrote down each day 's journey and the nightly hotel on a piece of paper , and made our course so plain that we should never be able to get lost without <unk> outside help .
i put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to <unk> , and then we went to bed , after laying out the <unk> and putting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning .
however , when we came down to breakfast at 8 a.m. , it looked so much like rain that i hired a <unk> <unk> for the first third of the journey .
for two or three hours we jogged along the level road which skirts the beautiful lake of <unk> , with a dim and <unk> picture of watery expanses and spectral alpine forms always before us , veiled in a <unk> mist .
then a steady downpour set in , and hid everything but the nearest objects .
we kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas , and away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy ; but the driver sat <unk> and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed to like it .
we had the road to ourselves , and i never had a pleasanter excursion .
the weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the <unk> , and presently a vast black <unk> in front of us dissolved away and <unk> the grand proportions and the soaring <unk> of the <unk> alp .
it was a sort of <unk> surprise ; for we had not supposed there was anything behind that <unk> blanket of sable cloud but level valley .
what we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of sky away aloft there , were really patches of the <unk> 's snowy crest caught through <unk> rents in the drifting pall of vapor .
we dined in the inn at <unk> , and our driver ought to have dined there , too , but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk both , so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter , and succeeded .
a <name> gentleman and his two <unk> daughters had been taking their <unk> at the inn , and when they left , just ahead of us , it was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours , and as happy and good-natured , too , which was saying a good deal .
these rascals overflowed with attentions and information for their guests , and with brotherly love for each other .
they tied their reins , and took off their coats and hats , so that they might be able to give <unk> attention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its illustration .
the road was smooth ; it led up and over and down a continual succession of hills ; but it was narrow , the horses were used to it , and could not well get out of it anyhow ; so why should n't the drivers entertain themselves and us ?
the noses of our horses projected <unk> into the rear of the forward carriage , and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend , and his friend stood up and talked back to him , with his rear to the scenery .
when the top was reached and we went flying down the other side , there was no change in the program .
i <name> in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver , on his knees on his high seat , resting his elbows on its back , and beaming down on his passengers , with happy eye , and flying hair , and jolly red face , and offering his card to the old <name> gentleman while he praised his hack and horses , and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to destruction or an <unk> safety .
toward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with <unk> , a cozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a <unk> nook among giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like islands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them from the lower world .
down from vague and <unk> heights , little ruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling , and found their way to the verge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls , whence they plunged , a shaft of silver , shivered to atoms in <unk> and turned to an air puff of luminous dust .
here and there , in <unk> depressions among the snowy <unk> of the upper altitudes , one glimpsed the extremity of a glacier , with its <unk> and honeycombed battlements of ice .
up the valley , under a dizzy precipice , nestled the village of <unk> , our <unk> for the night .
we were soon there , and housed in the hotel .
but the waning day had such an inviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments , but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little <unk> parlor , walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice .
this was the <unk> little <unk> imaginable ; it was perfectly level , and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide .
the walls around it were so gigantic , and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was <unk> , by contrast , to what i have likened it to  a cozy and carpeted parlor .
it was so high above the <unk> valley that there was nothing between it and the <unk> .
i had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before ; the <unk> had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs , hitherto , but now we were <unk>  if one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so <name> as these .
we could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers ; but two or three of these , instead of flowing over the precipices , sank down into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the <unk> of the walls .
the green nook which i have been describing is called the <unk> .
the glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing <name> to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices ; here the rushing <name> becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward <unk> , lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders , and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws .
there was no lack of cascades along this route .
the path by the side of the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp , when he heard a <unk> , and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a <name> side by side , and such places were not always to be had at an instant 's notice .
the cows wear <unk> , and that is a good idea in the cows , for where that torrent is , you could n't hear an ordinary <unk> any further than you could hear the ticking of a watch .
i needed exercise , so i employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift , and i sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent .
it was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle .
when i had had enough exercise , i made the agent take some , by running a race with one of those logs .
i made a trifle by betting on the log .
after dinner we had a walk up and down the <unk> valley , in the soft <unk> , with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm for contrast , and text for talk .
there were no sounds but the dulled complaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant <name> .
the spirit of the place was a sense of deep , pervading peace ; one might dream his life tranquilly away there , and not miss it or mind it when it was gone .
the summer departed with the sun , and <name> came with the stars .
it grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel , backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it , but we kept warm , and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for <unk> three hours before  so our little plan of helping that <name> family ( principally the old man ) over the pass , was a blocked generosity .
chapter xxxiv [ the world 's highest pig farm ] we hired the only guide left , to lead us on our way .
he was over seventy , but he could have given me nine-tenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to .
he shouldered our satchels , overcoats , and alpenstocks , and we set out up the steep path .
it was hot work .
the old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and <unk> to him to <name> , too , and we did it ; one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that ; he should have had them if he had been a hundred and fifty .
when we began that ascent , we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us .
it was on our right , across the narrow head of the valley .
but when we got up abreast it on its own level , mountains were towering high above on every hand , and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little <unk> which we had visited the evening before .
still it seemed a long way up in the air , in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks .
it had an <unk> <unk> in front of it which seemed about as big as a <unk> , and this <unk> slanted so sharply downward , and was so brief , and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice , that it was a <unk> thing to think of a person 's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all .
suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard ; there would be nothing for him to seize ; nothing could keep him from rolling ; five revolutions would bring him to the edge , and over he would go .
what a frightful distance he would fall !  for there are very few birds that fly as high as his <unk> .
he would strike and bounce , two or three times , on his way down , but this would be no advantage to him .
i would as soon take an <unk> on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard .
i would rather , in fact , for the distance down would be about the same , and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce .
i could not see how the peasants got up to that chalet  the region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon .
as we strolled on , climbing up higher and higher , we were continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before ; so by and by , while standing before a group of these giants , we looked around for the chalet again ; there it was , away down below us , apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley !
it was as far below us , now , as it had been above us when we were beginning the ascent .
after a while the path led us along a railed precipice , and we looked over  far beneath us was the snug parlor again , the little <unk> , with its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls .
we could have dropped a stone into it .
we had been finding the top of the world all along  and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead ; when we looked down into the <unk> we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last , but it was not so ; there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet .
we were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees , we were still in a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the <unk> <unk> of innumerable wild flowers .
we found , indeed , more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else .
we gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were unacquainted with ; so we had sumptuous bouquets .
but one of the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain , and determining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with .
for instance , it was the end of <name> at the level of the sea ; in the <unk> valley at the base of the pass , we found flowers which would not be due at the sea-level for two or three weeks ; higher up , we entered october , and gathered fringed <unk> .
i made no notes , and have forgotten the details , but the construction of the <unk> calendar was very entertaining while it lasted .
in the high regions we found <name> store of the splendid red flower called the alpine rose , but we did not find any examples of the ugly swiss favorite called <unk> .
its name seems to indicate that it is a <name> flower and that it is white .
it may be <name> enough , but it is not attractive , and it is not white .
the fuzzy <name> is the color of bad cigar ashes , and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush .
it has a <name> and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes , but that is probably on account of its looks ; it apparently has no monopoly of those upper altitudes , however , for they are sometimes intruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers .
everybody in the alps wears a sprig of <unk> in his hat .
it is the native 's pet , and also the tourist 's .
all the morning , as we loafed along , having a good time , other pedestrians went <unk> by us with vigorous strides , and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager .
these wore loose <unk> , long yarn stockings , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they were gentlemen who would go home to england or germany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guide-book every day .
but i doubted if they ever had much real fun , outside of the mere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights ; for they were almost always alone , and even the finest scenery loses <unk> when there is no one to enjoy it with .
all the morning an endless double procession of <unk> tourists filed past us along the narrow path  the one procession going , the other coming .
we had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the kindly <name> custom of saluting all strangers with <unk> hat , and we resolutely clung to it , that morning , although it kept us bareheaded most of the time and was not always responded to .
still we found an interest in the thing , because we naturally liked to know who were english and americans among the passers-by .
all continental natives responded of course ; so did some of the english and americans , but , as a general thing , these two races gave no sign .
whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect , we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need , and we always got a reply in the same language .
the english and american folk are not less kindly than other races , they are only more reserved , and that comes of habit and education .
in one dreary , <name> waste , away above the line of vegetation , we met a procession of twenty-five mounted young men , all from <name> .
we got answering bows enough from these , of course , for they were of an age to learn to do in rome as rome does , without much effort .
at one extremity of this patch of desolation , overhung by bare and forbidding crags which <unk> drifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities , was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass , and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some <unk> .
consequently this place could be really reckoned as " property " ; it had a money value , and was doubtless taxed .
i think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world .
it would be hard to set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm of space .
that man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world , for if there is any definite end to the world he has certainly found it .
from here forward we moved through a <unk> and <unk> desolation .
all about us rose gigantic masses , crags , and ramparts of bare and dreary rock , with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree or flower anywhere , or glimpse of any creature that had life .
the frost and the tempests of <unk> ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs , with a deathless energy , destroying them <unk> ; so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground .
soiled and aged banks of snow lay close about our path .
the ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete as if <unk> had furnished the <unk> for it .
but every now and then , through the stern gateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome , sheathed with glittering ice , and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was <unk> and plebeian , and this spectacle always chained one 's interest and admiration at once , and made him forget there was anything ugly in the world .
i have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places , but i forgot .
in the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all , where the racked and splintered debris was thickest , where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path , where the winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was <unk> and <unk> , and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or <name> , i found a solitary wee <unk> flourishing away , not a droop about it anywhere , but holding its bright blue <name> up with the prettiest and <unk> air in the world , the only happy spirit , the only smiling thing , in all that grisly desert .
she seemed to say , " cheer up !  as long as we are here , let us make the best of it . "
i judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place ; so i plucked her up and sent her to <name> to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made , all by her small self , to make a whole vast despondent alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable , and hold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once .
we stopped for a <unk> at a strongly built little inn called the <unk> .
it sits in a lonely spot among the peaks , where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the <unk> , and is rained on , and snowed on , and <unk> and persecuted by the storms , nearly every day of its life .
it was the only habitation in the whole <unk> pass .
close at hand , now , was a chance for a blood-curdling alpine adventure .
close at hand was the snowy mass of the great <unk> cooling its <unk> in the sky and daring us to an ascent .
i was fired with the idea , and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides , ropes , etc. , and undertake it .
i instructed <name> to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations .
meantime , i went diligently to work to read up and find out what this <unk> <unk> was like , and how one should go about it  for in these matters i was ignorant .
i opened mr. <unk> 's summer months among the alps ( published 1857 ) , and selected his account of his ascent of <name> <name> .
it began : " it is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening before a grand expedition  " i saw that i was too calm ; so i walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement ; but the book 's next remark  that the adventurer must get up at two in the morning  came as near as anything to <unk> it all out again .
however , i reinforced it , and read on , about how mr. <unk> dressed by <unk> and was " soon down among the guides , who were bustling about in the passage , packing provisions , and making every preparation for the start " ; and how he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that  " the whole sky was blazing with stars , larger and brighter than they appear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth .
they seemed actually suspended from the dark vault of heaven , and their gentle light shed a <unk> gleam over the <unk> around the foot of the matterhorn , which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high , penetrating to the heart of the great bear , and crowning itself with a <unk> of his magnificent stars .
not a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night , except the distant roar of streams which rush from the high plateau of the st. <unk> glacier , and fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the gorner glacier . "
he took his hot toast and coffee , and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed away from the <unk> hotel , and began the steep climb .
at half past five he happened to turn around , and " beheld the glorious spectacle of the matterhorn , just touched by the <unk> morning , and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and rock around it . "
then the <unk> and the <unk> <name> caught the radiant glow ; but " the intervening mass of <name> <name> made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could <name> to see the sun himself , yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth of the day . "
he gazed at the lofty crown of <name> <name> and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches , and the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that summit .
but the adventurers moved steadily on , nevertheless .
they toiled up , and up , and still up ; they passed the grand plateau ; then toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain , clinging like flies to its rugged face ; and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of falling .
they turned aside to skirt this wall , and gradually ascended until their way was barred by a " maze of gigantic snow crevices , "  so they turned aside again , and " began a long climb of sufficient <unk> to make a zigzag course necessary . "
fatigue compelled them to halt frequently , for a moment or two .
at one of these halts somebody called out , " look at mont blanc ! "
and " we were at once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the alps and his attendant satellites right over the top of the <unk> , itself at least <unk> feet high ! "
these people moved in single file , and were all tied to a strong rope , at regular distances apart , so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights , the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley , thousands of feet below .
by and by they came to an <unk> ridge which was tilted up at a sharp <name> , and had a precipice on one side of it .
they had to climb this , so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet , and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes , the toes of the man behind him occupied it .
" slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent , and i dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after the feet ; for , while on the left the incline of ice was so steep that it would be impossible for any man to save himself in case of a slip , unless the others could hold him up , on the right we might drop a pebble from the hand over precipices of unknown extent down upon the tremendous glacier below .
" great caution , therefore , was absolutely necessary , and in this exposed situation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of <unk> to <name> <name>  a severe and bitterly cold wind from the north .
the fine <unk> snow was driven past us in the clouds , penetrating the interstices of our clothes , and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of <name> 's ax were whisked into the air , and then dashed over the precipice .
we had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion , and now and then , in the more violent gusts of wind , were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard . "
having surmounted this perilous steep , they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss ; then they climbed to the base of another ridge  a more difficult and dangerous one still : " the whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow , and the fall on each side desperately steep , but the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge , almost like a knife ; these places , though not more than three or four short paces in length , looked uncommonly awkward ; but , like the sword leading true believers to the gates of paradise , they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition .
these were in one or two places so narrow , that in stepping over them with toes well turned out for greater security , one end of the foot projected over the awful precipice on the right , while the other was on the beginning of the ice slope on the left , which was scarcely less steep than the rocks .
on these occasions <name> would take my hand , and each of us stretching as far as we could , he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces or rather more from me , whence a spring would probably bring him to the rock on the other side ; then , turning around , he called to me to come , and , taking a couple of steps carefully , i was met at the third by his outstretched hand ready to clasp mine , and in a moment stood by his side .
the others followed in much the same fashion .
once my right foot slipped on the side toward the precipice , but i threw out my left arm in a moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as i fell , and supported me considerably ; at the same instant i cast my eyes down the side on which i had slipped , and contrived to plant my right foot on a piece of rock as large as a <unk> , which chanced to protrude through the ice , on the very edge of the precipice .
being thus anchored fore and aft , as it were , i believe i could easily have recovered myself , even if i had been alone , though it must be confessed the situation would have been an awful one ; as it was , however , a jerk from <name> settled the matter very soon , and i was on my legs all right in an instant .
the rope is an immense help in places of this kind . "
now they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome <unk> with ice and powdered with snow  the utmost , summit , the last bit of solidity between them and the hollow vault of heaven .
they set to work with their <unk> , and were soon creeping , <unk> , up its surface , with their heels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness , thickened up a little with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy procession far below .
presently , one man 's <unk> broke and he fell !
there he dangled in <unk> at the end of the rope , like a spider , till his friends above hauled him into place again .
a little bit later , the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very summit , in a driving wind , and looked out upon the vast green expanses of italy and a <unk> ocean of billowy alps .
when i had read thus far , <name> broke into the room in a <name> excitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured , and asked if i was ready .
i said i believed i would n't ascend the <unk> this time .
i said <unk> was a different thing from what i had supposed it was , and so i judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it .
but i told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to zermatt , because i meant to use them there .
i said i could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me , and was sure that the fell fascination of <unk> would soon be upon me .
i said he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with fright .
this made <name> happy , and filled him with ambitious anticipations .
he went at once to tell the guides to follow us to zermatt and bring all their paraphernalia with them .
chapter xxxv [ <unk> the coroner ] a great and priceless thing is a new interest !
how it takes possession of a man !
how it clings to him , how it rides him !
i strode onward from the <unk> hostelry a changed man , a reorganized personality .
i walked into a new world , i saw with new eyes .
i had been looking aloft at the giant <unk> only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude , and their unspeakable <name> of form ; i looked up at them now , as also things to be conquered and climbed .
my sense of their grandeur and their <name> beauty was neither lost nor impaired ; i had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones .
i followed the steep lines up , inch by inch , with my eye , and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet .
when i saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds , i tried to imagine i saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer thread .
we skirted the lonely little lake called the <unk> , and presently passed close by a glacier on the right  a thing like a great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth .
i had never been so near a glacier before .
here we came upon a new board shanty , and found some men engaged in building a stone house ; so the <unk> was soon to have a rival .
we bought a bottle or so of beer here ; at any rate they called it beer , but i knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry , and i perceived by the taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink .
we were surrounded by a hideous desolation .
we stepped forward to a sort of <unk> place , and were confronted by a startling contrast : we seemed to look down into fairyland .
two or three thousand feet below us was a bright green level , with a pretty town in its midst , and a silvery stream winding among the meadows ; the charming spot was walled in on all sides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines ; and over the pines , out of the softened distances , rose the snowy domes and peaks of the <name> <name> region .
how exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down there was !
the distance was not great enough to obliterate details , it only made them little , and mellow , and dainty , like landscapes and towns seen through the wrong end of a spy-glass .
right under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley , with a green , slanting , <unk> top , and grouped about upon this <unk> bench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like <unk> worms .
the bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood , but that was a deception  it was a long way down to it .
we began our descent , now , by the most remarkable road i have ever seen .
it wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice  a narrow way , with always the solid rock wall at one elbow , and perpendicular nothingness at the other .
we met an everlasting procession of guides , porters , mules , <unk> , and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path , and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule .
i always took the inside , when i heard or saw the mule coming , and flattened myself against the wall .
i preferred the inside , of course , but i should have had to take it anyhow , because the mule prefers the outside .
a mule 's preference  on a precipice  is a thing to be respected .
well , his choice is always the outside .
his life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky <unk> and packages which rest against his body  therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths , to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other .
when he goes into the passenger business he absurdly clings to his old habit , and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that <unk> heart is in the highlands , so to speak .
more than once i saw a <unk> hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss ; and i noticed that upon these occasions the rider , whether male or female , looked tolerably unwell .
there was one place where an <unk> breadth of light masonry had been added to the verge of the path , and as there was a very sharp turn here , a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time , as a protection .
this panel was old and gray and feeble , and the light masonry had been loosened by recent rains .
a young american girl came along on a mule , and in making the turn the mule 's hind foot caved all the loose masonry and one of the <unk> overboard ; the mule gave a violent lurch <unk> to save himself , and succeeded in the effort , but that girl turned as white as the snows of mont blanc for a moment .
the path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice ; there was a <unk> breadth of solid rock under the traveler , and <unk> breadth of solid rock just above his head , like the roof of a narrow porch ; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer <unk> and bottomless wall of rock before him , across a gorge or crack a biscuit 's toss in width  but he could not see the bottom of his own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge .
i did not do this , because i did not wish to soil my clothes .
every few hundred yards , at particularly bad places , one came across a panel or so of plank fencing ; but they were always old and weak , and they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash promises to hold up people who might need support .
there was one of these panels which had only its upper board left ; a <unk> english youth came tearing down the path , was seized with an impulse to look over the precipice , and without an instant 's thought he threw his weight upon that crazy board .
it bent outward a foot !
i never made a gasp before that came so near suffocating me .
the english youth 's face simply showed a lively surprise , but nothing more .
he went swinging along <unk> again , as if he did not know he had just swindled a coroner by the closest kind of a shave .
the alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between the <unk> of two long poles , and sometimes it is a chair with a back to it and a support for the feet .
it is carried by <unk> of strong porters .
the motion is easier than that of any other conveyance .
we met a few men and a great many ladies in <unk> ; it seemed to me that most of the ladies looked pale and <unk> ; their general aspect gave me the idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering .
as a rule , they looked at their laps , and left the scenery to take care of itself .
but the most frightened creature i saw , was a led horse that overtook us .
poor fellow , he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the <unk> valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place before .
every few steps he would stop short , glance wildly out from the dizzy height , and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race ; and all the while he <unk> from head to heel as with a <unk> .
he was a handsome fellow , and he made a fine <unk> picture of terror , but it was pitiful to see him suffer so .
this dreadful path has had its tragedy .
baedeker , with his customary over <unk> , begins and ends the tale thus : " the descent on horseback should be avoided .
in 1861 a <unk> <unk> fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on the spot . "
we looked over the precipice there , and saw the monument which <unk> the event .
it stands in the bottom of the gorge , in a place which has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent and the storms .
our old guide never spoke but when spoken to , and then limited himself to a syllable or two , but when we asked him about this tragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter .
he said the countess was very pretty , and very young  hardly out of her <unk> , in fact .
she was newly married , and was on her bridal tour .
the young husband was riding a little in advance ; one guide was leading the husband 's horse , another was leading the bride 's .
the old man continued : " the guide that was leading the husband 's horse happened to glance back , and there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the precipice ; and her face began to bend downward a little , and she put up her two hands slowly and met it  so ,  and put them flat against her eyes  so  and then she sank out of the saddle , with a sharp shriek , and one caught only the flash of a dress , and it was all over . "
then after a pause : " ah , yes , that guide saw these things  yes , he saw them all .
he saw them all , just as i have told you . "
after another pause : " ah , yes , he saw them all .
my god , that was me .
i was that guide ! "
this had been the one event of the old man 's life ; so one may be sure he had forgotten no detail connected with it .
we listened to all he had to say about what was done and what happened and what was said after the sorrowful occurrence , and a painful story it was .
when we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last spiral of the corkscrew , <name> 's hat blew over the last remaining bit of precipice  a small <name> a hundred or hundred and fifty feet high  and sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and fragments which the weather had <unk> away from the precipices .
we went leisurely down there , expecting to find it without any trouble , but we had made a mistake , as to that .
we hunted during a couple of hours  not because the old straw hat was valuable , but out of curiosity to find out how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where there was nothing left for it to hide behind .
when one is reading in bed , and lays his <unk> down , he can not find it again if it is smaller than a <unk> ; that hat was as stubborn as any <unk> could have been , and we finally had to give it up ; but we found a fragment that had once belonged to an <unk> , and by digging around and turning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the cylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete <unk> .
we afterward had the thing <unk> , and the owner can have his adventurous <unk> by submitting proofs and paying costs of rehabilitation .
we had hopes of finding the owner there , distributed around amongst the rocks , for it would have made an elegant paragraph ; but we were disappointed .
still , we were far from being disheartened , for there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched ; we were satisfied he was there , somewhere , so we resolved to wait over a day at <unk> and come back and get him .
then we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what we would do with him when we got him .
<name> was for contributing him to the british museum ; but i was for <unk> him to his widow .
that is the difference between <name> and me : <name> is all for display , i am all for the simple right , even though i lose money by it .
<name> argued in favor of his proposition against mine , i argued in favor of mine and against his .
the discussion warmed into a dispute ; the dispute warmed into a quarrel .
i finally said , very decidedly : " my mind is made up .
he goes to the widow . "
<name> answered sharply : " and my mind is made up .
he goes to the museum . "
i said , calmly : " the museum may whistle when it gets him . "
<name> retorted : " the widow may save herself the trouble of whistling , for i <name> see that she never gets him . "
after some angry <unk> of epithets , i said : " it seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these remains .
i do n't quite see what you 've got to say about them ? "
" i ?
i 've got all to say about them .
they 'd never have been thought of if i had n't found their <unk> .
the corpse belongs to me , and i 'll do as i please with him . "
i was leader of the expedition , and all discoveries achieved by it naturally belonged to me .
i was entitled to these remains , and could have enforced my right ; but rather than have bad blood about the matter , i said we would toss up for them .
i threw heads and won , but it was a barren victory , for although we spent all the next day searching , we never found a bone .
i can not imagine what could ever have become of that fellow .
the town in the valley is called <unk> or <unk> .
we pointed our course toward it , down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed <unk> and other flowers , and presently entered the narrow alleys of the outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid " <unk> . "
they ought to either <unk> that village or organize a ferry .
<name> 's body was simply a <unk> ; his person was populous with the little hungry pests ; his skin , when he stripped , was <unk> like a <unk> patient 's ; so , when we were about to enter one of the <unk> inns , and he noticed its sign , " chamois hotel , " he refused to stop there .
he said the chamois was plentiful enough , without hunting up hotels where they made a specialty of it .
i was indifferent , for the chamois is a creature that <name> neither bite me nor abide with me ; but to calm <name> , we went to the <unk> des <unk> .
at the table d'hôte , we had this , for an incident .
a very grave man  in fact his gravity amounted to solemnity , and almost to <unk>  sat opposite us and he was " tight , " but doing his best to appear sober .
he took up a <unk> bottle of wine , tilted it over his glass awhile , then set it out of the way , with a contented look , and went on with his dinner .
presently he put his glass to his mouth , and of course found it empty .
he looked puzzled , and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old <name> who sat at his right .
shook his head , as much as to say , " no , she could n't have done it . "
he tilted the <unk> bottle over his glass again , meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him .
he ate a few <unk> , raised his glass to his lips , and of course it was still empty .
he bent an injured and accusing <unk> upon that unconscious old <name> , which was a study to see .
she went on eating and gave no sign .
he took up his glass and his bottle , with a wise private nod of his head , and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his plate  poured himself another imaginary drink  went to work with his knife and fork once more  presently lifted his glass with good confidence , and found it empty , as usual .
this was almost a <unk> surprise .
he straightened himself up in his chair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows , first one and then the other .
at last he softly pushed his plate away , set his glass directly in front of him , held on to it with his left hand , and proceeded to pour with his right .
this time he observed that nothing came .
he turned the bottle clear upside down ; still nothing issued from it ; a plaintive look came into his face , and he said , as if to himself , " <unk> !
they 've got it all ! "
then he set the bottle down , resignedly , and took the rest of his dinner dry .
it was at that table d'hôte , too , that i had under inspection the largest <name> i have ever seen in private life .
she was over seven feet high , and magnificently proportioned .
what had first called my attention to her , was my stepping on an outlying <unk> of her foot , and hearing , from up toward the ceiling , a deep " pardon , <unk> , but you encroach ! "
that was when we were coming through the hall , and the place was dim , and i could see her only vaguely .
the thing which called my attention to her the second time was , that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls , and this great <name> came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view .
she had a handsome face , and she was very finely formed  perfectly formed , i should say .
but she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace .
ladies near her looked like children , and the men about her looked mean .
they looked like failures ; and they looked as if they felt so , too .
she sat with her back to us .
i never saw such a back in my life .
i would have so liked to see the moon rise over it .
the whole congregation waited , under one pretext or another , till she finished her dinner and went out ; they wanted to see her at full altitude , and they found it worth <unk> for .
she filled one 's idea of what an empress ought to be , when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place .
we were not at <unk> in time to see her at her heaviest weight .
she had suffered from <unk> and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths .
five weeks of soaking  five uninterrupted hours of it every day  had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right proportions .
those baths remove fat , and also <unk> .
the patients remain in the great tanks for hours at a time .
a dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together , and amuse themselves with <unk> and various games .
they have floating desks and tables , and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is <unk> .
the tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses .
there 's a <unk> , and he <name> have to contribute .
there are several of these big <unk> , and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it .
the water is running water , and changes all the time , else a patient with a <unk> might take the bath with only a partial success , since , while he was <unk> himself of the <unk> , he might catch the <unk> .
the next morning we wandered back up the green valley , leisurely , with the curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising into the clouds before us .
i had never seen a clean , bare precipice stretching up five thousand feet above me before , and i never shall expect to see another one .
they exist , perhaps , but not in places where one can easily get close to them .
this pile of stone is peculiar .
from its base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers , all its lines and all its details vaguely suggest human architecture .
there are rudimentary <unk> , cornices , chimneys , <unk> of stories , etc .
one could sit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of this grand structure , bit by bit , and day after day , and never weary his interest .
the termination , toward the town , observed in profile , is the perfection of shape .
it comes down out of the clouds in a succession of rounded , colossal , <unk> projections  a stairway for the gods ; at its head spring several lofty <unk> towers , one after another , with faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral banners .
if there were a king whose realms included the whole world , here would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch .
he would only need to hollow it out and put in the electric light .
he could give audience to a nation at a time under its roof .
our search for those remains having failed , we inspected with a glass the dim and distant track of an old-time avalanche that once swept down from some <unk> summits behind the town and swept away the houses and buried the people ; then we struck down the road that leads toward the rhone , to see the famous ladders .
these perilous things are built against the perpendicular face of a <name> two or three hundred feet high .
the peasants , of both sexes , were climbing up and down them , with heavy loads on their backs .
i ordered <name> to make the ascent , so i could put the thrill and horror of it in my book , and he accomplished the feat successfully , through a <unk> , for three francs , which i paid .
it makes me shudder yet when i think of what i felt when i was clinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy .
at times the world swam around me , and i could hardly keep from letting go , so <unk> was the appalling danger .
many a person would have given up and descended , but i stuck to my task , and would not yield until i had accomplished it .
i felt a just pride in my exploit , but i would not have repeated it for the wealth of the world .
i shall break my neck yet with some such foolhardy performance , for warnings never seem to have any lasting effect on me .
when the people of the hotel found that i had been climbing those crazy ladders , it made me an object of considerable attention .
next morning , early , we drove to the rhone valley and took the train for <unk> .
there we shouldered our knapsacks and things , and set out on foot , in a tremendous rain , up the winding gorge , toward zermatt .
hour after hour we <unk> along , by the roaring torrent , and under <name> lesser alps which were clothed in <name> velvety green all the way up and had little <unk> swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their <unk> heights .
the rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom , and we continued to enjoy both .
at the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane highest , and thundered loudest , and lashed the big boulders <unk> , the canton had done itself the honor to build the <unk> wooden bridge that exists in the world .
while we were walking over it , along with a party of horsemen , i noticed that even the larger <unk> made it shake .
i called <name> 's attention to it , and he noticed it , too .
it seemed to me that if i owned an elephant that was a <unk> , and i thought a good deal of him , i would think twice before i would ride him over that bridge .
we climbed up to the village of st. <name> , about half past four in the afternoon , waded <unk> through the <unk> , and stopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church .
we stripped and went to bed , and sent our clothes down to be baked .
and the horde of soaked tourists did the same .
that chaos of clothing got mixed in the kitchen , and there were consequences .
i did not get back the same drawers i sent down , when our things came up at <unk> ; i got a pair on a new plan .
they were merely a pair of white <unk> absurdities , hitched together at the top with a narrow band , and they did not come quite down to my knees .
they were pretty enough , but they made me feel like two people , and disconnected at that .
the man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that , to rough it in the swiss mountains .
the shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers , and had n't any sleeves to it  at least it had n't anything more than what mr. <name> would call " rudimentary " sleeves ; these had " edging " around them , but the bosom was ridiculously plain .
the knit silk <unk> they brought me was on a new plan , and was really a sensible thing ; it opened behind , and had pockets in it to put your shoulder-blades in ; but they did not seem to fit mine , and so i found it a sort of uncomfortable garment .
they gave my <unk> coat to somebody else , and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe .
i had to tie my collar on , because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt which i described a while ago .
when i was dressed for dinner at <unk> , i was too loose in some places and too tight in others , and altogether i felt slovenly and <unk> .
however , the people at the table d'hôte were no better off than i was ; they had everybody 's clothes but their own on .
a long stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it following me in , but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers , though i described them as well as i was able .
i gave them to the chambermaid that night when i went to bed , and she probably found the owner , for my own things were on a chair outside my door in the morning .
there was a lovable english clergyman who did not get to the table d'hôte at all .
his breeches had turned up missing , and without any equivalent .
he said he was not more particular than other people , but he had noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost sure to excite remark .

the <unk> began to ring at <unk> in the morning , and from the length of time it continued to ring i judged that it takes the swiss sinner a good while to get the invitation through his head .
most <unk> in the world are of poor quality , and have a harsh and rasping sound which <unk> the temper and produces much sin , but the st. <name> <name> is a good deal the worst one that has been contrived yet , and is peculiarly maddening in its operation .
still , it may have its right and its excuse to exist , for the community is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock , perhaps ; but there can not be any excuse for our <unk> at home , for there is no family in <name> without a clock , and consequently there is no fair pretext for the usual <name> medley of dreadful sounds that issues from our <unk> .
there is much more profanity in <name> on <name> than in all in the other six days of the week put together , and it is of a more bitter and malignant character than the week-day profanity , too .
it is produced by the <unk> <unk> of the cheap <unk> .
we build our churches almost without regard to cost ; we rear an edifice which is an adornment to the town , and we <unk> it , and fresco it , and mortgage it , and do everything we can think of to perfect it , and then spoil it all by putting a <name> on it which <unk> everybody who hears it , giving some the headache , others st. <unk> 's dance , and the rest the blind staggers .
an american village at ten o'clock on a summer <name> is the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> thing in nature ; but it is a pretty different thing half an hour later .
mr. poe 's poem of the " bells " stands incomplete to this day ; but it is well enough that it is so , for the public <unk> or " reader " who goes around trying to imitate the sounds of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself " up a stump " when he got to the <unk>  as <name> addison would say .
the church is always trying to get other people to reform ; it might not be a bad idea to reform itself a little , by way of example .
it is still clinging to one or two things which were useful once , but which are not useful now , neither are they ornamental .
one is the <unk> to remind a <unk> town that it is <unk> , and another is the reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of " notices " which everybody who is interested has already read in the newspaper .
the clergyman even reads the hymn through  a relic of an ancient time when <unk> are scarce and costly ; but everybody has a <unk> , now , and so the public reading is no longer necessary .
it is not merely unnecessary , it is generally painful ; for the average clergyman could not fire into his congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself , unless the weapon scattered shamefully .
i am not meaning to be flippant and irreverent , i am only meaning to be truthful .
the average clergyman , in all countries and of all denominations , is a very bad reader .
one would think he would at least learn how to read the lord 's prayer , by and by , but it is not so .
he races through it as if he thought the quicker he got it in , the sooner it would be answered .
a person who does not appreciate the exceeding value of pauses , and does not know how to measure their duration judiciously , can not render the grand simplicity and dignity of a composition like that effectively .
we took a tolerably early breakfast , and tramped off toward zermatt through the reeking lanes of the village , glad to get away from that <name> .
by and by we had a fine spectacle on our right .
it was the <unk> butt end of a huge glacier , which looked down on us from an alpine height which was well up in the blue sky .
it was an astonishing amount of ice to be compacted together in one mass .
we ciphered upon it and decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base of the wall of solid ice to the top of it  <name> believed it was really twice that .
we judged that if st. <name> 's , st. <name> 's , the great pyramid , the <unk> cathedral and the capitol in washington were clustered against that wall , a man sitting on its upper edge could not <name> his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three or four hundred feet  a thing which , of course , no man could do .
to me , that mighty glacier was very beautiful .
i did not imagine that anybody could find fault with it ; but i was mistaken .
<name> had been snarling for several days .
he was a rabid protestant , and he was always saying : " in the protestant <unk> you never see such poverty and dirt and <unk> as you do in this catholic one ; you never see the lanes and alleys flowing with <unk> ; you never see such wretched little <unk> of houses ; you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for a dome ; and as for a <unk> , why , you never hear a <unk> at all . "
all this morning he had been finding fault , straight along .
first it was with the mud .
he said , " it ai n't muddy in a protestant canton when it rains . "
then it was with the dogs : " they do n't have those lop-eared dogs in a protestant canton . "
then it was with the roads : " they do n't leave the roads to make themselves in a protestant canton , the people make them  and they make a road that is a road , too . "
next it was the goats : " you never see a goat shedding tears in a protestant canton  a goat , there , is one of the <unk> objects in nature . "
next it was the chamois : " you never see a protestant chamois act like one of these  they take a bite or two and go ; but these fellows camp with you and stay . "
then it was the <unk> : " in a protestant canton you could n't get lost if you wanted to , but you never see a <unk> in a catholic canton . "
next , " you never see any <unk> in the windows , here  never anything but now and then a cat  a torpid one ; but you take a protestant canton : windows perfectly lovely with flowers  and as for cats , there 's just acres of them .
these folks in this canton leave a road to make itself , and then fine you three francs if you <unk> ' over it  as if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road . "
next about the <unk> : " they talk about <unk> !  i have n't seen a <unk> in this whole canton that i could n't put in a hat . "
he had growled at everything , but i judged it would puzzle him to find anything the matter with this majestic glacier .
i intimated as much ; but he was ready , and said with surly discontent : " you ought to see them in the protestant <unk> . "
this irritated me .
but i concealed the feeling , and asked : " what is the matter with this one ? "
" matter ?
why , it ai n't in any kind of condition .
they never take any care of a glacier here .
the moraine has been spilling gravel around it , and got it all dirty . "
" why , man , they ca n't help that . "
" they ?
you 're right .
that is , they wo n't .
they could if they wanted to .
you never see a speck of dirt on a protestant glacier .
look at the rhone glacier .
it is fifteen miles long , and seven hundred feet thick .
if this was a protestant glacier you would n't see it looking like this , i can tell you . "
" that is nonsense .
what would they do with it ? "
" they would whitewash it .
they always do . "
i did not believe a word of this , but rather than have trouble i let it go ; for it is a waste of breath to argue with a <unk> .
i even doubted if the rhone glacier was in a protestant canton ; but i did not know , so i could not make anything by <unk> a man who would probably put me down at once with manufactured evidence .
about nine miles from st. <name> we crossed a bridge over the raging torrent of the <unk> , and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which was pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall forty feet high and into the river .
three children were approaching ; one of them , a little girl , about eight years old , was running ; when pretty close to us she stumbled and fell , and her feet shot under the rail of the fence and for a moment projected over the stream .
it gave us a sharp shock , for we thought she was gone , sure , for the ground slanted steeply , and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility ; but she managed to scramble up , and ran by us laughing .
we went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge .
if she had finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of the water , and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among the <unk> boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two minutes .
we had come exceedingly near witnessing her death .
and now <name> 's contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly manifested .
he has no spirit of self-denial .
he began straight off , and continued for an hour , to express his gratitude that the child was not destroyed .
i never saw such a man .
that was the kind of person he was ; just so he was gratified , he never cared anything about anybody else .
i had noticed that trait in him , over and over again .
often , of course , it was mere <unk> , mere want of reflection .
doubtless this may have been the case in most instances , but it was not the less hard to bar on that account  and after all , its bottom , its <unk> , was selfishness .
there is no avoiding that conclusion .
in the instance under consideration , i did think the <unk> of running on in that way might occur to him ; but no , the child was saved and he was glad , that was sufficient  he cared not a straw for my feelings , or my loss of such a literary plum , snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was ready to drop into it .
his selfishness was sufficient to place his own gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for me , his friend .
apparently , he did not once reflect upon the valuable details which would have fallen like a <unk> to me : fishing the child out  witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would have made among the peasants  then a swiss funeral  then the roadside monument , to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it .
and we should have gone into baedeker and been immortal .
i was silent .
i was too much hurt to complain .
if he could act so , and be so heedless and so frivolous at such a time , and actually seem to <name> in it , after all i had done for him , i would have cut my hand off before i would let him see that i was wounded .
we were approaching zermatt ; consequently , we were approaching the renowned matterhorn .
a month before , this mountain had been only a name to us , but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening double row of pictures of it , done in oil , water , chromo , wood , steel , copper , <unk> , and <unk> , and so it had at length become a shape to us  and a very distinct , decided , and familiar one , too .
we were expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run across it .
we were not deceived .
the monarch was far away when we first saw him , but there was no such thing as mistaking him .
he has the rare peculiarity of standing by himself ; he is peculiarly steep , too , and is also most oddly shaped .
he towers into the sky like a colossal wedge , with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left .
the broad base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand <unk> alpine platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level ; as the wedge itself is some five thousand feet high , it follows that its apex is about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level .
so the whole bulk of this stately piece of rock , this <unk> <unk> , is above the line of eternal snow .
yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of being built of solid snow , from their waists up , the matterhorn stands black and naked and forbidding , the year round , or merely powdered or streaked with white in places , for its sides are so steep that the snow can not stay there .
its strange form , its <name> isolation , and its majestic <unk> with its own kind , make it  so to speak  the <name> of the mountain world .
" grand , gloomy , and peculiar , " is a phrase which fits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain .
think of a monument a mile high , standing on a pedestal two miles high !
this is what the matterhorn is  a monument .
its office , henceforth , for all time , <name> be to keep watch and <name> over the secret resting-place of the young lord <name> , who , in 1865 , was precipitated from the summit over a precipice four thousand feet high , and never seen again .
no man ever had such a monument as this before ; the most imposing of the world 's other monuments are but atoms compared to it ; and they <name> perish , and their places <name> pass from memory , but this <name> remain .
[ the accident which cost lord <name> his life ( see chapter xii ) also cost the lives of three other men .
these three fell four-fifths of a mile , and their bodies were afterward found , lying side by side , upon a glacier , whence they were borne to zermatt and buried in the churchyard .
the remains of lord <name> have never been found .
the secret of his <unk> , like that of <name> , must remain a mystery always . ]
a walk from st. <name> to zermatt is a wonderful experience .
nature is built on a stupendous plan in that region .
one marches continually between walls that are piled into the skies , with their upper heights broken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold against the background of blue ; and here and there one sees a big glacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice , or a graceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities .
there is nothing tame , or cheap , or trivial  it is all magnificent .
that short valley is a <unk> of a notable kind , for it contains no <unk> ; from end to end the creator has <name> it with his <unk> .
we made zermatt at three in the afternoon , nine hours out from st. <name> .
distance , by guide-book , twelve miles ; by <unk> seventy-two .
we were in the heart and home of the <unk> , now , as all visible things testified .
the <unk> did not hold themselves aloof , in aristocratic reserve ; they nestled close around , in a friendly , sociable way ; guides , with the ropes and axes and other implements of their fearful calling slung about their persons , <unk> in a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel , and waited for customers ; <unk> climbers , in <unk> costume , and followed by their guides and porters , arrived from time to time , from breakneck expeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the high alps ; male and female tourists , on mules , filed by , in a continuous procession , <unk> from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every time they were described at the english or american fireside , and at last <unk> the possible itself .
we were not dreaming ; this was not a make-believe home of the <unk> , created by our heated imaginations ; no , for here was mr. <unk> himself , the famous englishman who hunts his way to the most formidable alpine summits without a guide .
i was not equal to imagining a <unk> ; it was all i could do to even realize him , while looking straight at him at short range .
i would rather face whole hyde parks of artillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the peaks and precipices of the mountains .
there is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous alp ; but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it .
i have not jumped to this conclusion ; i have traveled to it per <unk> , so to speak .
i have thought the thing all out , and am quite sure i am right .
a born climber 's appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy ; when it comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him ; he may have other business on hand , but it must wait .
mr. <unk> had had his usual summer holiday in the alps , and had spent it in his usual way , hunting for unique chances to break his neck ; his vacation was over , and his luggage packed for england , but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the tremendous <unk> once more , for he had heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it .
his baggage was unpacked at once , and now he and a friend , laden with knapsacks , <unk> , coils of rope , and <unk> of milk , were just setting out .
they would spend the night high up among the snows , somewhere , and get up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise .
i had a strong <name> to go with them , but forced it down  a feat which mr. <unk> , with all his fortitude , could not do .
even ladies catch the climbing mania , and are unable to throw it off .
a famous climber , of that sex , had attempted the <unk> a few days before our arrival , and she and her guides had lost their way in a snow-storm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to wander around a good while before they could find a way down .
when this <name> reached the bottom , she had been on her feet twenty-three hours !
our guides , hired on the <unk> , were already at zermatt when we reached there .
so there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an adventure whenever we should choose the time and the object .
i resolved to devote my first evening in zermatt to studying up the subject of alpine climbing , by way of preparation .
i read several books , and here are some of the things i found out .
one's shoes must be strong and heavy , and have pointed <unk> in them .
the alpenstock must be of the best wood , for if it should break , loss of life might be the result .
one should <name> an ax , to cut steps in the ice with , on the great heights .
there must be a ladder , for there are steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument  or this <unk>  but could not be surmounted without it ; such an obstruction has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route , when a ladder would have saved him all trouble .
one must have from one hundred and fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope , to be used in lowering the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to be traversed in any other way .
one must have a steel hook , on another rope  a very useful thing ; for when one is ascending and comes to a low bluff which is yet too high for the ladder , he swings this rope aloft like a lasso , the hook catches at the top of the bluff , and then the tourist climbs the rope , hand over hand  being always particular to try and forget that if the hook gives way he <name> never stop falling till he arrives in some part of switzerland where they are not expecting him .
another important thing  there must be a rope to tie the whole party together with , so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless chasm in a glacier , the others may brace back on the rope and save him .
one must have a silk veil , to protect his face from snow , sleet , hail and <name> , and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy , <unk> .
finally , there must be some porters , to <name> provisions , wine and scientific instruments , and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in .
i closed my readings with a fearful adventure which mr. <unk> once had on the matterhorn when he was prowling around alone , five thousand feet above the town of <unk> .
he was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of <unk> snow joined it .
this declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet , into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high , overlooking a glacier .
his foot slipped , and he fell .
he says : " my knapsack brought my head down first , and i pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below ; they caught something , and tumbled me off the edge , head over heels , into the gully ; the baton was dashed from my hands , and i whirled downward in a series of bounds , each longer than the last ; now over ice , now into rocks , striking my head four or five times , each time with increased force .
the last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet , from one side of the gully to the other , and i struck the rocks , luckily , with the whole of my left side .
they caught my clothes for a moment , and i fell back on to the snow with motion arrested .
my head fortunately came the right side up , and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt , in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice .
baton , hat , and veil skimmed by and disappeared , and the crash of the rocks  which i had started  as they fell on to the glacier , told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction .
as it was , i fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds .
ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below .
" the situation was sufficiently serious .
the rocks could not be let go for a moment , and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts .
the most serious ones were in the head , and i vainly tried to close them with one hand , while holding on with the other .
it was useless ; the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each <unk> .
at last , in a moment of inspiration , i kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head .
the idea was a happy one , and the flow of blood diminished .
then , scrambling up , i got , not a moment too soon , to a place of safety , and fainted away .
the sun was setting when consciousness returned , and it was pitch-dark before the great staircase was descended ; but by a combination of luck and care , the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to <unk> was accomplished without a slip , or once missing the way . "
his wounds kept him abed some days .
then he got up and climbed that mountain again .
that is the way with a true <unk> ; the more fun he has , the more he wants .
chapter xxxvii [ our imposing column starts upward ] after i had finished my readings , i was no longer myself ; i was <unk> , uplifted , intoxicated , by the almost incredible perils and adventures i had been following my authors through , and the triumphs i had been sharing with them .
i sat silent some time , then turned to <name> and said : " my mind is made up . "
something in my tone struck him : and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there , his face paled perceptibly .
he hesitated a moment , then said : " speak . "
i answered , with perfect calmness : " i <name> ascend the <unk> . "
if i had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly .
if i had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose .
but i turned a deaf ear to all he said .
when he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination , he ceased to urge , and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs .
i sat in marble resolution , with my eyes fixed upon vacancy , for in spirit i was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains , and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears .
at last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones : " your <name> <name> never desert you .
we <name> die together . "
i cheered the <name> fellow with praises , and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure .
he wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning , as he supposed the custom was ; but i explained that nobody was looking at that hour ; and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first night 's resting-place on the mountain side .
i said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 p.m. on the morrow ; meantime he could notify the guides , and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make .
i went to bed , but not to sleep .
no man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these alpine exploits .
i tossed feverishly all night long , and was glad enough when i heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner .
i rose , jaded and <name> , and went to the noon meal , where i found myself the center of interest and curiosity ; for the news was already abroad .
it is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion ; but it is very pleasant , nevertheless .
as usual , at zermatt , when a great ascent is about to be undertaken , everybody , native and foreign , laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start .
the expedition consisted of 198 persons , including the mules ; or 205 , including the cows .
as follows : chiefs of service subordinates myself 1 veterinary surgeon mr. <name> 1 butler 17 guides 12 waiters 4 surgeons 1 footman 1 geologist 1 barber 1 botanist 1 head cook 3 <unk> 9 assistants 2 <unk> 4 <unk> cooks 15 <unk> 1 <unk> artist 1 <unk> transportation , etc .
27 porters 3 coarse <unk> and <unk> 44 mules 1 fine ditto 44 <unk> 7 cows 2 <unk> total , 154 men , 51 animals .
grand total , 205 .
rations , etc .
apparatus 16 cases hams 25 spring <unk> 2 barrels flour 2 hair ditto 22 barrels whiskey bedding for same 1 barrel sugar 2 <unk> 1 keg lemons 29 tents 2,000 cigars scientific instruments 1 barrel pies 97 <unk> 1 ton of <unk> 5 cases dynamite 143 pair crutches 7 cans <unk> 2 barrels <unk> 22 <unk> ladders 1 bale of <unk> 2 miles of rope 27 <unk> <unk> 154 umbrellas it was full four o'clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready .
at that hour it began to move .
in point of <name> and spectacular effect , it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from zermatt .
i commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file , twelve feet apart , and lash them all together on a strong rope .
he objected that the first two miles was a dead level , with plenty of room , and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places .
but i would not listen to that .
my reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough ; i was not going to add one to the list .
the guide then obeyed my order .
when the procession stood at ease , roped together , and ready to move , i never saw a finer sight .
it was <unk> feet long  over half a mile ; every man and me was on foot , and had on his green veil and his blue goggles , and his white rag around his hat , and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other , and his <unk> in his belt , and carried his alpenstock in his left hand , his umbrella ( closed ) in his right , and his crutches slung at his back .
the burdens of the <unk> and the horns of the cows were decked with the <unk> and the alpine rose .
i and my agent were the only persons mounted .
we were in the post of danger in the extreme rear , and tied securely to five guides apiece .
our <unk> carried our <unk> , alpenstocks , and other implements for us .
we were mounted upon very small donkeys , as a measure of safety ; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up , and let the donkey walk from under .
still , i can not recommend this sort of animal  at least for excursions of mere pleasure  because his ears interrupt the view .
i and my agent possessed the regulation <unk> costumes , but concluded to leave them behind .
out of respect for the great <name> of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass , and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition , we decided to make the ascent in evening dress .
we watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village , and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us .
about half past five o'clock we arrived at a bridge which <unk> the <unk> , and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe , the caravan crossed without accident .
the way now led , by a gentle ascent , carpeted with fresh green grass , to the church at <unk> .
without stopping to examine this edifice , i executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the <unk> , after first testing its strength .
here i <unk> to the right again , and presently entered an inviting stretch of <unk> which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity .
these meadows offered an excellent <unk> .
we pitched our tents , <unk> , established a proper grade , recorded the events of the day , and then went to bed .
we rose at two in the morning and dressed by <unk> .
it was a dismal and chilly business .
a few stars were shining , but the general heavens were overcast , and the great shaft of the matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds .
the chief guide advised a delay ; he said he feared it was going to rain .
we waited until nine o'clock , and then got away in tolerably clear weather .
our course led up some terrific <unk> , densely wooded with <unk> and cedars , and traversed by paths which the rains had <unk> and which were obstructed by loose stones .
to add to the danger and inconvenience , we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback , and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by .
our troubles thickened .
about the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation .
after consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact  that is to say , they believed they were lost .
i asked if they did not know it ?
no , they said , they could n't absolutely know whether they were lost or not , because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before .
they had a strong instinct that they were lost , but they had no proofs  except that they did not know where they were .
they had met no tourists for some time , and they considered that a suspicious sign .
plainly we were in an ugly fix .
the guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty ; so we all went together .
for better security we moved slow and cautiously , for the forest was very dense .
we did not move up the mountain , but around it , hoping to strike across the old trail .
toward nightfall , when we were about tired out , we came up against a rock as big as a cottage .
this barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men , and a panic of fear and despair ensued .
they moaned and wept , and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again .
then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition .
some even muttered threats against me .
clearly it was no time to show weakness .
so i made a speech in which i said that other <unk> had been in as perilous a position as this , and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped .
i promised to stand by them , i promised to rescue them .
i closed by saying we had plenty of provisions to maintain us for quite a siege  and did they suppose zermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously disappear during any considerable time , right above their noses , and make no inquiries ?
no , zermatt would send out <unk> and we should be saved .
this speech had a great effect .
the men pitched the tents with some little show of cheerfulness , and we were snugly under cover when the night shut down .
i now <unk> the reward of my wisdom in providing one article which is not mentioned in any book of alpine adventure but this .
i refer to the <unk> .
but for that beneficent drug , would have not one of those men slept a moment during that fearful night .
but for that gentle <unk> they must have tossed , <unk> , the night through ; for the whiskey was for me .
yes , they would have risen in the morning <unk> for their heavy task .
as it was , everybody slept but my agent and me  only we and the <unk> .
i would not permit myself to sleep at such a time .
i considered myself responsible for all those lives .
i meant to be on hand and ready , in case of avalanches up there , but i did not know it then .
we watched the weather all through that awful night , and kept an eye on the barometer , to be prepared for the least change .
there was not the slightest change recorded by the instrument , during the whole time .
words can not describe the comfort that that friendly , hopeful , steadfast thing was to me in that season of trouble .
it was a defective barometer , and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer , but i did not know that until afterward .
if i should be in such a situation again , i should not wish for any barometer but that one .
all hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast , and as soon as it was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock .
for some time we tried the <unk> and other means of scaling it , but without success  that is , without perfect success .
the hook caught once , and <name> started up it hand over hand , but the hold broke and if there had not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time , <name> would certainly have been crippled .
as it was , it was the chaplain .
he took to his crutches , and i ordered the <unk> to be laid aside .
it was too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around .
we were puzzled for a while ; then somebody thought of the ladders .
one of these was leaned against the rock , and the men went up it tied together in couples .
another ladder was sent up for use in descending .
at the end of half an hour everybody was over , and that rock was conquered .
we gave our first grand shout of triumph .
but the <name> was short-lived , for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals over .
this was a serious difficulty ; in fact , it was an impossibility .
the courage of the men began to waver immediately ; once more we were threatened with a panic .
but when the danger was most imminent , we were saved in a mysterious way .
a mule which had attracted attention from the beginning by its disposition to experiment , tried to eat a <unk> can of <unk> .
this happened right alongside the rock .
the explosion threw us all to the ground , and covered us with dirt and debris ; it frightened us extremely , too , for the crash it made was deafening , and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble .
however , we were grateful , for the rock was gone .
its place was occupied by a new cellar , about thirty feet across , by fifteen feet deep .
the explosion was heard as far as zermatt ; and an hour and a half afterward , many citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured by descending portions of mule meat , frozen solid .
this shows , better than any estimate in figures , how high the <unk> went .
we had nothing to do , now , but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way .
with a cheer the men went at their work .
i attended to the engineering , myself .
i appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with <unk> and trim them for piers to support the bridge .
this was a slow business , for <unk> are not good to cut wood with .
i caused my piers to be firmly set up in ranks in the cellar , and upon them i laid six of my <unk> ladders , side by side , and laid six more on top of them .
upon this bridge i caused a bed of boughs to be spread , and on top of the boughs a bed of earth six inches deep .
i stretched ropes upon either side to serve as railings , and then my bridge was complete .
a train of elephants could have crossed it in safety and comfort .
by nightfall the caravan was on the other side and the ladders were taken up .
next morning we went on in good spirits for a while , though our way was slow and difficult , by reason of the steep and <name> nature of the ground and the thickness of the forest ; but at last a dull despondency crept into the men 's faces and it was apparent that not only they , but even the guides , were now convinced that we were lost .
the fact that we still met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant .
another thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost , but very badly lost ; for there must surely be <unk> on the road before this time , yet we had seen no sign of them .
<unk> was spreading ; something must be done , and done quickly , too .
fortunately , i am not <unk> in <unk> .
i contrived one now which commended itself to all , for it promised well .
i took three-quarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the waist of a guide , and told him to go find the road , while the caravan waited .
i instructed him to guide himself back by the rope , in case of failure ; in case of success , he was to give the rope a series of violent jerks , whereupon the expedition would go to him at once .
he departed , and in two minutes had disappeared among the trees .
i <unk> out the rope myself , while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes .
the rope crept away quite slowly , at times , at other times with some <unk> .
twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal , and a shout was just ready to break from the men 's lips when they perceived it was a false alarm .
but at last , when over half a mile of rope had <unk> away , it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still  one minute  two minutes  three  while we held our breath and watched .
was the guide resting ?
was he scanning the country from some high point ?
was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer ?
stop ,  had he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety ?
this thought gave us a shock .
i was in the very first act of <unk> an expedition to succor him , when the cord was assailed with a series of such frantic jerks that i could hardly keep hold of it .
the huzza that went up , then , was good to hear .
" saved !
saved ! "
was the word that rang out , all down the long rank of the caravan .
we rose up and started at once .
we found the route to be good enough for a while , but it began to grow difficult , by and by , and this feature steadily increased .
when we judged we had gone half a mile , we momently expected to see the guide ; but no , he was not visible anywhere ; neither was he waiting , for the rope was still moving , consequently he was doing the same .
this argued that he had not found the road , yet , but was marching to it with some peasant .
there was nothing for us to do but <unk> along  and this we did .
at the end of three hours we were still plodding .
this was not only mysterious , but exasperating .
and very fatiguing , too ; for we had tried hard , along at first , to catch up with the guide , but had only fagged ourselves , in vain ; for although he was traveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan over such ground .
at three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustion  and still the rope was slowly gliding out .
the murmurs against the guide had been growing steadily , and at last they were become loud and savage .
a mutiny ensued .
the men refused to proceed .
they declared that we had been traveling over and over the same ground all day , in a kind of circle .
they demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree , so as to halt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him .
this was not an unreasonable requirement , so i gave the order .
as soon as the rope was tied , the expedition moved forward with that alacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires .
but after a tiresome march of almost half a mile , we came to a hill covered thick with a <unk> rubbish of stones , and so steep that no man of us all was now in a condition to climb it .
every attempt failed , and ended in <unk> somebody .
within twenty minutes i had five men on crutches .
whenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope , it yielded and let him tumble backward .
the frequency of this result suggested an idea to me .
i ordered the caravan to 'bout face and form in marching order ; i then made the <unk> fast to the rear mule , and gave the command : " <name> time  by the right flank  forward  march ! "
the procession began to move , to the impressive strains of a <unk> , and i said to myself , " now , if the rope do n't break i judge this <name> fetch that guide into the camp . "
i watched the rope gliding down the hill , and presently when i was all fixed for triumph i was confronted by a bitter disappointment ; there was no guide tied to the rope , it was only a very indignant old black ram .
the fury of the baffled expedition exceeded all bounds .
they even wanted to wreak their unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute .
but i stood between them and their prey , <unk> by a bristling wall of <unk> and alpenstocks , and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder , and it was directly over my corpse .
even as i spoke i saw that my doom was sealed , except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from their fell purpose .
i see the sickening wall of weapons now ; i see that advancing host as i saw it then , i see the hate in those cruel eyes ; i remember how i drooped my head upon my breast , i feel again the sudden earthquake shock in my rear , administered by the very ram i was sacrificing myself to save ; i hear once more the typhoon of laughter that burst from the assaulting column as i <unk> it from van to rear like a sepoy shot from a rodman gun .
i was saved .
yes , i was saved , and by the merciful instinct of ingratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous beast .
the <name> which eloquence had failed to work in those men's hearts , had been wrought by a laugh .
the ram was set free and my life was spared .
we lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had placed a half-mile between himself and us .
to avert suspicion , he had judged it best that the line should continue to move ; so he caught that ram , and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to it , we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon , overcome by fatigue and distress .
when he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging around , trying to rid itself of the rope , and this was the signal which we had risen up with glad shouts to obey .
we had followed this ram round and round in a circle all day  a thing which was proven by the discovery that we had watered the expedition seven times at one and same spring in seven hours .
as expert a woodman as i am , i had somehow failed to notice this until my attention was called to it by a hog .
this hog was always wallowing there , and as he was the only hog we saw , his frequent repetition , together with his unvarying similarity to himself , finally caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog , and this led me to the deduction that this must be the same spring , also  which indeed it was .
i made a note of this curious thing , as showing in a striking manner the relative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog .
it is now a well-established fact that glaciers move ; i consider that my observations go to show , with equal <unk> , that a hog in a spring does not move .
i shall be glad to receive the opinions of other observers upon this point .
to return , for an explanatory moment , to that guide , and then i shall be done with him .
after leaving the ram tied to the rope , he had wandered at large a while , and then happened to run across a cow .
judging that a cow would naturally know more than a guide , he took her by the tail , and the result justified his judgment .
she nibbled her leisurely way downhill till it was near <unk> , then she struck for home and towed him into zermatt .
chapter xxxviii [ i conquer the gorner <unk> ] we went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us .
the men were greatly fatigued .
their conviction that we were lost was forgotten in the cheer of a good supper , and before the reaction had a chance to set in , i loaded them up with <unk> and put them to bed .
next morning i was considering in my mind our desperate situation and trying to think of a remedy , when <name> came to me with a baedeker map which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in switzerland  yes , every part of it was in switzerland .
so we were not lost , after all .
this was an immense relief ; it lifted the weight of two such mountains from my breast .
i immediately had the news disseminated and the map was exhibited .
the effect was wonderful .
as soon as the men saw with their own eyes that they knew where they were , and that it was only the summit that was lost and not themselves , they cheered up instantly and said with one accord , let the summit take care of itself .
our distresses being at an end , i now determined to rest the men in camp and give the scientific department of the expedition a chance .
first , i made a <unk> observation , to get our altitude , but i could not perceive that there was any result .
i knew , by my scientific reading , that either <unk> or <unk> ought to be boiled , to make them accurate ; i did not know which it was , so i boiled them both .
there was still no result ; so i examined these instruments and discovered that they possessed radical <unk> : the barometer had no hand but the brass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with <unk> .
i might have boiled those things to rags , and never found out anything .
i hunted up another barometer ; it was new and perfect .
i boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making .
the result was unexpected : the instrument was not affecting at all , but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook , who was a most conscientious person , changed its name in the <name> of fare .
the dish was so greatly liked by all , that i ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day .
it was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured , but i did not care for that .
i had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it could not tell how high a mountain was , therefore i had no real use for it .
changes in the weather i could take care of without it ; i did not wish to know when the weather was going to be good , what i wanted to know was when it was going to be bad , and this i could find out from <name> 's <unk> .
<name> had had his <unk> tested and regulated at the government observatory in heidelberg , and one could depend upon them with confidence .
so i transferred the new barometer to the cooking department , to be used for the official mess .
it was found that even a pretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer ; so i allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess .
i next boiled the thermometer , and got a most excellent result ; the mercury went up to about 200 degrees <unk> .
in the opinion of the other scientists of the expedition , this seemed to indicate that we had attained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above sea-level .
science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand feet above sea-level .
there was no snow where we were , consequently it was proven that the eternal snow-line ceases somewhere above the <unk> level and does not begin any more .
this was an interesting fact , and one which had not been observed by any observer before .
it was as valuable as interesting , too , since it would open up the deserted summits of the highest alps to population and agriculture .
it was a proud thing to be where we were , yet it caused us a pang to reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two hundred thousand feet higher .
the success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with my <unk> apparatus .
i got it out , and boiled one of my cameras , but the thing was a failure ; it made the wood swell up and burst , and i could not see that the lenses were any better than they were before .
i now concluded to boil a guide .
it might improve him , it could not impair his usefulness .
but i was not allowed to proceed .
guides have no feeling for science , and this one would not consent to be made uncomfortable in its interest .
in the midst of my scientific work , one of those needless accidents happened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless .
a <name> shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the <unk> .
this was not a serious matter to me , for a <unk> 's duties are as well performed on crutches as otherwise  but the fact remained that if the <unk> had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that load .
that would have been quite another matter , for when it comes down to a question of value there is a palpable difference between a <unk> and a mule .
i could not depend on having a <unk> in the right place every time ; so , to make things safe , i ordered that in the future the chamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other weapon than the forefinger .
my nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another <unk>  one which utterly <unk> me for a moment : a rumor swept suddenly through the camp that one of the <unk> had fallen over a precipice !
however , it turned out that it was only a chaplain .
i had laid in an extra force of <unk> , purposely to be prepared for emergencies like this , but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather <unk> in the matter of <unk> .
on the following morning we moved on , well refreshed and in good spirits .
i remember this day with peculiar pleasure , because it saw our road restored to us .
yes , we found our road again , and in quite an extraordinary way .
we had <unk> along some two hours and a half , when we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high .
i did not need to be instructed by a mule this time .
i was already beginning to know more than any mule in the expedition .
i at once put in a blast of dynamite , and lifted that rock out of the way .
but to my surprise and mortification , i found that there had been a chalet on top of it .
i picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity , and subordinates of my corps collected the rest .
none of these poor people were injured , happily , but they were much annoyed .
i explained to the head <unk> just how the thing happened , and that i was only searching for the road , and would certainly have given him timely notice if i had known he was up there .
i said i had meant no harm , and hoped i had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in the air .
i said many other judicious things , and finally when i offered to rebuild his chalet , and pay for the <unk> , and throw in the cellar , he was <unk> and satisfied .
he had n't any cellar at all , before ; he would not have as good a view , now , as formerly , but what he had lost in view he had gained in cellar , by exact measurement .
he said there was n't another hole like that in the mountains  and he would have been right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the <unk> .
i put a hundred and sixteen men at work , and they rebuilt the chalet from its own debris in fifteen minutes .
it was a good deal more picturesque than it was before , too .
the man said we were now on the <unk> , above the <unk>  information which i was glad to get , since it gave us our position to a degree of <unk> which we had not been accustomed to for a day or so .
we also learned that we were standing at the foot of the <unk> proper , and that the initial chapter of our work was completed .
we had a fine view , from here , of the energetic <unk> , as it makes its first plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice , worn through the <unk> of the great gorner glacier ; and we could also see the <unk> , which is the outlet of the <unk> glacier .
the <unk> to the summit of the <unk> passed right in front of the chalet , a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed , because a procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time .
" pretty much " may not be elegant english , but it is high time it was .
there is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it <unk>  m.t .
the <unk> 's business consisted in furnishing refreshments to tourists .
my blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes , by breaking all the bottles on the place ; but i gave the man a lot of whiskey to sell for alpine champagne , and a lot of vinegar which would answer for rhine wine , consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever .
leaving the expedition outside to rest , i quartered myself in the chalet , with <name> , proposing to correct my journals and scientific observations before continuing the ascent .
i had hardly begun my work when a tall , slender , vigorous american youth of about twenty-three , who was on his way down the mountain , entered and came toward me with that breezy <unk> which is the <unk> 's idea of the well-bred ease of the man of the world .
his hair was short and parted accurately in the middle , and he had all the look of an american person who would be likely to begin his signature with an initial , and spell his middle name out .
he introduced himself , smiling a <unk> smile borrowed from the courtiers of the stage , extended a <unk> <unk> , and while he gripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the hips , as the stage courtier does , and said in the <unk> and most <unk> and <unk> way  i quite remember his exact language : " very glad to make your acquaintance , 'm sure ; very glad indeed , assure you .
i 've read all your little efforts and greatly admired them , and when i heard you were here , i ... " i indicated a chair , and he sat down .
this grandee was the grandson of an american of considerable note in his day , and not wholly forgotten yet  a man who came so near being a great man that he was quite generally accounted one while he lived .
i slowly paced the floor , pondering scientific problems , and heard this conversation : grandson .
first visit to europe ?
<name> .
mine ?
yes .
<unk> .
( with a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may be tasted in their freshness but once . )
ah , i know what it is to you .
a first visit !  ah , the romance of it !
i wish i could feel it again .
h. yes , i find it exceeds all my dreams .
it is enchantment .
i go ... <unk> .
( with a dainty gesture of the hand <unk> " spare me your callow enthusiasms , good friend . " )
yes , i know , i know ; you go to cathedrals , and exclaim ; and you drag through <unk> <unk> and exclaim ; and you stand here , and there , and yonder , upon historic ground , and continue to exclaim ; and you are <unk> with your first crude conceptions of <name> , and are proud and happy .
ah , yes , proud and happy  that expresses it .
<unk> , enjoy it  it is right  it is an innocent revel .
h. and you ?
do n't you do these things now ?
<unk> .
i !
oh , that is very good !
my dear sir , when you are as old a traveler as i am , you <name> not ask such a question as that .
i visit the regulation gallery , moon around the regulation cathedral , do the worn round of the regulation sights , yet ?  excuse me !
h. well , what do you do , then ?
<unk> .
do ?
i flit  and flit  for i am ever on the wing  but i avoid the herd .
today i am in <name> , tomorrow in berlin , anon in rome ; but you would look for me in vain in the galleries of the louvre or the common resorts of the <unk> in those other capitals .
if you would find me , you must look in the <unk> nooks and corners where others never think of going .
one day you <name> find me making myself at home in some obscure peasant 's cabin , another day you <name> find me in some forgotten castle worshiping some little gem or <name> which the careless eye has overlooked and which the <unk> would despise ; again you <name> find me as guest in the inner <unk> of palaces while the herd is content to get a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by <unk> a servant .
h. you are a guest in such places ?
<unk> .
and a welcoming one .
h. it is surprising .
how does it come ?
<unk> .
my grandfather 's name is a passport to all the courts in europe .
i have only to utter that name and every door is open to me .
i flit from court to court at my own free <name> and pleasure , and am always welcome .
i am as much at home in the palaces of europe as you are among your relatives .
i know every titled person in europe , i think .
i have my pockets full of invitations all the time .
i am under promise to go to italy , where i am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses in the land .
in berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the imperial palace .
it is the same , wherever i go .
h. it must be very pleasant .
but it must make boston seem a little slow when you are at home .
<unk> .
yes , of course it does .
but i do n't go home much .
there 's no life there  little to feed a man 's higher nature .
boston 's very narrow , you know .
she does n't know it , and you could n't convince her of it  so i say nothing when i 'm there : where 's the use ?
yes , boston is very narrow , but she has such a good opinion of herself that she ca n't see it .
a man who has traveled as much as i have , and seen as much of the world , sees it plain enough , but he ca n't cure it , you know , so the best is to leave it and seek a sphere which is more in <name> with his tastes and culture .
i run across there , once a year , perhaps , when i have nothing important on hand , but i 'm very soon back again .
i spend my time in europe .
h. i see .
you map out your plans and ... <unk> .
no , excuse me .
i do n't map out any plans .
i simply follow the inclination of the day .
i am limited by no ties , no requirements , i am not bound in any way .
i am too old a traveler to hamper myself with deliberate purposes .
i am simply a traveler  an inveterate traveler  a man of the world , in a word  i can call myself by no other name .
i do not say , " i am going here , or i am going there "  i say nothing at all , i only act .
for instance , next week you may find me the guest of a grandee of spain , or you may find me off for <name> , or flitting toward dresden .
i shall probably go to egypt presently ; friends <name> say to friends , " he is at the nile cataracts "  and at that very moment they <name> be surprised to learn that i 'm away off yonder in <name> somewhere .
i am a constant surprise to people .
they are always saying , " yes , he was in jerusalem when we heard of him last , but goodness knows where he is now . "
presently the grandson rose to leave  discovered he had an appointment with some emperor , perhaps .
he did his graces over again : gripped me with one <unk> , at <unk> , pressed his hat against his stomach with the other , bent his body in the middle three times , murmuring : " pleasure , 'm sure ; great pleasure , 'm sure .
wish you much success . "
then he removed his gracious presence .
it is a great and solemn thing to have a grandfather .
i have not purposed to <unk> this boy in any way , for what little indignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but compassion .
one can not keep up a grudge against a vacuum .
i have tried to repeat this lad 's very words ; if i have failed anywhere i have at least not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said .
he and the innocent <unk> whom i met on the swiss lake are the most unique and interesting specimens of young <name> i came across during my foreign tramping .
i have made honest portraits of them , not <unk> .
the grandson of twenty-three referred to himself five or six times as an " old traveler , " and as many as three times ( with a serene complacency which was maddening ) as a " man of the world . "
there was something very delicious about his leaving boston to her " narrowness , " <unk> and <unk> .
i formed the caravan in marching order , presently , and after riding down the line to see that it was properly roped together , gave the command to proceed .
in a little while the road carried us to open , grassy land .
we were above the troublesome forest , now , and had an uninterrupted view , straight before us , of our summit  the summit of the <unk> .
we followed the <unk> , a zigzag course , now to the right , now to the left , but always up , and always crowded and <unk> by going and coming files of reckless tourists who were never , in a single instance , tied together .
i was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution , for in many places the road was not two yards wide , and often the lower side of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep .
i had to encourage the men constantly , to keep them from giving way to their <unk> fears .
we might have made the summit before night , but for a delay caused by the loss of an umbrella .
i was allowing the umbrella to remain lost , but the men murmured , and with reason , for in this exposed region we stood in peculiar need of protection against avalanches ; so i went into camp and detached a strong party to go after the missing article .
the difficulties of the next morning were severe , but our courage was high , for our goal was near .
at noon we conquered the last impediment  we stood at last upon the summit , and without the loss of a single man except the mule that ate the <unk> .
our great achievement was achieved  the possibility of the impossible was demonstrated , and <name> and i walked proudly into the great dining-room of the <unk> hotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner .
yes , i had made the grand ascent ; but it was a mistake to do it in evening dress .
the plug hats were battered , the <unk> were fluttering rags , mud added no <name> , the general effect was unpleasant and even disreputable .
there were about seventy-five tourists at the hotel  mainly ladies and little children  and they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for all our privations and sufferings .
the ascent had been made , and the names and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it to all future tourists .
i boiled a thermometer and took an altitude , with a most curious result : the summit was not as high as the point on the mountainside where i had taken the first altitude .
suspecting that i had made an important discovery , i prepared to verify it .
there happened to be a still higher summit ( called the gorner <unk> ) , above the hotel , and notwithstanding the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height , and that the ascent is difficult and dangerous , i resolved to venture up there and boil a thermometer .
so i sent a strong party , with some borrowed <unk> , in charge of two chiefs of service , to dig a stairway in the soil all the way up , and this i ascended , roped to the guides .
this breezy height was the summit proper  so i accomplished even more than i had originally purposed to do .
this foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone monument .
i boiled my thermometer , and sure enough , this spot , which <unk> to be two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel , turned out to be nine thousand feet lower .
thus the fact was clearly demonstrated that , above a certain point , the higher a point seems to be , the lower it actually is .
our ascent itself was a great achievement , but this contribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter .
<unk> object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the higher and higher you go , and hence the apparent anomaly .
i answer that i do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does , but upon what a boiled thermometer says .
you ca n't go behind the thermometer .
i had a magnificent view of <name> <name> , and apparently all the rest of the alpine world , from that high place .
all the circling horizon was piled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests .
one might have imagined he saw before him the <unk> camps of a <unk> host of <unk> .
note.  i had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse of the matterhorn wholly <unk> by clouds .
i leveled my <unk> apparatus at it without the loss of an instant , and should have got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered .
it was my purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book , but was obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the professional artist because i found i could not do landscape well .
but lonely , conspicuous , and superb , rose that wonderful upright wedge , the matterhorn .
its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow , and the upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a veil .
a little later the matterhorn took to himself the semblance of a volcano ; he was stripped naked to his apex  around this circled vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away <unk> toward the sun , a <unk> stretch of rolling and tumbling vapor , and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater .
later again , one of the mountain 's sides was clean and clear , and another side densely clothed from base to summit in thick <unk> cloud which feathered off and flew around the shaft 's sharp edge like the smoke around the corners of a burning building .
the matterhorn is always experimenting , and always gets up fine effects , too .
in the sunset , when all the lower world is <unk> in gloom , it points toward heaven out of the pervading blackness like a finger of fire .
in the sunrise  well , they say it is very fine in the sunrise .
authorities agree that there is no such tremendous " <unk> " of snowy alpine magnitude , grandeur , and sublimity to be seen from any other accessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the <unk> .
therefore , let the tourist rope himself up and go there ; for i have shown that with nerve , caution , and judgment , the thing can be done .
i wish to add one remark , here  in <unk> , so to speak  suggested by the word " snowy , " which i have just used .
we have all seen hills and mountains and levels with snow on them , and so we think we know all the aspects and effects produced by snow .
but indeed we do not until we have seen the alps .
possibly mass and distance add something  at any rate , something is added .
among other noticeable things , there is a dazzling , intense whiteness about the distant alpine snow , when the sun is on it , which one recognizes as peculiar , and not familiar to the eye .
the snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it  painters usually give it a bluish cast  but there is no perceptible tint to the distant alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest .
as to the unimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it  well , it simply is unimaginable .
chapter xxxix [ we travel by glacier ] a guide-book is a queer thing .
the reader has just seen what a man who undertakes the great ascent from zermatt to the <unk> hotel must experience .
yet baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this matter : 1 .
distance  3 hours .
2 .
the road can not be mistaken .
3 .
guide unnecessary .
4 .
distance from <unk> hotel to the gorner <unk> , one hour and a half .
5 .
ascent simple and easy .
guide unnecessary .
6 .
elevation of zermatt above sea-level , <unk> feet .
7 .
elevation of <unk> hotel above sea-level , <unk> feet .
8 .
elevation of the gorner <unk> above sea-level , <unk> feet .
i have pretty effectually <unk> these errors by sending him the following demonstrated facts : 1 .
distance from zermatt to <unk> hotel , 7 days .
2 .
the road can be mistaken .
if i am the first that did it , i want the credit of it , too .
3 .
guides are necessary , for none but a native can read those <unk> .
4 .
the estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sea-level is pretty correct  for baedeker .
he only misses it about a hundred and eighty or ninety thousand feet .
i found my <unk> invaluable .
my men were suffering <unk> , from the friction of sitting down so much .
during two or three days , not one of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about ; yet so effective was the <unk> , that on the fourth all were able to sit up .
i consider that , more than to anything else , i owe the success of our great undertaking to <unk> and <unk> .
my men are being restored to health and strength , my main perplexity , now , was how to get them down the mountain again .
i was not willing to expose the brave fellows to the perils , fatigues , and hardships of that fearful route again if it could be helped .
first i thought of balloons ; but , of course , i had to give that idea up , for balloons were not <unk> .
i thought of several other <unk> , but upon consideration discarded them , for cause .
but at last i hit it .
i was aware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact , for i had read it in baedeker ; so i resolved to take passage for zermatt on the great gorner glacier .
very good .
the next thing was , how to get down the glacier comfortably  for the <unk> to it was long , and winding , and wearisome .
i set my mind at work , and soon thought out a plan .
one looks straight down upon the vast frozen river called the gorner glacier , from the gorner <unk> , a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high .
we had one hundred and fifty-four umbrellas  and what is an umbrella but a parachute ?
i mentioned this <name> idea to <name> , with enthusiasm , and was about to order the expedition to form on the gorner <unk> , with their umbrellas , and prepare for flight by <unk> , each <unk> in command of a guide , when <name> stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty .
he asked me if this method of descending the alps had ever been tried before .
i said no , i had not heard of an instance .
then , in his opinion , it was a matter of considerable gravity ; in his opinion it would not be well to send the whole command over the <name> at once ; a better way would be to send down a single individual , first , and see how he fared .
i saw the wisdom in this idea instantly .
i said as much , and thanked my agent cordially , and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing right away , and wave his hat when he got down , if he struck in a soft place , and then i would ship the rest right along .
<name> was greatly touched with this <name> of confidence , and said so , in a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it ; but at the same time he said he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor ; that it might cause jealousy in the command , for there were plenty who would not hesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment , whereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it at all , nor even , in his secret heart , desired it .
i said these words did him extreme credit , but that he must not throw away the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend an alp per parachute , simply to save the feelings of some envious underlings .
no , i said , he must accept the appointment  it was no longer an invitation , it was a command .
he thanked me with effusion , and said that putting the thing in this form removed every objection .
he retired , and soon returned with his umbrella , his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with <name> .
just then the head guide passed along .
<name> 's expression changed to one of infinite tenderness , and he said : " that man did me a cruel injury four days ago , and i said in my heart he should live to perceive and confess that the only <name> revenge a man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil .
i resign in his favor .
appoint him . "
i threw my arms around the generous fellow and said : " <name> , you are the noblest soul that lives .
you shall not regret this sublime act , neither shall the world fail to know of it .
you shall have opportunity far <unk> this one , too , if i live  remember that . "
i called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot .
but the thing aroused no enthusiasm in him .
he did not take to the idea at all .
he said : " tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the gorner <unk> !
excuse me , there are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that . "
upon a discussion of the subject with him , it appeared that he considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous .
i was not convinced , yet i was not willing to try the experiment in any risky way  that is , in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency of the expedition .
i was about at my wits ' end when it occurred to me to try it on the <unk> .
he was called in .
but he declined , on the plea of inexperience , diffidence in public , lack of curiosity , and i did n't know what all .
another man declined on account of a cold in the head ; thought he ought to avoid exposure .
another could not jump well  never could jump well  did not believe he could jump so far without long and patient practice .
another was afraid it was going to rain , and his umbrella had a hole in it .
everybody had an excuse .
the result was what the reader has by this time guessed : the most magnificent idea that was ever conceived had to be abandoned , from sheer lack of a person with enterprise enough to <name> it out .
yes , i actually had to give that thing up  while doubtless i should live to see somebody use it and take all the credit from me .
well , i had to go overland  there was no other way .
i marched the expedition down the steep and tedious <unk> and took up as good a position as i could upon the middle of the glacier  because baedeker said the middle part travels the fastest .
as a measure of economy , however , i put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts , to go as slow freight .
i waited and waited , but the glacier did not move .
night was coming on , the darkness began to gather  still we did not budge .
it occurred to me then , that there might be a <unk> in baedeker ; it would be well to find out the hours of starting .
i called for the book  it could not be found .
bradshaw would certainly contain a <unk> ; but no bradshaw could be found .
very well , i must make the best of the situation .
so i pitched the tents , <unk> the animals , milked the cows , had supper , <unk> the men , established the watch , and went to bed  with orders to call me as soon as we came in sight of zermatt .
i awoke about half past ten next morning , and looked around .
we hadn't <unk> a <name> !
at first i could not understand it ; then it occurred to me that the old thing must be aground .
so i cut down some trees and rigged a spar on the starboard and another on the port side , and fooled away upward of three hours trying to spar her off .
but it was no use .
she was half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long , and there was no telling just whereabouts she was aground .
the men began to show uneasiness , too , and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces , saying she had sprung a leak .
nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another panic .
i ordered them to show me the place .
they led me to a spot where a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water .
it did look like a pretty bad leak , but i kept that to myself .
i made a pump and set the men to work to pump out the glacier .
we made a success of it .
i perceived , then , that it was not a leak at all .
this boulder had descended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the glacier , and the sun had warmed it up , every day , and consequently it had melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice , until at last it reposed , as we had found it , in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest water .
presently baedeker was found again , and i hunted eagerly for the <unk> .
there was none .
the book simply said the glacier was moving all the time .
this was satisfactory , so i shut up the book and chose a good position to view the scenery as we passed along .
i stood there some time enjoying the trip , but at last it occurred to me that we did not seem to be gaining any on the scenery .
i said to myself , " this confounded old thing 's aground again , sure , "  and opened baedeker to see if i could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions .
i soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter .
it said , " the gorner glacier travels at an average rate of a little less than an inch a day . "
i have seldom felt so outraged .
i have seldom had my confidence so wantonly betrayed .
i made a small calculation : one inch a day , say thirty feet a year ; estimated distance to zermatt , three and <unk> miles .
time required to go by glacier , a little over five hundred years !
i said to myself , " i can walk it quicker  and before i <name> <unk> such a fraud as this , i <name> do it . "
when i revealed to <name> the fact that the passenger part of this glacier  the central part  the <unk> part , so to speak  was not due in zermatt till the summer of <unk> , and that the baggage , coming along the slow edge , would not arrive until some generations later , he burst out with : " that is european management , all over !
an inch a day  think of that !
five hundred years to go a trifle over three miles !
but i am not a bit surprised .
it 's a catholic glacier .
you can tell by the look of it .
and the management . "
i said , no , i believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a catholic canton .
" well , then , it 's a government glacier , " said <name> .
" it 's all the same .
over here the government runs everything  so everything 's slow ; slow , and <unk> .
but with us , everything 's done by private enterprise  and then there ai n't much lolling around , you can depend on it .
i wish <name> <name> could get his hands on this torpid old slab once  you 'd see it take a different gait from this . "
i said i was sure he would increase the speed , if there was trade enough to justify it .
" he 'd make trade , " said <name> .
" that 's the difference between governments and individuals .
governments do n't care , individuals do .
<name> <name> would take all the trade ; in two years gorner stock would go to two hundred , and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers under the hammer for taxes . "
after a reflective pause , <name> added , " a little less than an inch a day ; a little less than an inch , mind you .
well , i 'm losing my reverence for glaciers . "
i was feeling much the same way myself .
i have traveled by <unk> , <unk> , raft , and by the ephesus and smyrna railway ; but when it comes down to good solid honest slow motion , i bet my money on the glacier .
as a means of passenger transportation , i consider the glacier a failure ; but as a vehicle of slow freight , i think she fills the <name> .
in the matter of putting the fine shades on that line of business , i judge she could teach the germans something .
i ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to zermatt .
at this moment a most interesting find was made ; a dark object , bedded in the glacial ice , was cut out with the <unk> , and it proved to be a piece of the undressed skin of some animal  a hair trunk , perhaps ; but a close inspection disabled the <unk> theory , and further discussion and examination exploded it entirely  that is , in the opinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it .
this one clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of <unk> of scientific theories , and afterward won many of the first scientists of the age to his view , by a very able pamphlet which he wrote , entitled , " evidences going to show that the hair trunk , in a wild state , belonged to the early glacial period , and roamed the wastes of chaos in the company with the <unk> , primeval man , and the other <unk> of the old silurian family . "
each of our scientists had a theory of his own , and put forward an animal of his own as a candidate for the skin .
i sided with the geologist of the expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had once helped to cover a siberian elephant , in some old forgotten age  but we divided there , the geologist believing that this discovery proved that siberia had formerly been located where switzerland is now , whereas i held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval swiss was not the dull savage he is represented to have been , but was a being of high intellectual development , who liked to go to the menagerie .
we arrived that evening , after many hardships and adventures , in some fields close to the great <unk> where the mad <unk> boils and surges out from under the foot of the great gorner glacier , and here we camped , our perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed .
we marched into zermatt the next day , and were received with the most lavish honors and applause .
a document , signed and sealed by the authorities , was given to me which established and <unk> the fact that i had made the ascent of the <unk> .
this i wear around my neck , and it <name> be buried with me when i am no more .
chapter xl [ piteous relics at chamonix ] i am not so ignorant about glacial movement , now , as i was when i took passage on the gorner glacier .
i have " read up " since .
i am aware that these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed ; while the gorner glacier makes less than an inch a day , the <unk> glacier makes as much as eight ; and still other glaciers are said to go twelve , sixteen , and even twenty inches a day .
one writer says that the slowest glacier travels twenty-five feet a year , and the fastest four hundred .
what is a glacier ?
it is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains .
but that gives no notion of its vastness .
for it is sometimes six hundred feet thick , and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep ; no , our rivers are six feet , twenty feet , and sometimes fifty feet deep ; we are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an <unk> six hundred feet deep .
the glacier 's surface is not smooth and level , but has deep <unk> and swelling elevations , and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose turbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent motion ; the glacier 's surface is not a flawless mass , but is a river with cracks or crevices , some narrow , some gaping wide .
many a man , the victim of a slip or a <unk> , has plunged down one of these and met his death .
men have been fished out of them alive ; but it was when they did not go to a great depth ; the cold of the great depths would quickly <unk> a man , whether he was hurt or unhurt .
these cracks do not go straight down ; one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down them ; consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought for , in the <name> that they had stopped within helping distance , whereas their case , in most instances , had really been hopeless from the beginning .
in 1864 a party of tourists was descending mont blanc , and while picking their way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region , roped together , as was proper , a young <name> disengaged himself from the line and started across an <unk> which spanned a crevice .
it broke under him with a crash , and he disappeared .
the others could not see how deep he had gone , so it might be <unk> to try and rescue him .
a brave young guide named <name> <unk> volunteered .
two ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a third one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him .
he was lowered into the crevice , he descended deeper and deeper between the clear blue walls of solid ice , he approached a bend in the crack and disappeared under it .
down , and still down , he went , into this profound grave ; when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under another bend in the crack , and thence descended eighty feet lower , as between perpendicular precipices .
arrived at this stage of one hundred and sixty feet below the surface of the glacier , he peered through the twilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and stretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps , for its course was lost in darkness .
what a place that was to be in  especially if that leather belt should break !
the compression of the belt threatened to <unk> the intrepid fellow ; he called to his friends to draw him up , but could not make them hear .
they still lowered him , deeper and deeper .
then he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could ; his friends understood , and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death .
then they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet , but it found no bottom .
it came up covered with <unk>  evidence enough that even if the poor <name> reached the bottom with unbroken bones , a swift death from cold was sure , anyway .
a glacier is a stupendous , <unk> , resistless plow .
it pushes ahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together , and they stretch across the gorge , right in front of it , like a long grave or a long , sharp roof .
this is called a moraine .
it also <unk> out a moraine along each side of its course .
imposing as the modern glaciers are , they are not so huge as were some that once existed .
for instance , mr. <unk> says : " at some very remote period the valley of <unk> was occupied by a vast glacier , which flowed down its entire length from mont blanc to the plain of <unk> , remained stationary , or nearly so , at its mouth for many centuries , and deposited there enormous masses of debris .
the length of this glacier exceeded eighty miles , and it drained a basin twenty-five to thirty-five miles across , bounded by the highest mountains in the alps .
" the great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers , and then , as now , shattered by sun and frost , poured down their showers of rocks and stones , in witness of which there are the immense piles of angular fragments that constitute the moraines of <unk> .
" the moraines around <unk> are of extraordinary dimensions .
that which was on the left bank of the glacier is about thirteen miles long , and in some places rises to a height of two thousand one hundred and thirty feet above the floor of the valley !
the terminal moraines ( those which are pushed in front of the glaciers ) cover something like twenty square miles of country .
at the mouth of the valley of <unk> , the thickness of the glacier must have been at least two thousand feet , and its width , at that part , five miles and a quarter . "
it is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that .
if one could cleave off the butt end of such a glacier  an oblong block two or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand feet thick  he could completely hide the city of new york under it , and <name> steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a <unk> would stick up into the bottom of a <unk> trunk .
" the boulders from mont blanc , upon the plain below <unk> , assure us that the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length of time .
their present distance from the cliffs from which they were derived is about <unk> feet , and if we assume that they traveled at the rate of 400 feet per annum , their journey must have occupied them no less than <unk> years !
in all probability they did not travel so fast . "
glaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic <unk> .
a marvelous spectacle is presented then .
mr. <unk> refers to a case which occurred in iceland in <unk> : " it seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain <unk> , large bodies of water formed underneath , or within the glaciers ( either on account of the interior heat of the earth , or from other causes ) , and at length acquired irresistible power , tore the glaciers from their <unk> on the land , and swept them over every obstacle into the sea .
prodigious masses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over land in the space of a few hours ; and their bulk was so enormous that they covered the sea for seven miles from the shore , and remained aground in six hundred feet of water !
the denudation of the land was upon a grand scale .
all superficial accumulations were swept away , and the <unk> was exposed .
it was described , in graphic language , how all irregularities and depressions were obliterated , and a smooth surface of several miles ' area laid bare , and that this area had the appearance of having been planed by a plane . "
the account translated from the <unk> says that the <unk> ruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye could reach no open water was discoverable , even from the highest peaks .
a monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch of land , too , by this strange irruption : " one can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it is mentioned that from <unk> farm , which lies high up on a <unk> , one could not see <unk> opposite , which is a fell six hundred and forty feet in height ; but in order to do so had to clamber up a mountain slope east of <unk> twelve hundred feet high . "
these things <name> help the reader to understand why it is that a man who keeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by and by .
the alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of conceit out of a man and reduce his <unk> to zero if he <name> only remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough to give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work .
the alpine glaciers move  that is granted , now , by everybody .
but there was a time when people scoffed at the idea ; they said you might as well expect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues of ice to do it .
but proof after proof was furnished , and the finally the world had to believe .
the wise men not only said the glacier moved , but they timed its movement .
they ciphered out a glacier 's gait , and then said confidently that it would travel just so far in so many years .
there is record of a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in these <unk> .
in 1820 the ascent of mont blanc was attempted by a russian and two englishmen , with seven guides .
they had reached a prodigious altitude , and were approaching the summit , when an avalanche swept several of the party down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them ( all guides ) into one of the crevices of a glacier .
the life of one of the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his back  it bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came .
the alpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way .
three men were lost  <name> <unk> , <name> carrier , and auguste <unk> .
they had been hurled down into the <unk> great deeps of the crevice .
dr. forbes , the english geologist , had made frequent visits to the mont blanc region , and had given much attention to the disputed question of the movement of glaciers .
during one of these visits he completed his estimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed up the three guides , and uttered the prediction that the glacier would deliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirty-five years from the time of the accident , or possibly forty .
a dull , slow journey  a movement imperceptible to any eye  but it was proceeding , nevertheless , and without cessation .
it was a journey which a rolling stone would make in a few seconds  the lofty point of departure was visible from the village below in the valley .
the prediction cut curiously close to the truth ; forty-one years after the catastrophe , the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier .
i find an interesting account of the matter in the <unk> du mont blanc , by <name> <unk> .
i <name> condense this account , as follows : on the 12th of <name> , 1861 , at the hour of the close of mass , a guide arrived out of breath at the <unk> of chamonix , and bearing on his shoulders a very <unk> burden .
it was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the glacier des <unk> .
he conjectured that these were remains of the victims of the catastrophe of 1820 , and a minute inquest , immediately instituted by the local authorities , soon demonstrated the correctness of his supposition .
the contents of the sack were spread upon a long table , and officially <unk> , as follows : portions of three human skulls .
several tufts of black and blonde hair .
a human jaw , furnished with fine white teeth .
a forearm and hand , all the fingers of the latter intact .
the flesh was white and fresh , and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the articulations .
the <unk> had suffered a slight <unk> , and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after forty-one years .
a left foot , the flesh white and fresh .
along with these fragments were portions of <unk> , hats , <unk> shoes , and other clothing ; a wing of a pigeon , with black feathers ; a fragment of an alpenstock ; a tin lantern ; and lastly , a boiled leg of mutton , the only flesh among all the remains that <unk> an unpleasant odor .
the guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier ; an hour 's exposure to the sun had already begun the work of decomposition upon it .
persons were called for , to identify these poor pathetic relics , and a touching scene ensued .
two men were still living who had witnessed the grim catastrophe of nearly half a century before  <name> <unk> ( saved by his baton ) and <unk> <unk> ( saved by the barometer ) .
these aged men entered and approached the table .
<unk> , more than eighty years old , contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant eye , for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age ; but <unk> 's faculties were still perfect at seventy-two , and he exhibited strong emotion .
he said : " <name> <unk> was fair ; he wore a straw hat .
this bit of skull , with the tuft of blond hair , was his ; this is his hat .
<name> carrier was very dark ; this skull was his , and this felt hat .
this is <unk> hand , i remember it so well ! "
and the old man bent down and kissed it reverently , then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp , crying out , " i could never have dared to believe that before quitting this world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of those brave comrades , the hand of my good friend <unk> . "
there is something <unk> pathetic about the picture of that white-haired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend who had been dead forty years .
when these hands had met last , they were alike in the softness and freshness of youth ; now , one was brown and wrinkled and horny with age , while the other was still as young and fair and <unk> as if those forty years had come and gone in a single moment , leaving no <name> of their passage .
time had gone on , in the one case ; it had stood still in the other .
a man who has not seen a friend for a generation , keeps him in mind always as he saw him last , and is somehow surprised , and is also shocked , to see the <unk> change the years have wrought when he sees him again .
<name> <unk> 's experience , in finding his friend 's hand unaltered from the image of it which he had carried in his memory for forty years , is an experience which stands alone in the history of man , perhaps .
<unk> identified other relics : " this hat belonged to auguste <unk> .
he carried the cage of pigeons which we proposed to set free upon the summit .
here is the wing of one of those pigeons .
and here is the fragment of my broken baton ; it was by <name> of that baton that my life was saved .
who could have told me that i should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of wood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate companions ! "
no portions of the body of <unk> , other than a piece of the skull , had been found .
a diligent search was made , but without result .
however , another search was instituted a year later , and this had better success .
many fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were discovered ; also , part of a lantern , and a green veil with <unk> on it .
but the interesting feature was this : one of the <unk> came suddenly upon a <unk> arm projecting from a crevice in the <unk> , with the hand outstretched as if offering greeting !
" the nails of this white hand were still <name> , and the pose of the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the long-lost light of day . "
the hand and arm were alone ; there was no trunk .
after being removed from the ice the <unk> quickly faded out and the <name> nails took on the <unk> <name> of death .
this was the third right hand found ; therefore , all three of the lost men were accounted for , beyond <unk> or question .
dr. <unk> was the russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent at the time of the famous disaster .
he left chamonix as soon as he conveniently could after the descent ; and as he had shown a chilly indifference about the calamity , and offered neither sympathy nor assistance to the widows and orphans , he carried with him the cordial <unk> of the whole community .
four months before the first remains were found , a chamonix guide named <unk>  a relative of one of the lost men  was in london , and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the british museum , who said : " i overheard your name .
are you from chamonix , monsieur <unk> ? "
" yes , sir . "
" have n't they found the bodies of my three guides , yet ?
i am dr .
<unk> . "
" alas , no , monsieur . "
" well , you 'll find them , sooner or later . "
" yes , it is the opinion of dr. forbes and mr. <unk> , that the glacier <name> sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate victims . "
" without a doubt , without a doubt .
and it <name> be a great thing for chamonix , in the matter of attracting tourists .
you can get up a museum with those remains that <name> draw ! "
this savage idea has not improved the odor of dr. <unk> 's name in chamonix by any means .
but after all , the man was sound on human nature .
his idea was conveyed to the public officials of chamonix , and they gravely discussed it around the official <unk> .
they were only prevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition of the friends and descendants of the lost guides , who insisted on giving the remains <name> burial , and succeeded in their purpose .
a close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments , to prevent <unk> .
a few accessory odds and ends were sold .
rags and scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to about twenty dollars a yard ; a piece of a lantern and one or two other trifles brought nearly their weight in gold ; and an englishman offered a pound <name> for a single <unk> .
chapter <unk> [ the fearful disaster of 1865 ] one of the most memorable of all the alpine <unk> was that of july , 1865 , on the matterhorn  already slightly referred to , a few pages back .
the details of it are scarcely known in <name> .
to the vast majority of readers they are not known at all .
mr. <unk> 's account is the only authentic one .
i <name> import the chief portion of it into this book , partly because of its intrinsic interest , and partly because it gives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of <unk> is .
this was mr. <unk> 's ninth attempt during a series of years , to <unk> that steep and stubborn pillar or rock ; it succeeded , the other eight were failures .
no man had ever accomplished the ascent before , though the attempts had been numerous .
mr. <unk> 's narrative we started from zermatt on the 13th of july , at half past five , on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning .
we were eight in number  <unk> ( guide ) , old <name> <unk> ( guide ) and his two sons ; lord f. <name> , mr. <unk> , rev .
mr. hudson , and i .
to insure steady motion , one tourist and one native walked together .
the youngest <unk> fell to my share .
the <unk> also fell to my lot to <name> , and throughout the day , after each drink , i <unk> them secretly with water , so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before !
this was considered a good omen , and little short of miraculous .
on the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height , and we mounted , accordingly , very leisurely .
before twelve o'clock we had found a good position for the tent , at a height of eleven thousand feet .
we passed the remaining hours of daylight  some basking in the <name> , some sketching , some collecting ; hudson made tea , i coffee , and at length we retired , each one to his blanket bag .
we assembled together before <name> on the 14th and started directly it was light enough to move .
one of the young <unk> returned to zermatt .
in a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the view of the eastern face from our tent platform .
the whole of this great slope was now revealed , rising for three thousand feet like a huge natural staircase .
some parts were more , and others were less easy , but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment , for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or to the left .
for the greater part of the way there was no occasion , indeed , for the rope , and sometimes hudson led , sometimes myself .
at <unk> we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred feet , and halted for half an hour ; we then continued the ascent without a break until <unk> , when we stopped for fifty minutes , at a height of fourteen thousand feet .
we had now arrived at the foot of that part which , seen from the <unk> , seems perpendicular or overhanging .
we could no longer continue on the eastern side .
for a little distance we ascended by snow upon the <unk>  that is , the ridge  then turned over to the right , or northern side .
the work became difficult , and required caution .
in some places there was little to hold ; the general slope of the mountain was less than forty degrees , and snow had accumulated in , and had filled up , the interstices of the <unk> , leaving only occasional fragments projecting here and there .
these were at times covered with a thin film of ice .
it was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety .
we bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet , then ascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet , then doubled back to the ridge which descends toward zermatt .
a long stride round a rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more .
that last doubt vanished !
the matterhorn was ours !
nothing but two hundred feet of easy snow remained to be surmounted .
the higher we rose , the more intense became the excitement .
the slope eased off , at length we could be detached , and <unk> and i , dashed away , ran a <unk> race , which ended in a dead heat .
at <unk> p.m. , the world was at our feet , and the matterhorn was conquered !
the others arrived .
<unk> now took the <unk> , and planted it in the highest snow .
" yes , " we said , " there is the flag-staff , but where is the flag ? "
" here it is , " he answered , pulling off his blouse and fixing it to the stick .
it made a poor flag , and there was no wind to float it out , yet it was seen all around .
they saw it at zermatt  at the <unk>  in the <name> <unk> ... .
we remained on the summit for one hour  one crowded hour of glorious life .
it passed away too quickly , and we began to prepare for the descent .
hudson and i consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the party .
we agreed that it was best for <unk> to go first , and <unk> second ; hudson , who was almost equal to a guide in <unk> of foot , wished to be third ; lord <name> was placed next , and old <name> , the strongest of the remainder , after him .
i suggested to hudson that we should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit , and hold it as we descended , as an additional protection .
he approved the idea , but it was not definitely decided that it should be done .
the party was being arranged in the above order while i was sketching the summit , and they had finished , and were waiting for me to be tied in line , when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a bottle .
they requested me to write them down , and moved off while it was being done .
a few minutes afterward i tied myself to young <name> , ran down after the others , and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the difficult part .
great care was being taken .
only one man was moving at a time ; when he was firmly planted the next advanced , and so on .
they had not , however , attached the additional rope to rocks , and nothing was said about it .
the suggestion was not made for my own sake , and i am not sure that it ever occurred to me again .
for some little distance we two followed the others , detached from them , and should have continued so had not lord <name> asked me , about 3 p.m. , to tie on to old <name> , as he feared , he said , that <unk> would not be able to hold his ground if a slip occurred .
a few minutes later , a <unk> lad ran into the <name> <name> hotel , at zermatt , saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of the matterhorn onto the matterhorn glacier .
the boy was reproved for telling idle stories ; he was right , nevertheless , and this was what he saw .
<name> <unk> had laid aside his ax , and in order to give mr. <unk> greater security , was absolutely taking hold of his legs , and putting his feet , one by one , into their proper positions .
as far as i know , no one was actually descending .
i can not speak with certainty , because the two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening mass of rock , but it is my belief , from the movements of their shoulders , that <unk> , having done as i said , was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself ; at this moment mr. <unk> slipped , fell against him , and knocked him over .
i heard one startled exclamation from <unk> , then saw him and mr. <unk> flying downward ; in another moment hudson was dragged from his steps , and lord <name> immediately after him .
all this was the work of a moment .
immediately we heard <unk> 's exclamation , old <name> and i planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit ; the rope was taut between us , and the jerk came on us both as on one man .
we held ; but the rope broke midway between <unk> and lord <name> <name> .
for a few seconds we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs , and spreading out their hands , endeavoring to save themselves .
they passed from our sight uninjured , disappeared one by one , and fell from the precipice to precipice onto the matterhorn glacier below , a distance of nearly four thousand feet in height .
from the moment the rope broke it was impossible to help them .
so perished our comrades !
for more than two hours afterward i thought almost every moment that the next would be my last ; for the <unk> , utterly unnerved , were not only incapable of giving assistance , but were in such a state that a slip might have been expected from them at any moment .
after a time we were able to do that which should have been done at first , and fixed rope to firm rocks , in addition to being tied together .
these ropes were cut from time to time , and were left behind .
even with their assurance the men were afraid to proceed , and several times old <name> turned , with ashy face and faltering limbs , and said , with terrible emphasis , " i can not ! "
about 6 p.m. , we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward zermatt , and all peril was over .
we frequently looked , but in vain , for traces of our unfortunate companions ; we bent over the ridge and cried to them , but no sound returned .
convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor hearing , we ceased from our useless efforts ; and , too cast down for speech , silently gathered up our things , and the little effects of those who were lost , and then completed the descent .
such is mr. <unk> 's graphic and thrilling narrative .
zermatt gossip darkly hints that the elder <unk> cut the rope , when the accident occurred , in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the abyss ; but mr. <unk> says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence of cutting , but only of breaking .
he adds that if <unk> had had the disposition to cut the rope , he would not have had time to do it , the accident was so sudden and unexpected .
lord <name> ' body has never been found .
it probably lodged upon some inaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice .
lord <name> was a youth of nineteen .
the three other victims fell nearly four thousand feet , and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by mr. <unk> and the other <unk> the next morning .
their graves are beside the little church in zermatt .
chapter <unk> [ chillon has a nice , roomy dungeon ] switzerland is simply a large , <unk> , solid rock , with a thin skin of grass stretched over it .
consequently , they do not dig graves , they blast them out with powder and fuse .
they can not afford to have large graveyards , the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable .
it is all required for the support of the living .
the graveyard in zermatt occupies only about one-eighth of an acre .
the graves are sunk in the living rock , and are very permanent ; but occupation of them is only temporary ; the occupant can only stay till his grave is needed by a later subject , he is removed , then , for they do not bury one body on top of another .
as i understand it , a family owns a grave , just as it owns a house .
a man dies and leaves his house to his son  and at the same time , this dead father succeeds to his own father's grave .
he moves out of the house and into the grave , and his predecessor moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel .
i saw a black box lying in the churchyard , with skull and <unk> painted on it , and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar .
in that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former citizens were compactly <unk> up .
they made a pile eighteen feet long , seven feet high , and eight feet wide .
i was told that in some of the receptacles of this kind in the swiss villages , the skulls were all marked , and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for several generations back , he could do it by these marks , preserved in the family records .
an english gentleman who had lived some years in this region , said it was the cradle of compulsory education .
but he said that the english idea that compulsory education would reduce <unk> and intemperance was an error  it has not that effect .
he said there was more <unk> in the protestant than in the catholic <unk> , because the <unk> protected the girls .
i wonder why it does n't protect married women in <name> and spain ?
this gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the <unk> , it was common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying , and his brethren  doomed bachelors  <unk> banded themselves together to help support the new family .
we left zermatt in a wagon  and in a <unk> , too  for st. <name> about ten o'clock one morning .
again we passed between those <unk> prodigious cliffs , <unk> with wee dwellings peeping over at us from velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high .
it did not seem possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices .
lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass , and correspond with a rifle .
in switzerland the farmer 's plow is a wide shovel , which <unk> up and turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock  and there the man of the plow is a hero .
now here , by our st. <name> road , was a grave , and it had a tragic story .
a <unk> was skinning his farm one morning  not the steepest part of it , but still a steep part  that is , he was not skinning the front of his farm , but the roof of it , near the eaves  when he <unk> let go of the <unk> to <unk> his hands , in the usual way ; he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward ; poor fellow , he never touched anything till he struck bottom , fifteen hundred feet below .
[ this was on a <unk>  m.t . ]
we throw a halo of heroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor , because of the deadly dangers they are facing all the time .
but we are not used to looking upon farming as a heroic occupation .
this is because we have not lived in switzerland .
from st. <name> we struck out for <unk>  or <unk>  on foot .
the <unk> had been at work during several days , and had done a deal of damage in switzerland and savoy .
we came to one place where a stream had changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place , sweeping everything before it .
two poor but precious farms by the roadside were ruined .
one was washed clear away , and the <unk> exposed ; the other was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks , gravel , mud , and rubbish .
the resistless might of water was well exemplified .
some saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground , stripped clean of their bark , and buried under <name> debris .
the road had been swept away , too .
in another place , where the road was high up on the mountain 's face , and its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry , we frequently came across spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for mules to get over ; and with still more frequency we found the masonry slightly crumbled , and marked by <unk> , thus showing that there had been danger of an accident to somebody .
when at last we came to a badly ruptured bit of masonry , with <unk> <unk> a desperate struggle to regain the lost foothold , i looked quite hopefully over the dizzy precipice .
but there was nobody down there .
they take exceedingly good care of their rivers in switzerland and other portions of europe .
they wall up both banks with slanting solid stone masonry  so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the wharves at st. <name> and other towns on the mississippi river .
it was during this walk from st. <name> , in the shadow of the majestic alps , that we came across some little children amusing themselves in what seemed , at first , a most odd and original way  but it was n't ; it was in simply a natural and characteristic way .
they were roped together with a string , they had mimic alpenstocks and <unk> , and were climbing a meek and lowly <unk> with a most blood-curdling amount of care and caution .
the " guide " at the head of the line cut imaginary steps , in a laborious and painstaking way , and not a monkey <unk> till the step above was vacated .
if we had waited we should have witnessed an imaginary accident , no doubt ; and we should have heard the intrepid band hurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the " magnificent view , " and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation .
in <name> i used to see the children play at <unk> .
of course , the great thing was an accident in a mine , and there were two " <name> " parts ; that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft , and that of the daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up .
i knew one small chap who always insisted on playing both of these parts  and he carried his point .
he would tumble into the shaft and die , and then come to the surface and go back after his own remains .
it is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere ; he is head guide in switzerland , head miner in <name> , head <unk> in spain , etc .
; but i knew a preacher 's son , seven years old , who once selected a part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame and <unk> .
<name> 's father stopped him from driving imaginary <unk> one <name>  stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary steamboat next <name>  stopped him from leading an imaginary army to battle the following <name>  and so on .
finally the little fellow said : " i 've tried everything , and they wo n't any of them do .
what can i play ? "
" i hardly know , <name> ; but you must play only things that are suitable to the <unk> . "
next <name> the preacher stepped softly to a <unk> door to see if the children were rightly employed .
he peeped in .
a chair occupied the middle of the room , and on the back of it <name> <name> 's cap ; one of his little sisters took the cap down , nibbled at it , then passed it to another small sister and said , " eat of this fruit , for it is good . "
the reverend took in the situation  alas , they were playing the expulsion from <name> !
yet he found one little <unk> of comfort .
he said to himself , " for once <name> has yielded the chief role  i have been <unk> him , i did not believe there was so much modesty in him ; i should have expected him to be either <name> or <name> . "
this <unk> of comfort lasted but a very little while ; he glanced around and discovered <name> standing in an imposing attitude in a corner , with a dark and deadly frown on his face .
what that meant was very plain  he was <unk> the deity !
think of the guileless sublimity of that idea .
we reached <unk> at 8 p.m. , only about seven hours out from st. <name> .
so we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour , and it was all downhill , too , and very muddy at that .
we stayed all night at the hotel de <unk> ; i remember it because the landlady , the portier , the <unk> , and the chambermaid were not separate persons , but were all contained in one neat and <unk> suit of spotless muslin , and she was the prettiest young creature i saw in all that region .
she was the landlord 's daughter .
and i remember that the only native match to her i saw in all europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village inn in the black forest .
why do n't more people in europe marry and keep hotel ?
next morning we left with a family of english friends and went by train to brevet , and thence by boat across the lake to <unk> ( <unk> ) .
<unk> is memorable to me , not on account of its beautiful situation and lovely surroundings  although these would make it stick long in one's memory  but as the place where i caught the london times dropping into humor .
it was not aware of it , though .
it did not do it on purpose .
an english friend called my attention to this lapse , and cut out the reprehensible paragraph for me .
think of encountering a grin like this on the face of that grim journal : <unk>  we are requested by <unk> 's telegram company to correct an erroneous announcement made in their <unk> telegram of the 2d inst. , published in our impression of the 5th inst. , stating that " <name> kennedy had given birth to twins , the eldest being a son . "
the company explain that the message they received contained the words " governor of queensland , twins first son . "
being , however , subsequently informed that sir <name> kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake , a telegraphic repetition was at once demanded .
it has been received today ( 11th <unk> . )
and shows that the words really telegraphed by <unk> agent were " governor queensland turns first sod , " alluding to the <unk> railway in course of construction .
the words in italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from australia , and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the mistake .
i had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of the " prisoner of chillon , " whose story <name> had told in such moving verse ; so i took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the castle of chillon , to see the place where poor <unk> endured his dreary captivity three hundred years ago .
i am glad i did that , for it took away some of the pain i was feeling on the prisoner 's account .
his dungeon was a nice , cool , roomy place , and i can not see why he should have been dissatisfied with it .
if he had been imprisoned in a st. <name> private dwelling , where the <unk> prevails , and the goat sleeps with the guest , and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes in and <unk> him when he wants to muse , it would have been another matter altogether ; but he surely could not have had a very cheerless time of it in that pretty dungeon .
it has romantic <unk> that let in generous bars of light , and it has tall , <name> columns , carved apparently from the living rock ; and what is more , they are written all over with thousands of names ; some of them  like <name> 's and <name> <name> 's  of the first celebrity .
why did n't he amuse himself reading these names ?
then there are the couriers and tourists  swarms of them every day  what was to hinder him from having a good time with them ?
i think <unk> 's sufferings have been overrated .
next , we took the train and went to <unk> , on the way to mont blanc .
next morning we started , about eight o'clock , on foot .
we had plenty of company , in the way of <unk> and <unk> of tourists  and dust .
this scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long .
the road was uphill  interminable uphill  and tolerably steep .
the weather was <unk> hot , and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping mule , or in a crawling wagon , and broil in the beating sun , was an object to be pitied .
we could dodge among the bushes , and have the relief of shade , but those people could not .
they paid for a conveyance , and to get their money 's worth they rode .
we went by the way of the <unk> <unk> , and after we reached high ground there was no lack of fine scenery .
in one place the road was <unk> through a shoulder of the mountain ; from there one looked down into a gorge with a rushing torrent in it , and on every hand was a charming view of <name> buttresses and wooded heights .
there was a liberal allowance of pretty waterfalls , too , on the <unk> <unk> route .
about half an hour before we reached the village of <unk> a vast dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed itself in a strong <unk> gateway of the mountains , and we recognized mont blanc , the " monarch of the alps . "
with every step , after that , this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky , and at last seemed to occupy the zenith .
some of mont blanc 's neighbors  bare , <unk> , <unk> rocks  were very peculiarly shaped .
some were <unk> to a sharp point , and slightly bent at the upper end , like a <name> 's finger ; one monster <unk> resembled a bishop 's hat ; it was too steep to hold snow on its sides , but had some in the division .
while we were still on very high ground , and before the descent toward <unk> began , we looked up toward a neighboring <unk> , and saw exquisite <unk> colors playing about some white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs .
the faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful ; none of the colors were deep , they were the lightest shades .
they were bewitching commingled .
we sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle .
the tints remained during several minutes  flitting , changing , melting into each other ; paling almost away for a moment , then <unk>  a shifting , restless , unstable succession of soft <unk> gleams , shimmering over that air film of white cloud , and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to clothe an <name> with .
by and by we perceived what those <unk> colors , and their continuous play and movement , reminded us of ; it is what one sees in a <unk> that is drifting along , catching changes of tint from the objects it passes .
a <unk> is the most beautiful thing , and the most exquisite , in nature ; that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was suggestive of a <unk> split open , and spread out in the sun .
i wonder how much it would take to buy a <unk> , if there was only one in the world ?
one could buy a hatful of <unk> with the same money , no doubt .
we made the tramp from <unk> to <unk> in eight hours .
we beat all the mules and wagons ; we did n't usually do that .
we hired a sort of open <unk> for the trip down the valley to chamonix , and then devoted an hour to dining .
this gave the driver time to get drunk .
he had a friend with him , and this friend also had had time to get drunk .
when we drove off , the driver said all the tourists had arrived and gone by while we were at dinner ; " but , " said he , impressively , " be not disturbed by that  remain tranquil  give yourselves no uneasiness  their dust rises far before us  rest you tranquil , leave all to me  i am the king of drivers .
behold ! "
down came his whip , and away we clattered .
i never had such a shaking up in my life .
the recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in places , but we never stopped , we never slowed down for anything .
we tore right along , over rocks , rubbish , gullies , open fields  sometimes with one or two wheels on the ground , but generally with none .
every now and then that calm , good-natured madman would bend a majestic look over his shoulder at us and say , " ah , you perceive ?
it is as i have said  i am the king of drivers . "
every time we just missed going to destruction , he would say , with tranquil happiness , " enjoy it , gentlemen , it is very rare , it is very unusual  it is given to few to ride with the king of drivers  and observe , it is as i have said , i am he . "
he spoke in french , and <unk> with <unk> .
his friend was french , too , but spoke in <name>  using the same system of <unk> , however .
the friend called himself the " captain of mont blanc , " and wanted us to make the ascent with him .
he said he had made more <unk> than any other man  forty seven  and his brother had made thirty-seven .
his brother was the best guide in the world , except himself  but he , yes , observe him well  he was the " captain of mont blanc "  that title belonged to none other .
the " king " was as good as his word  he overtook that long procession of tourists and went by it like a hurricane .
the result was that we got <unk> rooms at the hotel in chamonix than we should have done if his majesty had been a slower artist  or rather , if he had n't most <unk> got drunk before he left <unk> .

that is to say , it was <unk>  the half-dozen big diligences would soon be arriving from <name> , and the village was interested , in many ways , in knowing how many people were coming and what sort of folk they might be .
it was altogether the <unk> street we had seen in any village on the continent .
the hotel was by the side of a booming torrent , whose music was loud and strong ; we could not see this torrent , for it was dark , now , but one could locate it without a light .
there was a large enclosed yard in front of the hotel , and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting to see the diligences arrive , or to hire themselves to excursionists for the morrow .
a telescope stood in the yard , with its huge barrel canted up toward the lustrous evening <name> .
the long porch of the hotel was populous with tourists , who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast overshadowing bulk of mont blanc , and <unk> or meditated .
never did a mountain seem so close ; its big sides seemed at one 's very elbow , and its majestic dome , and the lofty cluster of slender <unk> that were its neighbors , seemed to be almost over one 's head .
it was night in the streets , and the lamps were sparkling everywhere ; the broad bases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom , but their summits swam in a strange <name> glow which was really daylight , and yet had a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard white glare of the kind of daylight i was used to .
its radiance was strong and clear , but at the same time it was singularly soft , and spiritual , and benignant .
no , it was not our harsh , aggressive , realistic daylight ; it seemed <unk> to an enchanted land  or to heaven .
i had seen moonlight and daylight together before , but i had not seen daylight and black night elbow to elbow before .
at least i had not seen the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand , before , to make the contrast startling and at war with nature .
the daylight passed away .
presently the moon rose up behind some of those <unk> fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which i have spoken  they were a little to the left of the crest of mont blanc , and right over our heads  but she could n't manage to climb high enough toward heaven to get entirely above them .
she would show the glittering arch of her upper third , occasionally , and scrape it along behind the <unk> row ; sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up , like a <unk> of <name> , against that glittering white shield , then seemed to glide out of it by its own volition and power , and become a dim <unk> , while the next pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with the black <unk> of its presence .
the top of one pinnacle took the shapely , clean-cut form of a rabbit 's head , in the <unk> <unk> , while it rested against the moon .
the <unk> peaks and <unk> , hovering vague and <unk> above us while the others were painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight , made a peculiar effect .
but when the moon , having passed the line of pinnacles , was hidden behind the stupendous white swell of mont blanc , the masterpiece of the evening was flung on the canvas .
a <name> greenish radiance sprang into the sky from behind the mountain , and in this some airy shreds and ribbons of vapor floated about , and being flushed with that strange tint , went waving to and fro like pale green flames .
after a while , radiating bars  vast <unk> <unk> shadows  grew up and stretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain .
it was a spectacle to take one 's breath , for the wonder of it , and the sublimity .
indeed , those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up from behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the dull and opaque heavens , was the most imposing and impressive <name> i had ever looked upon .
there is no simile for it , for nothing is like it .
if a child had asked me what it was , i should have said , " humble yourself , in this presence , it is the <name> flowing from the hidden head of the creator . "
one falls shorter of the truth than that , sometimes , in trying to explain mysteries to the little people .
i could have found out the cause of this <unk> miracle by inquiring , for it is not infrequent at mont blanc ,  but i did not wish to know .
we have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has , because we know how it is made .
we have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter .
we took a walk down street , a block or two , and a place where four streets met and the principal shops were clustered , found the groups of men in the roadway thicker than ever  for this was the exchange of chamonix .
these men were in the costumes of guides and porters , and were there to be hired .
the office of that great personage , the <unk> of the chamonix guild of guides , was near by .
this guild is a close corporation , and is governed by strict laws .
there are many excursion routes , some dangerous and some not , some that can be made safely without a guide , and some that can not .
the bureau determines these things .
where it decides that a guide is necessary , you are forbidden to go without one .
neither are you allowed to be a victim of extortion : the law states what you are to pay .
the guides serve in rotation ; you can not select the man who is to take your life into his hands , you must take the worst in the lot , if it is his turn .
a guide 's fee ranges all the way up from a <unk> ( for some trifling excursion of a few rods ) to twenty dollars , according to the distance traversed and the nature of the ground .
a guide 's fee for taking a person to the summit of mont blanc and back , is twenty dollars  and he earns it .
the time employed is usually three days , and there is enough early rising in it to make a man far more " healthy and wealthy and wise " than any one man has any right to be .
the <unk> fee for the same trip is ten dollars .
several fools  no , i mean several tourists  usually go together , and divide up the expense , and thus make it light ; for if only one f  tourist , i mean  went , he would have to have several guides and porters , and that would make the matter costly .
we went into the chief 's office .
there were maps of mountains on the walls ; also one or two <unk> of celebrated guides , and a portrait of the scientist de <unk> .
in glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and <unk> , and other suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on mount blanc .
in a book was a record of all the <unk> which have ever been made , beginning with nos .
1 and 2  being those of <name> <unk> and de <unk> , in <unk> , and ending with no .
<unk> , which was n't cold yet .
in fact no .
<unk> was standing by the official table waiting to receive the precious official diploma which should prove to his <name> household and to his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to the top of mont blanc .
he looked very happy when he got his document ; in fact , he spoke up and said he was happy .
i tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled , and whose <name> all his life has been to ascend mont blanc , but the <unk> rather insolently refused to sell me one .
i was very much offended .
i said i did not propose to be <unk> against on the account of my nationality ; that he had just sold a diploma to this <name> gentleman , and my money was a good as his ; i would see to it that he could n't keep his shop for germans and deny his produce to americans ; i would have his license taken away from him at the dropping of a handkerchief ; if <name> refused to break him , i would make an international matter of it and bring on a war ; the soil should be drenched with blood ; and not only that , but i would set up an opposition show and sell <unk> at half price .
for two cents i would have done these things , too ; but nobody offered me two cents .
i tried to move that <name> 's feelings , but it could not be done ; he would not give me his diploma , neither would he sell it to me .
i told him my friend was sick and could not come himself , but he said he did not care a <unk> <unk> , he wanted his diploma for himself  did i suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger ?
indeed he would n't , so he would n't .
i resolved , then , that i would do all i could to injure mont blanc .
in the <unk> was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain .
it began with the one in 1820 when the russian dr. <unk> 's three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier , and it recorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the <unk> glacier forty-one years later .
the latest catastrophe bore the date 1877 .
we stepped out and <unk> about the village awhile .
in front of the little church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide <name> <unk> , the first man who ever stood upon the summit of mont blanc .
he made that wild trip solitary and alone .
he accomplished the ascent a number of times afterward .
a stretch of nearly half a century lay between his first ascent and his last one .
at the ripe old age of seventy-two he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the <unk> du <unk>  nobody with him  when he slipped and fell .
so he died in the harness .
he had grown very <unk> in his old age , and used to go off stealthily to hunt for non-existent and impossible gold among those perilous peaks and precipices .
he was on a quest of that kind when he lost his life .
there was a statue to him , and another to de <unk> , in the hall of our hotel , and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs bore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied by <name> smith .
<unk> and de <unk> discovered mont blanc  so to speak  but it was smith who made it a paying property .
his articles in blackwood and his lectures on mont blanc in london advertised it and made people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money .
as we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red <unk> glowing in the darkness of the mountainside .
it seemed but a trifling way up  perhaps a hundred yards , a climb of ten minutes .
it was a lucky piece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and get a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to that lantern to get a light , as had been our purpose .
the man said that that lantern was on the <unk> <unk> , some sixty-five hundred feet above the valley !
i know by our <unk> experience , that it would have taken us a good part of a week to go up there .
i would sooner not smoke at all , than take all that trouble for a light .
even in the daytime the <unk> effect of this mountain 's close proximity creates curious <unk> .
for instance , one sees with the naked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier , and a little above and beyond he sees the spot where that red light was located ; he thinks he could throw a stone from the one place to the other .
but he could n't , for the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand feet .
it looks impossible , from below , that this can be true , but it is true , nevertheless .
while strolling around , we kept the run of the moon all the time , and we still kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico .
i had a theory that the gravitation of <unk> , being <unk> to atmospheric compensation , the <unk> of the earth 's surface would emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges occur , and possibly so <unk> impact the <unk> and <unk> forces together , the one upon the other , as to prevent the moon from rising higher than <unk> feet above sea-level .
this daring theory had been received with frantic scorn by some of my <unk> , and with an eager silence by others .
among the former i may mention prof. h   y ; and among the latter prof. t   l. such is professional jealousy ; a scientist <name> never show any kindness for a theory which he did not start himself .
there is no feeling of brotherhood among these people .
indeed , they always resent it when i call them brother .
to show how far their <unk> can <name> them , i <name> state that i offered to let prof. h   y publish my great theory as his own discovery ; i even begged him to do it ; i even proposed to print it myself as his theory .
instead of thanking me , he said that if i tried to fasten that theory on him he would <name> me for slander .
i was going to offer it to mr. <name> , whom i understood to be a man without prejudices , but it occurred to me that perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern <unk> .
but i am glad now , that i was forced to father my intrepid theory myself , for , on the night of which i am writing , it was triumphantly justified and established .
mont blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet high ; he hid the moon utterly ; near him is a peak which is <unk> feet high ; the moon slid along behind the pinnacles , and when she approached that one i watched her with intense interest , for my reputation as a scientist must stand or fall by its decision .
i can not describe the emotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when i saw the moon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more than two feet four inches of her upper rim above it ; i was secure , then .
i knew she could rise no higher , and i was right .
she sailed behind all the peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of them .
while the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers , its shadow was flung athwart the vacant heavens  a long , slanting , clean-cut , dark <name>  with a streaming and energetic suggestion of force about it , such as the ascending jet of water from a powerful <unk> affords .
it was curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon so <unk> a field as the atmosphere .
we went to bed , at last , and went quickly to sleep , but i woke up , after about three hours , with throbbing temples , and a head which was physically sore , outside and in .
i was dazed , dreamy , wretched , seedy , <unk> .
i recognized the occasion of all this : it was that torrent .
in the mountain villages of switzerland , and along the roads , one has always the roar of the torrent in his ears .
he imagines it is music , and he thinks poetic things about it ; he lies in his comfortable bed and is lulled to sleep by it .
but by and by he begins to notice that his head is very sore  he can not account for it ; in solitudes where the profoundest silence reigns , he notices a sullen , distant , continuous roar in his ears , which is like what he would experience if he had sea-shells pressed against them  he can not account for it ; he is drowsy and absent-minded ; there is no tenacity to his mind , he can not keep hold of a thought and follow it out ; if he sits down to write , his vocabulary is empty , no suitable words <name> come , he forgets what he started to do , and remains there , pen in hand , head tilted up , eyes closed , listening painfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears ; in his soundest sleep the strain continues , he goes on listening , always listening intently , anxiously , and wakes at last , harassed , irritable , <unk> .
he can not manage to account for these things .
day after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleeping-car .
it actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting torrents that have been making all the mischief .
it is time for him to get out of switzerland , then , for as soon as he has discovered the cause , the misery is magnified several fold .
the roar of the torrent is maddening , then , for his imagination is assisting ; the physical pain it <unk> is exquisite .
when he finds he is approaching one of those streams , his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and avoid the implacable foe .
eight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed from me , the roar and thunder of the streets of <name> brought it all back again .
i moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace .
about midnight the noises dulled away , and i was sinking to sleep , when i heard a new and curious sound ; i listened : evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a " double shuffle " in the room over my head .
i had to wait for him to get through , of course .
five long , long minutes he smoothly shuffled away  a pause followed , then something fell with a thump on the floor .
i said to myself " there  he is pulling off his boots  thank heavens he is done . "
another slight pause  he went to shuffling again !
i said to myself , " is he trying to see what he can do with only one boot on ? "
presently came another pause and another thump on the floor .
i said " good , he has pulled off his other boot  now he is done . "
but he was n't .
the next moment he was shuffling again .
i said , " confound him , he is at it in his slippers ! "
after a little came that same old pause , and right after it that thump on the floor once more .
i said , " <name> him , he had on two pair of boots ! "
for an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twenty-five pair , and i was hovering on the verge of lunacy .
i got my gun and stole up there .
the fellow was in the midst of an acre of sprawling boots , and he had a boot in his hand , shuffling it  no , i mean polishing it .
the mystery was explained .
he had n't been dancing .
he was the " boots " of the hotel , and was attending to business .
chapter <unk> [ i scale mont blanc  by telescope ] after breakfast , that next morning in chamonix , we went out in the yard and watched the gangs of <unk> tourists arriving and departing with their mules and guides and porters ; then we took a look through the telescope at the snowy hump of mont blanc .
it was brilliant with <name> , and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards away .
with the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the <name> <unk> , which is located by the side of the great glacier , and is more than three thousand feet above the level of the valley ; but with the telescope we could see all its details .
while i looked , a woman rode by the house on a mule , and i saw her with sharp distinctness ; i could have described her dress .
i saw her nod to the people of the house , and rein up her mule , and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun .
i was not used to telescopes ; in fact , i had never looked through a good one before ; it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away .
i was satisfied that i could see all these details with my naked eye ; but when i tried it , that mule and those vivid people had wholly vanished , and the house itself was become small and vague .
i tried the telescope again , and again everything was vivid .
the strong black shadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the house , and i saw the mule 's <unk> wave its ears .
the <unk>  or the <unk>  i do not know which is right  said a party were making a grand ascent , and would come in sight on the remote upper heights , presently ; so we waited to observe this performance .
presently i had a superb idea .
i wanted to stand with a party on the summit of mont blanc , merely to be able to say i had done it , and i believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the uppermost man .
the <unk> assured me that it could .
i then asked him how much i owed him for as far as i had got ?
he said , one franc .
i asked him how much it would cost to make the entire ascent ?
three francs .
i at once determined to make the entire ascent .
but first i inquired if there was any danger ?
he said no  not by telescope ; said he had taken a great many parties to the summit , and never lost a man .
i asked what he would charge to let my agent go with me , together with such guides and porters as might be necessary .
he said he would let <name> go for two francs ; and that unless we were unusually timid , he should consider guides and porters unnecessary ; it was not customary to take them , when going by telescope , for they were rather an <unk> than a help .
he said that the party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part , and if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes , and could then join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without their knowledge , and without expense to us .
i then said we would start immediately .
i believe i said it calmly , though i was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek , in view of the nature of the exploit i was so <unk> engaged in .
but the old <unk> spirit was upon me , and i said that as i had committed myself i would not back down ; i would ascend mont blanc if it cost me my life .
i told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and let us be off .
<name> was afraid and did not want to go , but i <unk> him up and said i would hold his hand all the way ; so he gave his consent , though he trembled a little at first .
i took a last pathetic look upon the pleasant summer scene about me , then boldly put my eye to the glass and prepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows .
we took our way carefully and cautiously across the great glacier des <unk> , over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags and buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic proportions .
the desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was wild and desolate beyond description , and the perils which beset us were so great that at times i was minded to turn back .
but i pulled my pluck together and pushed on .
we passed the glacier safely and began to mount the <unk> beyond , with great alacrity .
when we were seven minutes out from the <unk> , we reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect ; an apparently limitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our faces .
as my eye followed that awful <unk> far away up into the remote skies , it seemed to me that all i had ever seen before of sublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this .
we rested a moment , and then began to mount with speed .
within three minutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us , and stopped to observe them .
they were toiling up a long , slanting ridge of snow  twelve persons , roped together some fifteen feet apart , marching in single file , and strongly marked against the clear blue sky .
one was a woman .
we could see them lift their feet and put them down ; we saw them swing their alpenstocks forward in unison , like so many <unk> , and then bear their weight upon them ; we saw the <name> wave her handkerchief .
they dragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way , for they had been climbing steadily from the grand <unk> , on the glacier des <unk> , since three in the morning , and it was eleven , now .
we saw them sink down in the snow and rest , and drink something from a bottle .
after a while they moved on , and as they approached the final short dash of the <unk> we closed up on them and joined them .
presently we all stood together on the summit !
what a view was spread out below !
away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent billows of the <unk> <unk> , their snowy crests glinting softly in the subdued lights of distance ; in the north rose the giant form of the <unk> , draped from peak to shoulder in sable <unk> ; beyond him , to the right , stretched the grand <unk> summits of the <unk> cordillera , drowned in a <unk> haze ; to the east loomed the colossal masses of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , their cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun ; beyond them <unk> the faint far line of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> des <unk> ; in the south towered the smoking peak of <unk> and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless <unk> ; in the <unk> the stately range of the himalayas lay dreaming in a purple gloom ; and thence all around the curving horizon the eye <unk> over a troubled sea of <unk> alps , and noted , here and there , the <name> proportions and the soaring domes of the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , all bathed in the <name> of noon and mottled with softly gliding <unk> , the shadows flung from drifting clouds .
overcome by the scene , we all raised a triumphant , tremendous shout , in unison .
a startled man at my elbow said : " confound you , what do you yell like that for , right here in the street ? "
that brought me down to chamonix , like a flirt .
i gave that man some spiritual advice and disposed of him , and then paid the telescope man his full fee , and said that we were charmed with the trip and would remain down , and not <unk> and require him to fetch us down by telescope .
this pleased him very much , for of course we could have stepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us home if we wanted to .
i judged we could get <unk> , now , anyhow ; so we went after them , but the chief guide put us off , with one pretext or another , during all the time we stayed in chamonix , and we ended by never getting them at all .
so much for his prejudice against people 's nationality .
however , we worried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some time .
he even said , once , that he wished there was a lunatic asylum in chamonix .
this shows that he really had fears that we were going to drive him mad .
it was what we intended to do , but lack of time defeated it .
i can not venture to advise the reader one way or the other , as to ascending mont blanc .
i say only this : if he is at all timid , the enjoyments of the trip <name> hardly make up for the hardships and sufferings he <name> have to endure .
but , if he has good nerve , youth , health , and a bold , firm <name> , and could leave his family comfortably provided for in case the worst happened , he would find the ascent a wonderful experience , and the view from the top a vision to dream about , and tell about , and recall with exultation all the days of his life .
while i do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent , i do not advise him against it .
but if he <unk> to attempt it , let him be warily careful of two things : chose a calm , clear day ; and do not pay the telescope man in advance .
there are dark stories of his getting advance <unk> on the summit and then leaving them there to rot .
a frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the chamonix telescopes .
think of questions and answers like these , on an inquest : coroner .
you saw deceased lose his life ?
witness .
i did .
c. where was he , at the time ?
w. close to the summit of mont blanc .
c. where were you ?
w. in the main street of chamonix .
c. what was the distance between you ?
w. a little over five miles , as the bird flies .
this accident occurred in 1866 , a year and a month after the disaster on the matterhorn .
three adventurous english gentlemen , [ 1 ] of great experience in <unk> , made up their minds to ascend mont blanc without guides or porters .
all endeavors to dissuade them from their project failed .
powerful telescopes are numerous in chamonix .
these huge brass tubes , mounted on their <unk> and pointed skyward from every choice <unk> , have the formidable look of artillery , and give the town the general aspect of getting ready to repel a charge of angels .
the reader may easily believe that the telescopes had plenty of custom on that <name> morning in 1866 , for everybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot , and all had fears that misfortune would result .
all the morning the tubes remained directed toward the mountain heights , each with its anxious group around it ; but the white deserts were vacant .
1 .
sir <name> young and his brothers <name> and <name> .
at last , toward eleven o'clock , the people who were looking through the telescopes cried out " there they are ! "
 and sure enough , far up , on the loftiest terraces of the grand plateau , the three <unk> appeared , climbing with remarkable vigor and spirit .
they disappeared in the " corridor , " and were lost to sight during an hour .
then they reappeared , and were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit of mont blanc .
so , all was well .
they remained a few minutes on that highest point of land in europe , a target for all the telescopes , and were then seen to begin descent .
suddenly all three vanished .
an instant after , they appeared again , two thousand feet below !
evidently , they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular slope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier .
naturally , the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three corpses ; so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw two of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third .
during two hours and a half they watched the two <unk> themselves over the extended form of their brother , who seemed entirely inert .
<unk> affairs stood still ; everybody was in the street , all interest was centered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage five miles away .
finally the two  one of them walking with great difficulty  were seen to begin descent , abandoning the third , who was no doubt lifeless .
their movements were followed , step by step , until they reached the " corridor " and disappeared behind its ridge .
before they had had time to traverse the " corridor " and reappear , twilight was come , and the power of the telescope was at an end .
the survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering darkness , for they must get down to the <unk> <unk> before they would find a safe <unk>  a long and tedious descent , and perilous enough even in good daylight .
the oldest guides expressed the opinion that they could not succeed ; that all the chances were that they would lose their lives .
yet those brave men did succeed .
they reached the <unk> <unk> in safety .
even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not sufficient to overcome their coolness and courage .
it would appear from the official account that they were threading their way down through those dangers from the closing in of twilight until two o'clock in the morning , or later , because the rescuing party from chamonix reached the grand <unk> about three in the morning and moved thence toward the scene of the disaster under the leadership of sir <name> young , " who had only just arrived . "
after having been on his feet twenty-four hours , in the exhausting work of <unk> , sir <name> began the <unk> at the head of the relief party of six guides , to recover the corpse of his brother .
this was considered a new <unk> , as the number was too few for the service required .
another relief party presently arrived at the cabin on the <unk> <unk> and quartered themselves there to await events .
ten hours after sir <name> 's departure toward the summit , this new relief were still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high perch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the sea , but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living thing appearing up there .
this was alarming .
half a dozen of their number set out , then early in the afternoon , to seek and succor sir <name> and his guides .
the persons remaining at the cabin saw these disappear , and then ensued another distressing wait .
four hours passed , without tidings .
then at five o'clock another relief , consisting of three guides , set forward from the cabin .
they carried food and <unk> for the refreshment of their predecessors ; they took lanterns with them , too ; night was coming on , and to make matters worse , a fine , cold rain had begun to fall .
at the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent , the official <unk> of the mont blanc region undertook the dangerous descent to chamonix , all alone , to get reinforcements .
however , a couple of hours later , at 7 p.m. , the anxious solicitude came to an end , and happily .
a bugle note was heard , and a cluster of black specks was distinguishable against the snows of the upper heights .
the watchers counted these specks eagerly  fourteen  nobody was missing .
an hour and a half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin .
they had brought the corpse with them .
sir <name> young tarried there but a few minutes , and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin to chamonix .
he probably reached there about two or three o'clock in the morning , after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two days and two nights .
his endurance was equal to his daring .
the cause of the unaccountable delay of sir <name> and the relief parties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick fog  or , partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying the dead body down the perilous <unk> .
the corpse , upon being viewed at the inquest , showed no bruises , and it was some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken .
one of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries , but the other had suffered no hurt at all .
how these men could fall two thousand feet , almost perpendicularly , and live afterward , is a most strange and unaccountable thing .
a great many women have made the ascent of mont blanc .
an english girl , miss <unk> , conceived the daring idea , two or three years ago , of attempting the ascent in the middle of <name> .
she tried it  and she succeeded .
moreover , she froze two of her fingers on the way up , she fell in love with her guide on the summit , and she married him when she got to the bottom again .
there is nothing in romance , in the way of a striking " situation , " which can beat this love scene in <unk> on an isolated <unk> with the thermometer at zero and an <unk> <name> blowing .
the first woman who ascended mont blanc was a girl aged twenty-two  <unk> .
<name> <unk>  1809 .
nobody was with her but her sweetheart , and he was not a guide .
the sex then took a rest for about thirty years , when a <unk> .
<unk> made the ascent  1838 .
in chamonix i picked up a rude old <unk> of that day which pictured her " in the act . "
however , i value it less as a work of <name> than as a <unk> .
miss <unk> put on a pair of men 's pantaloons to climb it , which was wise ; but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat , which was idiotic .
one of the <unk> calamities which men 's disposition to climb dangerous mountains has resulted in , happened on mont blanc in <name> 1870 .
m. <unk> tells the story briefly in his <unk> du mont blanc .
in the next chapter i <name> copy its chief features .
chapter <unk> a catastrophe which cost eleven lives on the 5th of <name> , 1870 , a caravan of eleven persons departed from chamonix to make the ascent of mont blanc .
three of the party were tourists ; messrs. <name> and bean , americans , and mr. <name> <unk> , a scotch gentleman ; there were three guides and five porters .
the cabin on the <unk> <unk> was reached that day ; the ascent was resumed early the next morning , <name> 6th .
the day was fine and clear , and the movements of the party were observed through the telescopes of chamonix ; at two o'clock in the afternoon they were seen to reach the summit .
a few minutes later they were seen making the first steps of the descent ; then a cloud closed around them and hid them from view .
eight hours passed , the cloud still remained , night came , no one had returned to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , keeper of the cabin there , suspected a misfortune , and sent down to the valley for help .
a detachment of guides went up , but by the time they had made the tedious trip and reached the cabin , a raging storm had set in .
they had to wait ; nothing could be attempted in such a tempest .
the wild storm lasted more than a week , without ceasing ; but on the 17th , <unk> , with several guides , left the cabin and succeeded in making the ascent .
in the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon five bodies , lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there , while exhausted with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold , and never knew when death stole upon them .
<unk> moved a few steps further and discovered five more bodies .
the eleventh corpse  that of a <name>  was not found , although diligent search was made for it .
in the pocket of mr. bean , one of the americans , was found a note-book in which had been <unk> some sentences which admit us , in flesh and spirit , as it were , to the presence of these men during their last hours of life , and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon and their failing consciousness took cognizance of : tuesday , sept. 6 .
i have made the ascent of mont blanc , with ten persons  eight guides , and mr. <unk> and mr. <name> .
we reached the summit at half past 2 .
immediately after quitting it , we were enveloped in clouds of snow .
we passed the night in a grotto hollowed in the snow , which afforded us but poor shelter , and i was ill all night .
sept. 7  morning .
the cold is excessive .
the snow falls heavily and without interruption .
the guides take no rest .
evening .
my dear <unk> , we have been two days on mont blanc , in the midst of a terrible hurricane of snow , we have lost our way , and are in a hole scooped in the snow , at an altitude of 15,000 feet .
i have no longer any <name> of descending .
they had wandered around , and around , in the blinding snow-storm , hopelessly lost , in a space only a hundred yards square ; and when cold and fatigue vanquished them at last , they scooped their cave and lay down there to die by inches , unaware that five steps more would have brought them into the truth path .
they were so near to life and safety as that , and did not suspect it .
the thought of this gives the sharpest pang that the tragic story conveys .
the author of the <unk> du mont blanc introduced the closing sentences of mr. bean 's pathetic record thus : " here the characters are large and unsteady ; the hand which traces them is become chilled and torpid ; but the spirit <unk> , and the <name> and resignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity . "
perhaps this note-book <name> be found and sent to you .
we have nothing to eat , my feet are already frozen , and i am exhausted ; i have strength to write only a few words more .
i have left means for c 's education ; i know you <name> employ them wisely .
i die with <name> in god , and with loving thoughts of you .
farewell to all .
we shall meet again , in heaven .
...
i think of you always .
it is the way of the alps to deliver death to their victims with a merciful swiftness , but here the rule failed .
these men suffered the bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those mountains , freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies .
chapter <unk> [ meeting a hog on a precipice ] mr. <name> and i took some guides and porters and ascended to the hotel des <unk> , which is perched on the high moraine which borders the glacier des <unk> .
the road led sharply uphill , all the way , through grass and flowers and woods , and was a pleasant walk , barring the fatigue of the climb .
from the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range .
after a rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner frontage of the moraine , and stepped upon the glacier itself .
one of the shows of the place was a <unk> cavern , which had been hewn in the glacier .
the proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us into it .
it was three or four feet wide and about six feet high .
its walls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and <name> blue light that produced a lovely effect , and suggested enchanted caves , and that sort of thing .
when we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness , we turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and heights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the tender blue radiance of the tunnel 's atmosphere .
the cavern was nearly a hundred yards long , and when we reached its inner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles and left us buried in the bowels of the glacier , and in <unk> .
we judged his purpose was murder and robbery ; so we got out our matches and prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the glacier on fire if the worst came to the worst  but we soon perceived that this man had changed his mind ; he began to sing , in a deep , melodious voice , and woke some curious and pleasing echoes .
by and by he came back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for .
we believed as much of that as we wanted to .
thus our lives had been once more in imminent peril , but by the exercise of the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often , we had added another escape to the long list .
the tourist should visit that <unk> , by all means , for it is well worth the trouble ; but i would advise him to go only with a strong and <unk> force .
i do not consider artillery necessary , yet it would not be <unk> to take it along , if convenient .
the journey , going and coming , is about three miles and a half , three of which are on level ground .
we made it in less than a day , but i would counsel the <unk>  if not pressed for time  to allow themselves two .
nothing is gained in the alps by <unk> ; nothing is gained by crowding two days ' work into one for the poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward .
it <name> be found much better , in the long run , to do the thing in two days , and then <unk> one of them from the narrative .
this saves fatigue , and does not injure the narrative .
all the more thoughtful among the alpine tourists do this .
we now called upon the <unk> , and asked for a squadron of guides and porters for the ascent of the <unk> .
this idiot glared at us , and said : " you do n't need guides and porters to go to the <unk> . "
" what do we need , then ? "
" such as you ?  an ambulance ! "
i was so stung by this brutal remark that i took my custom elsewhere .
<unk> , next morning , we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the sea .
here we camped and breakfasted .
there was a cabin there  the spot is called the <unk>  and a spring of <unk> water .
on the door of the cabin was a sign , in french , to the effect that " one may here see a living chamois for fifty <unk> . "
we did not invest ; what we wanted was to see a dead one .
a little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on the <unk> , and had a view of six miles , right up the great glacier , the famous mer de <unk> .
at this point it is like a sea whose deep <unk> and long , rolling swells have been caught in <unk> and frozen solid ; but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows of ice .
we descended a <unk> path in the steep side of the moraine , and invaded the glacier .
there were tourists of both sexes scattered far and wide over it , everywhere , and it had the festive look of a <unk> .
the empress <name> came this far , once .
she ascended the <unk> in <unk>  but not alone ; a small army of men preceded her to clear the path  and carpet it , perhaps  and she followed , under the protection of sixty-eight guides .
her successor visited chamonix later , but in far different style .
it was seven weeks after the first fall of the empire , and poor <name> <name> , <unk> was a fugitive .
she came at night , and in a storm , with only two attendants , and stood before a peasant 's hut , tired , <unk> , soaked with rain , " the red print of her lost crown still <unk> her brow , " and implored admittance  and was refused !
a few days before , the <unk> and <unk> of a nation were sounding in her ears , and now she was come to this !
we crossed the mer de <unk> in safety , but we had misgivings .
the crevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious , and it made one nervous to traverse them .
the huge round waves of ice were slippery and difficult to climb , and the chances of tripping and sliding down them and darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable .
in the bottom of a deep <unk> between two of the biggest of the <unk> , we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure the safety of tourists .
he was " soldiering " when we came upon him , but he hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a cat , and charged us a franc or two for it .
then he sat down again , to doze till the next party should come along .
he had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already , that day , but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier perceptibly .
i have heard of a good many soft <unk> , but it seems to me that keeping <unk> on a glacier is the softest one i have encountered yet .
that was a blazing hot day , and it brought a persistent and persecuting thirst with it .
what an unspeakable luxury it was to <unk> that thirst with the pure and limpid ice-water of the glacier !
down the sides of every great rib of pure ice poured limpid <unk> in gutters carved by their own attrition ; better still , wherever a rock had lain , there was now a <unk> hole , with smooth white sides and bottom of ice , and this bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the careless observer would not see it at all , but would think the bowl was empty .
these fountains had such an alluring look that i often stretched myself out when i was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till my teeth ached .
everywhere among the swiss mountains we had at hand the blessing  not to be found in europe except in the mountains  of water capable of <unk> thirst .
everywhere in the swiss highlands brilliant little <unk> of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the <unk> , and my comrade and i were always drinking and always delivering our deep gratitude .
but in europe everywhere except in the mountains , the water is flat and insipid beyond the power of words to describe .
it is served <unk> ; but no matter , ice could not help it ; it is <unk> flat , <unk> insipid .
it is only good to wash with ; i wonder it does n't occur to the average inhabitant to try it for that .
in europe the people say contemptuously , " nobody drinks water here . "
indeed , they have a sound and sufficient reason .
in many places they even have what may be called <unk> reasons .
in <name> and munich , for instance , they say , " don't drink the water , it is simply poison . "
either <name> is <unk> than europe , notwithstanding her " deadly " indulgence in ice-water , or she does not keep the run of her death-rate as sharply as europe does .
i think we do keep up the death statistics accurately ; and if we do , our cities are <unk> than the cities of europe .
every month the <name> government <unk> the death-rate of the world and <unk> it .
i <unk> these reports during several months , and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death-rate month after month .
the tables might as well have been <unk> , they varied so little .
these tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000 population for a year .
munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1,000 of her population ( yearly average ) , chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17 , dublin with her 48  and so on .
only a few american cities appear in these tables , but they are scattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general average of city health in the united states ; and i think it <name> be granted that our towns and villages are <unk> than our cities .
here is the average of the only american cities reported in the <name> tables : chicago , deaths in 1,000 population annually , 16 ; philadelphia , 18 ; st. <name> , 18 ; san <name> , 19 ; new york ( the dublin of <name> ) , 23 .
see how the figures jump up , as soon as one arrives at the <unk> list : <name> , 27 ; glasgow , 27 ; london , 28 ; vienna , 28 ; <unk> , 28 ; <unk> , 28 ; <unk> , 29 ; cologne , 29 ; dresden , 29 ; hamburg , 29 ; berlin , 30 ; bombay , 30 ; <unk> , 31 ; breslau , 31 ; <name> , 32 ; munich , 33 ; <unk> , 33 , <unk> , 35 ; <unk> , 35 ; lisbon , 36 ; liverpool , 36 ; <unk> , 37 ; madras , 37 ; <unk> , 39 ; st. petersburg , 40 ; <unk> , 40 ; <name> ( egypt ) , 43 ; dublin , 48 ; calcutta , 55 .
edinburgh is as healthy as new york  23 ; but there is no city in the entire list which is <unk> , except <unk>  20 .
but frankfort is not as healthy as chicago , san <name> , st. <name> , or philadelphia .
perhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where one in 1,000 of <name> 's population dies , two in 1,000 of the other populations of the earth succumb .
i do not like to make insinuations , but i do think the above statistics darkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water " on the sly . "
we climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier , and then crept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so , in pretty constant danger of a tumble to the glacier below .
the fall would have been only one hundred feet , but it would have closed me out as effectually as one thousand , therefore i respected the distance accordingly , and was glad when the trip was done .
a moraine is an ugly thing to assault <unk> .
at a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand , accurately shaped and nicely smoothed ; but close by , it is found to be made mainly of rough boulders of all sizes , from that of a man 's head to that of a cottage .
by and by we came to the <unk> pas , or the villainous road , to translate it feelingly .
it was a breakneck path around the face of a precipice forty or fifty feet high , and nothing to <name> on to but some iron railings .
i got along , slowly , safely , and uncomfortably , and finally reached the middle .
my hopes began to rise a little , but they were quickly blighted ; for there i met a hog  a <unk> , bristly fellow , that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me inquiringly .
a hog on a pleasure excursion in switzerland  think of it !
it is striking and unusual ; a body might write a poem about it .
he could not retreat , if he had been disposed to do it .
it would have been foolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room to stand upon our feet , so we did nothing of the sort .
there were twenty or thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us ; we all turned about and went back , and the hog followed behind .
the creature did not seem set up by what he had done ; he had probably done it before .
we reached the restaurant on the height called the <unk> at four in the afternoon .
it was a <unk> , and the stock was large , cheap , and varied .
i bought the usual <unk> to remember the place by , and had mont blanc , the <unk> pas , and the rest of the region branded on my alpenstock ; then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together .
this was not dangerous , for the valley was five miles wide , and quite level .
we reached the hotel before nine o'clock .
next morning we left for <name> on top of the diligence , under shelter of a <name> awning .
if i remember rightly , there were more than twenty people up there .
it was so high that the ascent was made by ladder .
the huge vehicle was full everywhere , inside and out .
five other diligences left at the same time , all full .
we had engaged our seats two days beforehand , to make sure , and paid the regulation price , five dollars each ; but the rest of the company were wiser ; they had trusted baedeker , and waited ; consequently some of them got their seats for one or two dollars .
baedeker knows all about hotels , railway and diligence companies , and speaks his mind freely .
he is a trustworthy friend of the traveler .
we never saw mont blanc at his best until we were many miles away ; then he lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens , all white and cold and solemn , and made the rest of the world seem little and plebeian , and cheap and trivial .
as he passed out of sight at last , an old englishman settled himself in his seat and said : " well , i am satisfied , i have seen the principal features of swiss scenery  mont blanc and the <unk>  now for home ! "
chapter <unk> [ queer european manners ] we spent a few pleasant restful days at <name> , that delightful city where accurate <unk> are made for all the rest of the world , but whose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident .
<name> is filled with pretty shops , and the shops are filled with the most enticing <unk> , but if one enters one of these places he is at once pounced upon , and followed up , and so persecuted to buy this , that , and the other thing , that he is very grateful to get out again , and is not at all apt to repeat his experiment .
the shopkeepers of the smaller sort , in <name> , are as troublesome and persistent as are the <unk> of that monster hive in <name> , the <unk> <unk> du louvre  an establishment where <unk> <unk> , pursuing , and <unk> have been reduced to a science .
in <name> , prices in the smaller shops are very elastic  that is another bad feature .
i was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads , suitable for a child .
i was only admiring them ; i had no use for them ; i hardly ever wear beads .
the <unk> came out and offered them to me for thirty-five francs .
i said it was cheap , but i did not need them .
" ah , but monsieur , they are so beautiful ! "
i confessed it , but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character .
she darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands , saying : " ah , but only see how lovely they are !
surely monsieur <name> take them ; monsieur shall have them for thirty francs .
there , i have said it  it is a loss , but one must live . "
i dropped my hands , and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation .
but no , she dangled the beads in the sun before my face , exclaiming , " ah , monsieur can not resist them ! "
she <name> them on my coat button , folded her hand resignedly , and said : " gone ,  and for thirty francs , the lovely things  it is incredible !  but the good god <name> <unk> the sacrifice to me . "
i removed them gently , returned them , and walked away , shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe .
the woman leaned out of her door , shook the beads , and screamed after me : " monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight ! "
i shook my head .
" twenty-seven !
it is a cruel loss , it is ruin  but take them , only take them . "
i still retreated , still wagging my head .
" mon dieu , they shall even go for twenty-six !
there , i have said it .
come ! "
i wagged another negative .
a nurse and a little english girl had been near me , and were following me , now .
the <unk> ran to the nurse , thrust the beads into her hands , and said : " monsieur shall have them for twenty-five !
take them to the hotel  he shall send me the money tomorrow  next day  when he likes . "
then to the child : " when thy father sends me the money , come thou also , my <name> , and thou shall have something oh so pretty ! "
i was thus <unk> saved .
the nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly , and that ended the matter .
the " sights " of <name> are not numerous .
i made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people , <unk> and <name> , but i had no success .
then i concluded to go home .
i found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it ; for that town is a bewildering place .
i got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets , and stayed lost for an hour or two .
finally i found a street which looked somewhat familiar , and said to myself , " now i am at home , i judge . "
but i was wrong ; this was " hell street . "
presently i found another place which had a familiar look , and said to myself , " now i am at home , sure . "
it was another error .
this was " purgatory street . "
after a little i said , " now i 've got the right place , anyway ... no , this is <unk> street ' ; i 'm further from home than i was in the beginning . "
those were queer names  <name> was the author of them , likely .
" hell " and " purgatory " fitted those two streets like a glove , but the " paradise " appeared to be sarcastic .
i came out on the <unk> , at last , and then i knew where i was .
i was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when i saw a curious performance .
a <name> passed by , and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him ; he made no offer to step out of the way ; he did not apologize ; he did not even notice her .
she had to stop still and let him lounge by .
i wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely .
he strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table ; two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water .
i waited ; presently a youth came by , and this fellow got up and served him the same trick .
still , it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately .
to satisfy my curiosity i went around the block , and , sure enough , as i approached , at a good round speed , he got up and lounged lazily across my path , <unk> my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight .
this proved that his previous performances had not been accidental , but intentional .
i saw that dandy 's curious game played afterward , in <name> , but not for amusement ; not with a motive of any sort , indeed , but simply from a selfish indifference to other people 's comfort and rights .
one does not see it as frequently in <name> as he might expect to , for there the law says , in effect , " it is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong . "
we fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen ; <name> fines the citizen for being run over .
at least so everybody says  but i saw something which caused me to doubt ; i saw a horseman run over an old woman one day  the police arrested him and took him away .
that looked as if they meant to punish him .
it <name> not do for me to find merit in american manners  for are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished europe ?
still , i must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners ; a <name> may traverse our streets all day , going and coming as she chooses , and she <name> never be molested by any man ; but if a <name> , unattended , walks abroad in the streets of london , even at noonday , she <name> be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted  and not by drunken sailors , but by men who <name> the look and wear the dress of gentlemen .
it is maintained that these people are not gentlemen , but are a lower sort , disguised as gentlemen .
the case of colonel <name> baker <unk> that argument , for a man can not become an officer in the british army except he hold the rank of gentleman .
this person , finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl  but it is an atrocious story , and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough .
london must have been more or less accustomed to <unk> , and the ways of <unk> , else london would have been offended and excited .
baker was " imprisoned "  in a parlor ; and he could not have been more visited , or more overwhelmed with attentions , if he had committed six murders and then  while the gallows was preparing  " got religion "  after the manner of the holy <name> peace , of saintly memory .
arkansaw  it seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own <unk> , and comparisons are always odious , but still  arkansaw would certainly have hanged baker .
i do not say she would have tried him first , but she would have hanged him , anyway .
even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested , her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection .
she <name> encounter less polish than she would in the old world , but she <name> run across enough humanity to make up for it .
the music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning , and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk  to italy ; but the road was so level that we took the <unk> we lost a good deal of time by this , but it was no matter , we were not in a hurry .
we were four hours going to <unk> .
the swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour , in places , but they are quite safe .
that aged french town of <unk> was as quaint and crooked as <unk> .
a drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant , barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun .
in one of these streets , which was eight feet wide , gracefully curved , and built up with small <unk> houses , i saw three fat hogs lying asleep , and a boy ( also asleep ) taking care of them .
from queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers , and over the edge of one of these boxes <name> the head and shoulders of a cat  asleep .
the five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street .
there was not a sound ; absolute stillness prevailed .
it was <name> ; one is not used to such dreamy sundays on the continent .
in our part of the town it was different that night .
a regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from algiers , and i judged they got thirsty on the way .
they sang and drank till <name> , in the pleasant open air .
we left for <unk> at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels .
we forgot to take a lantern along , consequently we missed all the scenery .
our compartment was full .
a ponderous <unk> swiss woman , who put on many <unk> airs , but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it , sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one , <unk> them <unk> with her <unk> valise .
in the seat thus <unk> , sat two americans , greatly <unk> by that woman 's majestic <unk> feet .
one of them begged , politely , to remove them .
she opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare , but answered nothing .
by and by he <unk> his request again , with great <unk> .
she said , in good english , and in a deeply offended tone , that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her " rights " by <unk> foreigners , even if she was alone and unprotected .
" but i have rights , also , madam .
my ticket <unk> me to a seat , but you are occupying half of it . "
" i <name> not talk with you , sir .
what right have you to speak to me ?
i do not know you .
one would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen .
no gentleman would treat a <name> as you have treated me . "
" i come from a region where a <name> would hardly give me the same provocation . "
" you have insulted me , sir !
you have intimated that i am not a <name>  and i <name> i am not one , after the pattern of your country . "
" i beg that you <name> give yourself no alarm on that head , madam ; but at the same time i must insist  always respectfully  that you let me have my seat . "
here the fragile <unk> burst into tears and sobs .
" i never was so insulted before !
never , never !
it is shameful , it is brutal , it is base , to bully and abuse an unprotected <name> who has lost the use of her limbs and can not put her feet to the floor without agony ! "
" good heavens , madam , why did n't you say that at first !
i offer a thousand pardons .
and i offer them most sincerely .
i did not know  i could not know  anything was the matter .
you are most welcome to the seat , and would have been from the first if i had only known .
i am truly sorry it all happened , i do assure you . "
but he could n't get a word of forgiveness out of her .
she simply sobbed and sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours , meantime crowding the man more than ever with her <unk> and paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little efforts to do something for her comfort .
then the train halted at the italian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a leg as any <unk> of all her tribe !
and how sick i was , to see how she had fooled me .
<unk> is a very fine city .
in the matter of <unk> it transcends anything that was ever dreamed of before , i fancy .
it sits in the midst of a vast <unk> , and one is obliged to imagine that land may be had for the asking , and no taxes to pay , so lavishly do they use it .
the streets are extravagantly wide , the paved squares are prodigious , the houses are huge and handsome , and compacted into uniform blocks that stretch away as straight as an arrow , into the distance .
the sidewalks are about as wide as ordinary european streets , and are covered over with a double <unk> supported on great stone piers or columns .
one walks from one end to the other of these spacious streets , under shelter all the time , and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops and the most inviting <unk> .
there is a wide and lengthy court , glittering with the most wickedly enticing shops , which is roofed with glass , high aloft overhead , and paved with <unk> marbles laid in graceful figures ; and at night when the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and chatting and laughing multitude of <unk> , it is a spectacle worth seeing .
everything is on a large scale ; the public buildings , for instance  and they are <unk> imposing , too , as well as large .
the big squares have big bronze monuments in them .
at the hotel they gave us rooms that were alarming , for size , and parlor to match .
it was well the weather required no fire in the parlor , for i think one might as well have tried to warm a park .
the place would have a warm look , though , in any weather , for the <unk> were of red silk <unk> , and the walls were covered with the same <unk> goods  so , also , were the four sofas and the brigade of chairs .
the furniture , the ornaments , the chandeliers , the carpets , were all new and bright and costly .
we did not need a parlor at all , but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and we might use it if we chose .
since it was to cost nothing , we were not averse to using it , of course .
<unk> must surely read a good deal , for it has more <unk> to the square <name> than any other town i know of .
and it has its own share of military folk .
the italian officers ' uniforms are very much the most beautiful i have ever seen ; and , as a general thing , the men in them were as handsome as the clothes .
they were not large men , but they had fine forms , fine features , <name> <name> complexions , and lustrous black eyes .
for several weeks i had been <unk> all the information i could about italy , from tourists .
the tourists were all agreed upon one thing  one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the italians .
i took an evening walk in <unk> , and presently came across a little punch and <name> show in one of the great squares .
twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience .
this miniature theater was not much bigger than a man's coffin stood on end ; the upper part was open and displayed a <unk> parlor  a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a <unk> ; the <unk> consisted of a couple of <unk> an inch long ; various <unk> the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other , gesticulating a good deal , and they generally had a fight before they got through .
they were worked by strings from above , and the illusion was not perfect , for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that <unk> them  and the actors and <unk> all talked in the same voice , too .
the audience stood in front of the theater , and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily .
when the play was done , a youth in his shirt-sleeves started around with a small copper saucer to make a collection .
i did not know how much to put in , but thought i would be guided by my predecessors .
unluckily , i only had two of these , and they did not help me much because they did not put in anything .
i had no italian money , so i put in a small swiss coin worth about ten cents .
the youth finished his collection trip and emptied the result on the stage ; he had some very animated talk with the concealed manager , then he came working his way through the little crowd  seeking me , i thought .
i had a mind to slip away , but concluded i would n't ; i would stand my ground , and confront the villainy , whatever it was .
the youth stood before me and held up that swiss coin , sure enough , and said something .
i did not understand him , but i judged he was requiring italian money of me .
the crowd gathered close , to listen .
i was irritated , and said  in english , of course : " i know it 's swiss , but you 'll take that or none .
i have n't any other . "
he tried to put the coin in my hand , and spoke again .
i <name> my hand away , and said : " no , sir .
i know all about you people .
you ca n't play any of your <unk> tricks on me .
if there is a discount on that coin , i am sorry , but i am not going to make it good .
i noticed that some of the audience did n't pay you anything at all .
you let them go , without a word , but you come after me because you think i 'm a stranger and <name> put up with an extortion rather than have a scene .
but you are mistaken this time  you 'll take that swiss money or none . "
the youth stood there with the coin in his fingers , <unk> and bewildered ; of course he had not understood a word .
an english-speaking italian spoke up , now , and said : " you are misunderstanding the boy .
he does not mean any harm .
he did not suppose you gave him so much money purposely , so he hurried back to return you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your mistake .
take it , and give him a <name>  that <name> make everything smooth again . "
i probably blushed , then , for there was occasion .
through the interpreter i begged the boy 's pardon , but i nobly refused to take back the ten cents .
i said i was accustomed to <unk> large sums in that way  it was the kind of person i was .
then i retired to make a note to the effect that in italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat .
the episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history .
i once robbed an aged and blind <unk> of four dollars  in a church .
it happened this way .
when i was out with the innocents abroad , the ship stopped in the russian port of <name> and i went ashore , with others , to view the town .
i got separated from the rest , and wandered about alone , until late in the afternoon , when i entered a greek church to see what it was like .
when i was ready to leave , i observed two wrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall , near the door , with their brown palms open to receive alms .
i contributed to the nearer one , and passed out .
i had gone fifty yards , perhaps , when it occurred to me that i must remain ashore all night , as i had heard that the ship 's business would <name> her away at four o'clock and keep her away until morning .
it was a little after four now .
i had come ashore with only two pieces of money , both about the same size , but differing largely in value  one was a french gold piece worth four dollars , the other a turkish coin worth two cents and a half .
with a sudden and horrified misgiving , i put my hand in my pocket , now , and sure enough , i fetched out that turkish <name> !
here was a situation .
a hotel would require pay in advance  i must walk the street all night , and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character .
there was but one way out of the difficulty  i flew back to the church , and softly entered .
there stood the old woman yet , and in the palm of the nearest one still lay my gold piece .
i was grateful .
i crept close , feeling unspeakably mean ; i got my turkish <name> ready , and was extending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange , when i heard a cough behind me .
i jumped back as if i had been accused , and stood quaking while a <unk> entered and passed up the aisle .
i was there a year trying to steal that money ; that is , it seemed a year , though , of course , it must have been much less .
the <unk> went and came ; there were hardly ever three in the church at once , but there was always one or more .
every time i tried to commit my crime somebody came in or somebody started out , and i was prevented ; but at last my opportunity came ; for one moment there was nobody in the church but the two <unk> and me .
i whipped the gold piece out of the poor old pauper 's palm and dropped my turkish <name> in its place .
poor old thing , she murmured her thanks  they smote me to the heart .
then i sped away in a guilty hurry , and even when i was a mile from the church i was still glancing back , every moment , to see if i was being pursued .
that experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me ; for i resolved then , that as long as i lived i would never again <name> a blind <unk> in a church ; and i have always kept my word .
the most permanent lessons in morals are those which come , not of <unk> teaching , but of experience .
chapter <unk> [ beauty of women  and of old masters ] in <name> we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful <unk> or gallery , or whatever it is called .
blocks of tall new buildings of the most sumptuous sort , <name> with decoration and graced with statues , the streets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height , the pavements all of smooth and variegated marble , arranged in <unk> patterns  little tables all over these marble streets , people sitting at them , eating , drinking , or smoking  crowds of other people strolling by  such is the <unk> .
i should like to live in it all the time .
the windows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open , and one breakfasts there and enjoys the passing show .
we wandered all over the town , enjoying whatever was going on in the streets .
we took one omnibus ride , and as i did not speak italian and could not ask the price , i held out some copper coins to the conductor , and he took two .
then he went and got his tariff card and showed me that he had taken only the right sum .
so i made a note  italian omnibus conductors do not cheat .
near the cathedral i saw another instance of probity .
an old man was <unk> dolls and toy fans .
two small american children bought fans , and one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins , and both started away ; but they were called back , and the franc and one of the coppers were restored to them .
hence it is plain that in italy , parties connected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not cheat .
the stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive , generally .
in the vestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store , we saw eight or ten wooden <unk> grouped together , clothed in woolen business suits and each marked with its price .
one suit was marked forty-five francs  nine dollars .
<name> stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that .
nothing easier : the old merchant dragged in the dummy , brushed him off with a broom , stripped him , and shipped the clothes to the hotel .
he said he did not keep two suits of the same kind in stock , but manufactured a second when it was needed to <unk> the dummy .
in another quarter we found six italians engaged in a violent quarrel .
they danced fiercely about , gesticulating with their heads , their arms , their legs , their whole bodies ; they would rush forward occasionally with a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each other's very faces .
we lost half an hour there , waiting to help cord up the dead , but they finally embraced each other affectionately , and the trouble was over .
the episode was interesting , but we could not have afforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of it but a reconciliation .
note made  in italy , people who quarrel cheat the spectator .
we had another disappointment afterward .
we approached a deeply interested crowd , and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly chattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered with a piece of old blanket .
every little while he would bend down and take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his <unk> , as if to show there was no deception  chattering away all the while  but always , just as i was expecting to see a wonder feat of <unk> , he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further .
however , at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid in it , and held it fair and frankly around , for people to see that it was all right and he was taking no advantage  his chatter became more excited than ever .
i supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid and swallow it , so i was greatly wrought up and interested .
i got a cent ready in one hand and a <unk> in the other , intending to give him the former if he survived and the latter if he killed himself  for his loss would be my gain in a literary way , and i was willing to pay a fair price for the item  but this impostor ended his intensely moving performance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing the spoon !
then he held it aloft , and he could not have shown a wilder exultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle .
the crowd applauded in a gratified way , and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth when it says these children of the south are easily entertained .
we spent an impressive hour in the <name> cathedral , where long shafts of tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty windows and falling on a pillar here , a picture there , and a kneeling <unk> yonder .
the organ was muttering , <unk> were swinging , candles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing silently past them ; the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts away and steep the soul in a holy calm .
a trim young american <name> paused a yard or two from me , fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks <unk> the far-off altar , bent her head reverently a moment , then straightened up , kicked her train into the air with her heel , caught it deftly in her hand , and marched briskly out .
we visited the <unk> and the other regulation " sights " of <name>  not because i wanted to write about them again , but to see if i had learned anything in twelve years .
i afterward visited the great galleries of rome and <name> for the same purpose .
i found i had learned one thing .
when i wrote about the old masters before , i said the copies were better than the originals .
that was a mistake of large dimensions .
the old masters were still <unk> to me , but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies .
the copy is to the original as the pallid , smart , <unk> new <unk> group is to the vigorous , <name> , dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate .
there is a mellow richness , a subdued color , in the old pictures , which is to the eye what muffled and <unk> sound is to the ear .
that is the merit which is most loudly praised in the old picture , and is the one which the copy most conspicuously lacks , and which the <unk> must not <name> to compass .
it was generally conceded by the artists with whom i talked , that that subdued splendor , that mellow richness , is imparted to the picture by age .
then why should we worship the old master for it , who did n't impart it , instead of worshiping old time , who did ?
perhaps the picture was a clanging <name> , until time muffled it and sweetened it .
in conversation with an artist in <name> , i asked : " what is it that people see in the old masters ?
i have been in the doge 's palace and i saw several acres of very bad drawing , very bad perspective , and very incorrect proportions .
<name> <unk> 's dogs to not resemble dogs ; all the horses look like bladders on legs ; one man had a right leg on the left side of his body ; in the large picture where the emperor ( <unk> ? )
is prostrate before the pope , there are three men in the foreground who are over thirty feet high , if one may judge by the size of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground ; and according to the same scale , the pope is seven feet high and the doge is a <unk> dwarf of four feet . "
the artist said : " yes , the old masters often <name> badly ; they did not care much for truth and exactness in minor details ; but after all , in spite of bad drawing , bad perspective , bad proportions , and a choice of subjects which no longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago , there is a something about their pictures which is divine  a something which is above and beyond the <name> of any epoch since  a something which would be the despair of artists but that they never <name> or expect to attain it , and therefore do not worry about it . "
that is what he said  and he said what he believed ; and not only believed , but felt .
reasoning  especially reasoning , without technical knowledge  must be put aside , in cases of this kind .
it can not assist the inquirer .
it <name> lead him , in the most logical progression , to what , in the eyes of artists , would be a most illogical conclusion .
thus : bad drawing , bad proportion , bad perspective , indifference to truthful detail , color which gets its merit from time , and not from the artist  these things constitute the old master ; conclusion , the old master was a bad painter , the old master was not an old master at all , but an old apprentice .
your friend the artist <name> <name> your premises , but deny your conclusion ; he <name> maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed defects , there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable about the old master , and that there is no arguing the fact away by any system of reasoning whatsoever .
i can believe that .
there are women who have an indefinable charm in their faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates , but a cold stranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would fail .
he would say of one of these women : this <name> is too short , this nose is too long , this forehead is too high , this hair is too red , this complexion is too pallid , the perspective of the entire composition is incorrect ; conclusion , the woman is not beautiful .
but her nearest friend might say , and say truly , " your premises are right , your logic is faultless , but your conclusion is wrong , nevertheless ; she is an old master  she is beautiful , but only to such as know her ; it is a beauty which can not be <unk> , but it is there , just the same . "
i found more pleasure in contemplating the old masters this time than i did when i was in europe in former years , but still it was a calm pleasure ; there was nothing <unk> about it .
when i was in <name> before , i think i found no picture which stirred me much , but this time there were two which <unk> me to the doge 's palace day after day , and kept me there hours at a time .
one of these was <unk> 's <unk> picture in the great council chamber .
when i saw it twelve years ago i was not strongly attracted to it  the guide told me it was an insurrection in heaven  but this was an error .
the movement of this great work is very fine .
there are ten thousand figures , and they are all doing something .
there is a wonderful " go " to the whole composition .
some of the figures are driving headlong downward , with clasped hands , others are swimming through the <unk>  some on their faces , some on their backs  great processions of bishops , martyrs , and angels are pouring swiftly <unk> from various outlying directions  everywhere is enthusiastic <name> , there is rushing movement everywhere .
there are fifteen or twenty figures scattered here and there , with books , but they can not keep their attention on their reading  they offer the books to others , but no one wishes to read , now .
the lion of st. <name> is there with his book ; st. <name> is there with his pen uplifted ; he and the lion are looking each other earnestly in the face , disputing about the way to spell a word  the lion looks up in rapt admiration while st. <name> spells .
this is wonderfully interpreted by the artist .
it is the <unk> of this <unk> painting .
i visited the place daily , and never grew tired of looking at that grand picture .
as i have intimated , the movement is almost <unk> vigorous ; the figures are singing , <unk> , and many are blowing trumpets .
so vividly is noise suggested , that spectators who become absorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each other 's ears , making <unk> of their curved hands , fearing they may not otherwise be heard .
one often sees a tourist , with the eloquent tears pouring down his cheeks , funnel his hands at his wife 's ear , and hears him roar through them , " oh , to be there and at rest ! "
none but the supremely great in <name> can produce effects like these with the silent brush .
twelve years ago i could not have appreciated this picture .
one year ago i could not have appreciated it .
my study of <name> in heidelberg has been a <name> education to me .
all that i am today in <name> , i owe to that .
the other great work which fascinated me was <unk> 's immortal hair trunk .
this is in the chamber of the council of ten .
it is in one of the three <unk> pictures which decorate the walls of the room .
the composition of this picture is beyond praise .
the hair trunk is not hurled at the stranger 's head  so to speak  as the chief feature of an immortal work so often is ; no , it is carefully guarded from prominence , it is <unk> , it is restrained , it is most deftly and cleverly held in reserve , it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to , by the master , and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last , he is taken unawares , he is unprepared , and it bursts upon him with a stupefying surprise .
one is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate planning must have cost .
a general glance at the picture could never suggest that there was a hair trunk in it ; the hair trunk is not mentioned in the title even  which is , " pope <name> iii .
and the doge <unk> , the conqueror of the emperor <name> <unk> " ; you see , the title is actually <unk> to help divert attention from the trunk ; thus , as i say , nothing suggests the presence of the trunk , by any hint , yet everything <unk> leads up to it , step by step .
let us examine into this , and observe the exquisitely artful <unk> of the plan .
at the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women , one of them with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting with bandaged head on the ground .
these people seem needless , but no , they are there for a purpose ; one can not look at them without seeing the gorgeous procession of grandees , bishops , <unk> , and <unk> which is passing along behind them ; one can not see the procession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither it is going ; it leads him to the pope , in the center of the picture , who is talking with the <unk> doge  talking tranquilly , too , although within twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum , and not far from the drummer two persons are blowing horns , and many horsemen are plunging and rioting about  indeed , twenty-two feet of this great work is all a deep and happy holiday serenity and sunday-school procession , and then we come suddenly upon eleven and one-half feet of turmoil and racket and insubordination .
this latter state of things is not an accident , it has its purpose .
but for it , one would linger upon the pope and the doge , thinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture ; whereas one is drawn along , almost unconsciously , to see what the trouble is about .
now at the very end of this riot , within four feet of the end of the picture , and full thirty-six feet from the beginning of it , the hair trunk bursts with an <unk> suddenness upon the spectator , in all its matchless perfection , and the great <unk> triumph is sweeping and complete .
from that moment no other thing in those forty feet of canvas has any charm ; one sees the hair trunk , and the hair trunk only  and to see it is to worship it .
<unk> even placed objects in the immediate vicinity of the supreme feature whose pretended purpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus delay and <unk> the surprise ; for instance , to the right of it he has placed a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye for a moment  to the left of it , some six feet away , he has placed a <unk> man on an inflated horse , and that coat <unk> your eye to that locality the next moment  then , between the trunk and the red horseman he has intruded a man , naked to his waist , who is carrying a fancy <unk> on the middle of his back instead of on his shoulder  this admirable feat interests you , of course  keeps you at bay a little longer , like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing wolf  but at last , in spite of all <unk> and <unk> , the eye of even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the world 's masterpiece , and in that moment he <unk> to his chair or leans upon his guide for support .
descriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect , yet they are of value .
the top of the trunk is arched ; the arch is a perfect <unk> , in the <name> style of architecture , for in the then rapid <unk> of greek <name> , the rising influence of rome was already beginning to be felt in the <name> of the republic .
the trunk is bound or bordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body .
many critics consider this leather too cold in tone ; but i consider this its highest merit , since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast the impassioned fervor of the <unk> .
the <unk> in this part of the work are cleverly managed , the <unk> is admirably <unk> to the ground tints , and the <unk> is very fine .
the brass <unk> are in the purest style of the early renaissance .
the strokes , here , are very firm and bold  every <unk> is a portrait .
the handle on the end of the trunk has evidently been <unk>  i think , with a piece of chalk  but one can still see the inspiration of the old master in the tranquil , almost too tranquil , <name> of it .
the hair of this trunk is real hair  so to speak  white in patches , brown in patches .
the details are finely worked out ; the repose proper to hair in a <unk> and inactive attitude is charmingly expressed .
there is a feeling about this part of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of <name> ; the sense of sordid <unk> vanishes away  one recognizes that there is soul here .
view this trunk as you <name> , it is a gem , it is a <name> , it is a miracle .
some of the effects are very daring , approaching even to the boldest flights of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> schools  yet the master 's hand never <unk>  it moves on , calm , majestic , confident  and , with that <name> which <unk> <name> , it finally casts over the tout <unk> , by mysterious methods of its own , a subtle something which <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the arid <unk> and endures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of <unk> .
among the <unk> of europe there are pictures which approach the hair trunk  there are two which may be said to equal it , possibly  but there is none that <unk> it .
so perfect is the hair trunk that it moves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for <name> .
when an erie <unk> saw it two years ago , he could hardly keep from checking it ; and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence , he gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments , then slowly and unconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost , and got out his chalk with the other .
these facts speak for themselves .
chapter <unk> [ hanged with a golden rope ] one lingers about the cathedral a good deal , in <name> .
there is a strong fascination about it  partly because it is so old , and partly because it is so ugly .
too many of the world 's famous buildings fail of one chief virtue  <name> ; they are made up of a <unk> mixture of the ugly and the beautiful ; this is bad ; it is confusing , it is <unk> .
one has a sense of uneasiness , of distress , without knowing why .
but one is calm before st. <name> 's , one is calm within it , one would be calm on top of it , calm in the cellar ; for its details are <unk> ugly , no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded anywhere ; and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole , of soothing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ugliness .
one's admiration of a perfect thing always grows , never declines ; and this is the surest evidence to him that it is perfect .
st. <name> 's is perfect .
to me it soon grew to be so nobly , so <unk> ugly , that it was difficult to stay away from it , even for a little while .
every time its squat domes disappeared from my view , i had a despondent feeling ; whenever they reappeared , i felt an honest rapture  i have not known any happier hours than those i daily spent in front of <unk> 's , looking across the great square at it .
propped on its long row of low <unk> columns , its back <unk> with domes , it seemed like a vast <unk> bug taking a meditative walk .
st. <name> 's is not the oldest building in the world , of course , but it seems the oldest , and looks the oldest  especially inside .
when the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged , they are repaired but not altered ; the grotesque old pattern is preserved .
antiquity has a charm of its own , and to <unk> it up would only damage it .
one day i was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an ancient piece of <unk> , in mosaic , illustrative of the command to " multiply and <unk> the earth . "
the cathedral itself had seemed very old ; but this picture was illustrating a period in history which made the building seem young by comparison .
but i presently found an antique which was older than either the battered cathedral or the date assigned to the piece of history ; it was a <unk> fossil as large as the crown of a hat ; it was embedded in the marble bench , and had been sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth .
contrasted with the inconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil , those other things were flippantly modern  <unk>  mere matters of <unk> .
the sense of the <unk> of the cathedral vanished away under the influence of this truly venerable presence .
st. <name> 's is monumental ; it is an imperishable <unk> of the profound and simple piety of the middle ages .
whoever could <unk> a column from a pagan <name> , did it and contributed his swag to this <name> one .
so this <unk> is upheld by several hundred <unk> procured in that peculiar way .
in our day it would be immoral to go on the highway to get bricks for a church , but it was no sin in the old times .
st. <name> 's was itself the victim of a curious robbery once .
the thing is set down in the history of <name> , but it might be smuggled into the arabian nights and not seem out of place there : nearly four hundred and fifty years ago , a <unk> named <unk> , in the suite of a <name> of the house of <unk> , was allowed to view the riches of st. <name> 's .
his sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself behind an altar , with an evil purpose in his heart , but a priest discovered him and turned him out .
afterward he got in again  by false keys , this time .
he went there , night after night , and worked hard and patiently , all alone , overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his toil , and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble <unk> which walled the lower part of the treasury ; this block he fixed so that he could take it out and put it in at <name> .
after that , for weeks , he spent all his <unk> in his magnificent mine , inspecting it in security , <unk> over its marvels at his leisure , and always slipping back to his obscure lodgings before <name> , with a duke 's ransom under his cloak .
he did not need to grab , haphazard , and run  there was no hurry .
he could make deliberate and <unk> selections ; he could consult his <unk> tastes .
one <unk> how undisturbed he was , and how safe from any danger of interruption , when it is stated that he even carried off a unicorn 's horn  a mere curiosity  which would not pass through the egress entire , but had to be <unk> in two  a bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor .
he continued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost the charm of novelty and became monotonous ; then he ceased from it , contented .
well he might be ; for his collection , raised to modern values , represented nearly fifty million dollars !
he could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country , and it might have been years before the plunder was missed ; but he was human  he could not enjoy his delight alone , he must have somebody to talk about it with .
so he exacted a solemn oath from a <unk> <name> named <unk> , then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath away with a sight of his glittering hoard .
he detected a look in his friend 's face which excited his suspicion , and was about to slip a <unk> into him when <unk> saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment .
<unk> made <unk> a present of one of the state 's principal jewels  a huge <unk> , which afterward figured in the ducal cap of state  and the pair parted .
<unk> went at once to the palace , denounced the criminal , and handed over the <unk> as evidence .
<unk> was arrested , tried , and condemned , with the old-time venetian promptness .
he was hanged between the two great columns in the piazza  with a gilded rope , out of compliment to his love of gold , perhaps .
he got no good of his booty at all  it was all recovered .
in <name> we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the continent  a home dinner with a private family .
if one could always stop with private families , when traveling , europe would have a charm which it now lacks .
as it is , one must live in the hotels , of course , and that is a sorrowful business .
a man accustomed to american food and american domestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in europe ; but i think he would gradually waste away , and eventually die .
he would have to do without his accustomed morning meal .
that is too formidable a change altogether ; he would necessarily suffer from it .
he could get the shadow , the sham , the base counterfeit of that meal ; but it would do him no good , and money could not buy the reality .
to <unk> : the average american 's simplest and commonest form of breakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak ; well , in europe , coffee is an unknown beverage .
you can get what the european hotel-keeper thinks is coffee , but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles holiness .
it is a feeble , <unk> , <unk> sort of stuff , and almost as <unk> as if it had been made in an american hotel .
the milk used for it is what the french call " <name> " milk  milk which has been baptized .
after a few months ' acquaintance with european " coffee , " one 's mind <unk> , and his <name> with it , and he begins to wonder if the <name> beverage of home , with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it , is not a mere dream , after all , and a thing which never existed .
next comes the european bread  fair enough , good enough , after a fashion , but cold ; cold and tough , and unsympathetic ; and never any change , never any variety  always the same tiresome thing .
next , the butter  the sham and <unk> butter ; no salt in it , and made of goodness knows what .
then there is the beefsteak .
they have it in europe , but they do n't know how to cook it .
neither <name> they cut it right .
it comes on the table in a small , round pewter platter .
it lies in the center of this platter , in a bordering bed of <unk> potatoes ; it is the size , shape , and thickness of a man 's hand with the thumb and fingers cut off .
it is a little overdone , is rather dry , it tastes pretty <unk> , it <unk> no enthusiasm .
imagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing ; and imagine an <name> suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him a mighty <unk> steak an inch and a half thick , hot and sputtering from the <unk> ; dusted with a fragrant pepper ; enriched with little melting bits of butter of the most <unk> freshness and genuineness ; the precious <unk> of the meat trickling out and joining the gravy , <unk> with mushrooms ; a township or two of tender , yellowish fat <unk> an outlying district of this ample county of beefsteak ; the long white bone which divides the <unk> from the <unk> still in its place ; and imagine that the <name> also adds a great cup of american home-made coffee , with a cream <unk> on top , some real butter , firm and yellow and fresh , some smoking <unk> , a plate of hot buckwheat cakes , with transparent syrup  could words describe the gratitude of this exile ?
the european dinner is better than the european breakfast , but it has its faults and <unk> ; it does not satisfy .
he comes to the table eager and hungry ; he swallows his soup  there is an <unk> lack about it somewhere ; thinks the fish is going to be the thing he wants  eats it and is n't sure ; thinks the next dish is perhaps the one that <name> hit the hungry place  tries it , and is conscious that there was a something wanting about it , also .
and thus he goes on , from dish to dish , like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught every time it alights , but somehow does n't get caught after all ; and at the end the exile and the boy have fared about alike ; the one is full , but grievously unsatisfied , the other has had plenty of exercise , plenty of interest , and a fine lot of hopes , but he has n't got any butterfly .
there is here and there an american who <name> say he can remember rising from a european table d'hôte perfectly satisfied ; but we must not overlook the fact that there is also here and there an american who <name> lie .
the number of dishes is sufficient ; but then it is such a monotonous variety of <unk> dishes .
it is an <unk> <unk> of " <unk> . "
there is nothing to accent it .
perhaps if the roast of mutton or of beef  a big , generous one  were brought on the table and carved in full view of the client , that might give the right sense of earnestness and reality to the thing ; but they do n't do that , they pass the sliced meat around on a dish , and so you are perfectly calm , it does not stir you in the least .
now a vast roast turkey , stretched on the broad of his back , with his heels in the air and the <name> <unk> oozing from his fat sides ... but i may as well stop there , for they would not know how to cook him .
they ca n't even cook a chicken <unk> ; and as for carving it , they do that with a hatchet .
this is about the customary table d'hôte <name> in summer : soup ( <unk> ) .
fish  sole , salmon , or whiting  usually tolerably good .
roast  mutton or beef  <unk>  and some last year 's potatoes .
a <unk> , or some other made dish  usually good  " considering . "
one vegetable  brought on in state , and all alone  usually insipid <unk> , or <unk> , or indifferent asparagus .
roast chicken , as <unk> as paper .
<unk>  tolerably good .
decayed strawberries or cherries .
sometimes the apricots and figs are fresh , but this is no advantage , as these fruits are of no account anyway .
the grapes are generally good , and sometimes there is a tolerably good peach , by mistake .
the variations of the above <name> are trifling .
after a fortnight one discovers that the variations are only apparent , not real ; in the third week you get what you had the first , and in the fourth the week you get what you had the second .
three or four months of this weary sameness <name> kill the <unk> appetite .
it has now been many months , at the present writing , since i have had a nourishing meal , but i shall soon have one  a modest , private affair , all to myself .
i have selected a few dishes , and made out a little <name> of fare , which <name> go home in the steamer that precedes me , and be hot when i arrive  as follows : <unk> .

americans intending to spend a year or so in european hotels <name> do well to copy this <name> and <name> it along .
they <name> find it an excellent thing to get up an appetite with , in the <unk> presence of the squalid table d'hôte .
foreigners can not enjoy our food , i suppose , any more than we can enjoy theirs .
it is not strange ; for tastes are made , not born .
i might <unk> my <name> of fare until i was tired ; but after all , the scotchman would shake his head and say , " where 's your <unk> ? "
and the <unk> would sigh and say , " where 's your missionary ? "
i have a neat talent in matters pertaining to nourishment .
this has met with professional recognition .
i have often furnished <unk> for <unk> .
here are some designs for pies and things , which i recently prepared for a friend 's projected <unk> , but as i forgot to furnish diagrams and <unk> , they had to be left out , of course .
<unk> for an <unk> take a lot of water and add to it a lot of coarse <unk> and about a quarter of a lot of salt .
mix well together , <unk> into the form of a " <unk> , " and let the <unk> stand awhile  not on its edge , but the other way .
rake away a place among the embers , lay it there , and cover it an inch deep with hot ashes .
when it is done , remove it ; blow off all the ashes but one layer ; butter that one and eat .
n.b.  no household should ever be without this <unk> .
it has been noticed that tramps never return for another <unk> .
     <unk> for new english pie to make this excellent breakfast dish , proceed as follows : take a sufficiency of water and a sufficiency of flour , and construct a <unk> dough .
work this into the form of a disk , with the edges turned up some three-fourths of an inch .
<unk> and <unk> in a couple days in a mild but unvarying temperature .
construct a cover for this redoubt in the same way and of the same material .
fill with <unk> dried apples ; <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and slabs of <unk> ; add two portions of new orleans <unk> , then <unk> on the lid and set in a safe place till it <unk> .
serve cold at breakfast and invite your enemy .
     <unk> for <name> coffee take a barrel of water and bring it to a boil ; rub a <unk> <name> against a coffee <name> , then convey the former into the water .
continue the boiling and evaporation until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and <unk> has been diminished to a proper degree ; then set aside to cool .
now <unk> the remains of a once cow from the plow , insert them in a <unk> press , and when you shall have acquired a <unk> of that pale-blue juice which a <name> superstition regards as milk , modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast .
mix the beverage in a cold cup , partake with moderation , and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against <unk> .
to carve fowls in the <name> fashion use a club , and avoid the joints .
chapter l [ titian bad and titian good ] i wonder why some things are ?
for instance , <name> is allowed as much indecent license today as in earlier times  but the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply <unk> within the past eighty or ninety years .
<unk> and <unk> could portray the <unk> of their day in the <unk> language ; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day , but we are not allowed to approach them very near , even with nice and guarded forms of speech .
but not so with <name> .
the brush may still deal freely with any subject , however revolting or indelicate .
it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore , to go about rome and <name> and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues .
these works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages , are all <unk> now .
yes , every one of them .
nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps ; nobody can help noticing it now , the <unk> makes it so conspicuous .
but the comical thing about it all , is , that the <unk> is confined to cold and pallid marble , which would be still cold and <unk> without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty , whereas <unk> paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it .
at the door of the <unk> , in <name> , one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman , <unk> , battered , black with accumulated <unk>  they hardly suggest human beings  yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously <unk> by this fastidious generation .
you enter , and proceed to that <unk> little gallery that exists in the world  the tribune  and there , against the wall , without obstructing rag or leaf , you may look your fill upon the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> picture the world possesses  <unk> <name> .
it is n't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed  no , it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand .
if i ventured to describe that attitude , there would be a fine howl  but there the <name> lies , for anybody to gloat over that wants to  and there she has a right to lie , for she is a work of <name> , and <name> has its privileges .
i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her ; i saw young men gaze long and <unk> at her ; i saw aged , infirm men <name> upon her charms with a pathetic interest .
how i should like to describe her  just to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the world  just to hear the <unk> average man deliver himself about my <unk> and coarseness , and all that .
the world says that no worded description of a moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle seen with one 's own eyes  yet the world is willing to let its son and its daughter and itself look at titian 's beast , but wo n't stand a description of it in words .
which shows that the world is not as consistent as it might be .
there are pictures of <unk> women which suggest no impure thought  i am well aware of that .
i am not railing at such .
what i am trying to emphasize is the fact that titian 's <name> is very far from being one of that sort .
without any question it was painted for a <unk> and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong .
in truth , it is too strong for any place but a public <name> gallery .
titian has two <unk> in the tribune ; persons who have seen them <name> easily remember which one i am referring to .
in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood , carnage , oozing brains , <unk>  pictures <unk> intolerable suffering  pictures alive with every conceivable horror , wrought out in dreadful detail  and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited  without a growl from anybody  for they are innocent , they are inoffensive , being works of <name> .
but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things  the critics would skin him alive .
well , let it go , it can not be helped ; <name> retains her privileges , literature has lost hers .
somebody else may cipher out the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of it  i have n't got time .
titian 's <name> defiles and <unk> the tribune , there is no softening that fact , but his " <name> " <unk> it .
the simple truthfulness of its <name> work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor , be he learned or ignorant .
after wearying one 's self with the acres of stuffy , <unk> , expressionless babies that <unk> the canvases of the old masters of italy , it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child and feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of the real thing .
this is a human child , this is genuine .
you have seen him a thousand times  you have seen him just as he is here  and you confess , without reserve , that titian was a master .
the <unk> of other painted babes may mean one thing , they may mean another , but with the " <name> " the case is different .
the most famous of all the <unk> has said , " there is no room for doubt , here  plainly this child is in trouble . "
i consider that the " <name> " has no equal among the works of the old masters , except it be the divine hair trunk of <unk> .
i feel sure that if all the other old masters were lost and only these two preserved , the world would be the <unk> by it .
my sole purpose in going to <name> was to see this immortal " <name> , " and by good fortune i was just in time , for they were already preparing to remove it to a more private and <unk> place because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in europe at the time .
i got a capable artist to copy the picture ; <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> 's books , engraved it for me , and i have the pleasure of laying it before the reader in this volume .
we took a turn to rome and some other italian cities  then to munich , and thence to <name>  partly for exercise , but mainly because these things were in our projected program , and it was only right that we should be faithful to it .
from <name> i branched out and walked through holland and belgium , procuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired , and i had a tolerably good time of it " by and large . "
i worked spain and other regions through agents to save time and <unk> .
we crossed to england , and then made the homeward passage in the <unk> <unk> , a very fine ship .
i was glad to get home  immeasurably glad ; so glad , in fact , that it did not seem possible that anything could ever get me out of the country again .
i had not enjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure i felt in seeing new york harbor again .
europe has many advantages which we have not , but they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country .
then we are such a homeless lot when we are over there !
so are europeans themselves , for that matter .
they live in dark and chilly vast tombs  costly enough , maybe , but without conveniences .
to be condemned to live as the average european family lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average american family .
on the whole , i think that short visits to europe are better for us than long ones .
the former preserve us from becoming <unk> ; they keep our pride of country intact , and at the same time they <unk> our affection for our country and our people ; whereas long visits have the effect of <unk> those feelings  at least in the majority of cases .
i think that one who mixes much with americans long resident abroad must arrive at this conclusion .
appendix nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an appendix .
 herodotus appendix a .
the portier <name> <unk> , the <unk> of persia , writing more than eight hundred years ago , has said : " in the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned books , many that are able to lead armies , and many also that are able to govern kingdoms and empires ; but few there be that can keep a hotel . "
a word about the european hotel portier .
he is a most admirable invention , a most valuable convenience .
he always wears a conspicuous uniform ; he can always be found when he is wanted , for he sticks closely to his post at the front door ; he is as polite as a duke ; he speaks from four to ten languages ; he is your surest help and refuge in time of trouble or perplexity .
he is not the clerk , he is not the landlord ; he ranks above the clerk , and represents the landlord , who is seldom seen .
instead of going to the clerk for information , as we do at home , you go to the portier .
it is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know nothing whatever ; it is the pride of the portier to know everything .
you ask the portier at what hours the trains leave  he tells you instantly ; or you ask him who is the best physician in town ; or what is the hack tariff ; or how many children the mayor has ; or what days the galleries are open , and whether a permit is required , and where you are to get it , and what you must pay for it ; or when the theaters open and close , what the plays are to be , and the price of seats ; or what is the newest thing in hats ; or how the bills of mortality average ; or " who struck <name> patterson . "
it does not matter what you ask him : in nine cases out of ten he knows , and in the tenth case he <name> find out for you before you can turn around three times .
there is nothing he <name> not put his hand to .
suppose you tell him you wish to go from hamburg to <unk> by the way of jericho , and are ignorant of routes and prices  the next morning he <name> hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it to the last detail .
before you have been long on european soil , you find yourself still saying you are relying on providence , but when you come to look closer you <name> see that in reality you are relying on the portier .
he discovers what is puzzling you , or what is troubling you , or what your need is , before you can get the half of it out , and he promptly says , " leave that to me . "
consequently , you easily drift into the habit of leaving everything to him .
there is a certain embarrassment about applying to the average american hotel clerk , a certain hesitancy , a sense of <unk> against <unk> ; but you feel no embarrassment in your intercourse with the portier ; he receives your propositions with an enthusiasm which cheers , and plunges into their accomplishment with an alacrity which almost <unk> .
the more requirements you can pile upon him , the better he likes it .
of course the result is that you cease from doing anything for yourself .
he calls a hack when you want one ; puts you into it ; tells the driver whither to take you ; receives you like a long-lost child when you return ; sends you about your business , does all the quarreling with the hackman himself , and pays him his money out of his own pocket .
he sends for your theater tickets , and pays for them ; he sends for any possible article you can require , be it a doctor , an elephant , or a postage stamp ; and when you leave , at last , you <name> find a subordinate seated with the <unk> who <name> put you in your railway compartment , buy your tickets , have your baggage weighed , bring you the printed <unk> , and tell you everything is in your <name> and paid for .
at home you get such elaborate , excellent , and willing service as this only in the best hotels of our large cities ; but in europe you get it in the mere back <unk> just as well .
what is the secret of the portier 's devotion ?
it is very simple : he gets fees , and no salary .
his fee is pretty closely regulated , too .
if you stay a week , you give him five marks  a dollar and a quarter , or about eighteen cents a day .
if you stay a month , you reduce this average somewhat .
if you stay two or three months or longer , you cut it down half , or even more than half .
if you stay only one day , you give the portier a <name> .
the head waiter 's fee is a shade less than the portier 's ; the boots , who not only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes , but is usually the <name> and handles your baggage , gets a somewhat smaller fee than the head waiter ; the chambermaid 's fee ranks below that of the boots .
you fee only these four , and no one else .
a <name> gentleman told me that when he remained a week in a hotel , he gave the portier five marks , the head waiter four , the boots three , and the chambermaid two ; and if he stayed three months he divided ninety marks among them , in about the above proportions .
ninety marks make $ <unk> .
none of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel , though it be a year  except one of these four servants should go away in the mean time ; in that case he <name> be sure to come and bid you good-by and give you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him .
it is considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to remain longer in the hotel , because if you gave him too little he might neglect you afterward , and if you gave him too much he might neglect somebody else to attend to you .
it is considered best to keep his expectations " on a string " until your stay is concluded .
i do not know whether hotel servants in new york get any wages or not , but i do know that in some of the hotels there the <unk> system in vogue is a heavy burden .
the waiter expects a quarter at breakfast  and gets it .
you have a different waiter at luncheon , and so he gets a quarter .
your waiter at dinner is another stranger  consequently he gets a quarter .
the boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your gas <unk> around and hangs around significantly , and you fee him to get rid of him .
now you may ring for ice-water ; and ten minutes later for a lemonade ; and ten minutes afterward , for a cigar ; and by and by for a newspaper  and what is the result ?
why , a new boy has appeared every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him something .
suppose you boldly put your foot down , and say it is the hotel 's business to pay its servants ?
you <name> have to ring your <name> ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there ; and when he goes off to fill your order you <name> grow old and infirm before you see him again .
you may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours , maybe , if you are an <unk> sort of person , but in the mean time you <name> have been so <unk> served , and so insolently , that you <name> haul down your colors , and go to <unk> yourself with fees .
it seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the european <unk> system into <name> .
i believe it would result in getting even the bells of the philadelphia hotels answered , and cheerful service rendered .
the greatest american hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier , and pay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course of a year .
the great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling salary , and a portier who pays the hotel a salary .
by the latter system both the hotel and the public save money and are better served than by our system .
one of our consuls told me that a portier of a great berlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position , and yet cleared six thousand dollars for himself .
the position of portier in the chief hotels of <unk> , long branch , new york , and similar centers of resort , would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than five thousand dollars for , perhaps .
when we borrowed the <unk> fashion from europe a dozen years ago , the salary system ought to have been <unk> , of course .
we might make this correction now , i should think .
and we might add the portier , too .
since i first began to study the portier , i have had opportunities to observe him in the chief cities of germany , switzerland , and italy ; and the more i have seen of him the more i have wished that he might be adopted in <name> , and become there , as he is in europe , the <unk> guardian <name> .
yes , what was true eight hundred years ago , is just as true today : " few there be that can keep a hotel . "
perhaps it is because the <unk> and their subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without first learning it .
in europe the trade of hotel-keeper is taught .
the apprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several grades one after the other .
just as in our country <unk> the apprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water ; then learns to " roll " ; then to sort " <unk> " ; then to set type ; and finally rounds and <unk> his education with <unk> and <unk> ; so the <unk> serves as <unk> ; then as <unk> ; then as a parlor waiter ; then as head waiter , in which position he often has to make out all the bills ; then as clerk or cashier ; then as portier .
his trade is learned now , and by and by he <name> assume the style and dignity of landlord , and be found conducting a hotel of his own .
now in europe , the same as in <name> , when a man has kept a hotel so thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great reputation , he has his reward .
he can live prosperously on that reputation .
he can let his hotel run down to the last degree of <unk> and yet have it full of people all the time .
for instance , there is the hotel de <unk> , in <name> .
it swarms with mice and fleas , and if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough to start another one with .
the food would create an insurrection in a poorhouse ; and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes up its loss by <unk> you on all sorts of trifles  and without making any <unk> or excuses about it , either .
but the hotel de <unk> old excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with travelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to warn them .
appendix b. heidelberg castle heidelberg castle must have been very beautiful before the french battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago .
the stone is brown , with a pinkish tint , and does not seem to stain easily .
the dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a drawing-room rather than for the outside of a house .
many fruit and flower clusters , human heads and grim projecting lions ' heads are still as perfect in every detail as if they were new .
but the statues which are ranked between the windows have suffered .
these are <unk> statues of old-time emperors , <unk> , and similar grandees , clad in mail and bearing ponderous swords .
some have lost an arm , some a head , and one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle .
there is a saying that if a stranger <name> pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to the castle front without saying anything , he can make a wish and it <name> be fulfilled .
but they say that the truth of this thing has never had a chance to be proved , for the reason that before any stranger can walk from the drawbridge to the appointed place , the beauty of the palace front <name> extort an exclamation of delight from him .
a ruin must be rightly situated , to be effective .
this one could not have been better placed .
it stands upon a commanding elevation , it is buried in green woods , there is no level ground about it , but , on the contrary , there are wooded terraces upon terraces , and one looks down through shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight reigns and the sun can not intrude .
nature knows how to <unk> a ruin to get the best effect .
one of these old towers is split down the middle , and one half has tumbled aside .
it tumbled in such a way as to establish itself in a picturesque attitude .
then all it lacked was a fitting drapery , and nature has furnished that ; she has robed the rugged mass in flowers and verdure , and made it a charm to the eye .
the standing half exposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you , like open , toothless mouths ; there , too , the vines and flowers have done their work of <name> .
the rear portion of the tower has not been neglected , either , but is clothed with a clinging garment of polished <name> which hides the wounds and stains of time .
even the top is not left bare , but is crowned with a flourishing group of trees and shrubs .
misfortune has done for this old tower what it has done for the human character sometimes  improved it .
a gentleman remarked , one day , that it might have been fine to live in the castle in the day of its prime , but that we had one advantage which its vanished inhabitants lacked  the advantage of having a charming ruin to visit and muse over .
but that was a hasty idea .
those people had the advantage of us .
they had the fine castle to live in , and they could cross the rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of <unk> besides .
the <unk> people , in their day , five hundred years ago , could go and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished , now , to the last stone .
there have always been ruins , no doubt ; and there have always been pensive people to sigh over them , and asses to scratch upon them their names and the important date of their visit .
within a hundred years after <name> left <name> , the guide probably gave the usual general flourish with his hand and said : " place where the animals were named , ladies and gentlemen ; place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood ; exact spot where <name> and <name> first met ; and here , ladies and gentlemen , adorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of tourists , we have the crumbling remains of cain 's altar  fine old ruin ! "
then , no doubt , he taxed them a <unk> apiece and let them go .
an illumination of heidelberg castle is one of the sights of europe .
the castle 's picturesque shape ; its commanding situation , midway up the steep and wooded mountainside ; its vast size  these features combine to make an illumination a most effective spectacle .
it is necessarily an expensive show , and consequently rather infrequent .
therefore whenever one of these exhibitions is to take place , the news goes about in the papers and heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night .
i and my agent had one of these opportunities , and improved it .
about half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower bridge , with some american students , in a pouring rain , and started up the road which borders the <unk> side of the river .
this roadway was densely packed with carriages and <unk> ; the former of all ages , and the latter of all ages and both sexes .
this black and solid mass was struggling painfully onward , through the <unk> , the darkness , and the deluge .
we waded along for three-quarters of a mile , and finally took up a position in an <unk> <unk> directly opposite the castle .
we could not see the castle  or anything else , for that matter  but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the way , through the pervading blackness , and knew whereabouts the castle was located .
we stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden , under our umbrellas ; the other ninety-nine were occupied by standing men and women , and they also had umbrellas .
all the region round about , and up and down the <unk> , was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden under an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas .
thus we stood during two drenching hours .
no rain fell on my head , but the converging whalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling <unk> of water down my neck , and sometimes into my ears , and thus kept me from getting hot and impatient .
i had the rheumatism , too , and had heard that this was good for it .
afterward , however , i was led to believe that the water treatment is not good for rheumatism .
there were even little girls in that dreadful place .
a man held one in his arms , just in front of me , for as much as an hour , with <unk> soaking into her clothing all the time .
in the circumstances , two hours was a good while for us to have to wait , but when the illumination did at last come , we felt repaid .
it came unexpectedly , of course  things always do , that have been long looked and longed for .
with a perfectly <unk> suddenness several mast sheaves of <unk> rockets were <unk> skyward out of the black throats of the castle towers , accompanied by a thundering crash of sound , and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor of fire and color .
for some little time the whole building was a blinding crimson mass , the towers continued to spout thick columns of rockets aloft , and overhead the sky was radiant with <unk> bolts which <unk> their way to the zenith , paused , curved gracefully downward , then burst into brilliant <unk> of richly colored sparks .
the red fires died slowly down , within the castle , and presently the shell grew nearly black outside ; the angry glare that shone out through the broken arches and innumerable <unk> windows , now , reproduced the aspect which the castle must have borne in the old time when the french <unk> saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and spoiling toward extinction .
while we still gazed and enjoyed , the ruin was suddenly enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of <unk> green fire ; then in dazzling purple ones ; then a mixture of many colors followed , then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors .
meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated , and from several rafts anchored in the river , meteor showers of rockets , <name> candles , bombs , serpents , and <name> wheels were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky  a marvelous sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as i was .
for a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day , and yet the rain was falling in torrents all the time .
the evening 's entertainment presently closed , and we joined the innumerable caravan of <unk> strangers , and waded home again .
the castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful ; and as they joined the hotel grounds , with no fences to climb , but only some nobly shaded stone stairways to descend , we spent a part of nearly every day in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves .
there was an attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables and benches ; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at his <unk> <unk> of beer while he inspected the crowd .
i say pretend , because i only pretended to sip , without really sipping .
that is the polite way ; but when you are ready to go , you empty the <unk> at a draught .
there was a brass band , and it furnished excellent music every afternoon .
sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied , every table filled .
and never a rough in the assemblage  all nicely dressed fathers and mothers , young gentlemen and ladies and children ; and plenty of university students and glittering officers ; with here and there a gray professor , or a peaceful old <name> with her knitting ; and always a sprinkling of <unk> foreigners .
everybody had his glass of beer before him , or his cup of coffee , or his bottle of wine , or his hot <unk> and potatoes ; young ladies chatted , or fanned themselves , or wrought at their <unk> or <unk> ; the students fed sugar to their dogs , or discussed duels , or illustrated new fencing tricks with their little canes ; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment , and everywhere peace and good-will to men .
the trees were jubilant with birds , and the paths with <unk> children .
one could have a seat in that place and plenty of music , any afternoon , for about eight cents , or a family ticket for the season for two dollars .
for a change , when you wanted one , you could stroll to the castle , and burrow among its dungeons , or climb about its ruined towers , or visit its interior shows  the great heidelberg <unk> , for instance .
everybody has heard of the great heidelberg <unk> , and most people have seen it , no doubt .
it is a <unk> as big as a cottage , and some traditions say it holds eighteen thousand bottles , and other traditions say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels .
i think it likely that one of these statements is a mistake , and the other is a lie .
however , the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence , since the cask is empty , and indeed has always been empty , history says .
an empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me .
i do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in , when you can get a better quality , outside , any day , free of expense .
what could this cask have been built for ?
the more one studies over that , the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes .
some historians say that thirty couples , some say thirty thousand couples , can dance on the head of this cask at the same time .
even this does not seem to me to account for the building of it .
it does not even throw light on it .
a profound and scholarly englishman  a specialist  who had made the great heidelberg <unk> his sole study for fifteen years , told me he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make <name> cream in .
he said that the average <name> cow yielded from one to two and half <unk> of milk , when she was not worked in the plow or the <unk> more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day .
this milk was very sweet and good , and a beautiful transparent bluish tint ; but in order to get cream from it in the most economical way , a peculiar process was necessary .
now he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several <unk> in a <unk> , pour it into the great <unk> , fill up with water , and then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the <name> empire demanded .
this began to look reasonable .
it certainly began to account for the <name> cream which i had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels and restaurants .
but a thought struck me  " why did not each ancient <unk> take his own <unk> of milk and his own cask of water , and mix them , without making a government matter of it ? '
" where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion of water ? "
very true .
it was plain that the englishman had studied the matter from all sides .
still i thought i might catch him on one point ; so i asked him why the modern empire did not make the nation 's cream in the heidelberg <unk> , instead of leaving it to rot away unused .
but he answered as one prepared  " a patient and diligent examination of the modern <name> cream had satisfied me that they do not use the great <unk> now , because they have got a bigger one hid away somewhere .
either that is the case or they empty the spring <unk> into the mountain torrents and then skim the rhine all summer . "
there is a museum of antiquities in the castle , and among its most treasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with <name> history .
there are hundreds of these , and their dates stretch back through many centuries .
one of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a successor of charlemagne , in the year <unk> .
a signature made by a hand which vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago , is a more impressive thing than even a ruined castle .
<name> 's <unk> was shown me ; also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our <name> , and an early <unk> .
and there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who was assassinated about sixty years ago .
the <unk> in the face were duplicated with unpleasant fidelity .
one or two real hairs still remained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast .
that trifle seemed to almost change the counterfeit into a corpse .
there are many aged portraits  some valuable , some worthless ; some of great interest , some of none at all .
i bought a couple  one a gorgeous duke of the olden time , and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel , a <name> , maybe .
i bought them to start a <unk> of my ancestors with .
i paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the <name> .
one can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these , in europe , if he <name> mouse among old picture shops and look out for chances .
appendix c. the college prison it seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws without having to answer to the public authorities .
his case must come before the university for trial and punishment .
if a policeman catches him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him , the offender proclaims that he is a student , and perhaps shows his <unk> card , whereupon the officer asks for his address , then goes his way , and reports the matter at headquarters .
if the offense is one over which the city has no jurisdiction , the authorities report the case officially to the university , and give themselves no further concern about it .
the university court send for the student , listen to the evidence , and pronounce judgment .
the punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment in the university prison .
as i understand it , a student 's case is often tried without his being present at all .
then something like this happens : a constable in the service of the university visits the lodgings of the said student , knocks , is invited to come in , does so , and says politely  " if you please , i am here to conduct you to prison . "
" ah , " says the student , " i was not expecting it .
what have i been doing ? "
" two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you . "
" it is true ; i had forgotten it .
very well : i have been complained of , tried , and found guilty  is that it ? "
" exactly .
you are sentenced to two days ' solitary confinement in the college prison , and i am sent to fetch you . "
student .
" o , i ca n't go today . "
officer .
" if you please  why ? "
student .
" because i 've got an engagement . "
officer .
" tomorrow , then , perhaps ? "
student .
" no , i am going to the opera , tomorrow . "
officer .
" could you come friday ? "
student .
( reflectively . )
" let me see  friday  friday .
i do n't seem to have anything on hand friday . "
officer .
" then , if you please , i <name> expect you on friday . "
student .
" all right , i 'll come around friday . "
officer .
" thank you .
good day , sir . "
student .
" good day . "
so on friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord , and is admitted .
it is questionable if the world 's criminal history can show a custom more odd than this .
nobody knows , now , how it originated .
there have always been many noblemen among the students , and it is presumed that all students are gentlemen ; in the old times it was usual to mar the convenience of such folk as little as possible ; perhaps this indulgent custom owes its origin to this .
one day i was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an american student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and <unk> himself to prison .
i asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as he conveniently could , so that i might try to get in there and visit him , and see what college captivity was like .
he said he would appoint the very first day he could spare .
his confinement was to endure twenty-four hours .
he shortly chose his day , and sent me word .
i started immediately .
when i reached the university place , i saw two gentlemen talking together , and , as they had <unk> under their arms , i judged they were <unk> or elderly students ; so i asked them in english to show me the college jail .
i had learned to take it for granted that anybody in germany who knows anything , knows english , so i had stopped <unk> people with my <name> .
these gentlemen seemed a trifle amused  and a trifle confused , too  but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place .
he asked me why i wanted to get in there , and i said to see a friend  and for curiosity .
he doubted if i would be admitted , but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the <unk> .
he rang the <name> , a door opened , and we stepped into a paved way and then up into a small living-room , where we were received by a hearty and good-natured <name> woman of fifty .
she threw up her hands with a surprised " ach gott , herr professor ! "
and exhibited a mighty deference for my new acquaintance .
by the <name> in her eye i judged she was a good deal amused , too .
the " herr professor " talked to her in <name> , and i understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible reasons to bear for admitting me .
they were successful .
so the herr professor received my <name> thanks and departed .
the old dame got her keys , took me up two or three flights of stairs , unlocked a door , and we stood in the presence of the criminal .
then she went into a jolly and eager description of all that had occurred downstairs , and what the herr professor had said , and so forth and so on .
plainly , she regarded it as quite a superior joke that i had waylaid a professor and employed him in so odd a service .
but i would n't have done it if i had known he was a professor ; therefore my conscience was not disturbed .
now the dame left us to ourselves .
the cell was not a roomy one ; still it was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell .
it had a window of good size , <unk> ; a small stove ; two wooden chairs ; two oaken tables , very old and most elaborately carved with names , <unk> , faces , <unk> bearings , etc.  the work of several generations of imprisoned students ; and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress , but no sheets , pillows , blankets , or <unk>  for these the student must furnish at his own cost if he wants them .
there was no carpet , of course .
the ceiling was completely covered with names , dates , and <unk> , done with <unk> .
the walls were thickly covered with pictures and portraits ( in profile ) , some done with ink , some with soot , some with a pencil , and some with red , blue , and green <unk> ; and whenever an inch or two of space had remained between the pictures , the captives had written plaintive verses , or names and dates .
i do not think i was ever in a more elaborately frescoed apartment .
against the wall <name> a placard containing the prison laws .
i made a note of one or two of these .
for instance : the prisoner must pay , for the " privilege " of entering , a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money ; for the privilege of leaving , when his term had expired , 20 cents ; for every day spent in the prison , 12 cents ; for fire and light , 12 cents a day .
the jailer furnishes coffee , mornings , for a small sum ; dinners and suppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses  and he is allowed to pay for them , too .
here and there , on the walls , appeared the names of american students , and in one place the american arms and motto were displayed in colored <unk> .
with the help of my friend i translated many of the inscriptions .
some of them were cheerful , others the reverse .
i <name> give the reader a few specimens : " in my tenth <unk> ( my best one ) , i am cast here through the complaints of others .
let those who follow me take warning . "
" iii <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> aus <unk> . "
which is to say , he had a curiosity to know what prison life was like ; so he made a breach in some law and got three days for it .
it is more than likely that he never had the same curiosity again .
( translation . )
" e. <unk> , four days for being too eager a spectator of a row . "
" f. <unk> <unk>  <unk> , ii , <unk> . "
which means that count <unk> , son of the great statesman , was a prisoner two days in 1874 .
( translation . )
" r. <unk>  for love  4 days . "
many people in this world have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion .
this one is terse .
i translate : " four weeks for <unk> gallantry . "
i wish the sufferer had explained a little more fully .
a <unk> term is a rather serious matter .
there were many uncomplimentary references , on the walls , to a certain unpopular dignitary .
one sufferer had got three days for not saluting him .
another had " here two days slept and three nights lain awake , " on account of this same " dr. k. " in one place was a picture of dr. k. hanging on a gallows .
here and there , lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by altering the records left by predecessors .
leaving the name standing , and the date and length of the captivity , they had <unk> the description of the <unk> , and written in its place , in staring capitals , " for theft ! "
or " for murder ! "
or some other gaudy crime .
in one place , all by itself , stood this blood-curdling word : " <unk> ! "
[ 1 ] 1 .
" revenge ! "
there was no name signed , and no date .
it was an inscription well calculated to pique curiosity .
one would greatly like to know the nature of the wrong that had been done , and what sort of vengeance was wanted , and whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not .
but there was no way of finding out these things .
occasionally , a name was followed simply by the remark , " ii days , for disturbing the peace , " and without comment upon the justice or injustice of the sentence .
in one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap corps with a bottle of champagne in each hand ; and below was the legend : " these make an evil fate <unk> . "
there were two prison cells , and neither had space left on walls or ceiling for another name or portrait or picture .
the inside surfaces of the two doors were completely covered with <unk> de <unk> of former prisoners , ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and injury by glass .
i very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in <unk> with their <unk> , but red tape was in the way .
the <unk> could not sell one without an order from a superior ; and that superior would have to get it from his superior ; and this one would have to get it from a higher one  and so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment .
the system was right , and nobody could find fault with it ; but it did not seem justifiable to bother so many people , so i proceeded no further .
it might have cost me more than i could afford , anyway ; for one of those prison tables , which was at the time in a private museum in heidelberg , was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars .
it was not worth more than a dollar , or possibly a dollar and half , before the captive students began their work on it .
persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it .
among them many who have tasted the college prison 's dreary hospitality was a lively young fellow from one of the southern states of <name> , whose first year 's experience of <name> university life was rather peculiar .
the day he arrived in heidelberg he enrolled his name on the college books , and was so elated with the fact that his dearest <name> had found <unk> and he was actually a student of the old and renowned university , that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event by a grand lark in company with some other students .
in the course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the <unk> most <unk> laws .
sequel : before noon , next day , he was in the college prison  booked for three months .
the twelve long weeks dragged slowly by , and the day of deliverance came at last .
a great crowd of sympathizing <unk> received him with a rousing demonstration as he came forth , and of course there was another grand lark  in the course of which he managed to make a wide breach of the city 's most <unk> laws .
sequel : before noon , next day , he was safe in the city lockup  booked for three months .
this second tedious captivity <name> to an end in the course of time , and again a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth ; but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed soberly and calmly , but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down the <unk> street from sheer excess of <name> .
sequel : he slipped and broke his leg , and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months !
when he at last became a free man again , he said he believed he would hunt up a <unk> seat of learning ; the heidelberg lectures might be good , but the opportunities of attending them were too rare , the educational process too slow ; he said he had come to europe with the idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time , but if he had averaged the heidelberg system correctly , it was rather a matter of eternity .
appendix d. the awful <name> language a little learning makes the whole world kin .
 proverbs xxxii , 7 .
i went often to look at the collection of curiosities in heidelberg castle , and one day i surprised the keeper of it with my <name> .
i spoke entirely in that language .
he was greatly interested ; and after i had talked a while he said my <name> was very rare , possibly a " unique " ; and wanted to add it to his museum .
if he had known what it had cost me to acquire my <name> , he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it .
<name> and i had been hard at work on our <name> during several weeks at that time , and although we had made good progress , it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance , for three of our teachers had died in the mean time .
a person who has not studied <name> can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is .
surely there is not another language that is so <unk> and <unk> , and so slippery and elusive to the grasp .
one is washed about in it , hither and thither , in the most helpless way ; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech , he turns over the <name> and reads , " let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions . "
he runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it .
so overboard he goes again , to hunt for another <unk> and find another quicksand .
such has been , and continues to be , my experience .
every time i think i have got one of these four confusing " cases " where i am master of it , a seemingly insignificant <unk> <unk> itself into my sentence , clothed with an awful and unsuspected power , and <unk> the ground from under me .
for instance , my book <unk> after a certain bird  ( it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody ) : " where is the bird ? "
now the answer to this question  according to the book  is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain .
of course no bird would do that , but then you must stick to the book .
very well , i begin to cipher out the <name> for that answer .
i begin at the wrong end , necessarily , for that is the <name> idea .
i say to myself , " <unk> ( rain ) is masculine  or maybe it is feminine  or possibly neuter  it is too much trouble to look now .
therefore , it is either der ( the ) <unk> , or die ( the ) <unk> , or das ( the ) <unk> , according to which <unk> it may turn out to be when i look .
in the interest of science , i <name> cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine .
very well  then the rain is der <unk> , if it is simply in the quiescent state of being mentioned , without enlargement or discussion  <unk> case ; but if this rain is lying around , in a kind of a general way on the ground , it is then definitely located , it is doing something  that is , resting ( which is one of the <name> <unk> ideas of doing something ) , and this throws the rain into the <unk> case , and makes it dem <unk> .
however , this rain is not resting , but is doing something actively ,  it is falling  to interfere with the bird , likely  and this indicates movement , which has the effect of sliding it into the <unk> case and changing dem <unk> into den <unk> . "
having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter , i answer up confidently and state in <name> that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop " <unk> ( on account of ) den <unk> . "
then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word " <unk> " drops into a sentence , it always throws that subject into the <unk> case , regardless of consequences  and therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop " <unk> des <unk> . "
n.b.  i was informed , later , by a higher authority , that there was an " exception " which permits one to say " <unk> den <unk> " in certain peculiar and complex circumstances , but that this exception is not extended to anything but rain .
there are ten parts of speech , and they are all troublesome .
an average sentence , in a <name> newspaper , is a sublime and impressive curiosity ; it occupies a quarter of a column ; it contains all the ten parts of speech  not in regular order , but mixed ; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot , and not to be found in any dictionary  six or seven words compacted into one , without joint or seam  that is , without <unk> ; it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects , each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own , with here and there extra <unk> , making pens within pens : finally , all the <unk> and <unk> are massed together between a couple of <unk> , one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it  after which comes the verb , and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about ; and after the verb  merely by way of ornament , as far as i can make out  the writer shovels in " haben sind <unk> gehabt haven <unk> <unk> , " or words to that effect , and the monument is finished .
i suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man 's signature  not necessary , but pretty .
<name> books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head  so as to reverse the construction  but i think that to learn to read and understand a <name> newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner .
yet even the <name> books are not entirely free from attacks of the parenthesis distemper  though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines , and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before .
now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent <name> novel  with a slight parenthesis in it .
i <name> make a perfectly literal translation , and throw in the <unk> and some <unk> for the assistance of the reader  though in the original there are no <unk> or <unk> , and the reader is left to <unk> through to the remote verb the best way he can : " but when he , upon the street , the ( <unk> ) government counselor 's wife met , " etc. , etc .
[ 1 ] 1 .
wenn er aber auf der <unk> der in <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> sehr <unk> nach der <unk> mode <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that is from the old <unk> 's secret , by mrs. <unk> .
and that sentence is constructed upon the most approved <name> model .
you observe how far that verb is from the reader 's base of operations ; well , in a <name> newspaper they put their verb away over on the next <name> ; and i have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and <unk> for a column or two , they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all .
of course , then , the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state .
we have the parenthesis disease in our literature , too ; and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers : but with us it is the <name> and sign of an <unk> writer or a cloudy intellect , whereas with the germans it is doubtless the <name> and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people .
for surely it is not clearness  it necessarily ca n't be clearness .
even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that .
a writer 's ideas must be a good deal confused , a good deal out of line and sequence , when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor 's wife in the street , and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he <unk> down an inventory of the woman 's dress .
that is manifestly absurd .
it reminds a person of those <unk> who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the <unk> , and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk .
<unk> in literature and <unk> are in bad taste .
the germans have another kind of parenthesis , which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it .
can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that ?
these things are called " <unk> verbs . "
the <name> grammar is blistered all over with <unk> verbs ; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart , the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance .
a favorite one is <unk> ab  which means departed .
here is an example which i <unk> from a novel and reduced to english : " the trunks being now ready , he de after kissing his mother and sisters , and once more pressing to his bosom his adored <name> , who , dressed in simple white muslin , with a single <unk> in the ample folds of her <name> brown hair , had tottered feebly down the stairs , still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening , but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself , parted . "
however , it is not well to dwell too much on the <unk> verbs .
one is sure to lose his temper early ; and if he sticks to the subject , and <name> not be warned , it <name> at last either soften his <name> or <unk> it .
personal <unk> and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language , and should have been left out .
for instance , the same sound , sie , means you , and it means she , and it means her , and it means it , and it means they , and it means them .
think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six  and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that .
but mainly , think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey .
this explains why , whenever a person says sie to me , i generally try to kill him , if a stranger .
now observe the adjective .
here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage ; therefore , for no other reason , the inventor of this language complicated it all he could .
when we wish to speak of our " good friend or friends , " in our enlightened tongue , we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it ; but with the <name> tongue it is different .
when a <name> gets his hands on an adjective , he declines it , and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it .
it is as bad as latin .
he says , for instance : singular <unk>  mein <unk> <unk> , my good friend .
<unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> , of my good friend .
<unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> , to my good friend .
<unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> , my good friend .
plural n.  meine <unk> <unk> , my good friends .
g.  <unk> <unk> <unk> , of my good friends .
d.  <unk> <unk> <unk> , to my good friends .
a.  meine <unk> <unk> , my good friends .
now let the candidate for the asylum try to <unk> those variations , and see how soon he <name> be elected .
one might better go without friends in germany than take all this trouble about them .
i have shown what a bother it is to decline a good ( male ) friend ; well this is only a third of the work , for there is a variety of new <unk> of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine , and still another when the object is neuter .
now there are more adjectives in this language than there are black cats in switzerland , and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested .
difficult ?  troublesome ?  these words can not describe it .
i heard a californian student in heidelberg say , in one of his <unk> moods , that he would rather decline two drinks than one <name> adjective .
the inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in <unk> it in every way he could think of .
for instance , if one is casually referring to a house , <unk> , or a horse , <unk> , or a dog , hund , he spells these words as i have indicated ; but if he is referring to them in the <unk> case , he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so , as an added e often signifies the plural , as the s does with us , the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of a <unk> dog before he discovers his mistake ; and on the other hand , many a new student who could ill afford loss , has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them , because he <unk> bought that dog in the <unk> singular when he really supposed he was talking plural  which left the law on the seller 's side , of course , by the strict rules of grammar , and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie .
in <name> , all the <unk> begin with a capital letter .
now that is a good idea ; and a good idea , in this language , is necessarily conspicuous from its <unk> .
i consider this <unk> of <unk> a good idea , because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it .
you fall into error occasionally , because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing , and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it .
<name> names almost always do mean something , and this helps to deceive the student .
i translated a passage one day , which said that " the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest " ( <unk> ) .
when i was <unk> up my loins to doubt this , i found out that <unk> in this instance was a man 's name .
every noun has a <unk> , and there is no sense or system in the distribution ; so the <unk> of each must be learned separately and by heart .
there is no other way .
to do this one has to have a memory like a <unk> .
in <name> , a young <name> has no sex , while a turnip has .
think what <unk> reverence that shows for the turnip , and what <unk> disrespect for the girl .
see how it looks in print  i translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the <name> sunday-school books : " <name> .
wilhelm , where is the turnip ?
" wilhelm .
she has gone to the kitchen .
" <name> .
where is the accomplished and beautiful english maiden ?
" wilhelm .
it has gone to the opera . "
to continue with the <name> <unk> : a tree is male , its buds are female , its leaves are neuter ; horses are <unk> , dogs are male , cats are female  <unk> included , of course ; a person 's mouth , neck , bosom , elbows , fingers , nails , feet , and body are of the male sex , and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it , and not according to the sex of the individual who wears it  for in germany all the women wear either male heads or <unk> ones ; a person 's nose , lips , shoulders , breast , hands , and toes are of the female sex ; and his hair , ears , eyes , <name> , legs , knees , heart , and conscience have n't any sex at all .
the inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay .
now , by the above dissection , the reader <name> see that in germany a man may think he is a man , but when he comes to look into the matter closely , he is bound to have his doubts ; he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture ; and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine , the humiliating second thought <name> quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land .
in the <name> it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language , a woman is a female ; but a wife ( <unk> ) is not  which is unfortunate .
a wife , here , has no sex ; she is neuter ; so , according to the grammar , a fish is he , his scales are she , but a <unk> is neither .
to describe a wife as <unk> may be called <unk> ; that is bad enough , but <unk> is surely worse .
a <name> speaks of an englishman as the <unk> ; to change the sex , he adds inn , and that stands for <unk>  <unk> .
that seems descriptive enough , but still it is not exact enough for a <name> ; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine , and writes it down thus : " die <unk> , "  which means " the <unk> . "
i consider that that person is <unk> .
well , after the student has learned the sex of a great number of <unk> , he is still in a difficulty , because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as " he " and " she , " and " him " and " her , " which it has been always accustomed to refer to as " it . "
when he even frames a <name> sentence in his mind , with the <unk> and hers in the right places , and then works up his courage to the <unk> , it is no use  the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and all those labored males and females come out as " its . "
and even when he is reading <name> to himself , he always calls those things " it , " whereas he ought to read in this way : tale of the <unk> and its sad fate [ 2 ] 2 .
i <unk> the <unk> , in the <name> ( and ancient english ) fashion .
it is a bleak day .
hear the rain , how he pours , and the hail , how he rattles ; and see the snow , how he drifts along , and of the mud , how deep he is !
ah the poor <unk> , it is stuck fast in the mire ; it has dropped its basket of fishes ; and its hands have been cut by the scales as it seized some of the falling creatures ; and one scale has even got into its eye , and it can not get her out .
it opens its mouth to cry for help ; but if any sound comes out of him , alas he is drowned by the raging of the storm .
and now a <unk> has got one of the fishes and she <name> surely escape with him .
no , she bites off a fin , she holds her in her mouth  <name> she swallow her ?
no , the <unk> 's brave <unk> deserts his puppies and <unk> the fin  which he eats , himself , as his reward .
o , horror , the lightning has struck the <unk> ; he sets him on fire ; see the flame , how she licks the doomed <unk> with her red and angry tongue ; now she attacks the helpless <unk> 's foot  she burns him up , all but the big toe , and even she is partly consumed ; and still she spreads , still she waves her fiery tongues ; she attacks the <unk> 's leg and destroys it ; she attacks its hand and destroys her also ; she attacks the <unk> 's leg and destroys her also ; she attacks its body and <unk> him ; she <unk> herself about its heart and it is consumed ; next about its breast , and in a moment she is a cinder ; now she reaches its neck  he goes ; now its <name>  it goes ; now its nose  she goes .
in another moment , except help come , the <unk> <name> be no more .
time presses  is there none to succor and save ?
yes !
<name> , <name> , with flying feet the <unk> comes !
but alas , the generous <unk> is too late : where now is the fated <unk> ?
it has ceased from its sufferings , it has gone to a better land ; all that is left of it for its loved ones to lament over , is this poor <unk> <unk> .
ah , <unk> , <unk> <unk> !
let us take him up tenderly , reverently , upon the lowly shovel , and bear him to his long rest , with the prayer that when he rises again it <name> be a realm where he <name> have one good square responsible sex , and have it all to himself , instead of having a mangy lot of assorted sexes scattered all over him in spots .
there , now , the reader can see for himself that this <unk> business is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue .
i suppose that in all languages the <unk> of look and sound between words which have no similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the foreigner .
it is so in our tongue , and it is notably the case in the <name> .
now there is that troublesome word <unk> : to me it has so close a resemblance  either real or fancied  to three or four other words , that i never know whether it means despised , painted , suspected , or married ; until i look in the dictionary , and then i find it means the latter .
there are lots of such words and they are a great torment .
to increase the difficulty there are words which seem to resemble each other , and yet do not ; but they make just as much trouble as if they did .
for instance , there is the word <unk> ( to let , to lease , to hire ) ; and the word <unk> ( another way of saying to marry ) .
i heard of an englishman who knocked at a man 's door in heidelberg and proposed , in the best <name> he could command , to " <unk> " that house .
then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize the first syllable , but mean something very different if you throw the emphasis on the last syllable .
for instance , there is a word which means a runaway , or the act of glancing through a book , according to the placing of the emphasis ; and another word which signifies to associate with a man , or to avoid him , according to where you put the emphasis  and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble .
there are some exceedingly useful words in this language .
<unk> , for example ; and <unk> .
there are three-quarters of a column of <unk> in the <unk> , and a column and a half of <unk> .
the word <unk> means blow , stroke , dash , hit , shock , clap , slap , time , bar , coin , stamp , kind , sort , manner , way , apoplexy , <unk> , enclosure , field , <unk> .
this is its simple and exact meaning  that is to say , its restricted , its fettered meaning ; but there are ways by which you can set it free , so that it can soar away , as on the wings of the morning , and never be at rest .
you can <name> any word you please to its tail , and make it mean anything you want to .
you can begin with <unk> , which means artery , and you can <name> on the whole dictionary , word by word , clear through the alphabet to <unk> , which means <unk>  and including <unk> , which means mother-in-law .
just the same with <unk> .
strictly speaking , <unk> means pull , tug , draught , procession , march , progress , flight , direction , expedition , train , caravan , passage , stroke , touch , line , flourish , trait of character , feature , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , team , whiff , bias , drawer , propensity , <unk> , disposition : but that thing which it does not mean  when all its legitimate <unk> have been <name> on , has not been discovered yet .
one can not <unk> the usefulness of <unk> and <unk> .
armed just with these two , and the word also , what can not the foreigner on <name> soil accomplish ?
the <name> word also is the equivalent of the english phrase " you know , " and does not mean anything at all  in talk , though it sometimes does in print .
every time a <name> opens his mouth an also falls out ; and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was trying to get out .
now , the foreigner , equipped with these three <name> words , is master of the situation .
let him talk right along , fearlessly ; let him pour his indifferent <name> forth , and when he lacks for a word , let him heave a <unk> into the vacuum ; all the chances are that it fits it like a plug , but if it does n't let him promptly heave a <unk> after it ; the two together can hardly fail to bung the hole ; but if , by a miracle , they should fail , let him simply say also !
and this <name> give him a moment's chance to think of the needful word .
in germany , when you load your conversational gun it is always best to throw in a <unk> or two and a <unk> or two , because it does n't make any difference how much the rest of the charge may scatter , you are bound to bag something with them .
then you blandly say also , and load up again .
nothing gives such an air of <name> and elegance and <unk> to a <name> or an english conversation as to scatter it full of " also 's " or " you knows . "
in my note-book i find this entry : july 1.  in the hospital yesterday , a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patient  a north <name> from near hamburg ; but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place , under the impression that he contained a panorama , he died .
the sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community .
that paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject  the length of <name> words .
some <name> words are so long that they have a perspective .
observe these examples : <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
these things are not words , they are <unk> processions .
and they are not rare ; one can open a <name> newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the <name>  and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music , too .
they impart a martial thrill to the <unk> subject .
i take a great interest in these curiosities .
whenever i come across a good one , i stuff it and put it in my museum .
in this way i have made quite a valuable collection .
when i get duplicates , i exchange with other collectors , and thus increase the variety of my stock .
here are some specimens which i lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac <name> : <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the printed <name> , it <unk> and <unk> that literary landscape  but at the same time it is a great distress to the new student , for it blocks up his way ; he can not crawl under it , or climb over it , or tunnel through it .
so he resorts to the dictionary for help , but there is no help there .
the dictionary must draw the line somewhere  so it leaves this sort of words out .
and it is right , because these long things are hardly legitimate words , but are rather combinations of words , and the inventor of them ought to have been killed .
they are compound words with the <unk> left out .
the various words used in building them are in the dictionary , but in a very scattered condition ; so you can hunt the materials out , one by one , and get at the meaning at last , but it is a tedious and harassing business .
i have tried this process upon some of the above examples .
" <unk> " seems to be " friendship demonstrations , " which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying " demonstrations of friendship . "
" <unk> " seems to be " <unk> , " which is no improvement upon " declarations of independence , " so far as i can see .
" <unk> " seems to be " <unk> , " as nearly as i can get at it  a mere <unk> , <unk> <unk> for " meetings of the legislature , " i judge .
we used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature , but it has gone out now .
we used to speak of a thing as a " never-to-be-forgotten " circumstance , instead of <unk> it into the simple and sufficient word " memorable " and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened .
in those days we were not content to <unk> the thing and bury it decently , we wanted to build a monument over it .
but in our newspapers the <unk> lingers a little to the present day , but with the <unk> left out , in the <name> fashion .
this is the shape it takes : instead of saying " mr. simmons , clerk of the county and district courts , was in town yesterday , " the new form puts it thus : " clerk of the county and district courts simmons was in town yesterday . "
this saves neither time nor ink , and has an awkward sound besides .
one often sees a remark like this in our papers : " mrs. assistant district attorney <name> returned to her city residence yesterday for the season . "
that is a case of really unjustifiable <unk> ; because it not only saves no time or trouble , but <unk> a title on mrs. <name> which she has no right to .
but these little instances are trifles indeed , contrasted with the ponderous and dismal <name> system of piling <unk> compounds together .
i wish to submit the following local item , from a <unk> journal , by way of illustration : " in the <unk> night , the <unk> called 'the <unk> ' was <unk> .
when the fire to the <unk> stork 's nest reached , flew the parent storks away .
but when the <unk> , <unk> nest itself caught fire , straightway plunged the <unk> <unk> into the flames and died , her wings over her young ones <unk> . "
even the <unk> <name> construction is not able to take the pathos out of that picture  indeed , it somehow seems to strengthen it .
this item is dated away back yonder months ago .
i could have used it sooner , but i was waiting to hear from the <unk> .
i am still waiting .
" also ! "
if i had not shown that the <name> is a difficult language , i have at least intended to do so .
i have heard of an american student who was asked how he was getting along with his <name> , and who answered promptly : " i am not getting along at all .
i have worked at it hard for three level months , and all i have got to show for it is one solitary <name> phrase  <unk> <unk> ' " ( two glasses of beer ) .
he paused for a moment , reflectively ; then added with feeling : " but i 've got that solid ! "
and if i have not also shown that <name> is a harassing and <unk> study , my execution has been at fault , and not my intent .
i heard lately of a worn and sorely tried american student who used to fly to a certain <name> word for relief when he could bear up under his <unk> no longer  the only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and healing to his <unk> spirit .
this was the word <unk> .
it was only the sound that helped him , not the meaning ; [ 3 ] and so , at last , when he learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable , his only stay and support was gone , and he faded away and died .
3 .
it merely means , in its general sense , " herewith . "
i think that a description of any loud , stirring , tumultuous episode must be <unk> in <name> than in english .
our descriptive words of this character have such a deep , strong , <unk> sound , while their <name> equivalents do seem so thin and mild and <unk> .
boom , burst , crash , roar , storm , bellow , blow , thunder , explosion ; howl , cry , shout , yell , groan ; battle , hell .
these are magnificent words ; the have a force and magnitude of sound <unk> the things which they describe .
but their <name> equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with , or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds .
would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a <unk> ?
or would not a <unk> feel too much bundled up , who was about to go out , in a <unk> and a <unk> , into a storm which the <unk> word <unk> was employed to describe ?
and observe the strongest of the several <name> equivalents for explosion  <unk> .
our word <unk> is more powerful than that .
it seems to me that the germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with .
the <name> word for hell  <unk>  sounds more like <unk> than anything else ; therefore , how necessarily <unk> , frivolous , and <unk> it is .
if a man were told in <name> to go there , could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted ?
having pointed out , in detail , the several vices of this language , i now come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues .
the <unk> of the <unk> i have already mentioned .
but far before this virtue stands another  that of spelling a word according to the sound of it .
after one short lesson in the alphabet , the student can tell how any <name> word is pronounced without having to ask ; whereas in our language if a student should inquire of us , " what does b , o , w , spell ? "
we should be obliged to reply , " nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off by itself ; you can only tell by referring to the <unk> and finding out what it signifies  whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with , or a nod of one 's head , or the forward end of a boat . "
there are some <name> words which are singularly and powerfully effective .
for instance , those which describe lowly , peaceful , and affectionate home life ; those which deal with love , in any and all forms , from mere kindly feeling and honest good <name> toward the passing stranger , clear up to courtship ; those which deal with outdoor nature , in its softest and loveliest aspects  with meadows and forests , and birds and flowers , the fragrance and <name> of summer , and the moonlight of peaceful <name> nights ; in a word , those which deal with any and all forms of rest , repose , and peace ; those also which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland ; and lastly and chiefly , in those words which express pathos , is the language <unk> <name> and <unk> .
there are <name> songs which can make a stranger to the language cry .
that shows that the sound of the words is correct  it <unk> the meanings with truth and with exactness ; and so the ear is informed , and through the ear , the heart .
the germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the right one .
they repeat it several times , if they choose .
that is wise .
but in english , when we have used a word a couple of times in a paragraph , we imagine we are growing <unk> , and so we are weak enough to exchange it for some other word which only <unk> exactness , to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish .
repetition may be bad , but surely <unk> is worse .
there are people in the world who <name> take a great deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion or a language , and then go blandly about their business without suggesting any remedy .
i am not that kind of person .
i have shown that the <name> language needs reforming .
very well , i am ready to reform it .
at least i am ready to make the proper suggestions .
such a course as this might be <unk> in another ; but i have devoted upward of nine full weeks , first and last , to a careful and critical study of this tongue , and thus have acquired a confidence in my ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have conferred upon me .
in the first place , i would leave out the <unk> case .
it <unk> the <unk> ; and , besides , nobody ever knows when he is in the <unk> case , except he discover it by accident  and then he does not know when or where it was that he got into it , or how long he has been in it , or how he is ever going to get out of it again .
the <unk> case is but an ornamental folly  it is better to discard it .
in the next place , i would move the verb further up to the front .
you may load up with ever so good a verb , but i notice that you never really bring down a subject with it at the present <name> range  you only cripple it .
so i insist that this important part of speech should be brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked eye .
thirdly , i would import some strong words from the english tongue  to swear with , and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things in a vigorous way .
[ 4 ] 1 .
" <unk> , " and its variations and <unk> , are words which have plenty of meaning , but the sounds are so mild and ineffectual that <name> ladies can use them without sin .
<name> ladies who could not be induced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion , promptly rip out one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or do n't like the soup .
it sounds about as wicked as our " my gracious . "
<name> ladies are constantly saying , " ach !
gott ! "
" mein gott ! "
" gott in <unk> ! "
" herr gott " " der herr <name> ! "
etc .
they think our ladies have the same custom , perhaps ; for i once heard a gentle and lovely old <name> <name> say to a sweet young american girl : " the two languages are so alike  how pleasant that is ; we say <unk> !
gott ! '
you say <unk> . ' "
fourthly , i would <unk> the sexes , and distribute them accordingly to the <name> of the creator .
this as a tribute of respect , if nothing else .
fifthly , i would do away with those great long compounded words ; or require the speaker to deliver them in sections , with <unk> for refreshments .
to wholly do away with them would be best , for ideas are more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when they come in bulk .
intellectual food is like any other ; it is pleasanter and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel .
<unk> , i would require a speaker to stop when he is done , and not <name> a string of those useless " haven sind <unk> gehabt haben <unk> <unk> " to the end of his oration .
this sort of <unk> <unk> a speech , instead of adding a <name> .
they are , therefore , an offense , and should be discarded .
<unk> , i would discard the parenthesis .
also the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and likewise the final <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i would require every individual , be he high or low , to unfold a plain straightforward tale , or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace .
<unk> of this law should be <unk> with death .
and <unk> , and last , i would retain <unk> and <unk> , with their <unk> , and discard the rest of the vocabulary .
this would simplify the language .
i have now named what i regard as the most necessary and important changes .
these are perhaps all i could be expected to name for nothing ; but there are other suggestions which i can and <name> make in case my proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the government in the work of reforming the language .
my <unk> studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english ( barring spelling and pronouncing ) in thirty hours , french in thirty days , and <name> in thirty years .
it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired .
if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it .
a fourth of july oration in the <name> tongue , delivered at a banquet of the <unk> club of students by the author of this book gentlemen : since i arrived , a month ago , in this old wonderland , this vast garden of germany , my english tongue has so often proved a useless piece of baggage to me , and so troublesome to <name> around , in a country where they have n't the checking system for luggage , that i finally set to work , and learned the <name> language .
also !
es <unk> mich dass dies so ist , <unk> es muss , in ein <unk> degree , <unk> <unk> , dass man auf ein occasion like this , <unk> <unk> in die <unk> des <unk> <unk> he boards , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> habe ich , aus <unk> <unk>  no , <unk>  no , i mean <unk>  aus <unk> <unk> habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the <name> language , um <unk> <unk> !
also !
sie <unk> so <unk> <unk> , und <unk> mich die <unk> <name> ein oder <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> und da , <unk> ich <unk> dass die <unk> is not a very copious language , and so when you 've really got anything to say , you 've got to draw on a language that can stand the strain .
wenn <unk> man <unk> nicht <unk> <unk> <unk> , so <unk> ich <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , wenn er <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> haben <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( i do n't know what <unk> haben <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> means , but i notice they always put it at the end of a <name> sentence  merely for general literary <unk> , i suppose . )
this is a great and justly honored day  a day which is worthy of the veneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and nationalities  a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and speech ; und <unk> <unk>  no , <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  well , take your choice , they 're all the same price ; i do n't know which one is right  also !
ich habe gehabt haben <unk> <unk> <unk> , as goethe says in his paradise lost  ich  ich  that is to say  ich  but let us change cars .
also !
die <unk> so <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> concord , ist <unk> a welcome and <unk> spectacle .
and what has moved you to it ?
can the terse <name> tongue rise to the expression of this impulse ?
is it <unk> ?
nein , o nein !
this is a crisp and <name> word , but it fails to pierce the marrow of the impulse which has gathered this friendly meeting and produced <unk> <unk>  eine <unk> <unk> ist gut zu <unk>  gut <unk> die <unk> in a foreign land and a far country  eine <unk> <unk> <unk> in die <unk> <unk> phrase <unk> man ein " <unk> <unk> ! "
<name> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
also !
die <unk> auf dem <unk> <unk> <unk> ist , aber <unk> <unk> nicht so <unk> , <unk> ' gott !
because sie sind <unk> <unk> , in <unk> concord , ein <unk> tag zu <unk> , whose high benefits were not for one land and one locality , but have conferred a measure of good upon all lands that know <name> today , and love it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> die <unk> und die <unk> <unk> ; aber <unk> sind sie <unk> <unk> , gott <unk> dank !
may this good-fellowship endure ; may these banners here blended in amity so remain ; may they never any more wave over opposing hosts , or be stained with blood which was kindred , is kindred , and always <name> be kindred , until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to say : " this bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins of the descendant ! "
appendix e. legend of the castles called the " swallow 's nest " and " the brothers , " as condensed from the captain 's tale in the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the swallow 's nest and the larger castle between it and <unk> were owned and occupied by two old knights who were twin brothers , and bachelors .
they had no relatives .
they were very <name> .
they had fought through the wars and retired to private life  covered with honorable scars .
they were honest , honorable men in their dealings , but the people had given them a couple of nicknames which were very suggestive  herr <unk> and herr heartless .
the old knights were so proud of these names that if a <unk> called them by their right ones they would correct them .
the most renowned scholar in europe , at the time , was the herr doctor <unk> <unk> , who lived in heidelberg .
all germany was proud of the venerable scholar , who lived in the simplest way , for great scholars are always poor .
he was poor , as to money , but very <name> in his sweet young daughter <name> and his library .
he had been all his life collecting his library , book and book , and he lived it as a miser loves his <unk> gold .
he said the two strings of his heart were rooted , the one in his daughter , the other in his books ; and that if either were severed he must die .
now in an evil hour , hoping to win a marriage portion for his child , this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper to be ventured in a glittering speculation .
but that was not the worst of it : he signed a paper  without reading it .
that is the way with poets and scholars ; they always sign without reading .
this cunning paper made him responsible for heaps of things .
the rest was that one night he found himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold !  an amount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it .
it was a night of woe in that house .
" i must part with my library  i have nothing else .
so <unk> one <unk> , " said the old man .
" what <name> it bring , father ? "
asked the girl .
" nothing !
it is worth seven hundred pieces of gold ; but by auction it <name> go for little or nothing . "
" then you <name> have parted with the half of your heart and the <name> of your life to no purpose , since so mighty a burden of debt <name> remain behind . "
" there is no help for it , my child .
our darlings must pass under the hammer .
we must pay what we can . "
" my father , i have a feeling that the dear virgin <name> come to our help .
let us not lose heart . "
" she can not devise a miracle that <name> turn nothing into eight thousand gold pieces , and lesser help <name> bring us little peace . "
" she can do even greater things , my father .
she <name> save us , i know she <name> . "
toward morning , while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair where he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his beloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the <unk> of empty desolation , his daughter sprang into the room and gently woke him , saying  " my presentiment was true !
she <name> save us .
three times has she appeared to me in my dreams , and said , 'go to the herr <unk> , go to the herr heartless , ask them to come and bid . '
there , did i not tell you she would save us , the thrice blessed virgin ! "
sad as the old man was , he was obliged to laugh .
" thou <unk> as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as to the harder ones that lie in those men 's breasts , my child .
they bid on books writ in the learned tongues !  they can scarce read their own . "
but <name> 's <name> was in no wise shaken .
bright and early she was on her way up the neckar road , as joyous as a bird .
meantime herr <unk> and herr heartless were having an early breakfast in the former 's castle  the sparrow 's nest  and <unk> it with a quarrel ; for although these twins bore a love for each other which almost amounted to worship , there was one subject upon which they could not touch without calling each other hard names  and yet it was the subject which they oftenest touched upon .
" i tell you , " said <unk> , " you <name> beggar yourself yet with your insane <unk> of money upon what you choose to consider poor and worthy objects .
all these years i have implored you to stop this foolish custom and husband your means , but all in vain .
you are always lying to me about these secret <unk> , but you never have managed to deceive me yet .
every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet i have detected your hand in it  <unk> ass ! "
" every time you did n't set him on his feet yourself , you mean .
where i give one unfortunate a little private lift , you do the same for a dozen .
the idea of your swelling around the country and petting yourself with the nickname of <unk>  intolerable humbug !
before i would be such a fraud as that , i would cut my right hand off .
your life is a continual lie .
but go on , i have tried my best to save you from <unk> yourself by your riotous charities  now for the thousandth time i wash my hands of the consequences .
a <unk> old fool !
that 's what you are . "
" and you a <unk> old idiot ! "
roared <unk> , springing up .
" i wo n't stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to call me such names .
<unk> swine ! "
so saying , herr heartless sprang up in a passion .
but some lucky accident intervened , as usual , to change the subject , and the daily quarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation .
the gray-headed old <unk> parted , and herr heartless walked off to his own castle .
half an hour later , <name> was standing in the presence of herr <unk> .
he heard her story , and said  " i am sorry for you , my child , but i am very poor , i care nothing for <unk> rubbish , i shall not be there . "
he said the hard words kindly , but they nearly broke poor <unk> heart , nevertheless .
when she was gone the old <unk> muttered , rubbing his hands  " it was a good stroke .
i have saved my brother 's pocket this time , in spite of him .
nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to rescue the old scholar , the pride of germany , from his trouble .
the poor child wo n't venture near him after the <unk> she has received from his brother the <unk> . "
but he was mistaken .
the virgin had commanded , and <name> would obey .
she went to herr heartless and told her story .
but he said coldly  " i am very poor , my child , and books are nothing to me .
i wish you well , but i shall not come . "
when <name> was gone , he chuckled and said  " how my fool of a <unk> <unk> brother would rage if he knew how cunningly i have saved his pocket .
how he would have flown to the old man 's rescue !
but the girl wo n't venture near him now . "
when <name> reached home , her father asked her how she had prospered .
she said  " the virgin has promised , and she <name> keep her word ; but not in the way i thought .
she knows her own ways , and they are best . "
the old man patted her on the head , and smiled a doubting smile , but he honored her for her brave <name> , nevertheless .
ii next day the people assembled in the great hall of the ritter tavern , to witness the auction  for the proprietor had said the treasure of germany 's most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place .
<name> and her father sat close to the books , silent and sorrowful , and holding each other 's hands .
there was a great crowd of people present .
the bidding began  " how much for this precious library , just as it stands , all complete ? "
called the auctioneer .
" fifty pieces of gold ! "
" a hundred ! "
" two hundred . "
" three ! "
" four ! "
" five hundred ! "
" five twenty-five . "
a brief pause .
" five forty ! "
a longer pause , while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions .
" <unk> ! "
a heavy drag  the auctioneer persuaded , pleaded , implored  it was useless , everybody remained silent  " well , then  going , going  one  two  " " five hundred and fifty ! "
this in a shrill voice , from a bent old man , all <name> with rags , and with a green patch over his left eye .
everybody in his vicinity turned and gazed at him .
it was <unk> in disguise .
he was using a disguised voice , too .
" good ! "
cried the auctioneer .
" going , going  one  two  " " five hundred and sixty ! "
this , in a deep , harsh voice , from the midst of the crowd at the other end of the room .
the people near by turned , and saw an old man , in a strange costume , supporting himself on crutches .
he wore a long white beard , and blue spectacles .
it was herr heartless , in disguise , and using a disguised voice .
" good again !
going , going  one  " " six hundred ! "
sensation .
the crowd raised a cheer , and some one cried out , " go it , <unk> ! "
this tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted , " go it , <unk> ! "
" going  going  going  third and last call  one  two  " " seven hundred ! "
" <unk> !  well done , crutches ! "
cried a voice .
the crowd took it up , and shouted altogether , " well done , crutches ! "
" splendid , gentlemen !
you are doing magnificently .
going , going  " " a thousand ! "
" three cheers for <unk> !
up and at him , crutches ! "
" going  going  " " two thousand ! "
and while the people cheered and shouted , " crutches " muttered , " who can this devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books ?  but no matter , he sha'n't have them .
the pride of germany shall have his books if it beggars me to buy them for him . "
" going , going , going  " " three thousand ! "
" come , everybody  give a <unk> for <unk> ! "
and while they did it , " <unk> " muttered , " this cripple is plainly a lunatic ; but the old scholar shall have his books , nevertheless , though my pocket sweat for it . "
" going  going  " " four thousand ! "
" huzza ! "
" five thousand ! "
" huzza ! "
" six thousand ! "
" huzza ! "
" seven thousand ! "
" huzza ! "
" eight thousand ! "
" we are saved , father !
i told you the holy virgin would keep her word ! "
" blessed be her sacred name ! "
said the old scholar , with emotion .
the crowd roared , " huzza , huzza , huzza  at him again , <unk> ! "
" going  going  " " ten thousand ! "
as <unk> shouted this , his excitement was so great that he forgot himself and used his natural voice .
his brother recognized it , and muttered , under cover of the storm of cheers  " aha , you are there , are you , <unk> old fool ?
take the books , i know what you 'll do with them ! "
so saying , he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end .
<unk> shouldered his way to <name> , whispered a word in her ear , and then he also vanished .
the old scholar and his daughter embraced , and the former said , " truly the holy mother has done more than she promised , child , for she has given you a splendid marriage portion  think of it , two thousand pieces of gold ! "
" and more still , " cried <name> , " for she has given you back your books ; the stranger whispered me that he would none of them  'the honored son of germany must keep them , ' so he said .
i would i might have asked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing ; but he was our <name> 's <name> , and it is not meet that we of earth should venture speech with them that dwell above . "
appendix f. <name> journals the daily journals of hamburg , frankfort , <unk> , munich , and <unk> are all constructed on the same general plan .
i speak of these because i am more familiar with them than with any other <name> papers .
they contain no " <unk> " whatever ; no " <unk> "  and this is rather a merit than a <unk> , perhaps ; no <unk> column ; no <unk> reports ; no reports of proceedings of higher courts ; no information about <unk> or other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or other sporting matters of any sort ; no reports of banquet speeches ; no department of curious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip ; no " rumors " about anything or anybody ; no <unk> or prophecies about anything or anybody ; no lists of patents granted or sought , or any reference to such things ; no abuse of public officials , big or little , or complaints against them , or praises of them ; no religious columns saturdays , no <unk> of cold sermons <unk> ; no " weather indications " ; no " local item " <unk> of what is happening in town  nothing of a local nature , indeed , is mentioned , beyond the movements of some <name> , or the proposed meeting of some <unk> body .
after so formidable a list of what one ca n't find in a <name> daily , the question may well be asked , what can be found in it ?
it is easily answered : a child 's handful of telegrams , mainly about european national and international political movements ; <unk> about the same things ; market reports .
there you have it .
that is what a <name> daily is made of .
a <name> daily is the slowest and saddest and <unk> of the inventions of man .
our own <unk> <unk> the reader , pretty often ; the <name> daily only <unk> him .
once a week the <name> daily of the highest class <unk> up its heavy columns  that is , it thinks it <unk> them up  with a profound , an <unk> , book criticism ; a criticism which carries you down , down , down into the scientific bowels of the subject  for the <name> critic is nothing if not scientific  and when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see the <name> daylight once more , you resolve without a <unk> voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up a <name> daily .
sometimes , in place of the criticism , the first-class daily gives you what it thinks is a <name> and <unk> essay  about ancient grecian funeral customs , or the ancient egyptian method of <unk> a mummy , or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the flood did not approve of cats .
these are not unpleasant subjects ; they are not uninteresting subjects ; they are even exciting subjects  until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them .
he soon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way as to make a person low-spirited .
as i have said , the average <name> daily is made up solely of <unk>  a trifle of it by telegraph , the rest of it by mail .
every paragraph has the <unk> , " london , " " vienna , " or some other town , and a date .
and always , before the name of the town , is placed a letter or a sign , to indicate who the correspondent is , so that the authorities can find him when they want to <name> him .
stars , crosses , triangles , squares , <unk> , suns  such are some of the signs used by correspondents .
some of the <unk> move too fast , others too slowly .
for instance , my heidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at the hotel ; but one of my munich evening papers used to come a full twenty-four hours before it was due .
some of the less important <unk> give one a <unk> of a continued story every day ; it is strung across the bottom of the <name> , in the french fashion .
by <unk> for the paper for five years i judge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story .
if you ask a citizen of munich which is the best munich daily journal , he <name> always tell you that there is only one good munich daily , and that it is published in <unk> , forty or fifty miles away .
it is like saying that the best daily paper in new york is published out in new jersey somewhere .
yes , the <unk> <unk> zeitung is " the best munich paper , " and it is the one i had in my mind when i was describing a " first-class <name> daily " above .
the entire paper , opened out , is not quite as large as a single <name> of the new york herald .
it is printed on both sides , of course ; but in such large type that its entire contents could be put , in herald type , upon a single <name> of the herald  and there would still be room enough on the <name> for the <unk> " supplement " and some portion of the zeitung 's next day 's contents .
such is the first-class daily .
the <unk> actually printed in munich are all called second-class by the public .
if you ask which is the best of these second-class papers they say there is no difference ; one is as good as another .
i have preserved a copy of one of them ; it is called the <unk> <unk> , and bears date <name> 25 , 1879 .
comparisons are odious , but they need not be malicious ; and without any malice i wish to compare this journal , published in a <name> city of <unk> inhabitants , with journals of other countries .
i know of no other way to enable the reader to " size " the thing .
a column of an average daily paper in <name> contains from <unk> to <unk> words ; the <unk> in a single issue consists of from 25,000 to 50,000 words .
the <unk> in my copy of the munich journal consists of a total of <unk> words  for i counted them .
that would be nearly a column of one of our <unk> .
a single issue of the <unk> daily newspaper in the world  the london times  often contains 100,000 words of <unk> .
considering that the daily <unk> issues the usual twenty-six <name> per month , the reading matter in a single number of the london times would keep it in " copy " two months and a half .
the <unk> is an <unk> paper ; its <name> is one inch wider and one inch longer than a <unk> <name> ; that is to say , the dimensions of its <name> are somewhere between those of a schoolboy 's slate and a lady's pocket handkerchief .
one-fourth of the first <name> is taken up with the heading of the journal ; this gives it a rather <unk> appearance ; the rest of the first <name> is <unk> ; all of the second <name> is <unk> ; the other six pages are devoted to advertisements .
the <unk> is compressed into two hundred and five <unk> lines , and is lighted up with eight <unk> headlines .
the <name> of fare is as follows : first , under a <unk> <unk> , to enforce attention and respect , is a <unk> sermon urging mankind to remember that , although they are pilgrims here below , they are yet heirs of heaven ; and that " when they depart from earth they soar to heaven . "
perhaps a <unk> sermon in a saturday paper is the sufficient <name> equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the <unk> get in their monday morning papers .
the latest news ( two days old ) follows the <unk> sermon , under the <unk> <unk> " telegrams "  these are " telegraphed " with a pair of scissors out of the <unk> zeitung of the day before .
these telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines from berlin , fifteen lines from vienna , and two and <unk> lines from calcutta .
thirty-three <unk> lines of telegraphic news in a daily journal in a king 's capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an <unk> .
next we have the <unk> heading , " news of the day , " under which the following facts are set forth : <name> leopold is going on a visit to vienna , six lines ; <name> <unk> is coming back from russia , two lines ; the <unk> <name> meet at ten o'clock in the morning and consider an election law , three lines and one word over ; a city government item , five and one-half lines ; prices of tickets to the proposed grand <name> ball , twenty-three lines  for this one item occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first <name> ; there is to be a wonderful wagner concert in <unk> , with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments , seven and one-half lines .
that concludes the first <name> .
eighty-five lines , altogether , on that <name> , including three headlines .
about fifty of those lines , as one perceives , deal with local matters ; so the reporters are not overworked .
exactly one-half of the second <name> is occupied with an opera criticism , fifty-three lines ( three of them being headlines ) , and " death notices , " ten lines .
the other half of the second <name> is made up of two paragraphs under the head of " miscellaneous news . "
one of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the czar of russia and his eldest son , twenty-one and a half lines ; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents , forty lines , or one-fifth of the total of the <unk> contained in the paper .
consider what a fifth part of the <unk> of an american daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to !
think what a mass it is .
would any one suppose i could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again if the reader lost his place ?
surely not .
i <name> translate that <unk> word for word , to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the <unk> of a munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye : " from <unk> , <name> 21st , the <unk> zeitung receives a long account of a crime , which we shortened as follows : in <unk> , a village near <unk> , lived a young married couple with two children , one of which , a boy aged five , was born three years before the marriage .
for this reason , and also because a relative at <unk> had bequeathed <unk> ( $ 100 ) to the boy , the heartless father considered him in the way ; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the <unk> possible manner .
they proceeded to starve him slowly to death , meantime frightfully <unk> him  as the village people now make known , when it is too late .
the boy was shut in a hole , and when people passed by he cried , and implored them to give him bread .
his long-continued tortures and <unk> destroyed him at last , on the third of <name> .
the sudden ( sic ) death of the child created suspicion , the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier .
therefore the coroner gave notice , and an inquest was held on the 6th .
what a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then !
the body was a complete skeleton .
the stomach and intestines were utterly empty ; they contained nothing whatsoever .
the flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife , and <unk> in it brought not one drop of blood .
there was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body ; wounds , scars , bruises , discolored <unk> blood , everywhere  even on the soles of the feet there were wounds .
the cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments , and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck .
however , they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at <unk> . "
yes , they were arrested " two weeks after the inquest . "
what a home sound that has .
that kind of police <unk> rather more reminds me of my native land than <name> journalism does .
i think a <name> daily journal does n't do any good to speak of , but at the same time it does n't do any harm .
that is a very large merit , and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of .
the <name> humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper , and the illustrations are finely drawn , finely engraved , and are not <unk> funny , but deliciously so .
so also , generally speaking , are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures .
i remember one of these pictures : a most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm .
he says : " well , begging is getting played out .
only about five marks ( $ 1.25 ) for the whole day ; many an official makes more ! "
and i call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to <unk> his samples : merchant ( <unk> ) .  no , do n't .
i do n't want to buy anything !
<unk>  if you please , i was only going to show you  <unk>  but i do n't wish to see them !
drummer ( after a pause , pleadingly ) .  but do you you mind letting me look at them !
i have n't seen them for three weeks !
adventures of huckleberry finn by <name> twain notice persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative <name> be prosecuted ; persons attempting to find a moral in it <name> be banished ; persons attempting to find a plot in it <name> be shot .
by order of the author , per <unk> , chief of <unk> .
explanatory in this book a number of dialects are used , to wit : the missouri negro dialect ; the <unk> form of the backwoods southwestern dialect ; the ordinary " pike county " dialect ; and four modified varieties of this last .
the <unk> have not been done in a haphazard fashion , or by <unk> ; but <unk> , and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech .
i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding .
the author .
adventures of huckleberry finn scene : the mississippi valley time : forty to fifty years ago chapter i .
you do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of <name> sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter .
that book was made by mr. <name> twain , and he told the truth , mainly .
there was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth .
that is nothing .
i never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was aunt <name> , or the widow , or maybe <name> .
aunt <name>  <name> 's aunt <name> , she is  and <name> , and the widow <name> is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some <unk> , as i said before .
now the way that the book winds up is this : <name> and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us <name> .
we got six thousand dollars apiece  all gold .
it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up .
well , judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round  more than a body could tell what to do with .
the widow <name> she took me for her son , and allowed she would <unk> me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when i could n't stand it no longer i lit out .
i got into my old rags and my <unk> again , and was free and satisfied .
but <name> sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable .
so i went back .
the widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it .
she put me in them new clothes again , and i could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up .
well , then , the old thing commenced again .
the widow rung a <name> for supper , and you had to come to time .
when you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them ,  that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself .
in a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of <unk> around , and the things go better .
after supper she got out her book and learned me about <name> and the <unk> , and i was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that <name> had been dead a considerable long time ; so then i did n't care no more about him , because i do n't take no stock in dead people .
pretty soon i wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me .
but she would n't .
she said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and i must try to not do it any more .
that is just the way with some people .
they get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it .
here she was <unk> about <name> , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it .
and she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .
her sister , miss watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a <unk> .
she worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up .
i could n't stood it much longer .
then for an hour it was deadly dull , and i was <unk> .
miss watson would say , " do n't put your feet up there , huckleberry ; " and " do n't <unk> up like that , huckleberry  set up straight ; " and pretty soon she would say , " do n't gap and stretch like that , huckleberry  why do n't you try to behave ? "
then she told me all about the bad place , and i said i wished i was there .
she got mad then , but i did n't mean no harm .
all i wanted was to go somewheres ; all i wanted was a change , i war n't particular .
she said it was wicked to say what i said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place .
well , i could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so i made up my mind i would n't try for it .
but i never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good .
now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .
she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever .
so i did n't think much of it .
but i never said so .
i asked her if she reckoned <name> sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight .
i was glad about that , because i wanted him and me to be together .
miss watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome .
by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed .
i went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table .
then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use .
i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead .
the stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and i heard an owl , away off , <unk> about somebody that was dead , and a <unk> and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and i could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me .
then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving .
i got so <unk> and scared i did wish i had some company .
pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and i <unk> it off and it lit in the candle ; and before i could budge it was all <unk> up .
i didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me .
i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away .
but i had n't no confidence .
you do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you 've found , instead of <unk> it up over the door , but i had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider .
i set down again , <unk> all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow wouldn't know .
well , after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom  boom  boom  twelve licks ; and all still again  <unk> than ever .
pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees  something was a stirring .
i set still and listened .
directly i could just barely hear a " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
down there .
that was good !
says i , " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
as soft as i could , and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed .
then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was <name> sawyer waiting for me .
chapter ii .
we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads .
when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise .
we <unk> down and laid still .
miss watson 's big nigger , named <name> , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him .
he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening .
then he says : " who dah ? "
he listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly .
well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together .
there was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but i das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to <unk> ; and next my back , right between my shoulders .
seemed like i 'd die if i could n't scratch .
well , i 've noticed that thing plenty times since .
if you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ai n't sleepy  if you are anywheres where it wo n't do for you to scratch , why you <name> <unk> all over in upwards of a thousand places .
pretty soon <name> says : " say , who is you ?
whar is you ?
dog my cats ef i <unk> ' hear <unk> .
well , i know what i 's gwyne to do : i 's gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin . "
so he set down on the ground betwixt me and <name> .
he leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine .
my nose begun to <unk> .
it <unk> till the tears come into my eyes .
but i das n't scratch .
then it begun to <unk> on the inside .
next i got to itching underneath .
i did n't know how i was going to set still .
this <unk> went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that .
i was itching in eleven different places now .
i reckoned i could n't stand it more'n a minute longer , but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try .
just then <name> begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore  and then i was pretty soon comfortable again .
<name> he made a sign to me  kind of a little noise with his mouth  and we went creeping away on our hands and knees .
when we was ten foot off <name> whispered to me , and wanted to tie <name> to the tree for fun .
but i said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they 'd find out i war n't in .
then <name> said he had n't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more .
i did n't want him to try .
i said <name> might wake up and come .
but <name> wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and <name> laid five cents on the table for pay .
then we got out , and i was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do <name> but he must crawl to where <name> was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him .
i waited , and it seemed a good while , everything was so still and lonesome .
as soon as <name> was back we cut along the path , around the garden fence , and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house .
<name> said he slipped <name> 's hat off of his head and <name> it on a limb right over him , and <name> stirred a little , but he did n't wake .
afterwards <name> said the witches be <unk> him and put him in a trance , and rode him all over the state , and then set him under the trees again , and <name> his hat on a limb to show who done it .
and next time <name> told it he said they rode him down to new orleans ; and , after that , every time he told it he spread it more and more , till by and by he said they rode him all over the world , and tired him most to death , and his back was all over <unk> .
<name> was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he would n't hardly notice the other niggers .
niggers would come miles to hear <name> tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country .
strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder .
niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , <name> would happen in and say , " <unk> !
what you know 'bout witches ? "
and that nigger was <unk> up and had to take a back seat .
<name> always kept that <unk> piece round his neck with a string , and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands , and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ; but he never told what it was he said to it .
niggers would come from all around there and give <name> anything they had , just for a sight of that <unk> piece ; but they would n't touch it , because the devil had had his hands on it .
<name> was most ruined for a servant , because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches .
well , when <name> and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling , where there was sick folks , maybe ; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ; and down by the village was the river , a whole mile broad , and awful still and grand .
we went down the hill and found <name> harper and <name> rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old <unk> .
so we <unk> a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore .
we went to a clump of bushes , and <name> made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes .
then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees .
we went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up .
<name> poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you would n't a noticed that there was a hole .
we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and <unk> and cold , and there we stopped .
<name> says : " now , we 'll start this band of robbers and call it <name> sawyer 's gang .
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood . "
everybody was willing .
so <name> got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it .
it swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he must n't eat and he must n't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band .
and nobody that did n't belong to the band could use that <name> , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed .
and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever .
everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked <name> if he got it out of his own head .
he said , some of it , but the rest was out of <unk> and <unk> , and every gang that was high-toned had it .
some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets .
<name> said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in .
then <name> rogers says : " here 's huck finn , he <name> n't got no family ; what you going to do 'bout him ? "
" well , <name> n't he got a father ? "
says <name> sawyer .
" yes , he 's got a father , but you ca n't never find him these days .
he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the <unk> , but he <name> n't been seen in these parts for a year or more . "
they talked it over , and they was going to rule me out , because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill , or else it would n't be fair and square for the others .
well , nobody could think of anything to do  everybody was stumped , and set still .
i was most ready to cry ; but all at once i thought of a way , and so i offered them miss watson  they could kill her .
everybody said : " oh , she 'll do .
that 's all right .
huck can come in . "
then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and i made my <name> on the paper .
" now , " says <name> rogers , " what 's the line of business of this gang ? "
" nothing only robbery and murder , " <name> said .
" but who are we going to <name> ?  houses , or cattle , or  " " stuff !
stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , " says <name> sawyer .
" we ai n't burglars .
that ai n't no sort of style .
we are <unk> .
we stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money . "
" must we always kill the people ? "
" oh , certainly .
it 's best .
some authorities think different , but mostly it 's considered best to kill them  except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they 're <unk> . "
" <unk> ?
what 's that ? "
" i do n't know .
but that 's what they do .
i 've seen it in books ; and so of course that 's what we 've got to do . "
" but how can we do it if we do n't know what it is ? "
" why , blame it all , we 've got to do it .
do n't i tell you it 's in the books ?
do you want to go to doing different from what 's in the books , and get things all muddled up ? "
" oh , that 's all very fine to say , <name> sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be <unk> if we do n't know how to do it to them ?
 that 's the thing i want to get at .
now , what do you reckon it is ? "
" well , i do n't know .
but per'aps if we keep them till they 're <unk> , it means that we keep them till they 're dead . "
" now , that 's something like .
that 'll answer .
why could n't you said that before ?
we 'll keep them till they 're <unk> to death ; and a <unk> lot they 'll be , too  eating up everything , and always trying to get loose . "
" how you talk , <name> rogers .
how can they get loose when there 's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a <name> ? "
" a guard !
well , that is good .
so somebody 's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them .
i think that's foolishness .
why ca n't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ? "
" because it ai n't in the books so  that 's why .
now , <name> rogers , do you want to do things regular , or do n't you ?  that 's the idea .
do n't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what 's the correct thing to do ?
do you reckon you can learn 'em anything ?
not by a good deal .
no , sir , we 'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way . "
" all right .
i do n't mind ; but i say it 's a fool way , anyhow .
say , do we kill the women , too ? "
" well , <name> rogers , if i was as ignorant as you i would n't let on .
kill the women ?
no ; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that .
you fetch them to the cave , and you 're always as polite as pie to them ; and by and by they fall in love with you , and never want to go home any more . "
" well , if that 's the way i 'm agreed , but i do n't take no stock in it .
mighty soon we 'll have the cave so <unk> up with women , and fellows waiting to be <unk> , that there wo n't be no place for the robbers .
but go ahead , i ai n't got nothing to say . "
little <name> barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his <name> , and didn't want to be a robber any more .
so they all made fun of him , and called him <unk> , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets .
but <name> give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and <name> somebody and kill some people .
<name> rogers said he could n't get out much , only sundays , and so he wanted to begin next <name> ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on <name> , and that settled the thing .
they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected <name> sawyer first captain and <name> harper second captain of the gang , and so started home .
i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking .
my new clothes was all greased up and <unk> , and i was <unk> .
chapter iii .
well , i got a good <unk> in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she did n't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and <name> , and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could .
then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it .
she told me to pray every day , and whatever i asked for i would get it .
but it war n't so .
i tried it .
once i got a <unk> , but no hooks .
it war n't any good to me without hooks .
i tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow i couldn't make it work .
by and by , one day , i asked miss watson to try for me , but she said i was a fool .
she never told me why , and i could n't make it out no way .
i set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it .
i says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why don't deacon <unk> get back the money he lost on pork ?
why ca n't the widow get back her silver <unk> that was stole ?
why ca n't miss watson fat up ?
no , says i to my self , there ai n't nothing in it .
i went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was " spiritual gifts . "
this was too many for me , but she told me what she meant  i must help other people , and do everything i could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself .
this was including miss watson , as i took it .
i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but i could n't see no advantage about it  except for the other people ; so at last i reckoned i would n't worry about it any more , but just let it go .
sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body 's mouth water ; but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again .
i judged i could see that there was two <unk> , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow 's providence , but if miss watson 's got him there war n't no help for him any more .
i thought it all out , and reckoned i would belong to the widow 's if he wanted me , though i could n't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing i was so ignorant , and so kind of low-down and ornery .
pap he had n't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; i did n't want to see him no more .
he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around .
well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said .
they judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they could n't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it war n't much like a face at all .
they said he was floating on his back in the water .
they took him and buried him on the bank .
but i war n't comfortable long , because i happened to think of something .
i knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face .
so i knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes .
so i was uncomfortable again .
i judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though i wished he would n't .
we played robber now and then about a month , and then i resigned .
all the boys did .
we had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended .
we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on <unk> and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never <unk> any of them .
<name> sawyer called the hogs " <unk> , " and he called the turnips and stuff " <unk> , " and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
but i could n't see no profit in it .
one time <name> sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a <unk> ( which was the sign for the gang to get together ) , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and <name> <unk> was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand " <unk> " mules , all loaded down with di'monds , and they did n't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things .
he said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready .
he never could go after even a <unk> but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and <unk> , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they war n't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before .
i did n't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and <unk> , but i wanted to see the camels and elephants , so i was on hand next day , saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
but there war n't no spaniards and <unk> , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants .
it war n't anything but a sunday-school picnic , and only a <unk> at that .
we busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though <name> rogers got a rag doll , and <name> harper got a <unk> and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut .
i did n't see no di'monds , and i told <name> sawyer so .
he said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was <unk> there , too , and elephants and things .
i said , why could n't we see them , then ?
he said if i war n't so ignorant , but had read a book called <name> <unk> , i would know without asking .
he said it was all done by enchantment .
he said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians ; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sunday-school , just out of spite .
i said , all right ; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians .
<name> sawyer said i was a <unk> .
" why , " said he , " a magician could call up a lot of <unk> , and they would <unk> you up like nothing before you could say <name> robinson .
they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church . "
" well , " i says , " s'pose we got some <unk> to help us  ca n't we lick the other crowd then ? "
" how you going to get them ? "
" i do n't know .
how do they get them ? "
" why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the <unk> come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning <unk> around and the smoke <unk> , and everything they 're told to do they up and do it .
they do n't think nothing of pulling a <unk> up by the roots , and <unk> a sunday-school superintendent over the head with it  or any other man . "
" who makes them tear around so ? "
" why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring .
they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they 've got to do whatever he says .
if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds , and fill it full of <unk> , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor 's daughter from <name> for you to marry , they 've got to do it  and they 've got to do it before <unk> next morning , too .
and more : they 've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand . "
" well , " says i , " i think they are a pack of <unk> for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that .
and what's more  if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp . "
" how you talk , huck finn .
why , you 'd have to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not . "
" what !
and i as high as a tree and as big as a church ?
all right , then ; i would come ; but i lay i 'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country . "
" shucks , it ai n't no use to talk to you , huck finn .
you do n't seem to know anything , somehow  perfect <unk> . "
i thought all this over for two or three days , and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it .
i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it war n't no use , none of the <unk> come .
so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of <name> sawyer 's lies .
i reckoned he believed in the <unk> and the elephants , but as for me i think different .
it had all the marks of a sunday-school .
chapter iv .
well , three or four months run along , and it was well into the <name> now .
i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and i do n't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever .
i do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway .
at first i hated the school , but by and by i got so i could stand it .
whenever i got uncommon tired i played <unk> , and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up .
so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be .
i was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so <unk> on me .
living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me .
i liked the old ways best , but i was getting so i liked the new ones , too , a little bit .
the widow said i was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory .
she said she war n't ashamed of me .
one morning i happened to turn over the <unk> at breakfast .
i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but miss watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off .
she says , " take your hands away , huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making ! "
the widow put in a good word for me , but that war n't going to keep off the bad luck , i knowed that well enough .
i started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be .
there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this was n't one of them kind ; so i never tried to do anything , but just poked along low-spirited and on the <unk> .
i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence .
there was an inch of new snow on the ground , and i seen somebody 's tracks .
they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence .
it was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so .
i could n't make it out .
it was very curious , somehow .
i was going to follow around , but i stooped down to look at the tracks first .
i didn't notice anything at first , but next i did .
there was a cross in the left <unk> made with big nails , to keep off the devil .
i was up in a second and <unk> down the hill .
i looked over my shoulder every now and then , but i did n't see nobody .
i was at judge thatcher 's as quick as i could get there .
he said : " why , my boy , you are all out of breath .
did you come for your interest ? "
" no , sir , " i says ; " is there some for me ? "
" oh , yes , a <unk> is in last night  over a hundred and fifty dollars .
quite a fortune for you .
you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you 'll spend it . "
" no , sir , " i says , " i do n't want to spend it .
i do n't want it at all  nor the six thousand , nuther .
i want you to take it ; i want to give it to you  the six thousand and all . "
he looked surprised .
he could n't seem to make it out .
he says : " why , what can you mean , my boy ? "
i says , " do n't you ask me no questions about it , please .
you 'll take it  wo n't you ? "
he says : " well , i 'm puzzled .
is something the matter ? "
" please take it , " says i , " and do n't ask me nothing  then i wo n't have to tell no lies . "
he studied a while , and then he says : " <unk> !
i think i see .
you want to sell all your property to me  not give it .
that 's the correct idea . "
then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : " there ; you see it says 'for a consideration . '
that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it .
here 's a dollar for you .
now you sign it . "
so i signed it , and left .
miss watson 's nigger , <name> , had a <unk> as big as your fist , which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox , and he used to do magic with it .
he said there was a spirit inside of it , and it knowed everything .
so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for i found his tracks in the snow .
what i wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ?
<name> got out his <unk> and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor .
it fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch .
<name> tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same .
<name> got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened .
but it war n't no use ; he said it would n't talk .
he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money .
i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that war n't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it would n't pass nohow , even if the brass did n't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time .
( i reckoned i would n't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge . )
i said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the <unk> would take it , because maybe it would n't know the difference .
<name> smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the <unk> would think it was good .
he said he would split open a raw <name> potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you could n't see no brass , and it would n't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a <unk> .
well , i knowed a potato would do that before , but i had forgot it .
<name> put the quarter under the <unk> , and got down and listened again .
this time he said the <unk> was all right .
he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to .
i says , go on .
so the <unk> talked to <name> , and <name> told it to me .
he says : " yo ' ole father doan ' know yit what he 's <unk> to do .
sometimes he <unk> he 'll go 'way , en den agin he <unk> he 'll stay .
de <unk> ' way is to res ' easy en let de ole man take his own way .
dey 's two angels <unk> roun ' 'bout him .
one <unk> 'em is white en shiny , en t'other one is black .
de white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up .
a body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' .
but you is all right .
you gwyne to have <unk> trouble in yo ' life , en <unk> <name> .
sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you 's gwyne to git well agin .
dey 's two gals flyin ' 'bout you in yo ' life .
one <unk> 'em 's light en t'other one is dark .
one is <name> en t'other is po ' .
you 's gwyne to marry de po ' one fust en de <name> one by en by .
you wants to keep 'way <unk> de water as much as you kin , en do n't run no resk , <unk> it 's down in de bills dat you 's gwyne to git <name> . "
when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap  his own self !
chapter v. i had shut the door to .
then i turned around and there he was .
i used to be scared of him all the time , he tanned me so much .
i reckoned i was scared now , too ; but in a minute i see i was mistaken  that is , after the first jolt , as you may say , when my breath sort of hitched , he being so unexpected ; but right away after i see i war n't scared of him worth <unk> about .
he was most fifty , and he looked it .
his hair was long and tangled and greasy , and <name> down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines .
it was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers .
there war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl  a <unk> white , a <unk> white .
as for his clothes  just rags , that was all .
he had one ankle resting on t'other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then .
his hat was laying on the floor  an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid .
i stood <unk> at him ; he set there <unk> at me , with his chair tilted back a little .
i set the candle down .
i noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed .
he kept <unk> me all over .
by and by he says : " <unk> clothes  very .
you think you 're a good deal of a <unk> , don't you ? "
" maybe i am , maybe i ai n't , " i says .
" do n't you give me none o ' your lip , " says he .
" you 've put on considerable many frills since i been away .
i 'll take you down a <name> before i get done with you .
you 're educated , too , they say  can read and write .
you think you 're better'n your father , now , do n't you , because he ca n't ?
i 'll take it out of you .
who told you you might meddle with such <unk> foolishness , hey ?  who told you you could ? "
" the widow .
she told me . "
" the widow , hey ?  and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ai n't none of her business ? "
" nobody never told her . "
" well , i 'll learn her how to meddle .
and looky here  you drop that school , you hear ?
i 'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what he is .
you lem me catch you fooling around that school again , you hear ?
your mother could n't read , and she could n't write , nuther , before she died .
none of the family could n't before they died .
i ca n't ; and here you're <unk> yourself up like this .
i ai n't the man to stand it  you hear ?
say , lem me hear you read . "
i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars .
when i 'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house .
he says : " it 's so .
you can do it .
i had my doubts when you told me .
now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills .
i wo n't have it .
i 'll lay for you , my <unk> ; and if i catch you about that school i 'll tan you good .
first you know you 'll get religion , too .
i never see such a son . "
he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : " what 's this ? "
" it 's something they give me for learning my lessons good . "
he tore it up , and says : " i 'll give you something better  i 'll give you a cowhide . "
he set there <unk> and <unk> a minute , and then he says : " ai n't you a <unk> dandy , though ?
a bed ; and <unk> ; and a <unk> ; and a piece of carpet on the floor  and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the <unk> .
i never see such a son .
i bet i 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before i 'm done with you .
why , there ai n't no end to your airs  they say you 're <name> .
hey ?  <unk> that ? "
" they lie  that 's how . "
" looky here  mind how you talk to me ; i 'm <unk> about all i can stand now  so do n't gim me no <unk> .
i 've been in town two days , and i <name> n't heard nothing but about you bein ' <name> .
i heard about it away down the river , too .
that 's why i come .
you git me that money to-morrow  i want it . "
" i <name> n't got no money . "
" it 's a lie .
judge thatcher 's got it .
you git it .
i want it . "
" i <name> n't got no money , i tell you .
you ask judge thatcher ; he 'll tell you the same . "
" all right .
i 'll ask him ; and i 'll make him <unk> , too , or i 'll know the reason why .
say , how much you got in your pocket ?
i want it . "
" i <name> n't got only a dollar , and i want that to  " " it do n't make no difference what you want it for  you just shell it out . "
he took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ; said he had n't had a drink all day .
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ; and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i did n't drop that .
next day he was drunk , and he went to judge thatcher 's and <unk> him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he could n't , and then he swore he 'd make the law force him .
the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he did n't know the old man ; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he 'd <unk> not take a child away from its father .
so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business .
that pleased the old man till he could n't rest .
he said he 'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i did n't raise some money for him .
i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went <unk> around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week .
but he said he was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for him .
when he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him .
so he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak .
and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
the judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it .
the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again .
and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : " look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take <unk> of it ; shake it .
there 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back .
you <name> them words  do n't forget i said them .
it 's a clean hand now ; shake it  do n't be afeard . "
so they shook it , one after the other , all around , and cried .
the judge 's wife she kissed it .
then the old man he signed a pledge  made his <name> .
the judge said it was the <unk> time on record , or something like that .
then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room , which was the spare room , and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the <unk> and slid down a <unk> and traded his new coat for a jug of <unk> , and clumb back again and had a good old time ; and towards daylight he crawled out again , drunk as a <unk> , and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places , and was most froze to death when somebody found him after <unk> .
and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it .
the judge he felt kind of sore .
he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he did n't know no other way .
chapter <name> .
well , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school .
he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but i went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time .
i did n't want to go to school much before , but i reckoned i 'd go now to spite pap .
that law trial was a slow business  appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then i 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a <unk> .
every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town ; and every time he raised cain he got jailed .
he was just suited  this kind of thing was right in his line .
he got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him .
well , was n't he mad ?
he said he would show who was huck finn 's boss .
so he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there war n't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was .
he kept me with him all the time , and i never got a chance to run off .
we lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights .
he had a gun which he had stole , i reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on .
every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me .
the widow she found out where i was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till i was used to being where i was , and liked it  all but the cowhide part .
it was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study .
two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and i did n't see how i 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time .
i did n't want to go back no more .
i had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now i took to it again because pap hadn't no objections .
it was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around .
but by and by pap got too handy with his <unk> , and i could n't stand it .
i was all over <unk> .
he got to going away so much , too , and locking me in .
once he locked me in and was gone three days .
it was dreadful lonesome .
i judged he had got drownded , and i was n't ever going to get out any more .
i was scared .
i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there .
i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but i could n't find no way .
there war n't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through .
i could n't get up the <unk> ; it was too narrow .
the door was thick , solid oak slabs .
pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , i was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time .
but this time i found something at last ; i found an old <name> <unk> without any handle ; it was laid in between a <unk> and the <unk> of the roof .
i greased it up and went to work .
there was an old <unk> nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out .
i got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out  big enough to let me through .
well , it was a good long job , but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap 's gun in the woods .
i got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in .
pap war n't in a good humor  so he was his natural self .
he said he was down town , and everything was going wrong .
his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and judge thatcher knowed how to do it .
and he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time .
this shook me up considerable , because i did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and <unk> , as they called it .
then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them <unk> when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing .
he said he would like to see the widow get me .
he said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me .
that made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; i reckoned i would n't stay on hand till he got that chance .
the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got .
there was a <unk> sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a <unk> jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for <unk> , besides some tow .
i <unk> up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
i thought it all over , and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when i run away .
i guessed i would n't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow could n't ever find me any more .
i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and i reckoned he would .
i got so full of it i did n't notice how long i was staying till the old man <unk> and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded .
i got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark .
while i was cooking supper the old man took a <unk> or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again .
he had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at .
a body would a thought he was <name>  he was just all mud .
whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the <unk> , this time he says : " call this a <unk> !
why , just look at it and see what it 's like .
here 's the law <unk> ready to take a man 's son away from him  a man 's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising .
yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do <unk> ' for him and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him .
and they call that <unk> !
that ai n't all , nuther .
the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o ' my property .
here 's what the law does : the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and <unk> , and <unk> him into an old trap of a cabin like this , and lets him go round in clothes that ai n't <unk> for a hog .
they call that <unk> !
a man can't get his rights in a <unk> like this .
sometimes i 've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all .
yes , and i told 'em so ; i told old thatcher so to his face .
lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what i said .
says i , for two cents i 'd leave the blamed country and never come <unk> it agin .
them 's the very words .
i says look at my hat  if you call it a hat  but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it 's below my <name> , and then it ai n't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a <unk> o ' stove-pipe .
look at it , says i  such a hat for me to wear  one of the <unk> men in this town if i could git my rights .
" oh , yes , this is a wonderful <unk> , wonderful .
why , looky here .
there was a free nigger there from ohio  a <unk> , most as white as a white man .
he had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the <unk> hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a <unk> cane  the <unk> old gray-headed <unk> in the state .
and what do you think ?
they said he was a <unk> in a college , and could talk all kinds of languages , and knowed everything .
and that ai n't the wust .
they said he could vote when he was at home .
well , that let me out .
thinks i , what is the country a-coming to ?
it was <unk> day , and i was just about to go and vote myself if i war n't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a state in this country where they 'd let that nigger vote , i <unk> out .
i says i 'll never vote agin .
them 's the very words i said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all me  i 'll never vote agin as long as i live .
and to see the cool way of that nigger  why , he would n't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o ' the way .
i says to the people , why ai n't this nigger put up at auction and sold ?  that 's what i want to know .
and what do you reckon they said ?
why , they said he could n't be sold till he 'd been in the state six months , and he had n't been there that long yet .
there , now  that 's a specimen .
they call that a <unk> that ca n't sell a free nigger till he 's been in the state six months .
here 's a <unk> that calls itself a <unk> , and lets on to be a <unk> , and thinks it is a <unk> , and yet 's got to set <unk> for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , <unk> , infernal , <unk> free nigger , and  " pap was <unk> on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language  mostly hove at the nigger and the <unk> , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there .
he hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one <name> and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick .
but it war n't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body 's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous .
he said so his own self afterwards .
he had heard old <unk> <unk> in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but i reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe .
after supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two <unk> and one delirium <unk> .
that was always his word .
i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then i would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t'other .
he drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way .
he did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy .
he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time .
at last i got so sleepy i couldn't keep my eyes open all i could do , and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep , and the candle burning .
i do n't know how long i was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up .
there was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes .
he said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek  but i could n't see no snakes .
he started and run round and round the cabin , <unk> " take him off !
take him off !
he 's biting me on the neck ! "
i never see a man look so wild in the eyes .
pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting ; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils <unk> of him .
he wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning .
then he laid <unk> , and did n't make a sound .
i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still .
he was laying over by the corner .
by and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side .
he says , very low : " tramp  tramp  tramp ; that 's the dead ; tramp  tramp  tramp ; they're coming after me ; but i wo n't go .
oh , they 're here !
do n't touch me  do n't !
hands off  they 're cold ; let go .
oh , let a poor devil alone ! "
then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and <unk> in under the old pine table , still <unk> ; and then he went to crying .
i could hear him through the blanket .
by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me .
he chased me round and round the place with a <unk> , calling me the <name> of death , and saying he would kill me , and then i could n't come for him no more .
i begged , and told him i was only huck ; but he laughed such a <unk> laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up .
once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and i thought i was gone ; but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself .
pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me .
he put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who .
so he dozed off pretty soon .
by and by i got the old <unk> chair and clumb up as easy as i could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun .
i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then i laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir .
and how slow and still the time did drag along .
chapter vii .
" git up !
what you 'bout ? "
i opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where i was .
it was after <unk> , and i had been sound asleep .
pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too .
he says : " what you doin ' with this gun ? "
i judged he did n't know nothing about what he had been doing , so i says : " somebody tried to get in , so i was laying for him . "
" why did n't you <unk> me out ? "
" well , i tried to , but i could n't ; i could n't budge you . "
" well , all right .
do n't stand there <unk> all day , but out with you and see if there 's a fish on the lines for breakfast .
i 'll be along in a minute . "
he unlocked the door , and i cleared out up the river-bank .
i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so i knowed the river had begun to rise .
i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town .
the <name> rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes <unk> floating down , and pieces of log rafts  sometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the <unk> and the sawmill .
i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along .
well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck .
i shot <unk> off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe .
i just expected there 'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they 'd raise up and laugh at him .
but it war n't so this time .
it was a <unk> sure enough , and i clumb in and paddled her ashore .
thinks i , the old man <name> be glad when he sees this  she 's worth ten dollars .
but when i got to shore pap was n't in sight yet , and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully , all <name> over with vines and willows , i struck another idea : i judged i 'd hide her good , and then , 'stead of taking to the woods when i run off , i 'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot .
it was pretty close to the shanty , and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time ; but i got her hid ; and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun .
so he had n't seen anything .
when he got along i was hard at it taking up a " trot " line .
he abused me a little for being so slow ; but i told him i fell in the river , and that was what made me so long .
i knowed he would see i was wet , and then he would be asking questions .
we got five catfish off the lines and went home .
while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up , both of us being about wore out , i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me , it would be a <unk> thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ; you see , all kinds of things might happen .
well , i did n't see no way for a while , but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water , and he says : " another time a man comes <unk> round here you <unk> me out , you hear ?
that man war n't here for no good .
i 'd a shot him .
next time you <unk> me out , you hear ? "
then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted .
i says to myself , i can fix it now so nobody wo n't think of following me .
about twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank .
the river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise .
by and by along comes part of a log raft  nine logs fast together .
we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore .
then we had dinner .
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that war n't pap 's style .
nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell .
so he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three .
i judged he would n't come back that night .
i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start ; then i out with my saw , and went to work on that log again .
before he was t'other side of the river i was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder .
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then i done the same with the side of bacon ; then the <unk> .
i took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; i took the <unk> ; i took the bucket and gourd ; i took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the <unk> and the <unk> .
i took <unk> and matches and other things  everything that was worth a cent .
i cleaned out the place .
i wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and i knowed why i was going to leave that .
i fetched out the gun , and now i was done .
i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things .
so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust .
then i fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and did n't quite touch ground .
if you stood four or five foot away and did n't know it was sawed , you would n't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it war n't likely anybody would go fooling around there .
it was all grass clear to the canoe , so i had n't left a track .
i followed around to see .
i stood on the bank and looked out over the river .
all safe .
so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
i shot this fellow and took him into camp .
i took the axe and smashed in the door .
i beat it and hacked it considerable <unk> it .
i fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; i say ground because it was ground  hard packed , and no boards .
well , next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it  all i could drag  and i started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight .
you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground .
i did wish <name> sawyer was there ; i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches .
nobody could spread himself like <name> sawyer in such a thing as that .
well , last i pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner .
then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket ( so he could n't drip ) till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
now i thought of something else .
so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house .
i took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place  pap done everything with his <unk> about the cooking .
then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes  and ducks too , you might say , in the season .
there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , i do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river .
the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake .
i dropped <unk> <unk> there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident .
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it wouldn't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again .
it was about dark now ; so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that <name> over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise .
i made fast to a <name> ; then i took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
i says to myself , they'll follow the track of that <unk> of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me .
and they 'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things .
they wo n't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass .
they 'll soon get tired of that , and won't bother no more about me .
all right ; i can stop anywhere i want to .
<name> 's island is good enough for me ; i know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there .
and then i can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things i want .
<name> 's island 's the place .
i was pretty tired , and the first thing i knowed i was asleep .
when i woke up i did n't know where i was for a minute .
i set up and looked around , a little scared .
then i remembered .
the river looked miles and miles across .
the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went <unk> along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore .
everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and smelt late .
you know what i mean  i do n't know the words to put it in .
i took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to <unk> and start when i heard a sound away over the water .
i listened .
pretty soon i made it out .
it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in <unk> when it 's a still night .
i peeped out through the <name> branches , and there it was  a skiff , away across the water .
i could n't tell how many was in it .
it kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me i see there war n't but one man in it .
think 's i , maybe it 's pap , though i war n't expecting him .
he dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came <unk> up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him .
well , it was pap , sure enough  and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars .
i did n't lose no time .
the next minute i was <unk> down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank .
i made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me .
i got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float .
i laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it .
the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; i never knowed it before .
and how far a body can hear on the water such nights !
i heard people talking at the ferry landing .
i heard what they said , too  every word of it .
one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now .
t'other one said this war n't one of the short ones , he reckoned  and then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he did n't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone .
the first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman  she would think it was pretty good ; but he said that war n't nothing to some things he had said in his time .
i heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight would n't wait more than about a week longer .
after that the talk got further and further away , and i could n't make out the words any more ; but i could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off .
i was away below the ferry now .
i rose up , and there was <unk> island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy <unk> and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights .
there war n't any signs of the bar at the head  it was all under water now .
it did n't take me long to get there .
i shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore .
i run the canoe into a deep <unk> in the bank that i knowed about ; i had to part the <name> branches to get in ; and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside .
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling .
a monstrous big <unk> was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it .
i watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say , " stern oars , there !
heave her head to <unk> ! "
i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side .
there was a little gray in the sky now ; so i stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast .
chapter viii .
the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o'clock .
i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied .
i could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them .
there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places <unk> about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there .
a couple of squirrels set on a limb and <unk> at me very friendly .
i was powerful lazy and comfortable  did n't want to get up and cook breakfast .
well , i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of " boom ! "
away up the river .
i <unk> up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon i hears it again .
i hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up  about abreast the ferry .
and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down .
i knowed what was the matter now .
" boom ! "
i see the white smoke <unk> out of the <unk> side .
you see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top .
i was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke .
so i set there and watched the <unk> and listened to the boom .
the river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning  so i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my <unk> if i only had a bite to eat .
well , then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there .
so , says i , i 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me i 'll give them a show .
i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have , and i war n't disappointed .
a big double loaf come along , and i most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further .
of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shore  i knowed enough for that .
but by and by along comes another one , and this time i won .
i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in .
it was " baker 's bread "  what the quality eat ; none of your low-down corn-pone .
i got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat , and very well satisfied .
and then something struck me .
i says , now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it .
so there ai n't no doubt but there is something in that thing  that is , there 's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it do n't work for me , and i reckon it do n't work for only just the right kind .
i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching .
the ferryboat was floating with the current , and i allowed i 'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did .
when she 'd got pretty well along down towards me , i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
where the log forked i could peep through .
by and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore .
most everybody was on the boat .
pap , and judge thatcher , and <name> thatcher , and <name> harper , and <name> sawyer , and his old aunt <name> , and <name> and <name> , and plenty more .
everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : " look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water 's edge .
i <name> so , anyway . "
i did n't <name> so .
they all crowded up and leaned over the rails , nearly in my face , and kept still , watching with all their might .
i could see them first-rate , but they could n't see me .
then the captain <name> out : " stand away ! "
and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke , and i judged i was gone .
if they 'd a had some bullets in , i reckon they 'd a got the corpse they was after .
well , i see i war n't hurt , thanks to goodness .
the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island .
i could hear the booming now and then , further and further off , and by and by , after an hour , i did n't hear it no more .
the island was three mile long .
i judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up .
but they did n't yet a while .
they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went .
i crossed over to that side and watched them .
when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town .
i knowed i was all right now .
nobody else would come <unk> after me .
i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods .
i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain could n't get at them .
i catched a catfish and <unk> him open with my saw , and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper .
then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast .
when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current <unk> along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ai n't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you can't stay so , you soon get over it .
and so for three days and nights .
no difference  just the same thing .
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island .
i was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and i wanted to know all about it ; but mainly i wanted to put in the time .
i found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green <unk> ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show .
they would all come handy by and by , i judged .
well , i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i war n't far from the foot of the island .
i had my gun along , but i had n't shot nothing ; it was for protection ; thought i would kill some game nigh home .
about this time i mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and i after it , trying to get a shot at it .
i clipped along , and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking .
my heart jumped up amongst my lungs .
i never waited for to look further , but <unk> my gun and went sneaking back on my <unk> as fast as ever i could .
every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard i could n't hear nothing else .
i slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on .
if i see a stump , i took it for a man ; if i trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half , and the short half , too .
when i got to camp i war n't feeling very <unk> , there war n't much sand in my <unk> ; but i says , this ai n't no time to be fooling around .
so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year 's camp , and then clumb a tree .
i reckon i was up in the tree two hours ; but i did n't see nothing , i did n't hear nothing  i only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things .
well , i could n't stay up there forever ; so at last i got down , but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time .
all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast .
by the time it was night i was pretty hungry .
so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before <unk> and paddled over to the illinois bank  about a quarter of a mile .
i went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a <unk> , <unk> , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next i hear people 's voices .
i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out .
i had n't got far when i hear a man say : " we better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out .
let 's look around . "
i did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
i tied up in the old place , and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe .
i did n't sleep much .
i could n't , somehow , for thinking .
and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck .
so the sleep did n't do me no good .
by and by i says to myself , i ca n't live this way ; i'm a-going to find out who it is that 's here on the island with me ; i'll find it out or bust .
well , i felt better right off .
so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows .
the moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day .
i poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep .
well , by this time i was most down to the foot of the island .
a little <unk> , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done .
i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods .
i sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves .
i see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river .
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the <unk> , and knowed the day was coming .
so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen .
but i had n't no luck somehow ; i could n't seem to find the place .
but by and by , sure enough , i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees .
i went for it , cautious and slow .
by and by i was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground .
it most give me the <unk> .
he had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire .
i set there behind a clump of bushes , in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady .
it was getting gray daylight now .
pretty soon he <unk> and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was miss watson 's <name> !
i bet i was glad to see him .
i says : " hello , <name> ! "
and skipped out .
he bounced up and stared at me wild .
then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : " doan ' hurt me  do n't !
i <name> n't ever done no harm to a <unk> ' .
i <unk> liked dead people , en done all i could for 'em .
you go en git in de river agin , whah you <unk> , en doan ' do <unk> to ole <name> , 'at 'uz <unk> yo ' <unk> ' . "
well , i war n't long making him understand i war n't dead .
i was ever so glad to see <name> .
i war n't lonesome now .
i told him i war n't afraid of him telling the people where i was .
i talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing .
then i says : " it 's good daylight .
<name> 's get breakfast .
make up your camp fire good . "
" what 's de use er makin ' up de camp fire to cook <unk> en sich truck ?
but you got a gun , <name> n't you ?
den we kin git <unk> better den <unk> . "
" strawberries and such truck , " i says .
" is that what you live on ? "
" i <unk> ' git <unk> else , " he says .
" why , how long you been on the island , <name> ? "
" i come heah de night <unk> you 's killed . "
" what , all that time ? "
" yes  <unk> . "
" and ai n't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat ? "
" no , sah  <unk> else . "
" well , you must be most starved , ai n't you ? "
" i reck'n i could eat a hoss .
i think i could .
how long you <name> on de <unk> ' ? "
" since the night i got killed . "
" no !
<unk> , what has you lived on ?
but you got a gun .
oh , yes , you got a gun .
dat 's good .
now you kill <unk> en i 'll make up de fire . "
so we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , i fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and <unk> and frying-pan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft .
i catched a good big catfish , too , and <name> cleaned him with his knife , and fried him .
when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot .
<name> laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved .
then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and <unk> .
by and by <name> says : " but looky here , huck , who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you ? "
then i told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart .
he said <name> sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what i had .
then i says : " how do you come to be here , <name> , and how 'd you get here ? "
he looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute .
then he says : " maybe i better not tell . "
" why , <name> ? "
" well , dey 's reasons .
but you <unk> ' tell on me ef i <unk> to tell you , would you , huck ? "
" blamed if i would , <name> . "
" well , i b'lieve you , huck .
i  i run off . "
" <name> ! "
" but mind , you said you <unk> ' tell  you know you said you <unk> ' tell , huck . "
" well , i did .
i said i would n't , and i 'll stick to it .
honest injun , i <name> .
people would call me a low-down abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum  but that do n't make no difference .
i ai n't a-going to tell , and i ai n't a-going back there , anyways .
so , now , <name> 's know all about it . "
" well , you see , it 'uz dis way .
ole missus  dat 's miss watson  she <unk> on me all de time , en treats me <unk> rough , but she <unk> said she <unk> ' sell me down to orleans .
but i noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun ' de place <unk> lately , en i begin to git <unk> .
well , one night i creeps to de do ' <unk> late , en de do ' war n't quite shet , en i hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to orleans , but she <unk> ' want to , but she could git eight hund 'd dollars for me , en it 'uz sich a big stack o ' money she <unk> ' <unk> ' .
de widder she try to git her to say she <unk> ' do it , but i never waited to hear de res ' .
i lit out mighty quick , i tell you .
" i tuck out en <name> down de hill , en <unk> to steal a <unk> 'long de <unk> <unk> <unk> de town , but dey wuz people <unk> yit , so i hid in de ole <unk> <unk> on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way .
well , i wuz dah all night .
dey wuz somebody roun ' all de time .
'long 'bout six in de <unk> ' <unk> begin to go by , en 'bout eight er nine every <unk> dat went 'long wuz talkin ' 'bout how yo ' pap come over to de town en say you 's killed .
dese las ' <unk> wuz full o ' ladies en <unk> a-goin ' over for to see de place .
sometimes dey 'd pull up at de sho ' en take a res ' <unk> ' dey started acrost , so by de talk i got to know all 'bout de killin ' .
i 'uz powerful sorry you 's killed , huck , but i ain't no mo ' now .
" i laid dah under de <unk> 's all day .
i 'uz hungry , but i warn't afeard ; <unk> i knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin ' to start to de <unk> ' right <unk> <unk> ' en be gone all day , en dey knows i goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight , so dey <unk> ' <unk> to see me roun ' de place , en so dey <unk> ' miss me tell <unk> dark in de evenin ' .
de <unk> servants <unk> ' miss me , <unk> dey 'd <name> out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way .
" well , when it come dark i tuck out up de river road , en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey war n't no houses .
i 'd made up my mine 'bout what i 's <unk> to do .
you see , ef i kep ' on tryin ' to git away afoot , de dogs 'ud track me ; ef i stole a <unk> to cross over , dey 'd miss dat <unk> , you see , en dey 'd know 'bout whah i 'd <name> ' on de <unk> side , en whah to pick up my track .
so i says , a <unk> is what i 's <unk> ; it <unk> make no track .
" i see a light a-comin ' roun ' de p'int <unk> , so i <name> ' in en shove ' a log ahead o ' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river , en got in <unk> de drift-wood , en kep ' my head down low , en kinder swum agin de current tell de <unk> come along .
den i swum to de stern <unk> it en tuck <unk> .
it clouded up en 'uz <unk> dark for a little while .
so i clumb up en laid down on de planks .
de men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle , whah de lantern wuz .
de river wuz <unk> ' , en dey wuz a good current ; so i reck'n 'd 'at by fo ' in de <unk> ' i 'd be twenty-five mile down de river , en den i 'd slip in jis <unk> ' daylight en swim <unk> ' , en take to de woods on de illinois side .
" but i <unk> ' have no luck .
when we 'uz mos ' down to de head er de <unk> a man begin to come aft wid de lantern , i see it war n't no use fer to wait , so i slid overboard en struck out fer de <unk> ' .
well , i had a notion i could <name> ' mos ' <unk> , but i could n't  bank too bluff .
i 'uz mos ' to de foot er de <unk> ' <unk> ' i found ' a good place .
i went into de woods en <unk> i <unk> ' fool wid <unk> no mo ' , long as dey move de lantern roun ' so .
i had my pipe en a plug er <unk> , en some matches in my cap , en dey war n't wet , so i 'uz all right . "
" and so you ai n't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ?
why didn't you get <unk> ? "
" how you gwyne to git 'm ?
you ca n't slip up on um en grab um ; en how 's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ?
how could a body do it in de night ?
en i war n't gwyne to show <unk> on de bank in de daytime . "
" well , that 's so .
you 've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course .
did you hear 'em shooting the cannon ? "
" oh , yes .
i knowed dey was <unk> you .
i see um go by heah  watched um <unk> de bushes . "
some young birds come along , flying a yard or two at a time and lighting .
<name> said it was a sign it was going to rain .
he said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it .
i was going to catch some of them , but <name> wouldn't let me .
he said it was death .
he said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old <unk> said his father would die , and he did .
and <name> said you must n't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck .
the same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown .
and he said if a man owned a <unk> and that man died , the bees must be told about it before <unk> next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die .
<name> said bees would n't sting idiots ; but i did n't believe that , because i had tried them lots of times myself , and they would n't sting me .
i had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them .
<name> knowed all kinds of signs .
he said he knowed most everything .
i said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so i asked him if there war n't any <unk> signs .
he says : " mighty few  an ' dey ai n't no use to a body .
what you want to know when good luck 's a-comin ' for ?
want to keep it off ? "
and he said : " ef <unk> got hairy arms en a hairy <unk> ' , it 's a sign dat you 's <unk> to be <name> .
well , dey 's some use in a sign like dat , <unk> it 's so fur ahead .
you see , maybe you 's got to be po ' a long time fust , en so you might git discourage ' en kill <unk> <unk> you <unk> ' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be <name> <unk> . "
" have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast , <name> ? "
" what 's de use to ax dat question ?

" well , are you <name> ? "
" no , but i <name> <name> <unk> , and gwyne to be <name> agin .

" what did you speculate in , <name> ? "

" so you lost the ten dollars . "
" no , i did n't lose it all .

" you had five dollars and ten cents left .

" yes .

so dey <unk> ' none <unk> us git no money . "
" what did you do with the ten cents , <name> ? "
" well , i 'uz gwyne to <unk> ' it , but i had a dream , en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name ' <unk>  <unk> 's ass dey call him for short ; he's one er dem <unk> , you know .

i wisht i had de money , i <unk> ' want no mo ' . "
chapter ix .
i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that i 'd found when i was exploring ; so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide .
this place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high .
we had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick .
we tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards illinois .
the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and <name> could stand up straight in it .
it was cool in there .
<name> was for putting our traps in there right away , but i said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time .
<name> said if we had the canoe hid in a good place , and had all the traps in the cavern , we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island , and they would never find us without dogs .
and , besides , he said them little birds had said it was going to rain , and did i want the things to get wet ?
so we went back and got the canoe , and paddled up abreast the cavern , and lugged all the traps up there .
then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in , amongst the thick willows .
we took some fish off of the lines and set them again , and begun to get ready for dinner .
the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in , and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit , and was flat and a good place to build a fire on .
so we built it there and cooked dinner .
we spread the blankets inside for a carpet , and eat our dinner in there .
we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern .
pretty soon it darkened up , and begun to thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it .
directly it begun to rain , and it rained like all fury , too , and i never see the wind blow so .
it was one of these regular summer storms .
it would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside , and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and <unk> ; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale <unk> of the leaves ; and then a perfect <unk> of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ; and next , when it was just about the <unk> and blackest  <unk> !
it was as bright as <name> , and you 'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops <unk> about away off yonder in the storm , hundreds of yards further than you could see before ; dark as sin again in a second , and now you 'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash , and then go rumbling , grumbling , tumbling , down the sky towards the under side of the world , like rolling empty barrels down stairs  where it 's long stairs and they bounce a good deal , you know .
" <name> , this is nice , " i says .
" i would n't want to be nowhere else but here .
pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot <unk> . "
" well , you would n't a <name> here <unk> it had n't a <name> for <name> .
you 'd a <name> down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en <unk> ' mos ' drownded , too ; dat you would , <name> .
chickens knows when it 's gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile . "
the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks .
the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom .
on that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the missouri side it was the same old distance across  a half a mile  because the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs .
<unk> we paddled all over the island in the canoe , it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside .
we went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines <name> so thick we had to back away and go some other way .
well , on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtles  they would slide off in the water .
the ridge our cavern was in was full of them .
we could a had pets enough if we 'd wanted them .
one night we catched a little section of a lumber raft  nice pine planks .
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inches  a solid , level floor .
we could see <unk> go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we did n't show ourselves in daylight .
another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a <unk> down , on the west side .
she was a two-story , and tilted over considerable .
we paddled out and got aboard  clumb in at an upstairs window .
but it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight .
the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island .
then we looked in at the window .
we could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall .
there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man .
so <name> says : " hello , you ! "
but it did n't budge .
so i <unk> again , and then <name> says : " de man ai n't asleep  he 's dead .
you hold still  i 'll go en see . "
he went , and bent down and looked , and says : " it 's a dead man .
yes , <unk> ; naked , too .
he 's <name> shot in de back .
i reck'n he 's <name> dead two er three days .
come in , huck , but doan ' look at his face  it 's too <unk> . "
i did n't look at him at all .
<name> throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; i did n't want to see him .
there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the <unk> kind of words and pictures made with charcoal .
there was two old dirty calico dresses , and a <unk> , and some women 's <unk> hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too .
we put the lot into the canoe  it might come good .
there was a boy 's old speckled straw hat on the floor ; i took that , too .
and there was a bottle that had had milk in it , and it had a rag <unk> for a baby to suck .
we would a took the bottle , but it was broke .
there was a seedy old chest , and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke .
they stood open , but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account .
the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry , and war n't fixed so as to <name> off most of their stuff .
we got an old tin lantern , and a <unk> without any handle , and a <unk> barlow knife worth two bits in any store , and a lot of tallow candles , and a tin candlestick , and a gourd , and a tin cup , and a <unk> old <unk> off the bed , and a <unk> with needles and pins and <unk> and buttons and thread and all such truck in it , and a hatchet and some nails , and a <unk> as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it , and a roll of buckskin , and a leather <unk> , and a horseshoe , and some <unk> of medicine that did n't have no label on them ; and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good <unk> , and <name> he found a <unk> old <unk> , and a wooden leg .
the straps was broke off of it , but , barring that , it was a good enough leg , though it was too long for me and not long enough for <name> , and we could n't find the other one , though we hunted all around .
and so , take it all around , we made a good haul .
when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island , and it was pretty broad day ; so i made <name> lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt , because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off .
i paddled over to the illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it .
i crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody .
we got home all safe .
chapter x .
after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but <name> did n't want to .
he said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and <unk> us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go <unk> around than one that was planted and comfortable .
that sounded pretty reasonable , so i didn't say no more ; but i could n't keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for .
we rummaged the clothes we 'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat .
<name> said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they 'd a knowed the money was there they would n't a left it .
i said i reckoned they killed him , too ; but <name> did n't want to talk about that .
i says : " now you think it 's bad luck ; but what did you say when i fetched in the <unk> that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ?
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a <unk> with my hands .
well , here 's your bad luck !
we 've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides .
i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , <name> . "
" never you mind , <name> , never you mind .
do n't you git too <unk> .
it's a-comin ' .
mind i tell you , it 's a-comin ' . "
it did come , too .
it was a tuesday that we had that talk .
well , after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco .
i went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there .
i killed him , and curled him up on the foot of <name> 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when <name> found him there .
well , by night i forgot all about the snake , and when <name> flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him .
he jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the <unk> curled up and ready for another spring .
i laid him out in a second with a stick , and <name> grabbed pap 's <unk> and begun to pour it down .
he was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel .
that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it .
<name> told me to chop off the snake 's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it .
i done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him .
he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too .
he said that that would help .
then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for i war n't going to let <name> find out it was all my fault , not if i could help it .
<name> sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again .
his foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so i judged he was all right ; but i 'd <unk> been bit with a snake than pap 's whisky .
<name> was laid up for four days and nights .
then the swelling was all gone and he was around again .
i made up my mind i would n't ever take <unk> of a <unk> again with my hands , now that i see what had come of it .
<name> said he reckoned i would believe him next time .
and he said that handling a <unk> was such awful bad luck that maybe we had n't got to the end of it yet .
he said he <unk> see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a <unk> in his hand .
well , i was getting to feel that way myself , though i 've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the <unk> and <unk> things a body can do .
old <name> bunker done it once , and <unk> about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the <unk> , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him <unk> between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but i did n't see it .
pap told me .
but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool .
well , the days went along , and the river went down between its banks again ; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man , being six foot two inches long , and weighed over two hundred pounds .
we could n't handle him , of course ; he would a flung us into illinois .
we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded .
we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball , and lots of rubbage .
we split the ball open with the hatchet , and there was a <unk> in it .
<name> said he 'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it .
it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi , i reckon .
<name> said he had n't ever seen a bigger one .
he would a been worth a good deal over at the village .
they <unk> out such a fish as that by the pound in the <unk> there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat 's as white as snow and makes a good fry .
next morning i said it was getting slow and dull , and i wanted to get a stirring up some way .
i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on .
<name> liked that notion ; but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp .
then he studied it over and said , could n't i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl ?
that was a good notion , too .
so we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and i turned up my <unk> to my knees and got into it .
<name> hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit .
i put on the <unk> and tied it under my <name> , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe .
<name> said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly .
i practiced around all day to get the <name> of the things , and by and by i could do pretty well in them , only <name> said i did n't walk like a girl ; and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my <unk> .
i took notice , and done better .
i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark .
i started across to the town from a little below the <unk> , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town .
i tied up and started along the bank .
there was a light burning in a little shanty that had n't been lived in for a long time , and i wondered who had took up quarters there .
i slipped up and peeped in at the window .
there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table .
i did n't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you could n't start a face in that town that i did n't know .
now this was lucky , because i was weakening ; i was getting afraid i had come ; people might know my voice and find me out .
but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know ; so i knocked at the door , and made up my mind i would n't forget i was a girl .
chapter xi .
" come in , " says the woman , and i did .
she says : " take a cheer . "
i done it .
she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : " what might your name be ? "
" <name> <name> . "
" where <unk> do you live ?
in this neighborhood ? '
" no 'm .
in <unk> , seven mile below .
i 've walked all the way and i 'm all tired out . "
" hungry , too , i reckon .
i 'll find you something . "
" no 'm , i ai n't hungry .
i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm ; so i ai n't hungry no more .
it 's what makes me so late .
my mother 's down sick , and out of money and everything , and i come to tell my uncle abner moore .
he lives at the upper end of the town , she says .
i <name> n't ever been here before .
do you know him ? "
" no ; but i do n't know everybody yet .
i have n't lived here quite two weeks .
it 's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town .
you better stay here all night .
take off your bonnet . "
" no , " i says ; " i 'll rest a while , i reckon , and go on .
i ai n't <unk> of the dark . "
she said she would n't let me go by myself , but her husband would be in by and by , maybe in a hour and a half , and she 'd send him along with me .
then she got to talking about her husband , and about her relations up the river , and her relations down the river , and about how much better off they used to was , and how they did n't know but they 'd made a mistake coming to our town , instead of letting well alone  and so on and so on , till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder , and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along .
she told about me and <name> sawyer finding the six thousand dollars ( only she got it ten ) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was , and what a hard lot i was , and at last she got down to where i was murdered .
i says : " who done it ?
we 've heard considerable about these goings on down in <unk> , but we do n't know who 't was that killed huck finn . "
" well , i reckon there 's a right smart chance of people here that 'd like to know who killed him .
some think old finn done it himself . "
" no  is that so ? "
" most everybody thought it at first .
he 'll never know how nigh he come to getting <unk> .
but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named <name> . "
" why he  " i stopped .
i reckoned i better keep still .
she run on , and never noticed i had put in at all : " the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed .
so there 's a reward out for him  three hundred dollars .
and there 's a reward out for old finn , too  two hundred dollars .
you see , he come to town the morning after the murder , and told about it , and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt , and right away after he up and left .
before night they wanted to lynch him , but he was gone , you see .
well , next day they found out the nigger was gone ; they found out he had n't <name> seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done .
so then they put it on him , you see ; and while they was full of it , next day , back comes old finn , and went <unk> to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with .
the judge gave him some , and that evening he got drunk , and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty <unk> strangers , and then went off with them .
well , he <unk> come back sence , and they ai n't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little , for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it , and then he 'd get huck 's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit .
people do say he war n't any too good to do it .
oh , he 's sly , i reckon .
if he do n't come back for a year he 'll be all right .
you ca n't prove anything on him , you know ; everything <name> be quieted down then , and he 'll walk in huck 's money as easy as nothing . "
" yes , i reckon so , 'm .
i do n't see nothing in the way of it .
has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it ? "
" oh , no , not everybody .
a good many thinks he done it .
but they 'll get the nigger pretty soon now , and maybe they can scare it out of him . "
" why , are they after him yet ? "
" well , you 're innocent , ai n't you !
does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ?
some folks think the nigger ai n't far from here .
i 'm one of them  but i <name> n't talked it around .
a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call <name> 's island .
do n't anybody live there ?
says i .
no , nobody , says they .
i did n't say any more , but i done some thinking .
i was pretty near certain i 'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so i says to myself , like as not that nigger 's hiding over there ; anyway , says i , it 's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt .
i <name> n't seen any smoke sence , so i reckon maybe he 's gone , if it was him ; but husband 's going over to see  him and another man .
he was gone up the river ; but he got back to-day , and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago . "
i had got so uneasy i could n't set still .
i had to do something with my hands ; so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it .
my hands shook , and i was making a bad job of it .
when the woman stopped talking i looked up , and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little .
i put down the needle and thread , and let on to be interested  and i was , too  and says : " three hundred dollars is a power of money .
i wish my mother could get it .
is your husband going over there to-night ? "
" oh , yes .
he went <unk> with the man i was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun .
they 'll go over after midnight . "
" could n't they see better if they was to wait till daytime ? "
" yes .
and could n't the nigger see better , too ?
after midnight he'll likely be asleep , and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark , if he 's got one . "
" i did n't think of that . "
the woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and i did n't feel a bit comfortable .
pretty soon she says , " what did you say your name was , <name> ? "
" m  <name> <name> . "
somehow it did n't seem to me that i said it was <name> before , so i didn't look up  seemed to me i said it was <name> ; so i felt sort of cornered , and was <unk> maybe i was looking it , too .
i wished the woman would say something more ; the longer she set still the <unk> i was .
but now she says : " <name> , i thought you said it was <name> when you first come in ? "
" oh , yes 'm , i did .
<name> <name> <name> .
<name> 's my first name .
some calls me <name> , some calls me <name> . "
" oh , that 's the way of it ? "
" yes 'm . "
i was feeling better then , but i wished i was out of there , anyway .
i could n't look up yet .
well , the woman fell to talking about how hard times was , and how poor they had to live , and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place , and so forth and so on , and then i got easy again .
she was right about the rats .
you 'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while .
she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone , or they would n't give her no peace .
she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot , and said she was a good shot with it <unk> , but she 'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago , and didn't know whether she could throw true now .
but she watched for a chance , and directly banged away at a rat ; but she missed him wide , and said " ouch ! "
it hurt her arm so .
then she told me to try for the next one .
i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back , but of course i didn't let on .
i got the thing , and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive , and if he 'd a stayed where he was he 'd a been a tolerable sick rat .
she said that was first-rate , and she reckoned i would hive the next one .
she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back , and brought along a <name> of yarn which she wanted me to help her with .
i held up my two hands and she put the <name> over them , and went on talking about her and her husband 's matters .
but she broke off to say : " keep your eye on the rats .
you better have the lead in your lap , handy . "
so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment , and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking .
but only about a minute .
then she took off the <name> and looked me straight in the face , and very pleasant , and says : " come , now , what 's your real name ? "
" wh  what , mum ? "
" what 's your real name ?
is it <name> , or <name> , or <name> ?  or what is it ? "
i reckon i shook like a leaf , and i did n't know hardly what to do .
but i says : " please to do n't poke fun at a poor girl like me , mum .
if i 'm in the way here , i 'll  " " no , you wo n't .
set down and stay where you are .
i ai n't going to hurt you , and i ai n't going to tell on you , nuther .
you just tell me your secret , and trust me .
i 'll keep it ; and , what 's more , i 'll help you .
so 'll my old man if you want him to .
you see , you 're a runaway <unk> , that 's all .
it ai n't anything .
there ai n't no harm in it .
you 've been treated bad , and you made up your mind to cut .
bless you , child , i would n't tell on you .
tell me all about it now , that 's a good boy . "
so i said it would n't be no use to try to play it any longer , and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything , but she mus n't go back on her promise .
then i told her my father and mother was dead , and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river , and he treated me so bad i could n't stand it no longer ; he went away to be gone a couple of days , and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughter 's old clothes and cleared out , and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles .
i traveled nights , and hid <unk> and slept , and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way , and i had <unk> .
i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me , and so that was why i struck out for this town of <unk> .
" <unk> , child ?
this ai n't <unk> .
this is st. petersburg .
<unk> ten mile further up the river .
who told you this was <unk> ? "
" why , a man i met at daybreak this morning , just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep .
he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to <unk> . "
" he was drunk , i reckon .
he told you just exactly wrong . "
" well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ai n't no matter now .
i got to be moving along .
i 'll fetch <unk> before daylight . "
" hold on a minute .
i 'll put you up a <unk> to eat .
you might want it . "
so she put me up a <unk> , and says : " say , when a cow 's laying down , which end of her gets up first ?
answer up prompt now  do n't stop to study over it .
which end gets up first ? "
" the hind end , mum . "
" well , then , a horse ? "
" the <unk> end , mum . "
" which side of a tree does the moss grow on ? "
" north side . "
" if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction ? "
" the whole fifteen , mum . "
" well , i reckon you have lived in the country .
i thought maybe you was trying to <unk> me again .
what 's your real name , now ? "
" <name> peters , mum . "
" well , try to remember it , <name> .
do n't forget and tell me it's <unk> before you go , and then get out by saying it 's <name> <unk> when i catch you .
and do n't go about women in that old calico .
you do a girl tolerable poor , but you might fool men , maybe .
bless you , child , when you set out to thread a needle do n't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ; that 's the way a woman most always does , but a man always does t'other way .
and when you throw at a rat or anything , hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can , and miss your rat about six or seven foot .
throw <unk> from the shoulder , like there was a pivot there for it to turn on , like a girl ; not from the wrist and elbow , with your arm out to one side , like a boy .
and , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she do n't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead .
why , i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and i contrived the other things just to make certain .
now trot along to your uncle , <name> <name> <name> <name> <unk> peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs. <name> <unk> , which is me , and i 'll do what i can to get you out of it .
keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you .
the river road 's a <name> one , and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to <unk> , i reckon . "
i went up the bank about fifty yards , and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house .
i jumped in , and was off in a hurry .
i went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across .
i took off the <unk> , for i did n't want no <unk> on then .
when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike , so i stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but clear  eleven .
when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow , though i was most winded , but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot .
then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as i could go .
i landed , and <unk> through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern .
there <name> laid , sound asleep on the ground .
i roused him out and says : " git up and hump yourself , <name> !
there ai n't a minute to lose .
they're after us ! "
<name> never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared .
by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the <name> cove where she was hid .
we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and did n't show a candle outside after that .
i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around i could n't see it , for stars and shadows ain't good to see by .
then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still  never saying a word .
chapter xii .
it must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow .
if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore ; and it was well a boat did n't come , for we had n't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a <unk> , or anything to eat .
we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things .
it war n't good judgment to put everything on the raft .
if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built , and watched it all night for <name> to come .
anyways , they stayed away from us , and if my building the fire never fooled them it war n't no fault of mine .
i played it as low down on them as i could .
when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a <unk> in the bank there .
a <unk> is a <unk> that has cottonwoods on it as thick as <unk> .
we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side , and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place , so we war n't afraid of anybody running across us .
we laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore , and <unk> steamboats fight the big river in the middle .
i told <name> all about the time i had <unk> with that woman ; and <name> said she was a smart one , and if she was to start after us herself she would n't set down and watch a camp fire  no , sir , she 'd fetch a dog .
well , then , i said , why could n't she tell her husband to fetch a dog ?
<name> said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start , and he believed they must a gone <unk> to get a dog and so they lost all that time , or else we would n't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village  no , <unk> , we would be in that same old town again .
so i said i did n't care what was the reason they did n't get us as long as they did n't .
when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket , and looked up and down and across ; nothing in sight ; so <name> took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy , and to keep the things dry .
<name> made a floor for the wigwam , and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft , so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves .
right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ; this was to build a fire on in <unk> weather or chilly ; the wigwam would keep it from being seen .
we made an extra <unk> , too , because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something .
we fixed up a short forked stick to <name> the old lantern on , because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream , to keep from getting run over ; but we would n't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a " crossing " ; for the river was pretty high yet , very low banks being still a little under water ; so <unk> boats did n't always run the channel , but hunted easy water .
this second night we run between seven and eight hours , with a current that was making over four mile an hour .
we catched fish and talked , and we took a swim now and then to keep off <unk> .
it was kind of solemn , drifting down the big , still river , laying on our backs looking up at the stars , and we did n't ever feel like talking loud , and it warn't often that we laughed  only a little kind of a low chuckle .
we had mighty good weather as a general thing , and nothing ever happened to us at all  that night , nor the next , nor the next .
every night we passed towns , some of them away up on black hillsides , nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ; not a house could you see .
the fifth night we passed st. <name> , and it was like the whole world lit up .
in st. petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st. <name> , but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night .
there war n't a sound there ; everybody was asleep .
every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village , and buy ten or fifteen cents ' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ; and sometimes i lifted a chicken that war n't roosting comfortable , and took him along .
pap always said , take a chicken when you get a chance , because if you do n't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does , and a good deed ai n't ever forgot .
i never see pap when he did n't want the chicken himself , but that is what he used to say , anyway .
mornings before daylight i slipped into <unk> and borrowed a watermelon , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or some new corn , or things of that kind .
pap always said it war n't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ; but the widow said it war n't anything but a soft name for stealing , and no decent body would do it .
<name> said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we would n't borrow them any more  then he reckoned it would n't be no harm to borrow the others .
so we talked it over all one night , drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or what .
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory , and concluded to drop <unk> and <unk> .
we war n't feeling just right before that , but it was all comfortable now .
i was glad the way it come out , too , because <unk> ai n't ever good , and the <unk> would n't be ripe for two or three months yet .
we shot a <unk> now and then that got up too early in the morning or did n't go to bed early enough in the evening .
take it all round , we lived pretty high .
the fifth night below st. <name> we had a big storm after midnight , with a power of thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in a solid sheet .
we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself .
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead , and high , <name> bluffs on both sides .
by and by says i , " <unk> , <name> , looky yonder ! "
it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock .
we was drifting straight down for her .
the lightning showed her very distinct .
she was leaning over , with part of her upper deck above water , and you could see every little <unk> clean and clear , and a chair by the big <name> , with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it , when the flashes come .
well , it being away in the night and <name> , and all so <unk> , i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river .
i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there .
so i says : " <name> 's land on her , <name> . "
but <name> was dead against it at first .
he says : " i doan ' want to go <unk> 'long er no <unk> .
we 's doin ' blame ' well , en we better let blame ' well alone , as de good book says .
like as not <unk> a watchman on dat <unk> . "
" watchman your grandmother , " i says ; " there ai n't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house ; and do you reckon anybody 's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this , when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute ? "
<name> couldn't say nothing to that , so he did n't try .
" and besides , " i says , " we might borrow something worth having out of the captain 's stateroom .
<unk> , i bet you  and cost five cents apiece , solid cash .
steamboat captains is always <name> , and get sixty dollars a month , and they do n't care a cent what a thing costs , you know , long as they want it .
stick a candle in your pocket ; i ca n't rest , <name> , till we give her a rummaging .
do you reckon <name> sawyer would ever go by this thing ?
not for pie , he would n't .
he 'd call it an adventure  that 's what he 'd call it ; and he 'd land on that wreck if it was his last act .
and would n't he throw style into it ?
 would n't he spread himself , nor nothing ?
why , you 'd think it was <name> <unk> discovering <unk> .
i wish <name> sawyer was here . "
<name> he grumbled a little , but give in .
he said we must n't talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low .
the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the <unk> <name> , and made fast there .
the deck was high out here .
we went sneaking down the slope of it to <unk> , in the dark , towards the texas , feeling our way slow with our feet , and spreading our hands out to fend off the <unk> , for it was so dark we could n't see no sign of them .
pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight , and clumb on to it ; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain 's door , which was open , and by <unk> , away down through the <unk> we see a light !
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder !
<name> whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along .
i says , all right , and was going to start for the raft ; but just then i heard a voice wail out and say : " oh , please do n't , boys ; i swear i wo n't ever tell ! "
another voice said , pretty loud : " it 's a lie , <name> turner .
you 've acted this way before .
you always want more'n your share of the truck , and you 've always got it , too , because you 've swore 't if you did n't you 'd tell .
but this time you 've said it jest one time too many .
you 're the meanest , <unk> hound in this country . "
by this time <name> was gone for the raft .
i was just <unk> with curiosity ; and i says to myself , <name> sawyer would n't back out now , and so i wo n't either ; i 'm a-going to see what 's going on here .
so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage , and crept aft in the dark till there war n't but one stateroom betwixt me and the <unk> of the texas .
then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot , and two men standing over him , and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand , and the other one had a pistol .
this one kept pointing the pistol at the man 's head on the floor , and saying : " i 'd like to !
and i <unk> , too  a mean skunk ! "
the man on the floor would <unk> up and say , " oh , please do n't , <name> ; i <name> n't ever goin ' to tell . "
and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : " 'deed you ai n't !
you never said no truer thing 'n that , you bet you . "
and once he said : " hear him beg !
and yit if we had n't got the best of him and tied him he 'd a killed us both .
and what for ?
jist for noth'n .
jist because we stood on our rights  that 's what for .
but i lay you ai n't a-goin ' to threaten nobody any more , <name> turner .
put up that pistol , <name> . "
<name> says : " i do n't want to , <name> packard .
i 'm for killin ' him  and did n't he kill old <unk> jist the same way  and do n't he deserve it ? "
" but i do n't want him killed , and i 've got my reasons for it . "
" bless yo ' heart for them words , <name> packard !
i 'll never forgit you long 's i live ! "
says the man on the floor , sort of <unk> .
packard did n't take no notice of that , but <name> up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark , and motioned <name> to come .
i <unk> as fast as i could about two yards , but the boat slanted so that i could n't make very good time ; so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side .
the man came <unk> along in the dark , and when packard got to my stateroom , he says : " here  come in here . "
and in he come , and <name> after him .
but before they got in i was up in the upper berth , cornered , and sorry i come .
then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked .
i could n't see them , but i could tell where they was by the whisky they 'd been having .
i was glad i did n't drink whisky ; but it would n't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they could n't a <unk> me because i didn't breathe .
i was too scared .
and , besides , a body could n't breathe and hear such talk .
they talked low and <name> .
<name> wanted to kill turner .
he says : " he 's said he 'll tell , and he <name> .
if we was to give both our shares to him now it would n't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him .
shore 's you 're born , he 'll turn state 's evidence ; now you hear me .
i 'm for putting him out of his troubles . "
" so 'm i , " says packard , very quiet .
" blame it , i 'd <unk> begun to think you was n't .
well , then , that 's all right .
<name> 's go and do it . "
" hold on a minute ; i <name> n't had my say yit .
you listen to me .
shooting 's good , but there 's quieter ways if the thing 's got to be done .
but what i say is this : it ai n't good sense to go <unk> around after a halter if you can git at what you 're up to in some way that 's jist as good and at the same time do n't bring you into no <unk> .
ai n't that so ? "
" you bet it is .
but how you goin ' to manage it this time ? "
" well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever <unk> we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck .
then we 'll wait .
now i say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more'n two hours befo ' this <unk> breaks up and washes off down the river .
see ?
he 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self .
i reckon that 's a <unk> sight better 'n killin ' of him .
i'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ain't good sense , it ai n't good morals .
ai n't i right ? "
" yes , i reck'n you are .
but s'pose she do n't break up and wash off ? "
" well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , ca n't we ? "
" all right , then ; come along . "
so they started , and i lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward .
it was dark as pitch there ; but i said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , " <name> ! "
and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and i says : " quick , <name> , it ai n't no time for fooling around and moaning ; there 's a gang of murderers in yonder , and if we do n't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows ca n't get away from the wreck there 's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix .
but if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fix  for the sheriff 'll get 'em .
quick  hurry !
i 'll hunt the <unk> side , you hunt the <unk> .
you start at the raft , and  " " oh , my lordy , lordy !
<unk> ' ?
dey ain ' no <unk> ' no mo ' ; she done broke loose en gone i  en here we is ! "
chapter xiii .
well , i catched my breath and most fainted .
shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that !
but it war n't no time to be <unk> .
we 'd got to find that boat now  had to have it for ourselves .
so we went <unk> and shaking down the <unk> side , and slow work it was , too  seemed a week before we got to the stern .
no sign of a boat .
<name> said he didn't believe he could go any further  so scared he had n't hardly any strength left , he said .
but i said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure .
so on we <unk> again .
we struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then <unk> along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water .
when we got pretty close to the <unk> door there was the skiff , sure enough !
i could just barely see her .
i felt ever so thankful .
in another second i would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened .
one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and i thought i was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : " heave that blame lantern out o ' sight , <name> ! "
he flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down .
it was packard .
then <name> he come out and got in .
packard says , in a low voice : " all ready  shove off ! "
i could n't hardly <name> on to the shutters , i was so weak .
but <name> says : " hold on  'd you go through him ? "
" no .
did n't you ? "
" no .
so he 's got his share o ' the cash yet . "
" well , then , come along ; no use to take truck and leave money . "
" say , wo n't he suspicion what we 're up to ? "
" maybe he wo n't .
but we got to have it anyway .
come along . "
so they got out and went in .
the door slammed to because it was on the <unk> side ; and in a half second i was in the boat , and <name> come tumbling after me .
i out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went !
we did n't touch an oar , and we did n't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe .
we went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the <unk> , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it .
when we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as <name> turner was .
then <name> manned the oars , and we took out after our raft .
now was the first time that i begun to worry about the men  i reckon i had n't had time to before .
i begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix .
i says to myself , there ai n't no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would i like it ?
so says i to <name> : " the first light we see we 'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it 's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff , and then i 'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be <name> when their time comes . "
but that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever .
the rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , i reckon .
we boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft .
after a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it .
it was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again .
we seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
so i said i would go for it .
the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck .
we hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and i told <name> to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till i come ; then i manned my oars and shoved for the light .
as i got down towards it three or four more showed  up on a hillside .
it was a village .
i closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated .
as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the <unk> of a <unk> ferryboat .
i skimmed around for the watchman , <unk> whereabouts he slept ; and by and by i found him roosting on the <unk> forward , with his head down between his knees .
i gave his shoulder two or three little <unk> , and begun to cry .
he stirred up in a kind of a <unk> way ; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : " hello , what 's up ?
do n't cry , <unk> .
what 's the trouble ? "
i says : " pap , and <unk> , and sis , and  " then i broke down .
he says : " oh , <unk> it now , do n't take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this 'n 'll come out all right .
what 's the matter with 'em ? "
" they 're  they 're  are you the watchman of the boat ? "
" yes , " he says , kind of <unk> like .
" i 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head <unk> ; and sometimes i 'm the freight and passengers .
i ai n't as <name> as old <name> <unk> , and i ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to <name> , <name> , and <name> as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but i 've told him a many a time 't i would n't trade places with him ; for , says i , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and i 'm <unk> if i 'd live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin ' on , not for all his <unk> and as much more on top of it .
says i  " i broke in and says : " they 're in an awful peck of trouble , and  " " who is ? "
" why , pap and <unk> and sis and miss hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there  " " up where ?
where are they ? "
" on the wreck . "
" what wreck ? "
" why , there ai n't but one . "
" what , you do n't mean the <name> <name> ? "
" yes . "
" good land !
what are they doin ' there , for gracious sakes ? "
" well , they did n't go there <unk> . "
" i bet they did n't !
why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick !
why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ? "
" easy enough .
miss hooker was <unk> up there to the town  " " yes , booth 's landing  go on . "
" she was <unk> there at booth 's landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the <unk> to stay all night at her friend 's house , miss <unk> i <unk> her name  and they lost their <unk> , and swung around and went <unk> down , stern first , about two mile , and <unk> on the wreck , and the <unk> and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck .
well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our <unk> , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so we <unk> ; but all of us was saved but <name> whipple  and oh , he was the best cretur !  i most wish 't it had been me , i do . "
" my <name> !
it 's the <unk> thing i ever struck .
and then what did you all do ? "
" well , we <unk> and took on , but it 's so wide there we could n't make nobody hear .
so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow .
i was the only one that could swim , so i made a dash for it , and miss hooker she said if i did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing .
i made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , 'what , in such a night and such a current ?
there ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . '
now if you 'll go and  " " by <name> , i 'd like to , and , blame it , i do n't know but i <name> ; but who in the <unk> 's a-going ' to pay for it ?
do you reckon your pap  " " why that 's all right .
miss hooker she tole me , particular , that her uncle <unk>  " " great guns !
is he her uncle ?
looky here , you break for that light over <unk> , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to <name> <unk> 's , and he 'll foot the <name> .
and do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news .
tell him i 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town .
hump yourself , now ; i 'm a-going up around the corner here to <unk> out my engineer . "
i struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some <unk> ; for i could n't rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start .
but take it all around , i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it .
i wished the widow knowed about it .
i judged she would be proud of me for helping these <unk> , because <unk> and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in .
well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down !
a kind of cold shiver went through me , and then i struck out for her .
she was very deep , and i see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her .
i pulled all around her and <unk> a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still .
i felt a little bit <unk> about the gang , but not much , for i reckoned if they could stand it i could .
then here comes the ferryboat ; so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when i judged i was out of <unk> i laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker 's <unk> , because the captain would know her uncle <unk> would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and i laid into my work and went <unk> down the river .
it did seem a powerful long time before <name> 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people .
chapter xiv .
by and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of <unk> .
we had n't ever been this <name> before in neither of our lives .
the <unk> was prime .
we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .
i told <name> all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and i said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he didn't want no more adventures .
he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then miss watson would sell him south , sure .
well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger .
i read considerable to <name> about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your <name> , and your lordship , and so on , 'stead of mister ; and <name> 's eyes <unk> out , and he was interested .
he says : " i <unk> ' know dey was so many <name> um .
i <name> n't <unk> 'bout none <name> um , <unk> , but ole king <unk> , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er <unk> .
how much do a king git ? "
" get ? "
i says ; " why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them . "
" ain ' dat <name> ?
en what dey got to do , huck ? "
" they do n't do nothing !
why , how you talk !
they just set around . "
" no ; is dat so ? "
" of course it is .
they just set around  except , maybe , when there 's a war ; then they go to the war .
but other times they just lazy around ; or go <unk>  just <unk> and sp  sh !  d ' you hear a noise ? "
we skipped out and looked ; but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back .
" yes , " says i , " and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the <unk> ; and if everybody do n't go just so he <unk> their heads off .
but mostly they <name> round the harem . "
" roun ' de which ? "
" harem . "
" what 's de harem ? "
" the place where he keeps his wives .
do n't you know about the harem ?
<name> had one ; he had about a million wives . "

i never see such a nigger .
if he got a notion in his head once , there war n't no getting it out again .
he was the most down on <name> of any nigger i ever see .
so i went to talking about other kings , and let <name> slide .
i told about <name> sixteenth that got his head cut off in <name> long time ago ; and about his little boy the <unk> , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there .
" po ' little chap . "
" but some says he got out and got away , and come to <name> . "
" dat 's good !

" no . "
" den he <unk> n't git no situation .

" well , i do n't know .
some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk french . "
" why , huck , doan ' de french people talk de same way we does ? "
" no , <name> ; you could n't understand a word they said  not a single word . "
" well , now , i be <unk> !

" i <unk> ' think <unk> ; i 'd take en bust him over de head  dat is , if he war n't white .
i would n't <unk> no nigger to call me dat . "
" shucks , it ai n't calling you anything .
it 's only saying , do you know how to talk french ? "
" well , den , why could n't he say it ? "
" why , he is <unk> it .
that 's a frenchman 's way of saying it . "
" well , it 's a blame <unk> way , en i doan ' want to hear no mo ' 'bout it .
dey ain ' no sense in it . "
" looky here , <name> ; does a cat talk like we do ? "
" no , a cat do n't . "
" well , does a cow ? "
" no , a cow do n't , nuther . "
" does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ? "
" no , dey do n't . "
" it 's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ain't it ? "
" course . "
" and ai n't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from us ? "
" why , mos ' <unk> it is . "
" well , then , why ai n't it natural and right for a frenchman to talk different from us ?
you answer me that . "
" is a cat a man , huck ? "
" no . "
" well , den , dey ai n't no sense in a cat talkin ' like a man .
is a cow a man ?  er is a cow a cat ? "
" no , she ai n't either of them . "
" well , den , she ai n't got no business to talk like either one er the <unk> of 'em .
is a frenchman a man ? "
" yes . "
" well , den !
dad blame it , why doan ' he talk like a man ?
you answer me dat ! "
i see it war n't no use wasting words  you ca n't learn a nigger to argue .
so i quit .
chapter xv .
we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo , at the bottom of illinois , where the ohio river comes in , and that was what we was after .
we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states , and then be out of trouble .
well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when i paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to .
i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went .
i see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared i could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me  and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards .
i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke .
but she did n't come .
i was in such a hurry i hadn't untied her .
i got up and tried to untie her , but i was so excited my hands shook so i could n't hardly do anything with them .
as soon as i got started i took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
that was all right as far as it went , but the towhead war n't sixty yards long , and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog , and had n't no more idea which way i was going than a dead man .
thinks i , it wo n't do to paddle ; first i know i 'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; i got to set still and float , and yet it 's mighty <unk> business to have to hold your hands still at such a time .
i <unk> and listened .
away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits .
i went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again .
the next time it come i see i war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it .
and the next time i was heading away to the left of it  and not gaining on it much either , for i was flying around , this way and that and t'other , but it was going straight ahead all the time .
i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the <unk> that was making the trouble for me .
well , i fought along , and directly i hears the whoop behind me .
i was tangled good now .
that was somebody else 's whoop , or else i was turned around .
i throwed the paddle down .
i heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and i kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and i knowed the current had swung the canoe 's head down-stream , and i was all right if that was <name> and not some other <unk> <unk> .
i could n't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing do n't look natural nor sound natural in a fog .
the whooping went on , and in about a minute i come <unk> down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the <unk> was tearing by them so swift .
in another second or two it was solid white and still again .
i set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and i reckon i didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred .
i just give up then .
i knowed what the matter was .
that cut bank was an island , and <name> had gone down t'other side of it .
it war n't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes .
it had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
i kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , i reckon .
i was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour ; but you don't ever think of that .
no , you feel like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you do n't think to yourself how fast you 're going , but you catch your breath and think , my !
how that snag 's tearing along .
if you think it ai n't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once  you'll see .
next , for about a half an hour , i <unk> now and then ; at last i hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but i could n't do it , and directly i judged i 'd got into a nest of <unk> , for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me  sometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that i could n't see i knowed was there because i 'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that <name> over the banks .
well , i war n't long <unk> the <unk> down amongst the <unk> ; and i only tried to <name> them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a <unk> .
you never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much .
i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so i judged the raft must be <unk> into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing  it was floating a little faster than what i was .
well , i seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but i couldn't hear no sign of a whoop <unk> .
i reckoned <name> had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him .
i was good and tired , so i laid down in the canoe and said i would n't bother no more .
i did n't want to go to sleep , of course ; but i was so sleepy i could n't help it ; so i thought i would take jest one little <unk> .
but i reckon it was more than a <unk> , for when i waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and i was spinning down a big bend stern first .
first i did n't know where i was ; i thought i was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week .
it was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as i could see by the stars .
i looked away down-stream , and seen a black speck on the water .
i took after it ; but when i got to it it war n't nothing but a couple of <unk> made fast together .
then i see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time i was right .
it was the raft .
when i got to it <name> was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the <unk> .
the other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt .
so she 'd had a rough time .
i made fast and laid down under <name> 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against <name> , and says : " hello , <name> , have i been asleep ?
why did n't you stir me up ? "
" goodness gracious , is dat you , huck ?
en you ain ' dead  you <unk> drownded  you 's back agin ?
it 's too good for true , <name> , it 's too good for true .
lem me look at you chile , lem me feel o ' you .
no , you <unk> dead !
you 's back agin , <unk> en <unk> ' , jis de same ole huck  de same ole huck , thanks to goodness ! "
" what 's the matter with you , <name> ?
you been <unk> ? "
" drinkin ' ?
has i <name> <unk> ' ?
has i had a chance to be <unk> ' ? "
" well , then , what makes you talk so wild ? "
" how does i talk wild ? "
" how ?
why , <name> n't you been talking about my coming back , and all that stuff , as if i 'd been gone away ? "
" huck  huck finn , you look me in de eye ; look me in de eye .
<name> n't you <name> gone away ? "
" gone away ?
why , what in the nation do you mean ?
i <name> n't been gone anywheres .
where would i go to ? "
" well , looky here , boss , dey 's <unk> wrong , dey is .
is i me , or who is i ?
is i heah , or whah is i ?
now dat 's what i wants to know . "
" well , i think you 're here , plain enough , but i think you 're a <unk> old fool , <name> . "
" i is , is i ?
well , you answer me dis : did n't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make <unk> ' to de <unk> ? "
" no , i did n't .
what <unk> ?
i <name> n't see no <unk> . "
" you <name> n't seen no towhead ?
looky here , did n't de line pull loose en de <unk> ' go <unk> ' down de river , en leave you en de canoe <unk> in de fog ? "
" what fog ? "
" why , de fog !  de fog dat 's been aroun ' all night .
en did n't you whoop , en did n't i whoop , tell we got mix ' up in de islands en one <name> us got los ' en t'other one was jis ' as good as los ' , <unk> he <unk> ' know whah he wuz ?
en did n't i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a <unk> time en mos ' git drownded ?
now ain ' dat so , boss  ai n't it so ?
you answer me dat . "
" well , this is too many for me , <name> .
i <name> n't seen no fog , nor no islands , nor no troubles , nor nothing .
i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and i reckon i done the same .
you could n't a got drunk in that time , so of course you 've been dreaming . "
" dad fetch it , how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes ? "
" well , <name> it all , you did dream it , because there did n't any of it happen . "
" but , huck , it 's all jis ' as plain to me as  " " it do n't make no difference how plain it is ; there ai n't nothing in it .
i know , because i 've been here all the time . "
<name> did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it .
then he says : " well , den , i reck'n i did dream it , huck ; but dog my cats ef it ai n't de <unk> dream i ever see .
en i <name> n't ever had no dream <unk> ' <unk> tired me like dis one . "
" oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes .
but this one was a <unk> dream ; tell me all about it , <name> . "
so <name> went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable .
then he said he must start in and " <unk> " it , because it was sent for a warning .
he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him .
the <unk> was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we did n't try hard to make out to understand them they 'd just take us into bad luck , 'stead of keeping us out of it .
the lot of <unk> was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and did n't talk back and <unk> them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free states , and would n't have no more trouble .
it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now .
" oh , well , that 's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , <name> , " i says ; " but what does these things stand for ? "
it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar .
you could see them first-rate now .
<name> looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again .
he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away .
but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : " what do dey <name> ' for ?
i'se gwyne to tell you .
when i got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin ' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz <unk> broke <unk> you wuz los ' , en i <unk> ' <unk> no ' mo ' what become er me en de <unk> ' .
en when i wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en <unk> ' , de tears come , en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo ' foot , i 's so thankful .
en all you wuz thinkin ' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool <unk> ole <name> wid a lie .
dat truck dah is trash ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey <unk> 's en makes 'em ashamed . "
then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that .
but that was enough .
it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back .
it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ; but i done it , and i war n't ever sorry for it afterwards , neither .
i did n't do him no more mean tricks , and i wouldn't done that one if i 'd a knowed it would make him feel that way .
chapter xvi .
we slept most all day , and started out at night , a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession .
she had four long sweeps at each end , so we judged she carried as many as thirty men , likely .
she had five big wigwams aboard , wide apart , and an open camp fire in the middle , and a tall <unk> at each end .
there was a power of style about her .
it amounted to something being a <unk> on such a craft as that .
we went drifting down into a big bend , and the night clouded up and got hot .
the river was very wide , and was walled with solid timber on both sides ; you could n't see a break in it hardly ever , or a light .
we talked about cairo , and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it .
i said likely we would n't , because i had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ?
<name> said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show .
but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again .
that disturbed <name>  and me too .
so the question was , what to do ?
i said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a <unk> , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to cairo .
<name> thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited .
there war n't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it .
he said he 'd be mighty sure to see it , because he 'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he 'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom .
every little while he jumps up and says : " dah she is ? "
but it war n't .
it was <unk> , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before .
<name> said it made him all over <unk> and feverish to be so close to freedom .
well , i can tell you it made me all over <unk> and feverish , too , to hear him , because i begun to get it through my head that he was most free  and who was to blame for it ?
why , me .
i could n't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way .
it got to troubling me so i could n't rest ; i couldn't stay still in one place .
it had n't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that i was doing .
but now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more .
i tried to make out to myself that i war n't to blame , because i did n't run <name> off from his rightful owner ; but it war n't no use , conscience up and says , every time , " but you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody . "
that was so  i could n't get around that <unk> .
that was where it pinched .
conscience says to me , " what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ?
what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ?
why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how .
that 's what she done . "
i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead .
i fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and <name> was <unk> up and down past me .
we neither of us could keep still .
every time he danced around and says , " dah 's cairo ! "
it went through me like a shot , and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of <unk> .
<name> talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself .
he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master would n't sell them , they 'd get an <unk> to go and steal them .
it most froze me to hear such talk .
he would n't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before .
just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free .
it was according to the old saying , " give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an <unk> . "
thinks i , this is what comes of my not thinking .
here was this nigger , which i had as good as helped to run away , coming right out <unk> and saying he would steal his children  children that belonged to a man i did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm .
i was sorry to hear <name> say that , it was such a lowering of him .
my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last i says to it , " let up on me  it ai n't too late yet  i 'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell . "
i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off .
all my troubles was gone .
i went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself .
by and by one showed .
<name> sings out : " we 's safe , huck , we 's safe !
jump up and crack yo ' heels !
dat 's de good ole cairo at las ' , i jis knows it ! "
i says : " i 'll take the canoe and go and see , <name> .
it might n't be , you know . "
he jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as i shoved off , he says : " <unk> soon i 'll be <unk> ' for <name> , en i 'll say , it 's all on accounts o ' huck ; i 's a free man , en i could n't ever <name> free ef it <unk> ' <name> for huck ; huck done it .
<name> wo n't ever forgit you , huck ; you 's de <unk> ' <unk> <name> 's ever had ; en you 's de only <unk> ' ole <name> 's got now . "
i was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me .
i went along slow then , and i war n't right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i war n't .
when i was fifty yards off , <name> says : " dah you goes , de ole true huck ; de on'y white <unk> dat ever kep ' his promise to ole <name> . "
well , i just felt sick .
but i says , i got to do it  i ca n't get out of it .
right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and i stopped .
one of them says : " what 's that yonder ? "
" a piece of a raft , " i says .
" do you belong on it ? "
" yes , sir . "
" any men on it ? "
" only one , sir . "
" well , there 's five niggers run off to-night up yonder , above the head of the bend .
is your man white or black ? "
i did n't answer up prompt .
i tried to , but the words would n't come .
i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but i war n't man enough  had n't the <unk> of a rabbit .
i see i was weakening ; so i just give up trying , and up and says : " he 's white . "
" i reckon we 'll go and see for ourselves . "
" i wish you would , " says i , " because it 's pap that 's there , and maybe you 'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is .
he 's sick  and so is <unk> and <name> <name> . "
" oh , the devil !
we 're in a hurry , boy .
but i s'pose we 've got to .
come , buckle to your paddle , and let 's get along . "
i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars .
when we had made a stroke or two , i says : " pap 'll be mighty much <unk> to you , i can tell you .
everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and i ca n't do it by myself . "
" well , that 's infernal mean .
odd , too .
say , boy , what 's the matter with your father ? "
" it 's the  a  the  well , it ai n't anything much . "
they stopped pulling .
it war n't but a mighty little ways to the raft now .
one says : " boy , that 's a lie .
what is the matter with your pap ?
answer up square now , and it 'll be the better for you . "
" i <name> , sir , i <name> , honest  but do n't leave us , please .
it 's the  the  gentlemen , if you 'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the <unk> , you wo n't have to come <unk> the raft  please do . "
" set her back , <name> , set her back ! "
says one .
they backed water .
" keep away , boy  keep to <unk> .
confound it , i just expect the wind has blowed it to us .
your pap 's got the small-pox , and you know it precious well .
why did n't you come out and say so ?
do you want to spread it all over ? "
" well , " says i , <unk> , " i 've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us . "
" poor devil , there 's something in that .
we are right down sorry for you , but we  well , <name> it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see .
look here , i 'll tell you what to do .
do n't you try to land by yourself , or you'll smash everything to pieces .
you float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river .
it <name> be long after <unk> then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever .
do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter .
now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy .
it wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is  it 's only a <unk> .
say , i reckon your father 's poor , and i 'm bound to say he 's in pretty hard luck .
here , i 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by .
i feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom !
it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? "
" hold on , <name> , " says the other man , " here 's a twenty to put on the board for me .
good-bye , boy ; you do as mr. <name> told you , and you'll be all right . "
" that 's so , my boy  good-bye , good-bye .
if you see any runaway niggers you get help and <unk> them , and you can make some money by it . "
" good-bye , sir , " says i ; " i wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it . "
they went off and i got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because i knowed very well i had done wrong , and i see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get started right when he's little ai n't got no show  when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat .
then i thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s'pose you 'd a done right and give <name> up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
no , says i , i 'd feel bad  i 'd feel just the same way i do now .
well , then , says i , what 's the use you learning to do right when it 's troublesome to do right and ai n't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same ?
i was stuck .
i could n't answer that .
so i reckoned i would n't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come <unk> at the time .
i went into the wigwam ; <name> war n't there .
i looked all around ; he warn't anywhere .
i says : " <name> ! "
" here i is , huck .
is dey out o ' sight yit ?
do n't talk loud . "
he was in the river under the stern oar , with just his nose out .
i told him they were out of sight , so he come aboard .
he says : " i was <unk> ' to all de talk , en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho ' if dey come aboard .
den i was gwyne to swim to de <unk> agin when dey was gone .
but <unk> , how you did fool 'em , huck !
dat wuz de <unk> ' dodge !
i tell you , chile , <unk> it save ' ole <name>  ole <name> ai n't going to forgit you for dat , <name> . "
then we talked about the money .
it was a pretty good raise  twenty dollars apiece .
<name> said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states .
he said twenty mile more war n't far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there .
towards daybreak we tied up , and <name> was mighty particular about hiding the raft good .
then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit <unk> .
that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend .
i went off in the canoe to ask about it .
pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff , setting a <unk> .
i ranged up and says : " mister , is that town cairo ? "
" cairo ?
no .
you must be a blame ' fool . "
" what town is it , mister ? "
" if you want to know , go and find out .
if you stay here <unk> ' around me for about a half a minute longer you 'll get something you wo n't want . "
i paddled to the raft .
<name> was awful disappointed , but i said never mind , cairo would be the next place , i reckoned .
we passed another town before daylight , and i was going out again ; but it was high ground , so i did n't go .
no high ground about cairo , <name> said .
i had forgot it .
we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank .
i begun to suspicion something .
so did <name> .
i says : " maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night . "
he says : " doan ' <name> 's talk about it , huck .
po ' niggers ca n't have no luck .
i <unk> <unk> dat <unk> war n't done wid its work . "
" i wish i 'd never seen that <unk> , <name>  i do wish i 'd never laid eyes on it . "
" it ai n't yo ' fault , huck ; you <unk> ' know .
do n't you blame <unk> 'bout it . "
when it was daylight , here was the clear ohio water <unk> , sure enough , and outside was the old regular muddy !
so it was all up with cairo .
we talked it all over .
it would n't do to take to the shore ; we couldn't take the raft up the stream , of course .
there war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances .
so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone !
we did n't say a word for a good while .
there war n't anything to say .
we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the <unk> ; so what was the use to talk about it ?
it would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck  and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still .
by and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
we war n't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us .
so we shoved out after dark on the raft .
anybody that do n't believe yet that it 's foolishness to handle a <unk> , after all that that <unk> done for us , <name> believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us .
the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore .
but we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more .
well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog .
you ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance .
it got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river .
we lit the lantern , and judged she would see it .
up-stream boats did n't <unk> come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
we could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close .
she aimed right for us .
often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he's mighty smart .
well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be <unk> off a bit .
she was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of <unk> around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and <unk> , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us .
there was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steam  and as <name> went overboard on one side and i on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft .
i dived  and i aimed to find the bottom , too , for a <unk> wheel had got to go over me , and i wanted it to have plenty of room .
i could always stay under water a minute ; this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half .
then i bounced for the top in a hurry , for i was nearly <unk> .
i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit .
of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for <unk> ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though i could hear her .
i <name> out for <name> about a dozen times , but i did n't get any answer ; so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was " treading water , " and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me .
but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that i was in a crossing ; so i changed off and went that way .
it was one of these long , slanting , <unk> crossings ; so i was a good long time in getting over .
i made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank .
i could n't see but a little ways , but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then i run across a big old-fashioned double <unk> before i noticed it .
i was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and i knowed better than to move another <name> .
chapter xvii .
in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : " be done , boys !
who 's there ? "
i says : " it 's me . "
" who 's me ? "
" <name> <name> , sir . "
" what do you want ? "
" i do n't want nothing , sir .
i only want to go along by , but the dogs wo n't let me . "
" what are you prowling around here this time of night for  hey ? "
" i war n't prowling around , sir , i fell overboard off of the steamboat . "
" oh , you did , did you ?
strike a light there , somebody .
what did you say your name was ? "
" <name> <name> , sir .
i 'm only a boy . "
" look here , if you 're telling the truth you need n't be afraid  <unk> hurt you .
but do n't try to budge ; stand right where you are .
rouse out <name> and <name> , some of you , and fetch the guns .
<name> <name> , is there anybody with you ? "
" no , sir , nobody . "
i heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light .
the man <name> out : " snatch that light away , <name> , you old fool  ai n't you got any sense ?
put it on the floor behind the front door .
<name> , if you and <name> are ready , take your places . "
" all ready . "
" now , <name> <name> , do you know the <unk> ? "
" no , sir ; i never heard of them . "
" well , that may be so , and it may n't .
now , all ready .
step forward , <name> <name> .
and mind , do n't you hurry  come mighty slow .
if there's anybody with you , let him keep back  if he shows himself he 'll be shot .
come along now .
come slow ; push the door open yourself  just enough to squeeze in , d ' you hear ? "
i did n't hurry ; i could n't if i 'd a wanted to .
i took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only i thought i could hear my heart .
the dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me .
when i got to the three log <unk> i heard them <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , " there , that 's enough  put your head in . "
i done it , but i judged they would take it off .
the candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , i tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more  all of them fine and handsome  and the sweetest old gray-headed <name> , and back of her two young women which i could n't see right well .
the old gentleman says : " there ; i reckon it 's all right .
come in . "
as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows  there war n't none on the side .
they held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , " why , he ai n't a <unk>  no , there ain't any <unk> about him . "
then the old man said he hoped i wouldn't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it  it was only to make sure .
so he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right .
he told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old <name> says : " why , bless you , <name> , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and don't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? "
" true for you , <name>  i forgot . "
so the old <name> says : " <name> " ( this was a nigger woman ) , " you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up <name> and tell him  oh , here he is himself .
<name> , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry . "
<name> looked about as old as me  thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me .
he had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very <unk> .
he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one .
he says : " ai n't they no <unk> around ? "
they said , no , 't was a false alarm .
" well , " he says , " if they 'd a <name> some , i reckon i 'd a got one . "
they all laughed , and <name> says : " why , <name> , they might have scalped us all , you 've been so slow in coming . "
" well , nobody come after me , and it ai n't right i 'm always kept down ; i do n't get no show . "
" never mind , <name> , my boy , " says the old man , " you 'll have show enough , all in good time , do n't you fret about that .
go 'long with you now , and do as your mother told you . "
when we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and i put them on .
while i was at it he asked me what my name was , but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a <unk> and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where <name> was when the candle went out .
i said i did n't know ; i had n't heard about it before , no way .
" well , guess , " he says .
" how 'm i going to guess , " says i , " when i never heard tell of it before ? "
" but you can guess , ca n't you ?
it 's just as easy . "
" which candle ? "
i says .
" why , any candle , " he says .
" i do n't know where he was , " says i ; " where was he ? "
" why , he was in the dark !
that 's where he was ! "
" well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for ? "
" why , blame it , it 's a riddle , do n't you see ?
say , how long are you going to stay here ?
you got to stay always .
we can just have booming times  they do n't have no school now .
do you own a dog ?
i 've got a dog  and he 'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in .
do you like to comb up sundays , and all that kind of foolishness ?
you bet i do n't , but <name> she makes me .
confound these ole <unk> !
i reckon i'd better put 'em on , but i 'd ruther not , it 's so warm .
are you all ready ?
all right .
come along , old hoss . "
cold corn-pone , cold <unk> , butter and <unk>  that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever i 've come across yet .
<name> and his <name> and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women .
they all smoked and talked , and i eat and talked .
the young women had <unk> around them , and their hair down their backs .
they all asked me questions , and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw , and my sister <name> <name> run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and <name> went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and <name> and <unk> died , and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died i took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how i come to be here .
so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it .
then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and i went to bed with <name> , and when i waked up in the morning , drat it all , i had forgot what my name was .
so i laid there about an hour trying to think , and when <name> waked up i says : " can you spell , <name> ? "
" yes , " he says .
" i bet you ca n't spell my name , " says i .
" i bet you what you dare i can , " says he .
" all right , " says i , " go ahead . "
" <unk> <unk>  there now , " he says .
" well , " says i , " you done it , but i did n't think you could .
it ai n't no slouch of a name to spell  right off without studying . "
i set it down , private , because somebody might want me to spell it next , and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it .
it was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too .
i had n't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style .
it did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town .
there war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them .
there was a big fireplace that was <unk> on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and <unk> them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red <unk> that they call <unk> , same as they do in town .
they had big brass <unk> that could hold up a <unk> .
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it .
it was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these <unk> had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out .
they would n't took any money for her .
well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but did n't open their mouths nor look different nor interested .
they squeaked through underneath .
there was a couple of big <unk> fans spread out behind those things .
on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and <unk> and prettier than real ones is , but they war n't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath .
this table had a cover made out of beautiful <unk> , with a red and blue <unk> painted on it , and a painted border all around .
it come all the way from philadelphia , they said .
there was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table .
one was a big family bible full of pictures .
one was pilgrim 's progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why .
i read considerable in it now and then .
the statements was interesting , but tough .
another was friendship 's offering , full of beautiful stuff and poetry ; but i didn't read the poetry .
another was <name> <name> 's speeches , and another was dr. <unk> 's family medicine , which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead .
there was a hymn book , and a lot of other books .
and there was nice <unk> chairs , and perfectly sound , too  not <unk> down in the middle and busted , like an old basket .
they had pictures <name> on the walls  mainly <unk> and <unk> , and battles , and highland <unk> , and one called " signing the declaration . "
there was some that they called <unk> , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old .
they was different from any pictures i ever see before  blacker , mostly , than is common .
one was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with <unk> like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black <unk> bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping <name> , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a <unk> , and underneath the picture it said " shall i never see thee more alas . "
another one was a young <name> with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a <unk> , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said " i shall never hear thy sweet <unk> more alas . "
there was one where a young <name> was at a window looking up at the moon , and tears running down her cheeks ; and she had an open letter in one hand with black <unk> wax showing on one edge of it , and she was <unk> a locket with a chain to it against her mouth , and underneath the picture it said " and <name> thou gone yes thou <name> gone alas . "
these was all nice pictures , i reckon , but i did n't somehow seem to take to them , because if ever i was down a little they always give me the <unk> .
everybody was sorry she died , because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do , and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost .
but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard .
she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick , and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done , but she never got the chance .
it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown , standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off , with her hair all down her back , and looking up to the moon , with the tears running down her face , and she had two arms folded across her breast , and two arms stretched out in front , and two more reaching up towards the moon  and the idea was to see which pair would look best , and then scratch out all the other arms ; but , as i was saying , she died before she got her mind made up , and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room , and every time her birthday come they <name> flowers on it .
other times it was hid with a little curtain .
the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face , but there was so many arms it made her look too <unk> , seemed to me .
this young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive , and used to paste <unk> and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer , and write poetry after them out of her own head .
it was very good poetry .
this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of <name> dowling <unk> that fell down a well and was drownded : ode to <name> dowling <unk> , <unk> and did young <name> <unk> , and did young <name> die ?
and did the sad hearts thicken , and did the mourners cry ?
no ; such was not the fate of young <name> dowling <unk> ; though sad hearts round him thickened , 't was not from sickness ' shots .
no <unk> did rack his frame , nor measles drear with spots ; not these impaired the sacred name of <name> dowling <unk> .
despised love struck not with woe that head of curly knots , nor stomach troubles laid him low , young <name> dowling <unk> .
o no .
then list with tearful eye , whilst i his fate do tell .
his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well .
they got him out and emptied him ; alas it was too late ; his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great .
if <unk> <unk> could make poetry like that before she was fourteen , there ai n't no telling what she could a done by and by .
<name> said she could rattle off poetry like nothing .
she did n't ever have to stop to think .
he said she would slap down a line , and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead .
she war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was <unk> .
every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her " tribute " before he was cold .
she called them <unk> .
the neighbors said it was the doctor first , then <unk> , then the undertaker  the undertaker never got in ahead of <unk> but once , and then she <name> fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was whistler .
she war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long .
poor thing , many 's the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had <unk> on her a little .
i liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us .
poor <unk> made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it did n't seem right that there war n't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but i could n't seem to make it go somehow .
they kept <unk> room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there .
the old <name> took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly .
well , as i was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink .
there was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , i reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing " the last link is broken " and play " the battle of <unk> " on it .
the walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside .
it was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place .
nothing could n't be better .
and war n't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too !
chapter xviii .
col. <unk> was a gentleman , you see .
he was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family .
he was well born , as the saying is , and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the widow <name> said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he war n't no more quality than a <unk> himself .
col. <unk> was very tall and very slim , and had a <unk> complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say .
his forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and <name> to his shoulders .
his hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on sundays he wore a blue <unk> with brass buttons on it .
he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it .
there war n't no <unk> about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud .
he was as kind as he could be  you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence .
sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a <unk> , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards .
he did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners  everybody was always <unk> where he was .
everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was <name> most always  i mean he made it seem like good weather .
when he turned into a <unk> it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there would n't nothing go wrong again for a week .
when him and the old <name> come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them <unk> , and did n't set down again till they had set down .
then <name> and <name> went to the sideboard where the <unk> was , and mixed a glass of <unk> and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till <name> 's and <name> 's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , " our duty to you , sir , and madam ; " and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and <name> and <name> poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple <name> in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and <name> , and we drank to the old people too .
<name> was the oldest and <name> next  tall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes .
they dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad panama hats .
then there was miss <name> ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father .
she was beautiful .
so was her sister , miss <name> , but it was a different kind .
she was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
each person had their own nigger to wait on them  <name> too .
my nigger had a monstrous easy time , because i war n't used to having anybody do anything for me , but <name> 's was on the jump most of the time .
this was all there was of the family now , but there used to be more  three sons ; they got killed ; and <unk> that died .
the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers .
sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such <unk> round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods <unk> , and balls at the house nights .
these people was mostly <unk> of the family .
the men brought their guns with them .
it was a handsome lot of quality , i tell you .
there was another clan of aristocracy around there  five or six families  mostly of the name of <unk> .
they was as high-toned and well born and <name> and grand as the tribe of <unk> .
the <unk> and <unk> used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the <unk> there on their fine horses .
one day <name> and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming .
we was crossing the road .
<name> says : " quick !
jump for the woods ! "
we done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves .
pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier .
he had his gun across his pommel .
i had seen him before .
it was young harney <unk> .
i heard <unk> gun go off at my ear , and harney 's hat tumbled off from his head .
he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid .
but we did n't wait .
we started through the woods on a run .
the woods warn't thick , so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice i seen harney cover <name> with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come  to get his hat , i reckon , but i could n't see .
we never stopped running till we got home .
the old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute  't was pleasure , mainly , i judged  then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : " i do n't like that shooting from behind a bush .
why did n't you step into the road , my boy ? "
" the <unk> do n't , father .
they always take advantage . "
miss <name> she held her head up like a <name> while <name> was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped .
the two young men looked dark , but never said nothing .
miss <name> she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt .
soon as i could get <name> down by the <unk> under the trees by ourselves , i says : " did you want to kill him , <name> ? "
" well , i bet i did . "
" what did he do to you ? "
" him ?
he never done nothing to me . "
" well , then , what did you want to kill him for ? "
" why , nothing  only it 's on account of the feud . "
" what 's a feud ? "
" why , where was you raised ?
do n't you know what a feud is ? "
" never heard of it before  tell me about it . "
" well , " says <name> , " a feud is this way : a man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills him ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the cousins chip in  and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ai n't no more feud .
but it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time . "
" has this one been going on long , <name> ? "
" well , i should reckon !
it started thirty year ago , or <unk> along there .
there was trouble 'bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit  which he would naturally do , of course .
anybody would . "
" what was the trouble about , <name> ?  land ? "
" i reckon maybe  i do n't know . "
" well , who done the shooting ?
was it a <unk> or a <unk> ? "
" laws , how do i know ?
it was so long ago . "
" do n't anybody know ? "
" oh , yes , <name> knows , i reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they do n't know now what the row was about in the first place . "
" has there been many killed , <name> ? "
" yes ; right smart chance of funerals .
but they do n't always kill .
<unk> got a few buckshot in him ; but he do n't mind it <unk> he do n't weigh much , anyway .
<name> 's been carved up some with a bowie , and <name> 's been hurt once or twice . "
" has anybody been killed this year , <name> ? "
" yes ; we got one and they got one .
'bout three months ago my cousin <name> , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame ' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old <unk> <unk> <unk> ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair <unk> in the wind ; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , <name> 'lowed he could <unk> him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man <unk> all the time ; so at last <name> seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down .
but he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid him out . "
" i reckon that old man was a coward , <name> . "
" i reckon he war n't a coward .
not by a blame ' sight .
there ai n't a coward amongst them <unk>  not a one .
and there ai n't no cowards amongst the <unk> either .
why , that old man kep ' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three <unk> , and come out winner .
they was all <unk> ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep ' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the <unk> stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and <unk> away at him , and he <unk> away at them .
him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the <unk> had to be fetched home  and one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day .
no , sir ; if a body 's out hunting for cowards he do n't want to fool away any time amongst them <unk> , becuz they do n't breed any of that kind . "
next <name> we all went to church , about three mile , everybody <unk> .
the men took their guns along , so did <name> , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall .
the <unk> done the same .
it was pretty ornery preaching  all about brotherly love , and <unk> <unk> ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about <name> and good works and free <name> and <unk> , and i do n't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet .
about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull .
<name> and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep .
i went up to our room , and judged i would take a nap myself .
i found that sweet miss <name> standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if i liked her , and i said i did ; and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody , and i said i would .
then she said she 'd forgot her testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody .
i said i would .
so i slid out and slipped off up the road , and there war n't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there war n't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in <unk> because it 's cool .
if you notice , most folks do n't go to church only when they 've got to ; but a hog is different .
says i to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament .
so i give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with " half-past two " wrote on it with a pencil .
i ransacked it , but could n't find anything else .
i could n't make anything out of that , so i put the paper in the book again , and when i got home and upstairs there was miss <name> in her door waiting for me .
she pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said i was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody .
she was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty .
i was a good deal astonished , but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if i had read it , and i said no , and she asked me if i could read writing , and i told her " no , only <unk> , " and then she said the paper war n't anything but a <unk> to keep her place , and i might go and play now .
i went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind .
when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes <unk> , and says : " mars <unk> , if you 'll come down into de swamp i 'll show you a whole stack o ' <unk> . "
thinks i , that 's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday .
he <unk> know a body do n't love <unk> enough to go around hunting for them .
what is he up to , anyway ?
so i says : " all right ; trot ahead . "
i followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile .
we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : " you shove right in dah jist a few steps , mars <unk> ; dah 's whah dey is .
i 's seed 'm befo ' ; i do n't <unk> to see 'em no mo ' . "
then he <unk> right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him .
i poked into the place <unk> and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all <name> around with vines , and found a man laying there asleep  and , by <unk> , it was my old <name> !
i waked him up , and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it war n't .
he nearly cried he was so glad , but he war n't surprised .
said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but das n't answer , because he did n't want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again .
says he : " i got hurt a little , en could n't swim <unk> ' , so i wuz a <unk> ways <unk> you towards de las ' ; when you landed i <unk> i could ketch up wid you on de <name> ' <unk> havin ' to shout at you , but when i see dat house i begin to go slow .
i 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you  i wuz 'fraid o ' de dogs ; but when it 'uz all quiet agin i knowed you 's in de house , so i struck out for de woods to wait for day .
early in de <unk> some er de niggers come along , gwyne to de fields , en dey tuk me en showed me dis place , whah de dogs ca n't track me on accounts o ' de water , en dey brings me truck to eat every night , en tells me how you 's <unk> along . "
" why did n't you tell my <name> to fetch me here sooner , <name> ? "
" well , <unk> n't no use to <unk> you , huck , tell we could do <unk>  but we 's all right now .
i <name> <unk> ' pots en pans en vittles , as i got a chanst , en <unk> ' up de <unk> ' nights when  " " what raft , <name> ? "
" our ole <unk> ' . "
" you mean to say our old raft war n't smashed all to flinders ? "
" no , she war n't .
she was tore up a good deal  one en ' of her was ; but dey war n't no great harm done , on'y our traps was mos ' all los ' .
ef we <unk> ' dive ' so deep en swum so fur under water , en de night <unk> ' <name> so dark , en we war n't so <unk> , en <name> sich <unk> , as de sayin ' is , we 'd a seed de <unk> ' .
but it 's jis ' as well we did n't , <unk> now she's all fixed up agin mos ' as good as new , en we 's got a new lot o ' stuff , in de place o ' what 'uz los ' . "
" why , how did you get hold of the raft again , <name>  did you catch her ? "
" how i gwyne to ketch her en i out in de woods ?
no ; some er de niggers <unk> ' her ketched on a snag along heah in de <name> ' , en dey hid her in a <unk> <unk> de willows , en dey wuz so much <unk> ' 'bout which <name> 'um she <unk> to de mos ' dat i come to heah 'bout it <unk> soon , so i ups en settles de trouble by tellin ' 'um she do n't <unk> to none <unk> um , but to you en me ; en i <unk> 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white <unk> <unk> , en git a <unk> for it ?
den i gin 'm ten cents apiece , en dey 'uz mighty well satisfied , en wisht some mo ' <unk> 's 'ud come along en make 'm <name> agin .
dey 's mighty good to me , dese niggers is , en whatever i wants 'm to do fur me i doan ' have to <unk> 'm twice , <name> .
dat <name> 's a good nigger , en <unk> smart . "
" yes , he is .
he ai n't ever told me you was here ; told me to come , and he 'd show me a lot of <unk> .
if anything happens he ain't mixed up in it .
he can say he never seen us together , and it 'll be the truth . "
i do n't want to talk much about the next day .
i reckon i 'll cut it pretty short .
i waked up about <name> , and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when i noticed how still it was  did n't seem to be anybody stirring .
that war n't usual .
next i noticed that <name> was up and gone .
well , i gets up , <unk> , and goes down stairs  nobody around ; everything as still as a mouse .
just the same outside .
thinks i , what does it mean ?
down by the <unk> i comes across my <name> , and says : " what 's it all about ? "
says he : " do n't you know , mars <unk> ? "
" no , " says i , " i do n't . "
" well , den , miss <name> 's run off !
'deed she has .
she run off in de night some time  nobody do n't know jis ' when ; run off to get married to dat young harney <unk> , you know  <unk> , so dey <unk> .
de <unk> <unk> ' it out 'bout half an hour ago  maybe a little mo '  en ' i tell you dey war n't no time los ' .
sich another <unk> ' up guns en hosses you never see !
de women folks has gone for to stir up de relations , en ole mars <name> en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him <unk> ' he kin git acrost de river wid miss <name> .
i reck'n dey 's gwyne to be mighty rough times . "
" <name> went off 'thout waking me up . "
" well , i reck'n he did !
dey war n't gwyne to mix you up in it .
mars <name> he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he 's gwyne to fetch home a <unk> or bust .
well , dey 'll be plenty <name> 'm dah , i reck'n , en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst . "
i took up the river road as hard as i could put .
by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off .
when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place , and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach , and watched .
there was a <unk> four foot high a little ways in front of the tree , and first i was going to hide behind that ; but maybe it was luckier i did n't .
there was four or five men <unk> around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the <unk> alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they could n't come it .
every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at .
the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways .
by and by the men stopped <unk> around and yelling .
they started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the <unk> , and drops one of them out of his saddle .
all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to <name> him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run .
they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed .
then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them .
they gained on the boys , but it did n't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again .
one of the boys was <name> , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old .
the men ripped around awhile , and then rode away .
as soon as they was out of sight i <name> out to <name> and told him .
he did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first .
he was awful surprised .
he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some <unk> or other  would n't be gone long .
i wished i was out of that tree , but i <unk> come down .
<name> begun to cry and rip , and 'lowed that him and his cousin <name> ( that was the other young chap ) would make up for this day yet .
he said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy .
said the <unk> laid for them in ambush .
<name> said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations  the <unk> was too strong for them .
i asked him what was become of young harney and miss <name> .
he said they 'd got across the river and was safe .
i was glad of that ; but the way <name> did take on because he did n't manage to kill harney that day he shot at him  i <name> n't ever heard anything like it .
all of a sudden , bang !
bang !
bang !
goes three or four guns  the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses !
the boys jumped for the river  both of them hurt  and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , " kill them , kill them ! "
it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree .
i ai n't a-going to tell all that happened  it would make me sick again if i was to do that .
i wished i had n't ever come ashore that night to see such things .
i ai n't ever going to get shut of them  lots of times i dream about them .
i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down .
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so i reckoned the trouble was still a-going on .
i was mighty downhearted ; so i made up my mind i would n't ever go <unk> that house again , because i reckoned i was to blame , somehow .
i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss <name> was to meet harney somewheres at half-past two and run off ; and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess would n't ever happened .
when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till i got them ashore ; then i covered up their faces , and got away as quick as i could .
i cried a little when i was covering up <name> 's face , for he was mighty good to me .
it was just dark now .
i never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
<name> war n't on his island , so i tramped off in a hurry for the <unk> , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country .
the raft was gone !
my souls , but i was scared !
i could n't get my breath for most a minute .
then i raised a yell .
a voice not twenty-five foot from me says : " good <name> ' !
is dat you , <name> ?
doan ' make no noise . "
it was <name> 's voice  nothing ever sounded so good before .
i run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and <name> he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me .
he says : " laws bless you , chile , i 'uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin .
<unk> been heah ; he say he reck'n you 's <name> shot , <unk> you <unk> ' come home no mo ' ; so i 's jes ' dis minute a <unk> ' de <unk> ' down towards de <unk> er de <unk> , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as <name> comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead .
<unk> , i 's mighty glad to git you back again , <name> . "
i says : " all right  that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think i 've been killed , and floated down the river  there 's something up there that 'll help them think so  so do n't you lose no time , <name> , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can . "
i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi .
then we <name> up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more .
i had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so <name> he got out some <unk> and <unk> , and pork and cabbage and greens  there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right  and whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time .
i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was <name> to get away from the swamp .
we said there war n't no home like a raft , after all .
other places do seem so cramped up and <unk> , but a raft do n't .
you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft .
chapter xix .
two or three days and nights went by ; i reckon i might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely .
here is the way we put in the time .
it was a monstrous big river down there  sometimes a mile and a half wide ; we run nights , and laid up and hid <unk> ; soon as night was most gone we stopped <unk> and tied up  nearly always in the dead water under a towhead ; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows , and hid the raft with them .
then we set out the lines .
next we slid into the river and had a swim , so as to <unk> up and cool off ; then we set down on the <name> bottom where the water was about knee deep , and watched the daylight come .
not a sound anywheres  perfectly still  just like the whole world was asleep , only sometimes the <unk> <unk> , maybe .
the first thing to see , looking away over the water , was a kind of dull line  that was the woods on t'other side ; you couldn't make nothing else out ; then a pale place in the sky ; then more paleness spreading around ; then the river softened up away off , and war n't black any more , but gray ; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away  trading <unk> , and such things ; and long black streaks  rafts ; sometimes you could hear a sweep <unk> ; or <unk> up voices , it was so still , and sounds come so far ; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ; and you see the mist curl up off of the water , and the east <unk> up , and the river , and you make out a <unk> in the edge of the woods , away on the bank on t'other side of the river , being a <unk> , likely , and piled by them <unk> so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ; then the nice breeze springs up , and comes fanning you from over there , so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ; but sometimes not that way , because they 've left dead fish laying around , <unk> and such , and they do get pretty rank ; and next you 've got the full day , and everything smiling in the sun , and the song-birds just going it !
a little smoke could n't be noticed now , so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast .
and afterwards we would watch the <unk> of the river , and kind of lazy along , and by and by lazy off to sleep .
wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream , so far off towards the other side you could n't tell nothing about her only whether she was a <unk> or <unk> ; then for about an hour there would n't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see  just solid <unk> .
next you 'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a <unk> on it chopping , because they're most always doing it on a raft ; you 'd see the axe flash and come down  you do n't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it 's above the man 's head then you hear the <unk> !  it had took all that time to come over the water .
so we would put in the day , <unk> around , listening to the stillness .
once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats would n't run over them .
a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing  heard them plain ; but we couldn't see no sign of them ; it made you feel <unk> ; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air .
<name> said he believed it was spirits ; but i says : " no ; spirits would n't say , <unk> the dern fog . ' "
soon as it was night out we shoved ; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone , and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ; then we lit the pipes , and dangled our legs in the water , and talked about all kinds of things  we was always naked , day and night , whenever the mosquitoes would let us  the new clothes <name> 's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable , and besides i did n't go much on clothes , nohow .
sometimes we 'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time .
yonder was the banks and the islands , across the water ; and maybe a spark  which was a candle in a cabin window ; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two  on a raft or a scow , you know ; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them <unk> .
it 's lovely to live on a raft .
we had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened .
<name> he allowed they was made , but i allowed they happened ; i judged it would have took too long to make so many .
<name> said the moon could a laid them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so i did n't say nothing against it , because i 've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done .
we used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down .
<name> allowed they 'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest .
once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark , and now and then she would <unk> a whole world of sparks up out of her <unk> , and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ; and by and by her waves would get to us , a long time after she was gone , and <unk> the raft a bit , and after that you would n't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long , except maybe frogs or something .
after midnight the people on shore went to bed , and then for two or three hours the shores was black  no more sparks in the cabin windows .
these sparks was our clock  the first one that showed again meant morning was coming , so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away .
one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore  it was only two hundred yards  and paddled about a mile up a <unk> amongst the cypress woods , to see if i could n't get some berries .
just as i was passing a place where a kind of a <unk> crossed the <unk> , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it .
i thought i was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was me  or maybe <name> .
i was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and <name> out and begged me to save their lives  said they had n't been doing nothing , and was being chased for it  said there was men and dogs a-coming .
they wanted to jump right in , but i says : " do n't you do it .
i do n't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you 've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the <unk> a little ways ; then you take to the water and <name> down to me and get in  that 'll throw the dogs off the scent . "
they done it , and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting .
we heard them come along towards the <unk> , but could n't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe .
one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers .
he had an old <unk> slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue <unk> <unk> stuffed into his <unk> , and <unk> <unk>  no , he only had one .
he had an old long-tailed blue <unk> coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , <unk> <unk> .
the other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery .
after breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another .
" what got you into trouble ? "
says the <unk> to t'other chap .
" well , i 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth  and it does take it off , too , and <unk> the enamel along with it  but i stayed about one night longer than i ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off .
so i told you i was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out with you .
that 's the whole yarn  what 's yourn ?
" well , i 'd <name> <unk> ' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for i was makin ' it mighty warm for the <unk> , i tell you , and takin ' as much as five or six dollars a night  ten cents a head , children and niggers free  and business <unk> ' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that i had a way of puttin ' in my time with a private jug on the sly .
a nigger <unk> me out this mornin ' , and told me the people was <unk> ' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they 'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour 's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they 'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure .
i did n't wait for no breakfast  i warn't hungry . "
" old man , " said the young one , " i reckon we might <unk> it together ; what do you think ? "
" i ai n't <unk> .
what 's your line  mainly ? "
" <unk> printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; <unk>  tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and <unk> when there 's a chance ; teach <unk> school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes  oh , i do lots of things  most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work .
what 's your lay ? "
" i 've done <unk> in the doctoring way in my time .
layin ' on o' hands is my best holt  for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and i <unk> tell a fortune pretty good when i 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me .
<unk> 's my line , too , and workin ' <unk> 's , and <unk> ' around . "
nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : " alas ! "
" what 're you <unk> ' about ? "
says the <unk> .
" to think i should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . "
and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
" dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? "
says the <unk> , pretty pert and <unk> .
" yes , it is good enough for me ; it 's as good as i deserve ; for who fetched me so low when i was so high ?
i did myself .
i do n't blame you , gentlemen  far from it ; i do n't blame anybody .
i deserve it all .
let the cold world do its worst ; one thing i know  there 's a grave somewhere for me .
the world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me  loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that .
some day i 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart <name> be at rest . "
he went on <unk> .
" <unk> your pore broken heart , " says the <unk> ; " what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us <unk> ?
we <name> n't done nothing . "
" no , i know you have n't .
i ai n't blaming you , gentlemen .
i brought myself down  yes , i did it myself .
it 's right i should suffer  perfectly right  i do n't make any moan . "
" brought you down from whar ?
whar was you brought down from ? "
" ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes  let it pass  't is no matter .
the secret of my birth  " " the secret of your birth !
do you mean to say  " " gentlemen , " says the young man , very solemn , " i <name> reveal it to you , for i feel i may have confidence in you .
by rights i am a duke ! "
<name> 's eyes <unk> out when he heard that ; and i reckon mine did , too .
then the <unk> says : " no !
you ca n't mean it ? "
" yes .
my great-grandfather , eldest son of the duke of <unk> , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time .
the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates  the infant real duke was ignored .
i am the lineal descendant of that infant  i am the rightful duke of <unk> ; and here am i , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of <unk> on a raft ! "
<name> pitied him ever so much , and so did i .
we tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how .
he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say " your <name> , " or " my lord , " or " your lordship "  and he would n't mind it if we called him plain " <unk> , " which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
well , that was all easy , so we done it .
all through dinner <name> stood around and waited on him , and says , " <name> yo ' <name> have some o ' dis or some o ' dat ? "
and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him .
but the old man got pretty silent by and by  did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke .
he seemed to have something on his mind .
so , along in the afternoon , he says : " looky here , bilgewater , " he says , " i 'm nation sorry for you , but you ai n't the only person that 's had troubles like that . "
" no ? "
" no you ai n't .
you ai n't the only person that 's <name> <unk> down <unk> out'n a high place . "
" alas ! "
" no , you ai n't the only person that 's had a secret of his birth . "
and , by <unk> , he begins to cry .
" hold !
what do you mean ? "
" bilgewater , kin i trust you ? "
says the old man , still sort of sobbing .
" to the bitter death ! "
he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , " that secret of your being : speak ! "
" bilgewater , i am the late dauphin ! "
you bet you , <name> and me stared this time .
then the duke says : " you are what ? "
" yes , my friend , it is too true  your eyes is lookin ' at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin , <unk> the seventeen , son of <unk> the sixteen and marry <name> . "
" you !
at your age !
no !
you mean you 're the late charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . "
" trouble has done it , bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature <unk> .
yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue <unk> and misery , the <unk> ' , exiled , <unk> , and <unk> ' rightful king of <name> . "
well , he cried and took on so that me and <name> did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry  and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too .
so we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort him .
but he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him " your majesty , " and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them .
so <name> and me set to <unk> him , and doing this and that and t'other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down .
this done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable .
but the duke kind of <unk> on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke 's great-grandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed <unk> a good while , till by and by the king says : " like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this <unk> raft , bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour ?
it 'll only make things <unk> .
it ai n't my fault i war n't born a duke , it ain't your fault you war n't born a king  so what 's the use to worry ?
make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says i  that 's my motto .
this ain't no bad thing that we 've struck here  plenty grub and an easy life  come , give us your hand , duke , and <name> 's all be friends . "
the duke done it , and <name> and me was pretty glad to see it .
it took away all the <unk> and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any <unk> on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others .
it did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down <unk> and frauds .
but i never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble .
if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , i had n't no objections , 'long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell <name> , so i did n't tell him .
if i never learnt nothing else out of pap , i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
chapter xx .
they asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running  was <name> a runaway nigger ?
says i : " goodness sakes !
would a runaway nigger run south ? "
no , they allowed he would n't .
i had to account for things some way , so i says : " my folks was living in pike county , in missouri , where i was born , and they all died off but me and <name> and my brother <name> .
<name> , he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with uncle <name> , who 's got a little one-horse place on the river , forty-four mile below orleans .
<name> was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he 'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , <name> .
that war n't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way .
well , when the river rose <name> had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we 'd go down to orleans on it .
<name> 's luck did n't hold out ; a steamboat run over the <unk> corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; <name> and me come up all right , but <name> was drunk , and <name> was only four years old , so they never come up no more .
well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in <unk> and trying to take <name> away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger .
we do n't run <unk> no more now ; nights they do n't bother us . "
the duke says : " leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to .
i 'll think the thing over  i 'll invent a plan that 'll fix it .
we 'll let it alone for to-day , because of course we do n't want to go by that town yonder in daylight  it might n't be healthy . "
towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ; the heat lightning was <unk> around low down in the sky , and the leaves was beginning to shiver  it was going to be pretty ugly , it was easy to see that .
so the duke and the king went to <unk> our wigwam , to see what the beds was like .
my bed was a straw tick better than <name> 's , which was a <unk> tick ; there 's always <unk> around about in a <unk> tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up .
well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he would n't .
he says : " i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a <unk> to you that a <unk> bed war n't just <unk> for me to sleep on .
your <name> 'll take the <unk> bed yourself . "
<name> and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : " 't is my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression .
misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; i yield , i submit ; 't is my fate .
i am alone in the world  let me suffer ; can bear it . "
we got away as soon as it was good and dark .
the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town .
we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by  that was the town , you know  and slid by , about a half a mile out , all right .
when we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night .
it was my watch below till twelve , but i would n't a turned in anyway if i 'd had a bed , because a body do n't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight .
my souls , how the wind did scream along !
and every second or two there 'd come a glare that lit up the <unk> for a half a mile around , and you 'd see the islands looking <name> through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a <unk> !  <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk>  and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quit  and then rip comes another flash and another <unk> .
the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but i had n't any clothes on , and did n't mind .
we did n't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and <unk> around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them .
i had the middle watch , you know , but i was pretty sleepy by that time , so <name> he said he would stand the first half of it for me ; he was always mighty good that way , <name> was .
i crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there war n't no show for me ; so i laid outside  i did n't mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves war n't running so high now .
about two they come up again , though , and <name> was going to call me ; but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they war n't high enough yet to do any harm ; but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular <unk> and washed me overboard .
it most killed <name> <unk> .
he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway .
i took the watch , and <name> he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first <unk> that showed i <unk> him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day .
the king got out an old <unk> deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played <unk> a while , five cents a game .
then they got tired of it , and allowed they would " lay out a campaign , " as they called it .
the duke went down into his <unk> , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud .
one <name> said , " the celebrated dr. <name> de <unk> , of <name> , " would " lecture on the science of <unk> " at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and " furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece . "
the duke said that was him .
in another <name> he was the " <unk> <unk> <unk> , garrick the younger , of <unk> <name> , london . "
in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things , like finding water and gold with a " <unk> , " " <unk> witch spells , " and so on .
by and by he says : " but the <unk> muse is the darling .
have you ever trod the boards , royalty ? "
" no , " says the king .
" you shall , then , before you 're three days older , fallen grandeur , " says the duke .
" the first good town we come to we 'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in <name> iii .
and the balcony scene in <name> and <name> .
how does that strike you ? "
" i 'm in , up to the <unk> , for anything that <name> pay , bilgewater ; but , you see , i do n't know nothing about <unk> ' , and <name> n't ever seen much of it .
i was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace .
do you reckon you can learn me ? "
" easy ! "
" all right .
i 'm jist <unk> ' for something fresh , anyway .
<unk> commence right away . "
so the duke he told him all about who <name> was and who <name> was , and said he was used to being <name> , so the king could be <name> .
" but if <name> 's such a young gal , duke , my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin ' to look <unk> odd on her , maybe . "
" no , do n't you worry ; these country <unk> wo n't ever think of that .
besides , you know , you 'll be in costume , and that makes all the difference in the world ; <name> 's in a balcony , enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed , and she 's got on her <unk> and her ruffled <unk> .
here are the costumes for the parts . "
he got out two or three <unk> suits , which he said was <unk> armor for <name> iii .
and t'other chap , and a long white cotton <unk> and a ruffled <unk> to match .
the king was satisfied ; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid <unk> way , prancing around and acting at the same time , to show how it had got to be done ; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart .
there was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being <unk> for <name> ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing .
the king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could n't strike something .
we was out of coffee , so <name> said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
when we got there there war n't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like <name> .
we found a sick nigger <unk> himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that war n't too young or too sick or too old was gone to <unk> , about two mile back in the woods .
the king got the directions , and allowed he 'd go and work that <unk> for all it was worth , and i might go , too .
the duke said what he was after was a printing-office .
we found it ; a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shop  carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked .
it was a dirty , <unk> place , and had ink marks , and <unk> with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls .
the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now .
so me and the king lit out for the <unk> .
we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day .
there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around .
the woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the <unk> and <unk> to keep off the flies .
there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and <unk> truck .
the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people .
the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs .
they did n't have no backs .
the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds .
the women had on <unk> ; and some had <unk> frocks , some <unk> ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico .
some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a <unk> shirt .
some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly .
the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn .
he lined out two lines , everybody <name> it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing  and so on .
the people woke up more and more , and <name> louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout .
then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in <name> , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then <unk> down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , " it 's the brazen serpent in the wilderness !
look upon it and live ! "
and people would shout out , " <name> !  <unk> ! "
and so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : " oh , come to the mourners ' bench !
come , black with sin !
( amen ! )
come , sick and sore !
( amen ! )
come , lame and halt and blind !
( amen ! )
come , pore and <unk> , sunk in shame !
( <unk> ! )
come , all that 's worn and soiled and suffering !  come with a broken spirit !
come with a <unk> heart !
come in your rags and sin and dirt !
the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands open  oh , enter in and be at rest ! "
( <unk> !
<name> , <name> <unk> ! )
and so on .
you could n't make out what the preacher said any more , on account of the shouting and crying .
folks got up everywheres in the crowd , and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners ' bench , with the tears running down their faces ; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd , they <name> and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw , just crazy and wild .
well , the first i knowed the king got a-going , and you could hear him over everybody ; and next he went <unk> up on to the platform , and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people , and he done it .
he told them he was a pirate  been a pirate for thirty years out in the indian ocean  and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight , and he was home now to take out some fresh men , and thanks to goodness he 'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent , and he was glad of it ; it was the <unk> thing that ever happened to him , because he was a changed man now , and happy for the first time in his life ; and , poor as he was , he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean , and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ; for he could do it better than anybody else , being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money , he would get there anyway , and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him , " do n't you thank me , do n't you give me no credit ; it all belongs to them dear people in <unk> <unk> , natural brothers and benefactors of the race , and that dear preacher there , the truest friend a pirate ever had ! "
and then he busted into tears , and so did everybody .
then somebody sings out , " take up a collection for him , take up a collection ! "
well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , " let him pass the hat around ! "
then everybody said it , the preacher too .
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat <unk> his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times  and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the <unk> he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected <unk> dollars and seventy-five cents .
and then he had fetched away a <unk> jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods .
the king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he 'd ever put in in the <unk> line .
he said it war n't no use talking , <unk> do n't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a <unk> with .
the duke was thinking he 'd been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he did n't think so so much .
he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office  horse bills  and took the money , four dollars .
and he had got in ten dollars ' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance  so they done it .
the price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three <unk> for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in <unk> and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash .
he set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own head  three verses  kind of sweet and <unk>  the name of it was , " yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heart "  and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and did n't charge nothing for it .
well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he 'd done a pretty square day 's work for it .
then he showed us another little job he 'd printed and had n't charged for , because it was for us .
it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder , and " $ 200 reward " under it .
the reading was all about <name> , and just described him to a <name> .
it said he run away from st. <name> ' plantation , forty mile below new orleans , last <name> , and likely went north , and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses .
" now , " says the duke , " after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to .
whenever we see anybody coming we can tie <name> hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this <unk> and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward .
handcuffs and chains would look still better on <name> , but it would n't go well with the story of us being so poor .
too much like jewelry .
ropes are the correct thing  we must preserve the <unk> , as we say on the boards . "
we all said the duke was pretty smart , and there could n't be no trouble about running <unk> .
we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke 's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to .
we laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and did n't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it .
when <name> called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : " huck , does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo ' kings on dis trip ? "
" no , " i says , " i reckon not . "
" well , " says he , " dat 's all right , den .
i doan ' mine one er two kings , but dat 's enough .
dis one 's powerful drunk , en de duke ain ' much better . "
i found <name> had been trying to get him to talk french , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he 'd forgot it .
chapter xxi .
it was after <unk> now , but we went right on and did n't tie up .
the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty <name> ; but after they 'd jumped overboard and took a swim it <unk> them up a good deal .
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his <unk> , and let his legs <unk> in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his <name> and <name> by heart .
when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together .
the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; " only , " he says , " you must n't bellow out <name> !
that way , like a bull  you must say it soft and sick and <unk> , so  <unk> !
that is the idea ; for <name> 's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she does n't bray like a jackass . "
well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak <unk> , and begun to practice the sword fight  the duke called himself <name> iii .
; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see .
but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they 'd had in other times along the river .
after dinner the duke says : " well , <unk> , we 'll want to make this a first-class show , you know , so i guess we 'll add a little more to it .
we want a little something to answer <unk> with , anyway . "
" what 's <unk> , bilgewater ? "
the duke told him , and then says : " i 'll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailor 's <unk> ; and you  well , let me see  oh , i 've got it  you can do hamlet 's soliloquy . "
" hamlet 's which ? "
" hamlet 's soliloquy , you know ; the most celebrated thing in shakespeare .
ah , it 's sublime , sublime !
always fetches the house .
i have n't got it in the book  i 've only got one volume  but i reckon i can piece it out from memory .
i 'll just walk up and down a minute , and see if i can call it back from recollection 's vaults . "
so he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then ; then he would hoist up his eyebrows ; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ; next he would sigh , and next he 'd let on to drop a tear .
it was beautiful to see him .
by and by he got it .
he told us to give attention .
then he strikes a most <name> attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky ; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ; and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before .
this is the speech  i learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : to be , or not to be ; that is the bare <unk> that makes calamity of so long life ; for who would <unk> bear , till <unk> wood do come to <unk> , but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep , great nature 's second course , and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of .
there 's the respect must give us pause : wake <name> with thy knocking !
i would thou couldst ; for who would bear the whips and <unk> of time , the oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's <unk> , the law 's delay , and the <unk> which his pangs might take , in the dead waste and middle of the night , when <unk> yawn in customary suits of solemn black , but that the undiscovered country from whose <unk> no traveler returns , breathes forth <unk> on the world , and thus the native <name> of resolution , like the poor cat i ' the <unk> , is <unk> o'er with care , and all the clouds that lowered o'er our <unk> , with this regard their currents turn awry , and lose the name of action .
't is a consummation devoutly to be wished .
but soft you , the fair <name> : <unk> not thy ponderous and marble jaws , but get thee to a nunnery  go !
well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first-rate .
it seemed like he was just born for it ; and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and <unk> up behind when he was getting it off .
the first chance we got the duke he had some <unk> printed ; and after that , for two or three days as we floated along , the raft was a most uncommon lively place , for there war n't nothing but sword fighting and rehearsing  as the duke called it  going on all the time .
one morning , when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw , we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a <unk> which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but <name> took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show .
we struck it mighty lucky ; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon , and the country people was already beginning to come in , in all kinds of old <unk> wagons , and on horses .
the circus would leave before night , so our show would have a pretty good chance .
the duke he hired the <unk> , and we went around and stuck up our bills .
they read like this : <unk> revival !

admission 25 cents ; children and servants , 10 cents .
then we went loafing around town .
the stores and houses was most all old , <unk> , dried up frame concerns that had n't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was <unk> .
the houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but <unk> , and <unk> , and ash piles , and old <unk> boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and <unk> <unk> .
the fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every which way , and had gates that did n't <unk> have but one hinge  a leather one .
some of the fences had been <unk> some time or another , but the duke said it was in <unk> time , like enough .
there was <unk> hogs in the garden , and people driving them out .
all the stores was along one street .
they had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the <unk> .
there was empty <unk> boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , <unk> them with their barlow knives ; and <unk> tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretching  a mighty ornery lot .
they <unk> had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but did n't wear no coats nor <unk> , they called one another <name> , and <name> , and <name> , and <name> , and <name> , and talked lazy and <unk> , and used considerable many cuss words .
there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every <unk> , and he most always had his hands in his <unk> , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch .
what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : " gim me a chaw <unk> <unk> , <name> . "
" <unk> n't ; i <name> n't got but one chaw left .
ask <name> . "
maybe <name> he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ai n't got none .
some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own .
they get all their <unk> by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , " i wisht you 'd <name> ' me a chaw , <name> , i jist this minute give <name> thompson the last chaw i had "  which is a lie pretty much <unk> ; it do n't fool nobody but a stranger ; but <name> ai n't no stranger , so he says : " you give him a chaw , did you ?
so did your sister 's cat 's grandmother .
you pay me back the <unk> you 've <unk> <unk> 'd off'n me , <unk> buckner , then i 'll <name> you one or two ton of it , and wo n't charge you no back intrust , nuther . "
" well , i did pay you back some of it <unk> . "
" yes , you did  'bout six <unk> .
you <unk> 'd store <unk> and paid back <unk> . "
store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly <unk> the natural leaf twisted .
when they borrow a chaw they do n't <unk> cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it 's handed back , and says , sarcastic : " here , gim me the chaw , and you take the plug . "
all the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else but mud  mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in all the places .
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres .
you 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come <unk> along the street and <unk> herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she 'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary .
and pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , " hi !
so boy !
sick him , <unk> ! "
and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more a-coming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise .
then they 'd settle back again till there was a dog fight .
there couldn't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog fight  unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death .
on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank , and they was bowed and bent , and about ready to tumble in , the people had moved out of them .
the bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over .
people lived in them yet , but it was <unk> , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time .
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep <name> start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer .
such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river 's always gnawing at it .
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time .
families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons .
there was considerable whisky drinking going on , and i seen three fights .
by and by somebody sings out : " here comes old boggs !  in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys ! "
all the loafers looked glad ; i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs .
one of them says : " wonder who he 's <unk> to chaw up this time .
if he 'd <unk> up all the men he 's <name> <unk> to chaw up in the last twenty year he 'd have considerable <unk> now . "
another one says , " i wisht old boggs 'd threaten me , <unk> then i 'd know i war n't gwyne to die for a <unk> ' year . "
boggs comes <unk> along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an injun , and singing out : " <unk> the track , thar .
i 'm on the <unk> , and the price <unk> coffins is <unk> to raise . "
he was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face .
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and <unk> him , and he <unk> back , and said he 'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he could n't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old colonel sherburn , and his motto was , " meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on . "
he see me , and rode up and says : " whar 'd you come f 'm , boy ?
you prepared to die ? "
then he rode on .
i was scared , but a man says : " he do n't mean nothing ; he 's always <unk> ' on like that when he's drunk .
he 's the best <unk> old fool in arkansaw  never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober . "
boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : " come out here , sherburn !
come out and meet the man you 've swindled .
you 're the <unk> ' i 'm after , and i 'm <unk> to have you , too ! "
and so he went on , calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to , and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on .
by and by a <unk> man about fifty-five  and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town , too  steps out of the store , and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come .
he says to boggs , mighty ca 'm and slow  he says : " i 'm tired of this , but i 'll endure it till one o'clock .
till one o'clock , mind  no longer .
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you ca n't travel so far but i <name> find you . "
then he turns and goes in .
the crowd looked mighty sober ; nobody stirred , and there war n't no more laughing .
boggs rode off <unk> sherburn as loud as he could yell , all down the street ; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store , still keeping it up .
some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up , but he would n't ; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes , and so he must go home  he must go right away .
but it did n't do no good .
he cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went <unk> down the street again , with his gray hair <unk> .
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it war n't no use  up the street he would tear again , and give sherburn another cussing .
by and by somebody says : " go for his daughter !  quick , go for his daughter ; sometimes he 'll listen to her .
if anybody can persuade him , she can . "
so somebody started on a run .
i walked down street a ways and stopped .
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again , but not on his horse .
he was <unk> across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him <unk> of his arms and hurrying him along .
he was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he war n't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
somebody sings out : " boggs ! "
i looked over there to see who said it , and it was that colonel sherburn .
he was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right hand  not aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky .
the same second i see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her .
boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the <unk> come down slow and steady to a level  both barrels cocked .
boggs throws up both of his hands and says , " o lord , don't shoot ! "
bang !
goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the air  bang !
goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out .
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , " oh , he 's killed him , he 's killed him ! "
the crowd closed up around them , and shouldered and jammed one another , with their necks stretched , trying to see , and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting , " back , back !
give him air , give him air ! "
colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off .
they took boggs to a little drug store , the crowd pressing around just the same , and the whole town following , and i rushed and got a good place at the window , where i was close to him and could see in .
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head , and opened another one and spread it on his breast ; but they tore open his shirt first , and i seen where one of the bullets went in .
he made about a dozen long gasps , his breast lifting the bible up when he <unk> in his breath , and letting it down again when he breathed it out  and after that he laid still ; he was dead .
then they pulled his daughter away from him , screaming and crying , and took her off .
she was about sixteen , and very sweet and gentle looking , but awful pale and scared .
well , pretty soon the whole town was there , squirming and <unk> and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look , but people that had the places would n't give them up , and folks behind them was saying all the time , " say , now , you 've looked enough , you fellows ; 'tai n't right and 'tai n't fair for you to stay thar all the time , and never give nobody a chance ; other folks has their rights as well as you . "
there was considerable <unk> back , so i slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble .
the streets was full , and everybody was excited .
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening .
one long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a <unk> cane , marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him <name> the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood , frowning and having his <unk> down over his eyes , and <name> out , " boggs ! "
and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says " bang ! "
staggered backwards , says " bang ! "
again , and fell down flat on his back .
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened .
then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him .
well , by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be <unk> .
in about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every <unk> they come to to do the hanging with .
chapter xxii .
they swarmed up towards sherburn 's house , <unk> and raging like injuns , and everything had to clear the way or get run over and <unk> to mush , and it was awful to see .
children was <unk> it ahead of the mob , screaming and trying to get out of the way ; and every window along the road was full of women 's heads , and there was nigger boys in every tree , and bucks and <unk> looking over every fence ; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and <unk> back out of reach .
lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on , scared most to death .
they swarmed up in front of sherburn 's palings as thick as they could jam together , and you could n't hear yourself think for the noise .
it was a little <unk> yard .
some <name> out " tear down the fence !
tear down the fence ! "
then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing , and down she goes , and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave .
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch , with a <unk> gun in his hand , and takes his stand , perfectly <unk> and deliberate , not saying a word .
the racket stopped , and the wave sucked back .
sherburn never said a word  just stood there , looking down .
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable .
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to <unk> him , but they could n't ; they dropped their eyes and looked <unk> .
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that 's got sand in it .
then he says , slow and scornful : " the idea of you <unk> anybody !
it 's amusing .
the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man !
because you 're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless <unk> women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man ?
why , a man 's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind  as long as it 's daytime and you 're not behind him .
" do i know you ?
i know you clear through was born and raised in the south , and i 've lived in the north ; so i know the average all around .
the average man 's a coward .
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it .
in the south one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot .
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people  whereas you 're just as brave , and no braver .
why do n't your <unk> <name> murderers ?
because they 're afraid the man 's friends <name> shoot them in the back , in the dark  and it 's just what they would do .
" so they always acquit ; and then a man goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and <unk> the rascal .
your mistake is , that you did n't bring a man with you ; that 's one mistake , and the other is that you did n't come in the dark and fetch your masks .
you brought part of a man  <name> harkness , there  and if you had n't had him to start you , you 'd a taken it out in blowing .
" you did n't want to come .
the average man do n't like trouble and danger .
you do n't like trouble and danger .
but if only half a man  like <name> harkness , there  shouts <unk> him !
lynch him ! '
you 're afraid to back down  afraid you 'll be found out to be what you are  cowards  and so you raise a yell , and <name> yourselves on to that <unk> 's <unk> , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you 're going to do .
the <unk> thing out is a mob ; that 's what an army is  a mob ; they do n't fight with courage that 's born in them , but with courage that's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers .
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath <unk> .
now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole .
if any real <unk> 's going to be done it <name> be done in the dark , southern fashion ; and when they come they 'll bring their masks , and fetch a man along .
now leave  and take your <unk> with you "  tossing his gun up across his left arm and <unk> it when he says this .
the crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and <name> harkness he <unk> it after them , looking tolerable cheap .
i could a stayed if i wanted to , but i did n't want to .
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent .
i had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money , but i reckoned i better save it , because there ai n't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way .
you ca n't be too careful .
i ain't opposed to spending money on <unk> when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in wasting it on them .
it was a real bully circus .
it was the <unk> sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and <name> , side by side , the men just in their drawers and <unk> , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable  there must a been twenty of them  and every <name> with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real <unk> queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds .
it was a powerful fine sight ; i never see anything so lovely .
and then one by one they got up and stood , and went <unk> around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the <unk> , and every lady's <unk> dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol .
and then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the <unk> , cracking his whip and shouting " hi !  hi ! "
and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every <name> put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did <name> over and hump themselves !
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow i ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild .
well , all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people .
the ringmaster could n't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever could think of so many of them , and so sudden and so <name> , was what i could n't <unk> understand .
why , i could n't a thought of them in a year .
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring  said he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was .
they argued and tried to keep him out , but he would n't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill .
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him , and that made him mad , and he begun to rip and tear ; so that stirred up the people , and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring , saying , " knock him down !
throw him out ! "
and one or two women begun to scream .
so , then , the ringmaster he made a little speech , and said he hoped there would n't be no disturbance , and if the man would promise he would n't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse .
so everybody laughed and said all right , and the man got on .
the minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and <unk> around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down .
and at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t'other one on t'other side , and the people just crazy .
it war n't funny to me , though ; i was all of a tremble to see his danger .
but pretty soon he struggled up <unk> and grabbed the bridle , <unk> this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood !
and the horse a-going like a house afire too .
he just stood up there , <unk> around as easy and comfortable as if he war n't ever drunk in his life  and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them .
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits .
and , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the <unk> and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum  and finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room , and everybody just <unk> with pleasure and astonishment .
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he was the <unk> ringmaster you ever see , i reckon .
why , it was one of his own men !
he had got up that joke all out of his own head , and never let on to nobody .
well , i felt sheepish enough to be took in so , but i would n't a been in that ringmaster 's place , not for a thousand dollars .
i do n't know ; there may be <unk> <unk> than what that one was , but i never struck them yet .
anyways , it was plenty good enough for me ; and wherever i run across it , it can have all of my custom every time .
well , that night we had our show ; but there war n't only about twelve people there  just enough to pay expenses .
and they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep .
so the duke said these arkansaw <unk> could n't come up to shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedy  and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned .
he said he could size their style .
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and <unk> off some <unk> , and stuck them up all over the village .
the bills said : at the court house !
for 3 nights only !
the <unk> <unk> <name> garrick the younger !
and <name> <unk> the elder !
of the london and continental theatres , in their thrilling tragedy of the king 's <unk> , or the <name> <unk> !
!
!
admission 50 cents .
then at the bottom was the biggest line of all , which said : ladies and children not admitted .
" there , " says he , " if that line do n't fetch them , i do n't know arkansaw ! "
chapter xxiii .
well , all day him and the king was hard at it , rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for <unk> ; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time .
when the place could n't hold no more , the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech , and praised up this tragedy , and said it was the most <unk> one that ever was ; and so he went on <unk> about the tragedy , and about <name> <unk> the elder , which was to play the main principal part in it ; and at last when he 'd got everybody 's expectations up high enough , he rolled up the curtain , and the next minute the king come <unk> out on all fours , naked ; and he was painted all over , <unk> striped , all sorts of colors , as splendid as a rainbow .
and  but never mind the rest of his outfit ; it was just wild , but it was awful funny .
the people most killed themselves laughing ; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes , they roared and clapped and stormed and <unk> till he come back and done it over again , and after that they made him do it another time .
well , it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut .
then the duke he lets the curtain down , and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy <name> be performed only two nights more , on accounts of pressing london engagements , where the seats is all sold already for it in <unk> <name> ; and then he makes them another bow , and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them , he <name> be deeply <unk> if they <name> mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it .
twenty people sings out : " what , is it over ?
is that all ? "
the duke says yes .
then there was a fine time .
everybody sings out , " sold ! "
and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them <unk> .
but a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : " hold on !
just a word , gentlemen . "
they stopped to listen .
" we are sold  mighty badly sold .
but we do n't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , i reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live .
no .
what we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the rest of the town !
then we 'll all be in the same boat .
ai n't that sensible ? "
( " you bet it is !  the jedge is right ! "
everybody sings out . )
" all right , then  not a word about any sell .
go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy . "
next day you could n't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was .
house was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way .
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made <name> and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town .
the third night the house was crammed again  and they war n't <unk> this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights .
i stood by the duke at the door , and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat  and i see it war n't no <unk> , neither , not by a long sight .
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around , and i bet i do , there was sixty-four of them went in .
i shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; i could n't stand it .
well , when the place could n't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , i after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : " walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then <name> for the raft like the dickens was after you ! "
i done it , and he done the same .
we struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word .
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : " well , how 'd the old thing pan out this time , duke ? "
he had n't been <unk> at all .
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village .
then we lit up and had a supper , and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they 'd served them people .
the duke says : " <unk> , <unk> !
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ; and i knew they 'd lay for us the third night , and consider it was their turn now .
well , it is their turn , and i 'd give something to know how much they 'd take for it .
i would just like to know how they 're putting in their opportunity .
they can turn it into a picnic if they want to  they brought plenty provisions . "
them <unk> took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights .
i never see money hauled in by the <unk> like that before .
by and by , when they was asleep and snoring , <name> says : " do n't it <unk> you de way dem kings carries on , huck ? "
" no , " i says , " it do n't . "
" why do n't it , huck ? "
" well , it do n't , because it 's in the breed .
i reckon they 're all alike , " " but , huck , dese kings o ' <unk> is <unk> <unk> ; dat 's jist what dey is ; dey 's <unk> <unk> . "
" well , that 's what i 'm <unk> ; all kings is mostly <unk> , as fur as i can make out . "
" is dat so ? "
" you read about them once  you 'll see .
look at <name> the eight ; this 'n 's a sunday-school superintendent to him .
and look at <name> second , and <name> fourteen , and <name> fifteen , and <name> second , and <name> second , and <name> third , and forty more ; besides all them saxon <unk> that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain .
my , you ought to seen old <name> the eight when he was in bloom .
he was a <name> .
he used to marry a new wife every day , and chop off her head next morning .
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs .
<unk> up <name> <unk> , ' he says .
they fetch her up .
next morning , <unk> off her head ! '
and they chop it off .
<unk> up <name> shore , ' he says ; and up she comes , next morning , <unk> off her head '  and they chop it off .
<unk> up fair <unk> . '
fair <unk> answers the <name> .
next morning , <unk> off her head . '
and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night ; and he kept that up till he had <unk> a thousand and one tales that way , and then he put them all in a book , and called it domesday book  which was a good name and stated the case .
you do n't know kings , <name> , but i know them ; and this old rip of <unk> is one of the cleanest i 've struck in history .
well , <name> he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country .
how does he go at it  give notice ?  give the country a show ?
no .
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard , and <unk> out a declaration of independence , and dares them to come on .
that was his style  he never give anybody a chance .
he had suspicions of his father , the duke of wellington .
well , what did he do ?
ask him to show up ?
no  drownded him in a butt of <unk> , like a cat .
s'pose people left money laying around where he was  what did he do ?
he collared it .
s'pose he contracted to do a thing , and you paid him , and did n't set down there and see that he done it  what did he do ?
he always done the other thing .
s'pose he opened his mouth  what then ?
if he did n't shut it up powerful quick he 'd lose a lie every time .
that 's the kind of a bug <name> was ; and if we 'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he 'd a fooled that town a heap worse than <unk> done .
i do n't say that <unk> is lambs , because they ai n't , when you come right down to the cold facts ; but they ai n't nothing to that old ram , anyway .
all i say is , kings is kings , and you got to make allowances .
take them all around , they 're a mighty ornery lot .
it 's the way they 're raised . "
" but dis one do smell so like de nation , huck . "
" well , they all do , <name> .
we ca n't help the way a king smells ; history do n't tell no way . "
" now de duke , he 's a <unk> likely man in some ways . "
" yes , a duke 's different .
but not very different .
this one 's a middling hard lot for a duke .
when he 's drunk there ai n't no <unk> man could tell him from a king . "
" well , anyways , i doan ' <unk> for no mo ' <name> um , huck .
dese is all i kin <name> ' . "
" it 's the way i feel , too , <name> .
but we 've got them on our hands , and we got to remember what they are , and make allowances .
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that 's out of kings . "
what was the use to tell <name> these war n't real kings and dukes ?
it would n't a done no good ; and , besides , it was just as i said : you could n't tell them from the real kind .
i went to sleep , and <name> did n't call me when it was my turn .
he often done that .
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees , moaning and mourning to himself .
i did n't take notice nor let on .
i knowed what it was about .
he was thinking about his wife and his children , away up yonder , and he was low and homesick ; because he had n't ever been away from home before in his life ; and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for <unk> .
it do n't seem natural , but i reckon it 's so .
he was often moaning and mourning that way nights , when he judged i was asleep , and saying , " po ' little <unk> !
po ' little <name> !
it 's mighty hard ; i <unk> ' i ai n't ever gwyne to see you no mo ' , no mo ' ! "
he was a mighty good nigger , <name> was .
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones ; and by and by he says : " what makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz <unk> i hear <unk> over yonder on de bank like a whack , er a slam , while ago , en it mine me er de time i treat my little <unk> so ornery .
she war n't on'y 'bout fo ' year ole , en she tuck de <unk> fever , en had a <unk> rough spell ; but she got well , en one day she was <unk> ' aroun ' , en i says to her , i says : " <unk> de do ' . '
" she never done it ; jis ' stood dah , <unk> <unk> ' up at me .
it make me mad ; en i says agin , mighty loud , i says : " <unk> ' you hear me ?

" she jis stood de same way , <unk> <unk> ' up .

i says : " 'i lay i make you mine ! '
" en wid dat i fetch ' her a slap side de head dat sont her <unk> ' .

oh , she was plumb deef en dumb , huck , plumb deef en dumb  en i 'd <name> <unk> her so ! "
chapter xxiv .
next day , towards night , we laid up under a little <name> towhead out in the middle , where there was a village on each side of the river , and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns .
<name> he spoke to the duke , and said he hoped it would n't take but a few hours , because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope .
you see , when we left him all alone we had to tie him , because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it would n't look much like he was a runaway nigger , you know .
so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day , and he 'd cipher out some way to get around it .
he was uncommon bright , the duke was , and he soon struck it .
he dressed <name> up in king lear 's outfit  it was a long <unk> gown , and a white <unk> wig and whiskers ; and then he took his theater paint and painted <name> 's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead , dull , solid blue , like a man that 's been drownded nine days .
blamed if he war n't the <unk> looking outrage i ever see .
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so : sick arab  but harmless when not out of his head .
and he nailed that shingle to a lath , and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam .
<name> was satisfied .
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day , and trembling all over every time there was a sound .
the duke told him to make himself free and easy , and if anybody ever come meddling around , he must hop out of the wigwam , and <name> on a little , and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast , and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone .
which was sound enough judgment ; but you take the average man , and he wouldn't wait for him to howl .
why , he did n't only look like he was dead , he looked considerable more than that .
these <unk> wanted to try the <unk> again , because there was so much money in it , but they judged it would n't be safe , because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time .
they could n't hit no project that suited exactly ; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he could n't put up something on the arkansaw village ; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan , but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable way  meaning the devil , i reckon .
we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last ; and now the king put his'n on , and he told me to put mine on .
i done it , of course .
the king's duds was all black , and he did look real swell and <unk> .
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before .
why , before , he looked like the <unk> old rip that ever was ; but now , when he 'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile , he looked that grand and good and pious that you 'd say he had walked right out of the ark , and maybe was old <unk> himself .
<name> cleaned up the canoe , and i got my paddle ready .
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point , about three mile above the town  been there a couple of hours , taking on freight .
says the king : " seein ' how i 'm dressed , i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st. <name> or cincinnati , or some other big place .
go for the steamboat , huckleberry ; we 'll come down to the village on her . "
i did n't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride .
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village , and then went <unk> along the bluff bank in the easy water .
pretty soon we come to a nice <unk> young country <name> setting on a log <unk> the sweat off of his face , for it was powerful warm weather ; and he had a couple of big <unk> by him .
" run her nose in shore , " says the king .
i done it .
" <unk> ' you bound for , young man ? "
" for the steamboat ; going to orleans . "
" git aboard , " says the king .
" hold on a minute , my servant 'll <unk> you with them bags .
jump out and <unk> the gentleman , <unk> "  meaning me , i see .
i done so , and then we all three started on again .
the young chap was mighty thankful ; said it was tough work <unk> his baggage such weather .
he asked the king where he was going , and the king told him he 'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning , and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there .
the young fellow says : " when i first see you i says to myself , 'it 's mr. wilks , sure , and he come mighty near getting here in time . '
but then i says again , 'no , i reckon it ai n't him , or else he would n't be paddling up the river . '
you ai n't him , are you ? "
" no , my name 's blodgett  <unk> blodgett  reverend <unk> blodgett , i s'pose i must say , as i 'm one o ' the lord 's poor servants .
but still i 'm jist as able to be sorry for mr. wilks for not arriving in time , all the same , if he 's missed anything by it  which i <name> he has n't . "
" well , he do n't miss any property by it , because he 'll get that all right ; but he 's missed seeing his brother <name> die  which he <unk> mind , nobody can tell as to that  but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died ; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ; had n't seen him since they was boys together  and had n't ever seen his brother <name> at all  that 's the deef and dumb one  <name> ai n't more than thirty or thirty-five .
<name> and <name> were the only ones that come out here ; <name> was the married brother ; him and his wife both died last year .
<name> and <name> 's the only ones that 's left now ; and , as i was saying , they have n't got here in time . "
" did anybody send 'em word ? "
" oh , yes ; a month or two ago , when <name> was first took ; because <name> said then that he <unk> felt like he war n't going to get well this time .
you see , he was pretty old , and <name> 's <unk> was too young to be much company for him , except <name> <name> , the red-headed one ; and so he was kinder lonesome after <name> and his wife died , and did n't seem to care much to live .
he most desperately wanted to see <name>  and <name> , too , for that matter  because he was one of them kind that ca n't bear to make a <name> .
he left a letter behind for <name> , and said he 'd told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so <name> 's <unk> would be all right  for <name> didn't leave nothing .
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to . "
" why do you reckon <name> do n't come ?
<unk> ' does he live ? "
" oh , he lives in england  <unk>  <unk> there  has n't ever been in this country .
he has n't had any too much time  and besides he might n't a got the letter at all , you know . "
" too bad , too bad he could n't a lived to see his brothers , poor soul .
you going to orleans , you say ? "
" yes , but that ai n't only a part of it .
i 'm going in a ship , next wednesday , for <unk> <unk> , where my uncle lives . "
" it 's a pretty long journey .
but it 'll be lovely ; wisht i was a-going .
is <name> <name> the oldest ?
how old is the others ? "
" <name> <name> 's nineteen , <name> 's fifteen , and <name> 's about fourteen  that 's the one that gives herself to good works and has a <unk> . "
" poor things !
to be left alone in the cold world so . "
" well , they could be worse off .
old <name> had friends , and they ain't going to let them come to no harm .
there 's hobson , the <unk> ' preacher ; and deacon lot <unk> , and <name> <unk> , and abner <unk> , and <name> <name> , the lawyer ; and dr. robinson , and their wives , and the widow <unk> , and  well , there 's a lot of them ; but these are the ones that <name> was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home ; so <name> 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here . "
well , the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow .
blamed if he did n't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town , and all about the <unk> ; and about <name> 's business  which was a <name> ; and about <name> 's  which was a carpenter ; and about <name> 's  which was a <unk> minister ; and so on , and so on .
then he says : " what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for ? "
" because she 's a big orleans boat , and i was afeard she might n't stop there .
when they 're deep they wo n't stop for a hail .
a cincinnati boat <name> , but this is a st. <name> one . "
" was <name> wilks well off ? "
" oh , yes , pretty well off .
he had houses and land , and it 's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up <unk> . "
" when did you say he died ? "
" i did n't say , but it was last night . "
" funeral to-morrow , likely ? "
" yes , 'bout the middle of the day . "
" well , it 's all terrible sad ; but we 've all got to go , one time or another .
so what we want to do is to be prepared ; then we 're all right . "
" yes , sir , it 's the best way .
<name> used to always say that . "
when we struck the boat she was about done loading , and pretty soon she got off .
the king never said nothing about going aboard , so i lost my ride , after all .
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place , and then he got ashore and says : " now hustle back , right off , and fetch the duke up here , and the new <unk> .
and if he 's gone over to t'other side , go over there and git him .
and tell him to git himself up regardless .
shove along , now . "
i see what he was up to ; but i never said nothing , of course .
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe , and then they set down on a log , and the king told him everything , just like the young fellow had said it  every last word of it .
and all the time he was <unk> it he tried to talk like an englishman ; and he done it pretty well , too , for a slouch .
i ca n't imitate him , and so i ai n't a-going to try to ; but he really done it pretty good .
then he says : " how are you on the deef and dumb , bilgewater ? "
the duke said , leave him alone for that ; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the <unk> boards .
so then they waited for a steamboat .
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they did n't come from high enough up the river ; but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her .
she sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from cincinnati ; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they would n't land us .
but the king was ca 'm .
he says : " if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to <name> 'em , ca n't it ? "
so they softened down and said it was all right ; and when we got to the village they <unk> us ashore .
about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming , and when the king says : " kin any of you gentlemen tell me <unk> ' mr. <name> wilks lives ? "
they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , " what d ' i tell you ? "
then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : " i 'm sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening . "
sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash , and fell up against the man , and put his <name> on his shoulder , and cried down his back , and says : " alas , alas , our poor brother  gone , and we never got to see him ; oh , it 's too , too hard ! "
then he turns around , <unk> , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands , and blamed if he did n't drop a <unk> and bust out <unk> .
if they war n't the <unk> lot , them two frauds , that ever i struck .
well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them , and carried their <unk> up the hill for them , and let them <name> on them and cry , and told the king all about his brother 's last moments , and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke , and both of them took on about that dead <name> like they 'd lost the twelve disciples .
well , if ever i struck anything like it , i 'm a nigger .
it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race .
chapter xxv .
the news was all over town in two minutes , and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way , some of them putting on their coats as they come .
