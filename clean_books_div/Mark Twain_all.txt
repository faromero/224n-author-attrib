1601 conversation as it was by the social fireside in the time of the <unk> by <name> twain introduction " born irreverent , " scrawled <name> twain on a scratch pad , "  like all other people i have ever known or heard of  i am hoping to remain so while there are any reverent <unk> left to make fun of . "
 [ <unk> manuscript of <name> l. clemens , in the collection of the f. j. meine ] <name> twain was just as irreverent as he dared be , and 1601 reveals his richest expression of sovereign contempt for <unk> language , genteel literature , and conventional <unk> .
later , when a magazine editor <unk> , " o that we had a <unk> ! "
<name> <unk> and <unk>  submitted 1601 ; and that same editor , a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> abused it and the <unk> .
in this episode , as in many others , <name> twain , the " bad boy " of american literature , revealed his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy .
too , there was always the spirit of <name> sawyer <unk> in <name> 's make-up that prompted him , as he himself boasted , to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world .
who wrote 1601 ?
the correct and complete title of 1601 , as first issued , was : [ date , 1601 . ]
<unk> , as it was by the social fireside , in the time of the <unk> . '
for many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880 , its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed .
in boston , <name> t. ball , one of the leading theatrical critics during the late 90 's , asserted that it was originally written by an english actor ( name not <unk> ) who gave it to him .
ball 's original , it was said , looked like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed , and may indeed have been a proof pulled in some newspaper office .
in st. <name> , <name> <name> <unk> , editor of the st. <name> mirror , had seen this famous tour de force circulated in the early 80 's in <unk> form ; he first learned from <name> field that it was from the pen of <name> twain .
" many people , " said <unk> , " thought the thing was done by field and attributed , as a joke , to <name> twain .
field had a perfect genius for that sort of thing , as many extant specimens attest , and for that sort of practical joke ; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too mellow  not hard and bright and bitter  to be <name> field 's . "
<unk> opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great <unk> ; one half suspects that <unk> was thinking of field 's french crisis .
but twain first claimed his <unk> from the fog of <unk> in 1906 , in a letter addressed to mr. <name> <unk> , librarian of case library , <name> .
said clemens , in the course of his letter , dated july 30 , 1906 , from dublin , new hampshire : " the title of the piece is 1601 .
the piece is a <unk> conversation which takes place in <name> <name> 's closet in that year , between the <name> , <name> jonson , beaumont , sir <name> <name> , the duchess of bilgewater , and one or two others , and is not , as <name> hay <unk> supposes , a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste <name> 's time ; if there is a decent word <unk> in it , it is because i overlooked it .
i hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings . "
<unk> the rev .
<name> twichell the circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been officially revealed by <name> <unk> paine in 'mark twain , a <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and in the publication of <name> twain 's notebook ( <unk> ) .
1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the clemens family had retreated to quarry farm in <name> county , new york .
here mrs. clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations , the children romped over the countryside , and <name> retired to his octagonal study , which , perched high on the hill , looked out upon the valley below .
it was in the famous summer of 1876 , too , that <name> was putting the finishing touches to <name> sawyer .
before the close of the same year he had already begun work on 'the adventures of huckleberry finn ' , published in 1885 .
it is interesting to note the use of the title , the " duke of bilgewater , " in huck finn when the " duchess of bilgewater " had already made her appearance in 1601 .
<unk> between his two great <unk> , <name> sawyer and huck finn , the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude .
during this prolific period <name> wrote many minor items , most of them rejected by howells , and read extensively in one of his favorite books , <unk> ' diary .
like many another writer <name> was captivated by <unk> style and spirit , and " he determined , " says <name> <unk> paine in his 'mark twain , a biography ' , " to try his hand on an imaginary record of conversation and court manners of a bygone day , written in the phrase of the period .
the result was <unk> conversation in the time of <name> <name> ' , or as he later called it , <unk> ' .
the <unk> recorded by a supposed <unk> of that period , was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day , when fireside <unk> were limited only to the loosened fancy , vocabulary , and physical performance , and not by any bounds of convention . "
" it was written as a letter , " continues paine , " to that robust divine , rev .
<name> twichell , who , unlike howells , had no scruples about <unk> <unk> breadth of <unk> . ' "
the rev .
<name> twichell , <name> 's most intimate friend for over forty years , was pastor of the asylum hill <unk> church of hartford , which <name> <unk> called the " church of the holy speculators , " because of its wealthy parishioners .
here <name> had first met " <name> " at a social , and their meeting ripened into a glorious , life long friendship .
twichell was a man of about <name> 's own age , a profound scholar , a devout <name> , " yet a man with an <unk> sense of humor , and a profound understanding of the <unk> of mankind . "
the rev .
mr. twichell performed the marriage ceremony for <name> twain and <unk> the births of his children ; " <name> , " his friend , counseled him on literary as well as personal matters for the remainder of <name> 's life .
it is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written , for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which 1601 was written , or the keen enjoyment which <name> and " <name> " derived from it .
" save me one . "
the story of the first issue of 1601 is one of <unk> , state diplomacy , and <unk> printing .
the rev .
" <name> " twichell , for whose <unk> the piece had been written , apparently had pocketed the document for four long years .
then , in 1880 , it came into the hands of <name> hay , later secretary of state , presumably sent to him by <name> twain .
hay pronounced the sketch a masterpiece , and wrote immediately to his old <name> friend , <name> <unk> , <name> of <unk> in <name> and literature .
the following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name of <name> hay known throughout the world .
department of state washington , <name> 21 , 1880 .
dear <unk> : are you in <name> for all this week ?
if you <name> say yes by return mail , i have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only in my hands for a few days .
yours , very much <unk> by the depravity of christendom , hay the second letter <unk> hay 's own high opinion of the effort and his deep concern for its safety .
<name> 24 , 1880 my dear <unk> : here it is .
it was written by <name> twain in a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste elizabethan standard .
but the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic .
he has not yet been able even to find a publisher .
the globe has not yet recovered from <unk> 's <unk> , and they wo n't touch it .
i send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics , who know a good thing when they see it .
read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me ; for <name> is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring .
yours , hay .
in his third letter one can almost hear hay 's chuckle in the certainty that his diplomatic , if somewhat wicked , suggestion would bear fruit .
washington , d. <unk> 7 , 1880 my dear <unk> : i have your letter , and the proposition which you make to pull a few proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive , and of course highly immoral .
i can not properly consent to it , and i am afraid the great many would think i was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence .
please send back the document as soon as you can , and if , in spite of my prohibition , you take these proofs , save me one .
very truly yours , <name> hay .
thus was this elizabethan dialogue poured into the moulds of cold type .
according to <name> <name> , <name> twain 's <unk> , it was issued in pamphlet form , without wrappers or covers ; there were 8 pages of text and the pamphlet measured 7 by 8 1/2 inches .
only four copies are believed to have been printed , one for hay , one for <unk> , and two for twain .
" in the matter of humor , " wrote clemens , referring to hay 's delicious notes , " what an <unk> touch <name> hay had ! "
humor at west point the first printing of 1601 in actual book form was " donne at ye <unk> press , " in 1882 , west point , new york , under the supervision of <unk> .
c. e. s. wood , then adjutant of the u. s. military academy .
in 1882 <name> twain and <name> twichell visited their friend <unk> .
wood at west point , where they learned that wood , as adjutant , had under his control a small printing establishment .
on <name> 's return to hartford , wood received a letter asking if he would do <name> a great favor by printing something he had written , which he did not care to <unk> to the ordinary printer .
wood replied that he would be glad to oblige .
on <name> 3 , 1882 , <name> sent the manuscript : " i enclose the original of <unk> [ sic ] as you suggest .
i am afraid there are errors in it , also , <unk> in <unk> spelling  e 's stuck on often at end of words where they are not strictly necessary , etc ... ..
i would go through the manuscript but i am too much driven just now , and it is not important anyway .
i wish you would do me the kindness to make any and all corrections that suggest themselves to you .
" sincerely yours , " s. l .
clemens . "
<name> erskine <name> wood recalled in a <unk> , which he wrote for the limited edition of 1601 issued by the <unk> press , how he felt when he first saw the original manuscript .
" when i read it , " writes wood , " i felt that the character of it would be carried a little better by a printing which pretended to the eye that it was contemporaneous with the pretended <unk> . '
" i wrote <name> that for literary effect i thought there should be a species of forgery , though of course there was no effort to actually deceive a scholar .
<name> answered that i might do as i liked ;  that his only object was to secure a number of copies , as the demand for it was becoming burdensome , but he would be very grateful for any interest i brought to the doing .
" well , tucker [ foreman of the printing shop ] and i soaked some <unk> linen paper in weak coffee , put it as a wet bundle into a warm room to mildew , dried it to a dampness approved by tucker and he printed the <unk> ' on a hand press .
i had special <unk> cut for such elizabethan <unk> as the a , e , o and u , when followed by m or n  and for the ( commonly and stupidly pronounced ye ) .
" the only <unk> i did was as to the spelling and a few old english words introduced .
the spelling , if i remember correctly , is mine , but the text is exactly as written by <name> .
i wrote asking his view of making the spelling of the period and he was enthusiastic  telling me to do whatever i thought best and he was greatly pleased with the result . "
thus was printed in a de <unk> edition of fifty copies the most curious masterpiece of american humor , at one of <name> 's most dignified institutions , the united states military academy at west point .
" 1601 was so <unk> by the <unk> scholars of a quarter of a century ago , " wrote clemens in his letter to <name> <unk> , " that i was rather inordinately vain of it .
at that time it had been privately printed in several countries , among them japan .
a sumptuous edition on large paper , <unk> , was made by <unk> .
c. e. s. wood at west point  an edition of 50 copies  and distributed among popes and kings and such people .
in england copies of that issue were worth twenty guineas when i was there six years ago , and none to be had . "
from the depths <name> twain 's irreverence should not be <unk> : it was an irreverence which bubbled up from a deep , passionate insight into the <unk> of human nature .
in 1601 , as in 'the man that corrupted hadleyburg , ' and in 'the mysterious stranger , ' he tore the masks off human beings and left them cringing before the public view .
with the <unk> of a master surgeon clemens dealt with human emotions and delighted in exposing human nature in the raw .
the spirit and the language of the fireside conversation were rooted deep in <name> twain 's nature and in his life , as c. e. s. wood , who printed 1601 at west point , has <unk> observed , " if i made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601 rose i would say that <name> 's intellectual structure and <unk> <unk> was from anglo-saxons as primitive as the common man of the tudor period .
he came from the banks of the mississippi  from the <unk> , pilots , <unk> , farmers and village folk of a rude , primitive people  as <name> did .
" he was finished in the mining camps of the west among stage drivers , gamblers and the men of <unk> .
the simple roughness of a frontier people was in his blood and <name> .
" words vulgar and offensive to other ears were a common language to him .
anyone who ever knew <name> heard him use them freely , forcibly , picturesquely in his unrestrained conversation .
such language is forcible as all primitive words are .
refinement seems to make for weakness  or let us say a cutting edge  but the old vulgar <unk> words bit like the blow of a pioneer 's ax  and <name> was like that .
then i think 1601 came out of <name> 's instinctive humor , satire and hatred of <unk> .
but there is more than this ; with all its humor there is a sense of real delight in what may be called <unk> for its own sake .
<unk> and the bible are no more obscene than nature herself  no more obscene than a manure pile , out of which come roses and cherries .
every word used in 1601 was used by our own rude pioneers as a part of their vocabulary  and no word was ever invented by man with obscene intent , but only as language to express his meaning .
no act of nature is obscene in itself  but when such words and acts are dragged in for an ulterior purpose they become offensive , as everything out of place is offensive .
i think he delighted , too , in shocking  giving resounding <unk> on what chaucer would quite simply call 'the bare <unk> . ' "
quite aside from this <unk> " <unk> " slapping , clemens had also a <unk> purpose , that of <unk> a past time as he saw it in shakespeare , <unk> , jonson , and other writers of the elizabethan <name> .
fireside conversation was an exercise in <unk> illumined by a keen sense of character .
it was made especially effective by the artistic arrangement of <unk> material into a compressed picture of a phase of the manners and even the minds of the men and women " in the spacious times of great <name> . "
<name> twain made of 1601 a very smart and fascinating performance , carried over almost to <unk> just to show it was not done for mere delight in the <name> <unk> of the functions with which it deals .
that <name> twain had made considerable study of this frankness is apparent from chapter four of 'a yankee at king <name> 's court , ' where he refers to the conversation at the famous round table thus : " many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen of the land would have made a comanche blush .
<unk> is too mild a term to convey the idea .
however , i had read <name> jones and <name> random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk , and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies , clear up to one hundred years ago ; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century  in which century , broadly speaking , the earliest samples of the real <name> and the real gentleman discoverable in english history ,  or in european history , for that matter  may be said to have made their appearance .
suppose sir <name> [ <name> ] instead of putting the conversation into the mouths of his characters , had allowed the characters to speak for themselves ?
we should have had talk from <name> and <unk> and the soft <name> <name> which would embarrass a tramp in our day .
however , to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate . "
<name> twain 's interest in history and in the <unk> of historical periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical reading in preference to fiction , and through his other historical writings .
even in the hilarious , youthful days in san <name> , paine reports that " clemens , however , was never quite ready for sleep .
then , as ever , he would prop himself up in bed , light his pipe , and lose himself in english or french history until his sleep conquered . "
paine tells us , too , that lecky 's <unk> morals ' was an old favorite .
the notes to 'the <name> and the pauper ' show again how carefully clemens examined his historical background , and his interest in these materials .
some of the more important sources are noted : hume 's 'history of england ' , <unk> ' <unk> of london ' , j. hammond <unk> 's <unk> laws , true and false ' .
apparently <name> twain <unk> it , for as <name> <unk> points out , " the book is always <name> twain .
its <unk> of tudor speech lapse sometimes into a callow satisfaction in that <unk>  <name> hugely enjoys his <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . "
the writing of 1601 <unk> his fondness for this treatment .
" do you suppose the liberties and the <unk> of these states have to do only with delicate <unk> ?
with gloved gentleman words " walt <unk> , 'an american <unk> ' .
although 1601 was not matched by any similar sketch in his published works , it was representative of <name> twain the man .
he was no emaciated literary <unk> .
bronzed and <unk> son of the west , <name> was a man 's man , and that significant fact is emphasized by the several phases of <name> 's <name> life as steamboat pilot , printer , miner , and frontier journalist .
on the <name> city enterprise <name> learned from editor r. m. <unk> that " when it was necessary to call a man names , there were no <unk> too long or too expressive to be hurled in rapid succession to emphasize the utter want of character of the man assailed ... .
there were <unk> there who could hurl <unk> at bad copy which would have frightened a bengal tiger .
the news editor could damn a mutilated dispatch in twenty-four languages . "
in san <name> in the <unk> <unk> we catch a glimpse of <name> twain and his <name> , <name> gillis , pausing in doorways to sing " the doleful ballad of the neglected lover , " an old piece of <unk> <unk> .
one morning , when a dog began to howl , <name> awoke " to find his <unk> standing in the door that opened out into a back garden , holding a big revolver , his hand shaking with cold and excitement , " relates paine in his biography .
" 'come here , <name> , ' he said .
'i 'm so chilled through i ca n't get a bead on him . '
" <unk> , ' said <name> , 'do n't shoot him .
just swear at him .
you can easily kill him at any range with your profanity . '
" <name> gillis declares that <name> twain let go such a scorching , <unk> blast that the brute 's owner sold him the next day for a mexican hairless dog . "
nor did <name> 's " geysers of profanity " cease spouting after these <name> and youthful days in san <name> .
with clemens it may truly be said that profanity was an <name>  a <unk> <name> that entertained nations .
" it was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts , " recalled <name> <unk> , life-long housekeeper and friend in the clemens <unk> , " and he'd swear something terrible if i did n't .
if he found a shirt in his drawer without a button on , he 'd take every single shirt out of that drawer and throw them right out of the window , rain or shine  out of the bathroom window they 'd go .
i used to look out every morning to see the <unk>  anything white .
out they 'd fly ... . oh !
he 'd swear at anything when he was on a <unk> .
he 'd swear at his razor if it didn't cut right , and mrs. clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter .
well , i 'd go and knock ; i 'd say , <unk> .
clemens wants to know what 's the matter . '
and then he 'd say to me ( kind of low ) in a whisper like , 'did she hear me <name> ? '
'yes , ' i 'd say , 'every word . '
oh , well , he was ashamed then , he was afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that , because mrs. clemens hated swearing . "
but his swearing never seemed really bad to <name> <unk> , " it was sort of funny , and a part of him , somehow , " she said .
" sort of amusing it was  and <name>  not like real swearing , 'cause he swore like an <name> . "
in his later years at stormfield <name> loved to play his favorite billiards .
" it was sometimes a wonderful and <unk> thing to watch mr. clemens play billiards , " relates <name> <name> .
" he loved the game , and he loved to win , but he occasionally made a very bad stroke , and then the varied , picturesque , and <unk> vocabulary , acquired in his more youthful years , was the only thing that gave him comfort .
gently , slowly , with no profane <unk> of voice , but irresistibly as though they had the <unk> of the mississippi for their source , came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice <unk> . "
<name> 's vocabulary ran the whole <unk> of life itself .
in <name> , in his appearance in 1879 before the stomach club , a jolly lot of <name> wags , <name> 's address , reports paine , " obtained a wide celebrity among the clubs of the world , though no line of it , not even its title , has ever found its way into published literature . "
it is <unk> to have been called " some remarks on the science of <unk> . "
in berlin , <name> asked <name> w. fisher to accompany him on an exploration of the berlin <name> library , where the librarian , having learned that clemens had been the kaiser 's guest at dinner , opened the secret treasure chests for the famous visitor .
one of these guarded treasures was a volume of grossly indecent verses by voltaire , addressed to <name> the great .
" too much is enough , " <name> is reported to have said , when fisher translated some of the verses , " i would blush to remember any of these stanzas except to tell <unk> about them when i get to vienna . "
when fisher had finished copying a verse for him <name> put it into his pocket , saying , " livy [ <name> 's wife , <name> ] is so busy <unk> <name> these days she ca n't even attempt to get at this . "
in his letters , too , howells observed , " he had the southwestern , the <unk> , the elizabethan breadth of <unk> , which i suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling one 's self <unk> ; and i was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion ; i could not bear to burn them , and i could not , after the first reading , quite bear to look at them .
i shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was <unk> . "
" with a nigger squat on her <unk> " <name> hay , pike county ballads .
" is there any other explanation , " asks van <unk> <name> , " 'of his elizabethan breadth of <unk> ? '
mr. howells confesses that he sometimes blushed over <name> twain 's letters , that there were some which , to the very day when he wrote his <unk> on his dead friend , he could not bear to <unk> .
perhaps if he had not so insisted , in former years , while going over <name> twain 's proofs , upon <unk> that swearing out in an instant , ' he would never had had cause to suffer from his having <unk> his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion . '
<name> twain 's verbal <unk> was obviously the expression of that vital sap which , not having been permitted to inform his work , had been driven inward and left there to ferment .
no wonder he was always indulging in orgies of forbidden words .
consider the famous book , 1601 , that fireside conversation in the time of <name> <name> : is there any obsolete verbal <unk> in the english language that <name> twain has not <unk> <unk> and assembled there ?
he , whose blood was in constant ferment and who could not contain within the narrow bonds that had been set for him the riotous exuberance of his nature , had to have an <unk> , and he poured through it a fetid stream of meaningless <unk>  the waste of a priceless <unk> material ! "
thus , <name> lumps 1601 with <name> twain 's " <unk> , " and <unk> it simply as another indication of <unk> .
figs for fig leaves !
of course , the writing of such a piece as 1601 raised the question of freedom of expression for the creative artist .
although little discussed at that time , it was a question which intensely interested <name> , and for a fuller appreciation of <unk> position one must keep in mind the year in which 1601 was written , 1876 .
there had been nothing like it before in american literature ; there had appeared no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> .
victorian england was gushing tennyson .
in the united states polite letters was a cult of the brahmins of boston , with <name> <name> howells at the helm of the atlantic .
<name> may <unk> published little women in <unk> , and little men in 1871 .
in 1873 <name> twain led the van of the <unk> , scraping the gilt off the <name> in the gilded age .
in 1880 <name> took a few pot shots at license in <name> and literature in his tramp abroad , " i wonder why some things are ?
for instance , <name> is allowed as much indecent license to-day as in earlier times  but the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply <unk> within the past eighty or ninety years .
<unk> and <unk> could portray the <unk> of their day in the <unk> language ; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day , but we are not allowed to approach them very near , even with nice and guarded forms of speech .
but not so with <name> .
the brush may still deal freely with any subject ; however revolting or indelicate .
it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore , to go about rome and <name> and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues .
these works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages , are all <unk> now .
yes , every one of them .
nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps ; nobody can help noticing it now , the <unk> makes it so conspicuous .
but the comical thing about it all , is , that the <unk> is confined to cold and pallid marble , which would be still cold and <unk> without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty , whereas <unk> paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it .
" at the door of the <unk> , in <name> , one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman , <unk> , battered , black with accumulated <unk>  they hardly suggest human beings  yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously <unk> by this fastidious generation .
you enter , and proceed to that <unk> little gallery that exists in the world ... . and there , against the wall , without obstructing rag or leaf , you may look your fill upon the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> picture the world possesses  titian 's <name> .
it is n't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed  no , it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand .
if i ventured to describe the attitude , there would be a fine howl  but there the <name> lies , for anybody to gloat over that wants to  and there she has a right to lie , for she is a work of <name> , and <name> has its privileges .
i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her ; i saw young men gaze long and <unk> at her ; i saw aged , infirm men <name> upon her charms with a pathetic interest .
how i should like to describe her  just to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the world  just to hear the <unk> average man deliver himself about my <unk> and coarseness , and all that .
" in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood , carnage , oozing brains , <unk>  pictures <unk> intolerable suffering  pictures alive with every conceivable horror , wrought out in dreadful detail  and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited  without a growl from anybody  for they are innocent , they are inoffensive , being works of <name> .
but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things  the critics would skin him alive .
well , let it go , it can not be helped ; <name> retains her privileges , literature has lost hers .
somebody else may cipher out the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of it  i have n't got time . "
professor scents <unk> unfortunately , 1601 has recently been <unk> by professor <name> <unk> as " the most famous piece of <unk> in american literature . "
like many another <unk> , prof. w. is like the little boy who is shocked to see " naughty " words chalked on the back fence , and thinks they are <unk> .
the initiated , after years of wading through the mire , <name> recognize instantly the significant difference between filthy filth and funny " filth . "
dirt for dirt 's sake is something else again .
<unk> , an eminent american <unk> has pointed out , is distinguished by the " leer of the <unk> . "
" the words which are criticised as dirty , " observed justice <name> m. <unk> in the united states district court of new york , lifting the ban on <name> by <name> <name> , " are old saxon words known to almost all men and , i venture , to many women , and are such words as would be naturally and habitually used , i believe , by the types of folk whose life , physical and mental , <name> is seeking to describe . "
neither was there " <unk> intent , " according to justice <unk> , nor was <name> obscene within the legal definition of that word .
" the meaning of the word <unk> , ' " the justice indicated , " as legally defined by the courts is : tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and <unk> thoughts .
" whether a particular book would tend to excite such impulses and thoughts must be tested by the court 's opinion as to its effect on a person with average sex instincts  what the french would call <unk> <unk> <unk> '  who plays , in this branch of legal inquiry , the same role of hypothetical <unk> as does the <unk> man ' in the law of <unk> and 'the learned man in the <name> ' on questions of invention in patent law . "
obviously , it is ridiculous to say that the " leer of the <unk> " <unk> in the pages of <name> twain 's 1601 .
droll story " in a way , " observed <name> <name> <unk> , " 1601 is to twain 's whole works what the <unk> stories ' are to <unk> 's .
it is better than the privately circulated <unk> and vulgarity of <name> field ; is , indeed , an essay in a sort of primordial humor such as we find in <unk> , or in the plays of some of the lesser stars that <name> their light from shakespeare 's urn .
it is humor or fun such as one expects , let us say , from the peasants of <name> hardy , outside of hardy 's books .
and , though it be filthy , it yet hath a splendor of mere <unk> of good spirits ...
i would say it is <unk> rather than <unk> , save for one touch toward the end .
indeed , it seems more of <unk> than of <unk> or <unk> or <unk>  is brutally british rather than <unk> <unk> , as to the subjects , but sumptuous as regards the language . "
immediately upon first reading , <name> hay , later secretary of state , had proclaimed 1601 a masterpiece .
<name> <unk> paine , <name> twain's biographer , likewise acknowledged its greatness , when he said , " 1601 is a genuine classic , as classics of that sort go .
it is better than the gross <unk> of <unk> , and perhaps in some day to come , the taste that justified <unk> and the <unk> <name> give this literary <unk> shelter and setting among the more conventional writing of <name> twain .
human taste is a curious thing ; delicacy is purely a matter of environment and point of view . "
" it depends on who writes a thing whether it is coarse or not , " wrote clemens in his notebook in 1879 .
" i built a conversation which could have happened  i used words such as were used at that time  1601 .
i sent it <unk> to a magazine , and how the editor abused it and the <unk> ! "
" but that man was a <unk> of <unk> and had been saying , 'o that we had a <unk> ! '
i judged that i could furnish him one . "
" then i took it to one of the greatest , best and most learned of <unk> [ rev .

he came within an ace of killing himself with laughter ( for between you and me the thing was dreadfully funny .
i do n't often write anything that i laugh at myself , but i can hardly think of that thing without laughing ) .

ye <unk>  what saith ye worshipful master <unk> ?

though ye <unk> hosts of heaven had foretold ye coming of this most desolating breath , proclaiming it a work of <unk> man , its quaking thunders , its <unk> <unk> his own achievement in due course of nature , yet had not i believed it ; but had said the pit itself hath furnished forth the stink , and <unk> artillery hath shook the globe in admiration of it .
[ then was there a silence , and each did turn him toward the worshipful <unk> <name> <unk> , that browned , <unk> , bloody <unk> , who rising up did smile , and <unk> say , ] <unk> w.  most gracious <unk> , 't was i that did it , but indeed it was so poor and frail a note , compared with such as i am wont to furnish , yt in sooth i was ashamed to call the <unk> mine in so <name> a presence .

then fell they to talk about ye manners and customs of many peoples , and master <unk> spake of ye <unk> of ye sieur <name> de <unk> , wherein was mention of ye custom of widows of <unk> to wear <unk> ye <unk> , in sign of <unk> , a <name> in ye <unk> of a man's member wilted and limber , whereat ye <unk> did laugh and say widows in england doe wear <unk> too , but betwixt the thighs , and not wilted neither , till <unk> hath done that office for them .
master <unk> did likewise observe how yt ye sieur de <unk> hath also spoken of a certain emperor of such mighty prowess that he did take ten <unk> in ye compass of a single night , ye while his empress did entertain two and twenty <unk> knights between her <unk> , yet was not satisfied ; whereat ye <name> countess <unk> saith a ram is yet ye <unk> superior , sith he <unk> <unk> above a hundred <unk> 'twixt sun and sun ; and after , if he can have none more to <unk> , <name> <unk> until he hath enrich 'd whole acres with his seed .

with such a tongue as thine , lad , thou'lt spread the <name> thighs of many a willing <unk> in thy good time , an ' thy <unk> be as handy as thy <unk> .
then spake ye <unk> of how she met old <unk> when she was turned of fifteen , and he did tell her of a man his father knew that had a double pair of <unk> , whereon a controversy followed as concerning the most just way to spell the word , ye contention running high betwixt ye learned bacon and ye ingenious jonson , until at last ye old <name> <name> , wearying of it all , saith , <unk> , what <unk> it how ye shall spell the word ?
i warrant ye when ye use your <unk> ye shall not think of it ; and my <name> <unk> , be ye content ; let the spelling be , ye shall enjoy the beating of them on your <unk> just the same , i trow .
before i had gained my fourteenth year i had learnt that them that would explore a <unk> stop 'd not to consider the spelling <unk> . '

<unk> hath a story of a priest that did beguile a maid into his cell , then knelt him in a corner to pray for <name> to be rightly thankful for this tender <unk> ye lord had sent him ; but ye abbot , spying through ye key-hole , did see a tuft of brownish hair with fair white flesh about it , wherefore when ye priest 's prayer was done , his chance was gone , <unk> as ye little maid had but ye one <unk> , and that was already occupied to her content .
then conversed they of religion , and ye <unk> work ye old dead <name> did doe by ye <name> of god .
then next about poetry , and master <unk> did <unk> a part of his king <name> iv. , ye which , it <unk> unto me , is not of ye value of an <unk> of ashes , yet they praised it bravely , one and all .
ye same did <unk> a portion of his " <name> and adonis , " to their prodigious admiration , whereas i , being sleepy and fatigued withal , did <unk> it but paltry stuff , and was the more <unk> in that ye <unk> <unk> had got his wind again , and did turn his mind to <unk> with such villain zeal that presently i was like to choke once more .
god damn this <name> ruffian and all his breed .
i <unk> that hell <unk> get him .
they talked about ye wonderful defense which old <unk> <name> <unk> did make for himself before ye judges in ye time of <name> ; which was unlucky matter to <unk> , sith it fetched out ye <unk> with a <unk> yt he , having so much wit , had yet not enough to save his <unk> <unk> sound for her <unk> . '
and ye <unk> did give ye <unk> <unk> <name> a look yt made <unk> wince  for she hath not forgot he was her own lover it yt <unk> day .
there was silent <unk> now ; 't was not a good turn for talk to take , sith if ye <unk> must find offense in a little harmless <unk> , when <unk> were stiff and <unk> not <unk> to take ye stiffness out of them , who of this company was <unk> ; behold , was not ye wife of master <unk> four months gone with child when she stood <unk> before ye altar ?

in time came they to discourse of <unk> , and of the new painter , <unk> , that is beginning to be heard of .
fine words and <unk> phrases from the ladies now , one or two of them being , in other days , pupils of that poor ass , <unk> , himself ; and i marked how that jonson and <unk> did <unk> to discharge some venom of sarcasm , yet dared they not in the presence , the <unk> 's <name> being ye very flower of ye <unk> herself .
but behold , these be they yt , having a specialty , and admiring it in themselves , be jealous when a neighbor doth <unk> it , nor can abide it in them long .
wherefore 't was observable yt ye <unk> waxed <unk> ; and in time labor 'd <unk> <unk> out of ye mouth of <name> <name> , who manifestly did mightily pride herself thereon , did quite <unk> ye <unk> 's endurance , who listened till ye gaudy <unk> was done , then lifted up her brows , and with <unk> irony , mincing saith 'o <unk> !

whereat they <unk> did <unk> , but not ye <name> <name> , yt <unk> foolish <unk> .
now was <unk> <name> minded of a tale he once did hear ye ingenious <unk> of <unk> relate , about a maid , which being like to suffer rape by an <unk> <unk> , did <unk> contrive a device to save her <unk> , and said to him , first , my lord , i prithee , take out thy holy tool and <unk> before me ; which doing , lo his member <unk> , and would not rise again .
footnotes to frivolity the historical consistency of 1601 indicates that twain must have given the subject considerable thought .
the author was careful to speak only of men who <unk> might have been in the virgin <name> 's closet and engaged in discourse with her .
the characters at this time ( 1601 ) <name> <name> was 68 years old .
she speaks of having talked to " old <unk> " in her youth .
this might have been possible as <unk> died in <unk> , when the <name> was 19 years old .
among those in the party were shakespeare , at that time 37 years old ; <name> jonson , 27 ; and sir <name> <name> , 49 .
beaumont at the time was 17 , not 16 .
he was admitted as a member of the inner <name> in 1600 , and his first translations , those from <unk> , were first published in <unk> .
therefore , if one were holding strictly to the year date , neither by age nor by fame would beaumont have been eligible to attend such a gathering of <name> personages in the year 1601 ; but the point is unimportant .
the elizabethan writers in the conversation shakespeare speaks of montaigne 's essays .
these were first published in <unk> and successive editions were issued in the years following , the third volume being published in <unk> .
" in england montaigne was early popular .
it was long supposed that the autograph of shakespeare in a copy of <unk> 's translation showed his study of the essays .
the autograph has been disputed , but divers passages , and especially one in the tempest , show that at first or second hand the poet was acquainted with the <unk> . "
( encyclopedia <unk> . )
the company at the <name> 's fireside discoursed of <name> ( or <unk> ) , english dramatist and novelist of the elizabethan <name> , whose novel , <unk> , published in two parts , <unk> ' , or the 'anatomy of <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> and his england ' ( <unk> ) was a literary sensation .
it is said to have influenced literary style for more than a quarter of a century , and traces of its influence are found in shakespeare .
( columbia encyclopedia ) .
the introduction of <name> jonson into the party was wholly appropriate , if one may call to witness some of jonson 's writings .
the subject under discussion was one that jonson was acquainted with , in the <unk> : act .

good old english custom that certain types of english society have not changed materially in their freedom toward breaking wind in public can be noticed in some comparatively recent literature .
<name> <name> in my life , vol .
2 , ch .
xiii , tells of <name> <unk> , wife of a judge advocate general , being compelled to leave her own table , at which she was entertaining sir <name> fowler , then the lord mayor of london , because of the suffocating and <unk> odors there .
he also tells of an instance in parliament , and of a rather brilliant bon <unk> spoken upon that occasion .
" while fowler was speaking <unk> had shewn signs of restlessness ; towards the end of the speech he had moved some three yards away from the <unk> .
as soon as fowler sat down <unk> sprang up holding his handkerchief to his nose : " 'mr .
speaker , ' he began , and was at once acknowledged by the speaker , for it was a maiden speech , and as such was entitled to precedence by the courteous custom of the house , 'i know why the right honourable member from the city did not conclude his speech with a proposal .
the only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be with a motion ! ' "
<unk> <unk> but society had apparently <unk> sadly in modern times , and even in the <name> of <name> , for at an earlier date it was a serious  nay , capital  offense to break wind in the presence of majesty .
the emperor claudius , hearing that one who had suppressed the urge while paying him court had suffered greatly thereby , " intended to issue an edict , allowing to all people the <name> of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by <unk> : " martial , too ( book xii , <unk> <unk> ) , tells of the embarrassment of one who broke wind while praying in the capitol , " one day , while standing upright , addressing his prayers to jupiter , <unk> <unk> in the capitol .
men laughed , but the father of the gods , offended , condemned the guilty one to dine at home for three nights .
since that time , miserable <unk> , when he wishes to enter the capitol , goes first to <unk> ' <unk> and <unk> ten or twenty times .
yet , in spite of this <unk> <unk> , he salutes jove with constricted <unk> . "
martial also ( book iv , <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> a woman who was subject to the habit , saying , " your <unk> , <unk> , has always a child at her side , calling it her darling and her plaything ; and yet  more wonder  she does not care for children .
what is the reason then .
<unk> is apt to <unk> .
( for which she could blame the unsuspecting infant . ) "
the tale is told , too , of a certain woman who performed an <unk> <unk> at a dinner attended by the witty <unk> <unk> , bishop of orleans , and that when , to cover up her lapse , she began to scrape her feet upon the floor , and to make similar noises , the bishop said , " do not trouble to find a rhyme , madam ! "
nay , worthier names than those of any yet mentioned have discussed the matter .
herodotus tells of one such which was the <unk> to the fall of an empire and a change of dynasty  that which amasis discharges while on horseback , and bids the <unk> of <unk> , king of egypt , catch and deliver to his <name> master .
even the exact manner and posture of amasis , author of this insult , is described .
st. <name> ( the city of god , <unk> ) <unk> the instance of a man who could command his rear trumpet to sound at <name> , which his learned <unk> <unk> with the example of one who could do so in tune !
<name> <name> , in his " letter to the <name> academy of brussels " has <unk> suggested remedies for <unk> the stench attendant upon these discharges : " my prize question therefore should be : to discover some drug , wholesome and  not disagreeable , to be mixed with our common food , or <unk> , that shall render the natural discharges of wind from our bodies not only inoffensive , but agreeable as perfumes .
" that this is not a <unk> project & altogether impossible , may appear from these considerations .
that we already have some knowledge of means capable of varying that smell .
he that <unk> on stale flesh , especially with much addition of onions , shall be able to afford a stink that no company can tolerate ; while he that has lived for some time on vegetables only , shall have that breath so pure as to be insensible of the most delicate noses ; and if he can manage so as to avoid the report , he may anywhere give vent to his griefs , unnoticed .
but as there are many to whom an entire vegetable diet would be inconvenient , & as a little quick lime thrown into a <unk> <name> correct the amazing quantity of fetid air arising from the vast mass of putrid matter contained in such places , and render it pleasing to the smell , who knows but that a little powder of lime ( or some other equivalent ) taken in our food , or perhaps a glass of lime water drank at dinner , may have the same effect on the air produced in and issuing from our bowels ? "
one curious commentary on the text is that <name> should be so fond of investigating into the authorship of the <unk> in question , when she was inordinately fond of strong and sweet perfumes ; in fact , she was responsible for the tremendous increase in <unk> of scents into england during her reign .
" ye <unk> of ye sieur <name> de <unk> " there is a curious <unk> of error and misunderstanding in this part of the sketch .
in the first place , the story is borrowed from montaigne , where it is told <unk> , and then further corrupted in the telling .
it was not the good widows of <unk> who wore the <unk> upon their <unk> ; it was the young married women , of the district near <unk> home , who paraded it to view upon their foreheads , as a symbol , says our <unk> , " of the <name> they derived therefrom . "
if they became widows , they reversed its position , and covered it up with the rest of their <unk> .
the " emperor " mentioned was not an emperor ; he was <unk> , a native of <unk> , on the genoese coast , who , with <unk> , led the unsuccessful rebellion in gaul against emperor <unk> .
even so keen a <unk> as cotton has failed to note the error .
the empress ( montaigne does not say " his empress " ) was messalina , third wife of the emperor claudius , who was uncle of caligula and <unk> to nero .
furthermore , in her case the charge is that she <unk> with twenty-five in a single night , and not twenty-two , as appears in the text .
montaigne is right in his statistics , if original sources are correct , whereas the author erred in <unk> the incident .
as for proculus , it has been noted that he was associated with <unk> , who was as renowned in the field of <unk> as was proculus in that of <name> ( gibbon , decline and fall of the <name> empire ) .
the feat of proculus is told in his own words , in <unk> , ( hist .
<name> , p. 246 ) where he <unk> having captured one hundred <unk> virgins , and <unk> ten of them in one night , together with the happenings subsequent thereto .
concerning messalina , there appears to be no question but that she was a <unk> , and that , while empress of rome , she participated in some fearful <unk> .
the question is what to believe , for much that we have heard about her is almost certainly <unk> .
the author from whom montaigne took his facts is the elder pliny , who , in his natural history , book x , chapter 83 , says , " other animals become <unk> with <unk> pleasures ; man hardly knows any <unk> .
messalina , the wife of claudius caesar , thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress , selected for the purpose of deciding the question , one of the most notorious women who followed the profession of a hired <unk> ; and the empress <unk> her , after continuous intercourse , night and day , at the <unk> embrace . "
but pliny , notwithstanding his great attainments , was often a <unk> of stale gossip , and in like case was aurelius <name> , another writer who heaped much <unk> on her name .
again , there is a great <unk> in the annals of <unk> , a true historian , at the period covering the earlier days of the empress ; while <unk> , bitter as he may be , is little more than an <unk> .
<unk> , another of her <unk> , is a prejudiced witness , for he started out to <unk> female vice , and naturally aimed at high places .
<unk> also tells of messalina 's misdeeds , but his work is under the same limitations as that of <unk> .
furthermore , none but pliny mentions the excess under consideration .
however , " where there is much smoke there must be a little fire , " and based upon the superimposed testimony of the writers of the period , there appears little doubt but that messalina was a <unk> , that she <unk> herself in the public <unk> , naked , and with gilded nipples , and that she did actually marry her chief <unk> , silius , while claudius was absent at ostia , and that the wedding was consummated in the presence of a concourse of witnesses .
this was " the straw that broke the camel 's back . "
claudius hastened back to rome , silius was dispatched , and messalina , lacking the <unk> to destroy herself , was killed when an officer ran a sword through her abdomen , just as it appeared that claudius was about to <unk> .
" then spake ye damned windmill , sir <name> " <name> is thoroughly in character here ; this observation is quite in keeping with the general veracity of his account of his travels in guiana , one of the most <unk> accounts of adventure ever told .
naturally , the scholarly researches of <unk> have failed to discover this people ; perhaps <name> <name> might best be protected among the <unk> of <unk> , where the men marry when approaching forty .
<name> jonson in his conversations observed " that <unk> w. <unk> esteemed more of fame than of conscience . "
ye virgin <unk> grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of <name> to the title , " the virgin <name> , " and it is utterly impossible to dispose of the issue in a note .
however , the weight of opinion appears to be in the negative .
many and great were the difficulties attending the marriage of a protestant <name> in those <unk> times , and <name> finally announced that she would become wedded to the english nation , and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death .
however , more or less open <unk> with essex and leicester , as well as a host of lesser courtiers , her ardent temperament , and her imperious temper , are indications that can not be denied in determining any estimate upon the point in question .
<name> jonson in his conversations with <name> <unk> of <unk> says , " <name> <name> never saw herself after she became old in a true glass ; they painted her , and <unk> would vermillion her nose .
she had <unk> about <unk> <unk> set dice that threw <unk> or five , and she knew not they were other , to make her win and <unk> herself fortunate .
that she had a <unk> on her , which made her <unk> of man , though for her delight she tried many .
at the coming over of monsieur , there was a french <unk> who took in hand to cut it , <unk> fear stayed her , and his death . "
it was a subject which again <unk> clemens when he was abroad with w. h. fisher , whom <name> employed to " nose up " everything pertaining to <name> <name> 's manly character .
" <unk> hath a story " the author does not pay any great compliment to <name> 's memory here .
there is no such tale in all <unk> .
the nearest related incident forms the subject matter of <unk> 's novel ( the fourth ) of the first day of the <unk> .
old <unk> <name> <unk> the incident referred to appears to be sir <name> <unk> 's trial for <unk> in the attempt to make <name> <name> grey <name> of england , a charge of which he was acquitted .
this so angered <name> <name> that she imprisoned him in the tower , and fined the <unk> from one to two thousand pounds each .
her action terrified succeeding <unk> , so that sir <name> 's brother was condemned on no stronger evidence than that which had failed to prevail before .
while sir <name> 's defense may have been brilliant , it must be admitted that the evidence was weak .
he was later released from the tower , and under <name> was one of a group of commissioners sent by that <name> into scotland , to <unk> trouble with <name> , <name> of scots .
when the attempt became known , <name> repudiated the acts of her agents , but sir <name> , having anticipated this possibility , had sufficient foresight to secure <unk> of his plan by the council , and so outwitted <name> , who was playing a <unk> role , and <name> , one of the greatest statesmen who ever held the post of principal minister .
perhaps it was this incident to which the company referred , which might in part explain <name> 's rejoinder .
however , he had been restored to confidence ere this , and had served as ambassador to <name> .
" to save his <unk> 's <unk> " <name> <unk> ( or <unk> ) , daughter of sir <name> , was one of <name> 's maids of honor .
when it was learned that she had been <unk> by <name> , sir <name> was recalled from his command at sea by the <name> , and compelled to marry the girl .
this was not " in that <unk> <unk> , " as the text has it , for it happened only eight years before the date of this <unk> " conversation , " when <name> was sixty years old .
partial <unk> the various <unk> of 1601 reveal how <name> twain 's <unk> conversation ' has become a part of the american printer 's <name> .
but more important , its many <unk> indicate that it has become a popular bit of american <unk> , particularly for men and women who have a feeling for <name> twain .
apparently it appeals to the <unk> , who <unk> to it his worthy <name> , as well as to the job printer , who may pull a <unk> printed proof .
the <name> procession of curious <unk> of 1601 is unique in the history of american printing .
indeed , the story of the various <unk> of 1601 is almost <unk> .

two or three persons having at different times intimated that if i would write an autobiography they would read it , when they got leisure , i yield at last to this frenzied public demand , and herewith tender my history : ours is a <name> old house , and stretches a long way back into antiquity .
the earliest ancestor the <unk> have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of higgins .
this was in the eleventh century , when our people were living in <unk> , county of cork , england .
why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name ( except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness ) , instead of higgins , is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much <name> to stir .
it is a kind of vague , pretty romance , and we leave it alone .
all the old families do that way .
<unk> twain was a man of considerable note  a solicitor on the highway in <name> <name> ' time .
at about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old english places of resort called <unk> , to see about something , and never returned again .
while there he died suddenly .
<name> twain , seems to have made something of a stir about the year <unk> .
he was as full of fun as he could be , and used to take his old sabre and sharpen it up , and get in a convenient place on a dark night , and stick it through people as they went by , to see them jump .
he was a born humorist .
but he got to going too far with it ; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties , the authorities removed one end of him , and put it up on a nice high place on <name> bar , where it could contemplate the people and have a good time .
he never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long .
then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers  <name> , <unk> fellows , who always went into battle singing ; right behind the army , and always went out <unk> , right ahead of it .
this is a <unk> rebuke to old dead <unk> 's poor <unk> that our family tree never had but one limb to it , and that that one stuck out at right angles , and bore fruit <name> , and summer .
<unk> || | || | || o || / || \ || || || || || || || our family tree early in the fifteenth century we have <name> twain , called " the scholar . "
he wrote a beautiful , beautiful hand .
and he could imitate <unk> hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it .
he had infinite sport with his talent .
but by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road , and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand .
still , he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business , which , with inconsiderable intervals , was some forty-two years .
in fact , he died in harness .
during all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till government gave him another .
he was a perfect pet .
and he was always a favorite with his <unk> , and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society , called the chain gang .
he always wore his hair short , had a preference for striped clothes , and died lamented by the government .
he was a sore loss to his country .
for he was so regular .
some years later we have the illustrious <name> <name> twain .
he came over to this country with <name> in <unk> , as a passenger .
he appears to have been of a <unk> , uncomfortable disposition .
he complained of the food all the way over , and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change .
he wanted fresh <name> .
hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air , sneering about the commander , and saying he did not believe <name> knew where he was going to or had ever been there before .
the memorable cry of " land ho ! "
thrilled every heart in the ship but his .
he gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the <unk> line lying on the distant water , and then said : " land be hanged ,  it 's a raft ! "
when this questionable passenger came on board the ship , he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked " b. g. , " one cotton sock marked " l. w. c. " one woollen one marked " d. f. " and a <unk> marked " o. m. r. " and yet during the voyage he worried more about his " trunk , " and gave himself more airs about it , than all the rest of the passengers put together .
if the ship was " down by the head , " and would not steer , he would go and move his " trunk " farther aft , and then watch the effect .
if the ship was " by the stern , " he would suggest to <name> to detail some men to " shift that baggage . "
in storms he had to be gagged , because his <unk> about his " trunk " made it impossible for the men to hear the orders .
the man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing , but it is noted in the ship 's log as a " curious circumstance " that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper , he took it ashore in four trunks , a <unk> crate , and a couple of champagne baskets .
but when he came back insinuating in an insolent , swaggering way , that some of his things were missing , and was going to search the other passengers ' baggage , it was too much , and they threw him overboard .
they watched long and wonderingly for him to come up , but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide .
but while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side , and the interest was momentarily increasing , it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow .
then in the ship 's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note : " in time it was <unk> yt ye <unk> passenger <unk> <unk> <unk> and got ye anchor , and <unk> ye same and <unk> it to ye dam <unk> from ye interior , saying yt he <unk> <unk> it , ye <unk> of a <unk> ! "
yet this ancestor had good and <name> instincts , and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and <unk> our indians .
he built a commodious jail and put up a gallows , and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them .
at this point the chronicle becomes less <name> and <unk> , and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in <name> , and while there received injuries which terminated in his death .
the great grandson of the " reformer " flourished in sixteen hundred and something , and was known in our annals as , " the old admiral , " though in history he had other titles .
he was long in command of fleets of swift vessels , well armed and manned , and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen .
vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on , always made good fair time across the ocean .
but if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do , his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer  and then he would take that ship home where he lived and , keep it there carefully , expecting the owners to come for it , but they never did .
and he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take <unk> exercise and a bath .
he called it " walking a plank . "
all the pupils liked it .
at any rate , they never found any fault with it after trying it .
when the owners were late coming for their ships , the admiral always burned them , so that the insurance money should not be lost .
at last this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors .
and to her dying day , his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been <unk> .
<name> <name> twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century , and was a zealous and distinguished missionary .
he converted sixteen thousand south sea islanders , and taught them that a <unk> necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in .
his poor flock loved him very , very dearly ; and when his funeral was over , they got up in a body ( and came out of the restaurant ) with tears in their eyes , and saying , one to another , that he was a good tender missionary , and they wished they had some more of him .
<unk> ( <unk> ) twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century , and aided gen. braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor washington .
it was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our washington from behind a tree .
so far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral <unk> is correct ; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the great spirit for some mighty mission , and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again , the narrative seriously <unk> the integrity of history .
what he did say was : " it ai n't no ( <unk> ! )
no use .
'at man 's so drunk he ca n't <name> ' still long enough for a man to hit him .
i ( <unk> ! )
i ca n't <unk> to fool away any more <unk> on him ! "
that was why he stopped at the seventeenth round , and it was , a good plain matter-of-fact reason , too , and one that easily <unk> itself to us by the eloquent , persuasive flavor of probability there is about it .
i always enjoyed the <unk> narrative , but i felt a <unk> misgiving that every indian at braddock 's defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times ( two easily grows to seventeen in a century ) , and missed him , jumped to the conclusion that the great spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission ; and so i somehow feared that the only reason why washington 's case is remembered and the others forgotten is , that in his the prophecy came true , and in that of the others it did n't .
there are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies indians and other <unk> parties have made ; but one may <name> in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled .
i <name> remark here , in passing , that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well known in history by their <unk> , that i have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them , or even mention them in the order of their birth .
among these may be mentioned <name> <unk> twain , alias <name> <unk> ; <name> wentworth twain , alias <unk> <name> ; <name> <unk> twain , alias <name> <unk> ; <unk> twain , alias baron <unk> ; <name> <name> twain , alias capt .
<unk> ; and then there are <name> <name> train , <name> pepper , <unk> and <unk> ass  they all belong to our family , but to a branch of it somewhat distantly removed from the honorable direct line  in fact , a collateral branch , whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that , in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and <unk> for , they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged .
it is not well , when writing an autobiography , to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time  it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather , and then skip from there to yourself , which i now do .
i was born without teeth  and there <name> iii had the advantage of me ; but i was born without a <unk> , likewise , and there i had the advantage of him .
my parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest .
but now a thought occurs to me .
my own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors , that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until i am hanged .
if some other biographies i have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred , it would have been a felicitous thing , for the reading public .
how does it strike you ?
awful , terrible medieval romance chapter i .
the secret revealed .
it was night .
stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of <unk> .
the year <unk> was drawing to a close .
far away up in the tallest of the castle 's towers a single light glimmered .
a secret council was being held there .
the stern old lord of <unk> sat in a chair of state meditating .
presently he said , with a tender accent : " my daughter ! "
a young man of <name> presence , clad from head to heel in knightly mail , answered : " speak , father ! "
" my daughter , the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young life .
know , then , that it had its birth in the matters which i shall now unfold .
my brother ulrich is the great duke of <unk> .
our father , on his <unk> , decreed that if no son were born to ulrich , the succession should pass to my house , provided a son were born to me .
and further , in case no son were born to either , but only daughters , then the succession should pass to <unk> daughter , if she proved <unk> ; if she did not , my daughter should succeed , if she retained a blameless name .
and so i , and my old wife here , prayed fervently for the good boon of a son , but the prayer was vain .
you were born to us .
i was in despair .
i saw the mighty prize slipping from my grasp , the splendid dream vanishing away .
and i had been so hopeful !
five years had ulrich lived in <unk> , and yet his wife had borne no heir of either sex .
" 'but hold , ' i said , 'all is not lost . '
a saving scheme had shot athwart my <name> .
you were born at midnight .
only the leech , the nurse , and six <unk> knew your sex .
i hanged them every one before an hour had sped .
next morning all the <unk> went mad with rejoicing over the proclamation that a son was born to <unk> , an heir to mighty <unk> !
and well the secret has been kept .
your mother 's own sister nursed your infancy , and from that time forward we feared nothing .
" when you were ten years old , a daughter was born to ulrich .
we grieved , but hoped for good results from measles , or physicians , or other natural enemies of infancy , but were always disappointed .
she lived , she throve  heaven 's <unk> upon her !
but it is nothing .
we are safe .
for , <unk> !
have we not a son ?
and is not our son the future duke ?
our well-beloved <name> , is it not so ?  for , woman of <unk> years  as you are , my child , none other name than that hath ever fallen to you !
" now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother , and he <unk> feeble .
the cares of state do tax him sore .
therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already duke  in act , though not yet in name .
your <unk> are ready  you journey forth to-night .
" now listen well .
remember every word i say .
there is a law as old as germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people , she shall die !
so heed my words .
pretend humility .
pronounce your judgments from the premier 's chair , which stands at the foot of the throne .
do this until you are crowned and safe .
it is not likely that your sex <name> ever be discovered ; but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life . "
" oh ; my father , is it for this my life hath been a lie !
was it that i might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights ?
spare me , father , spare your child ! "
" what , <unk> !
is this my reward for the <name> fortune my <name> has wrought for thee ?
by the bones of my father , this <unk> sentiment of thine but ill accords with my humor .
" <unk> thee to the duke , instantly !
and beware how thou <unk> with my purpose ! "
let this suffice , of the conversation .
it is enough for us to know that the prayers , the entreaties and the tears of the <unk> girl availed nothing .
they nor anything could move the stout old lord of <unk> .
and so , at last , with a heavy heart , the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her , and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants .
the old baron sat silent for many minutes after his <unk> departure , and then he turned to his sad wife and said : " dame , our matters seem speeding fairly .
it is full three months since i sent the shrewd and handsome count <unk> on his devilish mission to my brother 's daughter <name> .
if he fail , we are not wholly safe ; but if he do succeed , no power can bar our girl from being duchess e'en though <unk> should decree she never should be duke ! "
" my heart is full of <unk> , yet all may still be well . "
" <unk> , woman !
leave the owls to croak .
to bed with ye , and dream of <unk> and grandeur ! "
chapter ii .
festivity and tears six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter , the brilliant capital of the duchy of <unk> was resplendent with military pageantry , and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes ; for <name> , the young heir to the crown , was come .
the old duke 's heart was full of happiness , for <name> 's handsome person and graceful bearing had won his love at once .
the great halls of the palace were thronged with nobles , who welcomed <name> bravely ; and so bright and happy did all things seem , that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving place to a comforting contentment .
but in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature was <unk> .
by a window stood the duke 's only child , the <name> <name> .
her eyes were red and swollen , and full of tears .
she was alone .
presently she fell to weeping anew , and said aloud : " the villain <unk> is gone  has fled the dukedom !
i could not believe it at first , but alas !
it is too true .
and i loved him so .
i dared to love him though i knew the duke my father would never let me wed him .
i loved him  but now i hate him !
with all my soul i hate him !
oh , what is to become of me !
i am lost , lost , lost !
i shall go mad ! "
chapter iii .
the plot <unk> .
a few months drifted by .
all men published the praises of the young <name> 's government and <unk> the wisdom of his judgments , the <unk> of his sentences , and the modesty with which he bore himself in his great office .
the old duke soon gave everything into his hands , and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier .
it seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as <name> was , could not be otherwise than happy .
but strange enough , he was not .
for he saw with dismay that the <name> <name> had begun to love him !
the love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him , but this was freighted with danger !
and he saw , moreover , that the delighted duke had discovered his daughter 's passion likewise , and was already dreaming of a marriage .
every day somewhat of the deep sadness that had been in the <name> ' face faded away ; every day <name> and animation beamed brighter from her eye ; and by and by even vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so troubled .
<name> was appalled .
he bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own sex when he was new and a stranger in the palace  when he was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel .
he now began to avoid , his cousin .
but this only made matters worse , for , naturally enough , the more he avoided her , the more she cast herself in his way .
he marvelled at this at first ; and next it startled him .
the girl haunted him ; she hunted him ; she happened upon him at all times and in all places , in the night as well as in the day .
she seemed singularly anxious .
there was surely a mystery somewhere .
this could not go on forever .
all the world was talking about it .
the duke was beginning to look perplexed .
poor <name> was becoming a very ghost through dread and dire distress .
one day as he was emerging from a private ante-room attached to the picture gallery , <name> confronted him , and seizing both his hands , in hers , exclaimed : " oh , why , do you avoid me ?
what have i done  what have i said , to lose your kind opinion of me  for , surely i had it once ?
<name> , do not despise me , but pity a tortured heart ?
i can not  can not hold the words unspoken longer , lest they kill me  i love you , <name> !
there , despise me if you must , but they would be uttered ! "
<name> was speechless .
<name> hesitated a moment , and then , <unk> his silence , a wild gladness flamed in her eyes , and she flung her arms about his neck and said : " you <unk> !
you <unk> !
you can love me  you <name> love me !
oh , say you <name> , my own , my worshipped <name> ! "
<name> groaned aloud .
a sickly pallor overspread his countenance , and he trembled like an <unk> .
presently , in desperation , he thrust the poor girl from him , and cried : " you know not what you ask !
it is forever and ever impossible ! "
and then he fled like a criminal and left the <name> stupefied with amazement .
a minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there , and <name> was crying and sobbing in his chamber .
both were in despair .
both saw ruin staring them in the face .
by and by <name> rose slowly to her feet and moved away , saying : " to think that he was <unk> my love at the very moment that i thought it was melting his cruel heart !
i hate him !
he spurned me  did this man  he spurned me from him like a dog ! "
chapter iv .
the awful revelation .
time passed on .
a settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance of the good duke 's daughter .
she and <name> were seen together no more now .
the duke grieved at this .
but as the weeks wore away , <unk> color came back to his cheeks and his old-time vivacity to his eye , and he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom .
presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace .
it grew louder ; it spread farther .
the <unk> of the city got hold of it .
it swept the dukedom .
and this is what the whisper said : " the <name> <name> hath given birth to a child ! "
when the lord of <unk> heard it , he swung his plumed helmet thrice around his head and shouted : " long live duke <name> !  for lo , his crown is sure , from this day forward !
<unk> has done his errand well , and the good scoundrel shall be rewarded ! "
and he spread the tidings far and wide , and for <unk> hours no soul in all the <unk> but did dance and sing , <unk> and illuminate , to celebrate the great event , and all at proud and happy old <unk> 's expense .
chapter v. the frightful catastrophe .
the trial was at hand .
all the great lords and barons of <unk> were assembled in the hall of justice in the ducal palace .
no space was left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit .
<name> , clad in purple and <unk> , sat in the premier 's chair , and on either side sat the great judges of the realm .
the old duke had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed , without favor , and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted .
his days were numbered .
poor <name> had begged , as for his very life , that he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin 's crime , but it did not avail .
the saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in <name> 's breast .
the <unk> was in his father 's .
for , unknown to his daughter " <name> , " the old baron <unk> was come , and was among the crowd of nobles , triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house .
after the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries had followed , the venerable lord chief justice said : " prisoner , stand forth ! "
the unhappy <name> rose and stood <unk> before the vast multitude .
the lord chief justice continued : " most <name> <name> , before the great judges of this realm it hath been charged and proven that out of holy <unk> your <name> hath given birth unto a child ; and by our ancient law the penalty is death , excepting in one sole contingency , whereof his <name> the acting duke , our good lord <name> , <name> advertise you in his solemn sentence now ; wherefore , give heed . "
<name> stretched forth the reluctant sceptre , and in the self-same moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned <unk> toward the doomed prisoner , and the tears came into his eyes .
he opened his lips to speak , but the lord chief justice said quickly : " not there , your <name> , not there !
it is not lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal line save from the ducal throne ! "
a shudder went to the heart of poor <name> , and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise .
<name> had not been crowned  dared he profane the throne ?
he hesitated and turned pale with fear .
but it must be done .
wondering eyes were already upon him .
they would be suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer .
he ascended the throne .
presently he stretched forth the sceptre again , and said : " prisoner , in the name of our sovereign lord , ulrich , duke of <unk> , i proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me .
give heed to my words .
by the ancient law of the land , except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner , you must surely die .
embrace this opportunity  save yourself while yet you may .
name the father of your child ! "
a solemn hush fell upon the great court  a silence so profound that men could hear their own hearts beat .
then the <name> slowly turned , with eyes gleaming with hate , and pointing her finger straight at <name> , said : " thou <name> the man ! "
an appalling conviction of his helpless , hopeless peril struck a chill to <name> 's heart like the chill of death itself .
what power on earth could save him !
to <unk> the charge , he must reveal that he was a woman ; and for an <unk> woman to sit in the ducal chair was death !
at one and the same moment , he and his grim old father swooned and fell to , the ground .

the truth is , i have got my hero ( or heroine ) into such a particularly close place , that i do not see how i am ever going to get him ( or her ) out of it again  and therefore i <name> wash my hands of the whole business , and leave that person to get out the best way that offers  or else stay there .
i thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty , but it looks different now .

<name> twain
a connecticut yankee in king <name> 's court by <name> twain ( <name> l. clemens ) preface the <unk> laws and customs touched upon in this tale are historical , and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also historical .
it is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in england in the sixth century ; no , it is only pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the english and other <unk> of far later times , it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also .
one is quite justified in <unk> that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that remote time , its place was <unk> filled by a worse one .
the question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of kings is not settled in this book .
it was found too difficult .
that the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary ability , was manifest and indisputable ; that none but the deity could select that head <unk> , was also manifest and indisputable ; that the deity ought to make that selection , then , was likewise manifest and indisputable ; consequently , that he does make it , as claimed , was an unavoidable deduction .
i mean , until the author of this book encountered the <unk> , and <name> castlemaine , and some other executive heads of that kind ; these were found so difficult to work into the scheme , that it was judged better to take the other tack in this book ( which must be issued this fall ) , and then go into training and settle the question in another book .
it is , of course , a thing which ought to be settled , and i am not going to have anything particular to do next <name> anyway .
<name> twain hartford , july 21 , 1889 a connecticut yankee in king <name> 's court a word of explanation it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about .
he attracted me by three things : his candid simplicity , his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor , and the <unk> of his company  for he did all the talking .
we fell together , as modest people <name> , in the tail of the herd that was being shown through , and he at once began to say things which interested me .
as he talked along , softly , pleasantly , <unk> , he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time , and into some remote <name> and old forgotten country ; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed to move among the <unk> and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity , holding speech with a relic of it !
exactly as i would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies , or my most familiar neighbors , he spoke of sir <unk> , sir <unk> de <unk> , sir launcelot of the lake , sir <unk> , and all the other great names of the table round  and how old , old , unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on !
presently he turned to me and said , just as one might speak of the weather , or any other common matter  " you know about <unk> of souls ; do you know about <unk> of epochs  and bodies ? "
i said i had not heard of it .
he was so little interested  just as when people speak of the weather  that he did not notice whether i made him any answer or not .
there was half a moment of silence , immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the <unk> <unk> : " ancient <unk> , date of the sixth century , time of king <name> and the round table ; said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramor <name> desirous ; observe the round hole through the <unk> in the left breast ; ca n't be accounted for ; supposed to have been done with a bullet since invention of firearms  perhaps maliciously by cromwell 's soldiers . "
my acquaintance smiled  not a modern smile , but one that must have gone out of general use many , many centuries ago  and muttered apparently to himself : " wit ye well , i saw it done . "
then , after a pause , added : " i did it myself . "
by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark , he was gone .
all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms , steeped in a dream of the olden time , while the rain beat upon the windows , and the wind roared about the eaves and corners .
from time to time i dipped into old sir <name> <unk> 's enchanting book , and fed at its <name> feast of prodigies and adventures , breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete names , and dreamed again .
midnight being come at length , i read another tale , for a <unk>  this which here follows , to wit : how sir launcelot slew two giants , and made a castle free anon withal came there upon him two great giants , well armed , all save the heads , with two horrible clubs in their hands .
sir launcelot put his shield afore him , and put the stroke away of the one giant , and with his sword he <unk> his head asunder .
when his fellow saw that , he ran away as he were wood [ <unk> ] , for fear of the horrible strokes , and sir launcelot after him with all his might , and smote him on the shoulder , and <unk> him to the middle .
then sir launcelot went into the hall , and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels , and all kneeled unto him , and thanked god and him of their deliverance .
for , sir , said they , the most part of us have been here this seven year their prisoners , and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat , and we are all great <unk> born , and blessed be the time , knight , that ever thou wert born ; for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world , that <name> we bear record , and we all pray you to tell us your name , that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison .
fair damsels , he said , my name is sir launcelot du lake .
and so he departed from them and <unk> them unto god .
and then he mounted upon his horse , and rode into many strange and wild countries , and through many waters and valleys , and evil was he lodged .
and at the last by fortune him happened against a night to come to a fair <unk> , and therein he found an old <unk> that lodged him with a good-will , and there he had good cheer for him and his horse .
and when time was , his host brought him into a fair <name> over the gate to his bed .
there sir launcelot unarmed him , and set his harness by him , and went to bed , and anon he fell on sleep .
so , soon after there came one on horseback , and knocked at the gate in great haste .
and when sir launcelot heard this he rose up , and looked out at the window , and saw by the moonlight three knights come riding after that one man , and all three lashed on him at once with swords , and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended him .
truly , said sir launcelot , yonder one knight shall i help , for it were shame for me to see three knights on one , and if he be slain i am partner of his death .
and therewith he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four knights , and then sir launcelot said on high , turn you knights unto me , and leave your fighting with that knight .
and then they all three left sir <name> , and turned unto sir launcelot , and there began great battle , for they alight all three , and <unk> many strokes at sir launcelot , and assailed him on every side .
then sir <name> dressed him for to have <unk> sir launcelot .
nay , sir , said he , i <name> none of your help , therefore as ye <name> have my help let me alone with them .
sir <name> for the pleasure of the knight suffered him for to do his <name> , and so stood aside .
and then anon within six strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth .
and then they all three cried , sir knight , we yield us unto you as man of might matchless .
as to that , said sir launcelot , i <name> not take your yielding unto me , but so that ye yield you unto sir <name> the <unk> , on that covenant i <name> save your lives and else not .
fair knight , said they , that were we loath to do ; for as for sir <name> we chased him hither , and had overcome him had ye not been ; therefore , to yield us unto him it were no reason .
well , as to that , said sir launcelot , advise you well , for ye may choose whether ye <name> die or live , for an ye be <unk> , it shall be unto sir <name> .
fair knight , then they said , in saving our lives we <name> do as thou <unk> us .
then shall ye , said sir launcelot , on <unk> next coming go unto the court of king <name> , and there shall ye yield you unto <name> <unk> , and put you all three in her <name> and <name> , and say that sir <name> sent you thither to be her prisoners .
on the morn sir launcelot arose early , and left sir <name> sleeping ; and sir launcelot took sir <name> 's armor and his shield and armed him , and so he went to the stable and took his horse , and took his leave of his host , and so he departed .
then soon after arose sir <name> and missed sir launcelot ; and then he espied that he had his armor and his horse .
now by my <name> i know well that he <name> grieve some of the court of king <name> ; for on him knights <name> be bold , and deem that it is i , and that <name> beguile them ; and because of his armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace .
and then soon after departed sir <name> , and thanked his host .
as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door , and my stranger came in .
i gave him a pipe and a chair , and made him welcome .
i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky ; gave him another one ; then still another  hoping always for his story .
after a fourth <unk> , he drifted into it himself , in a quite simple and natural way : the stranger 's history i am an american .
i was born and reared in hartford , in the state of connecticut  anyway , just over the river , in the country .
so i am a yankee of the yankees  and practical ; yes , and nearly barren of sentiment , i suppose  or poetry , in other words .
my father was a blacksmith , my uncle was a horse doctor , and i was both , along at first .
then i went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade ; learned all there was to it ; learned to make everything : guns , revolvers , cannon , boilers , engines , all sorts of <unk> machinery .
why , i could make anything a body wanted  anything in the world , it did n't make any difference what ; and if there was n't any quick <unk> way to make a thing , i could invent one  and do it as easy as rolling off a log .
i became head superintendent ; had a couple of thousand men under me .
well , a man like that is a man that is full of fight  that goes without saying .
with a couple of thousand rough men under one , one has plenty of that sort of amusement .
i had , anyway .
at last i met my match , and i got my dose .
it was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules .
he laid me out with a <unk> alongside the head that made everything crack , and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor .
then the world went out in darkness , and i did n't feel anything more , and did n't know anything at all  at least for a while .
when i came to again , i was sitting under an oak tree , on the grass , with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself  nearly .
not entirely ; for there was a fellow on a horse , looking down at me  a fellow fresh out of a picture-book .
he was in old-time iron armor from head to heel , with a helmet on his head the shape of a <unk> with slits in it ; and he had a shield , and a sword , and a prodigious spear ; and his horse had armor on , too , and a steel horn projecting from his forehead , and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that <name> down all around him like a <unk> , nearly to the ground .
" fair sir , <name> ye just ? "
said this fellow .
" <name> i which ? "
" <name> ye try a passage of arms for land or <name> or for  " " what are you giving me ? "
i said .
" get along back to your circus , or i 'll report you . "
now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear , with his <unk> bent down nearly to his horse 's neck and his long spear pointed straight ahead .
i saw he meant business , so i was up the tree when he arrived .
he allowed that i was his property , the captive of his spear .
there was argument on his side  and the bulk of the advantage  so i judged it best to humor him .
we fixed up an agreement whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me .
i came down , and we started away , i walking by the side of his horse .
we marched comfortably along , through <unk> and over <name> which i could not remember to have seen before  which puzzled me and made me wonder  and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus .
so i gave up the idea of a circus , and concluded he was from an asylum .
but we never came to an asylum  so i was up a stump , as you may say .
i asked him how far we were from hartford .
he said he had never heard of the place ; which i took to be a lie , but allowed it to go at that .
at the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river ; and beyond it on a hill , a vast gray fortress , with towers and turrets , the first i had ever seen out of a picture .
" <unk> ? "
said i , pointing .
" camelot , " said he .
my stranger had been showing signs of <unk> .
he caught himself nodding , now , and smiled one of those pathetic , obsolete smiles of his , and said : " i find i ca n't go on ; but come with me , i 've got it all written out , and you can read it if you like . "
in his chamber , he said : " first , i kept a journal ; then by and by , after years , i took the journal and turned it into a book .
how long ago that was ! "
he handed me his manuscript , and pointed out the place where i should begin : " begin here  i 've already told you what goes before . "
he was steeped in drowsiness by this time .
as i went out at his door i heard him murmur sleepily : " give you good den , fair sir . "
i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure .
the first part of it  the great bulk of it  was parchment , and yellow with age .
i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a <unk> .
under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces of a <unk> which was older and <unk> still  latin words and sentences : fragments from old <unk> legends , evidently .
i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read  as follows : the tale of the lost land chapter i camelot " camelot  camelot , " said i to myself .
" i do n't seem to remember hearing of it before .
name of the asylum , likely . "
it was a soft , reposeful summer landscape , as lovely as a dream , and as lonesome as <name> .
the air was full of the smell of flowers , and the buzzing of insects , and the <unk> of birds , and there were no people , no wagons , there was no stir of life , nothing going on .
the road was mainly a winding path with <unk> in it , and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass  wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one 's hand .
presently a fair slip of a girl , about ten years old , with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders , came along .
around her head she wore a hoop of <unk> poppies .
it was as sweet an outfit as ever i saw , what there was of it .
she walked <unk> along , with a mind at rest , its peace reflected in her innocent face .
the circus man paid no attention to her ; didn't even seem to see her .
and she  she was no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of her life .
she was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows ; but when she happened to notice me , then there was a change !
up went her hands , and she was turned to stone ; her mouth dropped open , her eyes stared wide and <unk> , she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear .
and there she stood gazing , in a sort of stupefied fascination , till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view .
that she should be startled at me instead of at the other man , was too many for me ; i could n't make head or tail of it .
and that she should seem to consider me a spectacle , and totally overlook her own merits in that respect , was another puzzling thing , and a display of magnanimity , too , that was surprising in one so young .
there was food for thought here .
i moved along as one in a dream .
as we approached the town , signs of life began to appear .
at intervals we passed a wretched cabin , with a thatched roof , and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation .
there were people , too ; brawny men , with long , coarse , <unk> hair that <name> down over their faces and made them look like animals .
they and the women , as a rule , wore a coarse <unk> robe that came well below the knee , and a rude sort of <unk> , and many wore an iron collar .
the small boys and girls were always naked ; but nobody seemed to know it .
all of these people stared at me , talked about me , ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me ; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow , except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains .
in the town were some substantial <unk> houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins ; the streets were mere crooked alleys , and <unk> ; troops of dogs and <unk> children played in the sun and made life and noise ; hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about , and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and <unk> her family .
presently there was a distant blare of military music ; it came nearer , still nearer , and soon a <name> cavalcade wound into view , glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and <unk> banners and <name> <unk> and <unk> and gilded <unk> ; and through the muck and swine , and naked brats , and joyous dogs , and shabby huts , it took its gallant way , and in its wake we followed .
followed through one winding alley and then another ,  and climbing , always climbing  till at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood .
there was an exchange of bugle blasts ; then a parley from the walls , where men-at-arms , in <unk> and <unk> , marched back and forth with <unk> at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them ; and then the great gates were flung open , the drawbridge was lowered , and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches ; and we , following , soon found ourselves in a great paved court , with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides ; and all about us the dismount was going on , and much greeting and ceremony , and running to and fro , and a <name> display of moving and <unk> colors , and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion .
chapter ii king <name> 's court the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said , in an insinuating , confidential way : " friend , do me a kindness .
do you belong to the asylum , or are you just on a visit or something like that ? "
he looked me over stupidly , and said : " marry , fair sir , me <unk>  " " that <name> do , " i said ; " i reckon you are a patient . "
i moved away , <unk> , and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light .
i judged i had found one , presently ; so i <name> him aside and said in his ear : " if i could see the head keeper a minute  only just a minute  " " prithee do not let me . "
" let you what ? "
" hinder me , then , if the word please thee better .
then he went on to say he was an <unk> and could not stop to gossip , though he would like it another time ; for it would comfort his very liver to know where i got my clothes .
as he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose , and was seeking me besides , no doubt .
this was an airy slim boy in <unk> tights that made him look like a forked carrot , the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles ; and he had long yellow curls , and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear .
by his look , he was good-natured ; by his gait , he was satisfied with himself .
he was pretty enough to frame .
he arrived , looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity ; said he had come for me , and informed me that he was a <name> .
" go 'long , " i said ; " you ai n't more than a paragraph . "
it was pretty severe , but i was nettled .
however , it never <unk> him ; he did n't appear to know he was hurt .
he began to talk and laugh , in happy , thoughtless , boyish fashion , as we walked along , and made himself old friends with me at once ; asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes , but never waited for an answer  always chattered straight ahead , as if he didn't know he had asked a question and was n't expecting any reply , until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513 .
it made the cold chills creep over me !
i stopped and said , a little faintly : " maybe i did n't hear you just right .
say it again  and say it slow .
what year was it ? "
" 513 . "
" 513 !
you do n't look it !
come , my boy , i am a stranger and friendless ; be honest and honorable with me .
are you in your right mind ? "
he said he was .
" are these other people in their right minds ? "
he said they were .
" and this is n't an asylum ?
i mean , it is n't a place where they cure crazy people ? "
he said it was n't .
" well , then , " i said , " either i am a lunatic , or something just as awful has happened .
now tell me , honest and true , where am i ? "
" in king <name> 's court . "
i waited a minute , to let that idea shudder its way home , and then said : " and according to your notions , what year is it now ? "
" <unk>  nineteenth of <name> . "
i felt a mournful sinking at the heart , and muttered : " i shall never see my friends again  never , never again .
they <name> not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet . "
i seemed to believe the boy , i did n't know why .
something in me seemed to believe him  my consciousness , as you may say ; but my reason did n't .
my reason straightway began to clamor ; that was natural .
i did n't know how to go about satisfying it , because i knew that the testimony of men would n't serve  my reason would say they were lunatics , and throw out their evidence .
but all of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing , just by luck .
i knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the 21st of <name> , a.d. <unk> , <unk> , and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon .
i also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year  i.e. , 1879 .
so , if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours , i should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not .
wherefore , being a practical connecticut man , i now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come , in order that i might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment , and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made .
one thing at a time , is my motto  and just play that thing for all it is worth , even if it 's only two pair and a <name> .
i made up my mind to two things : if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunatics and could n't get away , i would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why ; and if , on the other hand , it was really the sixth century , all right , i did n't want any softer thing : i would boss the whole country inside of three months ; for i judged i would have the start of the <unk> man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward .
i 'm not a man to waste time after my mind 's made up and there 's work on hand ; so i said to the <name> : " now , <name> , my boy  if that might happen to be your name  i 'll get you to post me up a little if you do n't mind .
what is the name of that apparition that brought me here ? "
" my master and thine ?
that is the good knight and great lord sir <name> the <unk> , <name> brother to our liege the king . "
" very good ; go on , tell me everything . "
he made a long story of it ; but the part that had immediate interest for me was this : he said i was sir <name> 's prisoner , and that in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends <unk> me  unless i chanced to rot , first .
i saw that the last chance had the best show , but i did n't waste any bother about that ; time was too precious .
the <name> said , further , that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time , and that as soon as the <unk> and the heavy drinking should begin , sir <name> would have me in and exhibit me before king <name> and his illustrious knights seated at the table round , and would brag about his exploit in capturing me , and would probably exaggerate the facts a little , but it would n't be good form for me to correct him , and not over safe , either ; and when i was done being exhibited , then ho for the dungeon ; but he , <name> , would find a way to come and see me every now and then , and cheer me up , and help me get word to my friends .
get word to my friends !
i thanked him ; i could n't do less ; and about this time a <unk> came to say i was wanted ; so <name> led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me .
well , it was a curious kind of spectacle , and interesting .
it was an immense place , and rather naked  yes , and full of loud contrasts .
it was very , very lofty ; so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight ; there was a <unk> gallery at each end , high up , with musicians in the one , and women , clothed in stunning colors , in the other .
the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares , rather battered by age and use , and needing repair .
as to ornament , there was n't any , strictly speaking ; though on the walls <name> some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of <name> ; <unk> , they were , with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread ; with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holes  so that the man 's coat looks as if it had been done with a <unk> .
there was a fireplace big enough to camp in ; and its projecting sides and hood , of carved and pillared <unk> , had the look of a cathedral door .
along the walls stood men-at-arms , in breastplate and <unk> , with <unk> for their only weapon  rigid as statues ; and that is what they looked like .
in the middle of this <unk> and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the table round .
it was as large as a circus ring ; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one 's eyes to look at them .
they wore their plumed hats , right along , except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king , he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark .
mainly they were drinking  from entire ox horns ; but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones .
there was about an average of two dogs to one man ; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them , and then they went for it by brigades and divisions , with a rush , and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails , and the storm of howlings and <unk> <unk> all speech for the time ; but that was no matter , for the <unk> was always a bigger interest anyway ; the men rose , sometimes , to observe it the better and bet on it , and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their <unk> with the same object ; and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time .
in the end , the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws , and proceeded to growl over it , and gnaw it , and grease the floor with it , just as fifty others were already doing ; and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments .
as a rule , the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly ; and i noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anything  i mean in a <unk> interval .
and plainly , too , they were a childlike and innocent lot ; telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning <unk> , and ready and willing to listen to anybody <unk> lie , and believe it , too .
it was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful ; and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder .
i was not the only prisoner present .
there were twenty or more .
poor devils , many of them were maimed , hacked , carved , in a frightful way ; and their hair , their faces , their clothing , were caked with black and stiffened <unk> of blood .
they were suffering sharp physical pain , of course ; and weariness , and hunger and thirst , no doubt ; and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash , or even the poor <name> of a <unk> for their wounds ; yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan , or saw them show any sign of restlessness , or any disposition to complain .
the thought was forced upon me : " the rascals  they have served other people so in their day ; it being their own turn , now , they were not expecting any better treatment than this ; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training , intellectual fortitude , reasoning ; it is mere animal training ; they are white indians . "
chapter iii knights of the table round mainly the round table talk was <unk>  narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and <unk> killed and stripped of their steeds and armor .
as a general thing  as far as i could make out  these murderous adventures were not <unk> undertaken to avenge injuries , nor to settle old disputes or sudden <unk> out ; no , as a rule they were simply duels between strangers  duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other , and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever .
many a time i had seen a couple of boys , strangers , meet by chance , and say simultaneously , " i can lick you , " and go at it on the spot ; but i had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only , and was a sign and <name> of childhood ; but here were these big <unk> sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond .
yet there was something very engaging about these great <unk> creatures , something attractive and lovable .
there did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery , so to speak , to bait a <unk> with ; but you did n't seem to mind that , after a little , because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that , and indeed would have marred it , hindered it , spoiled its symmetry  perhaps rendered its existence impossible .
there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face ; and in some a certain <unk> and sweetness that rebuked your <unk> criticisms and stilled them .
a most <name> <unk> and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir <unk> , and likewise in the king 's also ; and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake .
there was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this sir launcelot .
at a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies , six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies ' gallery and begged the <name> of a word with the <name> .
the most conspicuously situated <name> in that massed <unk> of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent , and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon , ransom , captivity , or death , as she in her good pleasure might elect ; and this , as he said , he was doing by command of sir <name> the <unk> , whose prisoners they were , he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field .
surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house ; the <name> 's gratified smile faded out at the name of sir <name> , and she looked disappointed ; and the <name> whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision  " sir <name> , forsooth !
oh , call me pet names , dearest , call me a <name> !
in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to <unk> the fellow to this majestic lie ! "
every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir <name> .
but he was equal to the occasion .
he got up and played his hand like a <name>  and took every trick .
he said he would state the case exactly according to the facts ; he would tell the simple straightforward tale , without comment of his own ; " and then , " said he , " if ye find <name> and honor due , ye <name> give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or <unk> with sword in the ranks of <name> battle  even him that <unk> there ! "
and he pointed to sir launcelot .
ah , he fetched them ; it was a rattling good stroke .
then he went on and told how sir launcelot , seeking adventures , some brief time gone by , killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword , and set a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free ; and then went further , still seeking adventures , and found him ( sir <name> ) fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights , and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands , and conquered the nine ; and that night sir launcelot rose quietly , and dressed him in sir <name> 's armor and took sir <name> 's horse and <unk> him away into distant lands , and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another ; and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about <unk> they would ride to <name> 's court and yield them to <name> <unk> 's hands as captives of sir <name> the <unk> , spoil of his knightly prowess ; and now here were these half dozen , and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds .
well , it was touching to see the <name> blush and smile , and look embarrassed and happy , and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot that would have got him shot in arkansas , to a dead certainty .
everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot ; and as for me , i was perfectly amazed , that one man , all by himself , should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters .
i said as much to <name> ; but this mocking <unk> only said : " an sir <name> had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him , ye had seen the <unk> doubled . "
i looked at the boy in sorrow ; and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance .
i followed the direction of his eye , and saw that a very old and <unk> man , clothed in a flowing black gown , had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs , and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye .
the same suffering look that was in the <name> 's face was observable in all the faces around  the look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan .
" marry , we shall have it again , " sighed the boy ; " that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words , and that he <name> tell till he <unk> , every time he hath gotten his barrel full and <unk> his <unk> <unk> .
would god i had died or i saw this day ! "
" who is it ? "
" <name> , the mighty liar and magician , perdition <unk> him for the weariness he <unk> with his one tale !
but that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call , they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and <unk> it .
he <unk> it always in the third person , making believe he is too modest to <unk> himself  <unk> light upon him , misfortune be his dole !
good friend , prithee call me for <unk> . "
the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep .
the old man began his tale ; and presently the lad was asleep in reality ; so also were the dogs , and the court , the <unk> , and the files of men-at-arms .
the droning voice <unk> on ; a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments .
some heads were bowed upon folded arms , some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music ; the flies <unk> and bit , unmolested , the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes , and <unk> about , and made themselves at home everywhere ; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king 's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it , and <unk> the crumbs in the king 's face with naive and impudent irreverence .
it was a tranquil scene , and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit .
this was the old man 's tale .
he said : " right so the king and <name> departed , and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech .
so the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good <unk> ; so the king was there three days , and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go , and so departed .
and as they rode , <name> said , i have no sword .
no force , * [ <unk> from m.t .
: no matter . ]
said <name> , hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may .
so they rode till they came to a lake , the which was a fair water and broad , and in the midst of the lake <name> was ware of an arm clothed in white <unk> , that held a fair sword in that hand .
lo , said <name> , yonder is that sword that i spake of .
with that they saw a damsel going upon the lake .
what damsel is that ?
said <name> .
that is the <name> of the lake , said <name> ; and within that lake is a rock , and therein is as fair a place as any on earth , and richly <unk> , and this damsel <name> come to you anon , and then speak ye fair to her that she <name> give you that sword .
anon withal came the damsel unto <name> and saluted him , and he her again .
damsel , said <name> , what sword is that , that yonder the arm <unk> above the water ?
i would it were mine , for i have no sword .
sir <name> king , said the damsel , that sword is mine , and if ye <name> give me a gift when i ask it you , ye shall have it .
by my <name> , said <name> , i <name> give you what gift ye <name> ask .
well , said the damsel , go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword , and take it and the scabbard with you , and i <name> ask my gift when i see my time .
so sir <name> and <name> alight , and tied their horses to two trees , and so they went into the ship , and when they came to the sword that the hand held , sir <name> took it up by the handles , and took it with him .
and the arm and the hand went under the water ; and so they came unto the land and rode forth .
and then sir <name> saw a <name> pavilion .
what <unk> yonder pavilion ?
it is the knight 's pavilion , said <name> , that ye fought with last , sir <unk> , but he is out , he is not there ; he hath ado with a knight of yours , that <unk> <unk> , and they have fought together , but at the last <unk> fled , and else he had been dead , and he hath chased him even to <unk> , and we shall meet with him anon in the highway .
that is well said , said <name> , now have i a sword , now <name> i wage battle with him , and be avenged on him .
sir , ye shall not so , said <name> , for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing , so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him ; also , he <name> not lightly be matched of one knight living ; and therefore it is my counsel , let him pass , for he shall do you good service in short time , and his sons , after his days .
also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed .
when i see him , i <name> do as ye advise me , said <name> .
then sir <name> looked on the sword , and liked it passing well .
whether <unk> you better , said <name> , the sword or the scabbard ?
me <unk> better the sword , said <name> .
ye are more unwise , said <name> , for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword , for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood , be ye never so sore wounded ; therefore , keep well the scabbard always with you .
so they rode into <unk> , and by the way they met with sir <unk> ; but <name> had done such a craft that <unk> saw not <name> , and he passed by without any words .
i <name> , said <name> , that the knight would not speak .
sir , said <name> , he saw you not ; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed .
so they came unto <unk> , whereof his knights were passing glad .
and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would <unk> his person so alone .
but all men of worship said it was <name> to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did . "
chapter iv sir <unk> the humorist it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told ; but then i had heard it only once , and that makes a difference ; it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh , no doubt .
sir <unk> the humorist was the first to awake , and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality .
he tied some metal <unk> to a dog 's tail and turned him loose , and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright , with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil ; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed , and some fell out of their chairs and <unk> on the floor in ecstasy .
it was just like so many children .
sir <unk> was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again , to weariness , how the immortal idea happened to occur to him ; and as is the way with <unk> of his breed , he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through .
he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech  of course a humorous speech .
i think i never heard so many old <unk> jokes strung together in my life .
he was worse than the minstrels , worse than the clown in the circus .
it seemed peculiarly sad to sit here , thirteen hundred years before i was born , and listen again to poor , flat , <unk> jokes that had given me the dry <unk> when i was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards .
it about convinced me that there is n't any such thing as a new joke possible .
everybody laughed at these antiquities  but then they always do ; i had noticed that , centuries later .
however , of course the <unk> did n't laugh  i mean the boy .
no , he scoffed ; there was n't anything he would n't scoff at .
he said the most of sir <unk> 's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified .
i said " petrified " was good ; as i believed , myself , that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by <unk> periods .
but that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place , for geology had n't been invented yet .
however , i made a note of the remark , and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through .
it is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market is n't ripe yet .
now sir <name> arose and began to fire up on his <unk> with me for fuel .
it was time for me to feel serious , and i did .
sir <name> told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians , who all wore the same ridiculous garb that i did  a garb that was a work of enchantment , and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands .
however he had <unk> the force of the enchantment by prayer , and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours ' battle , and taken me prisoner , sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court .
he spoke of me all the time , in the <unk> way , as " this prodigious giant , " and " this horrible <unk> monster , " and " this <unk> and <unk> <unk> ogre " , and everybody took in all this bosh in the <unk> way , and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me .
he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top of a tree two hundred <unk> high at a single bound , but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow , which " <unk> <unk> " the most of my bones , and then swore me to appear at <name> 's court for sentence .
he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st ; and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date .
i was in a dismal state by this time ; indeed , i was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how i had better be killed , the possibility of the killing being doubted by some , because of the enchantment in my clothes .
and yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of <unk> <unk> .
still , i was sane enough to notice this detail , to wit : many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a comanche blush .
<unk> is too mild a term to convey the idea .
however , i had read " <name> jones , " and " <name> random , " and other books of that kind , and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk , and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies , clear up to a hundred years ago ; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century  in which century , broadly speaking , the earliest samples of the real <name> and real gentleman discoverable in english history  or in european history , for that matter  may be said to have made their appearance .
suppose sir <name> , instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters , had allowed the characters to speak for themselves ?
we should have had talk from <name> and <unk> and the soft <name> <name> which would embarrass a tramp in our day .
however , to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate .
king <unk> people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence of mind enough not to mention it .
they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved , at last , when old <name> swept the difficulty away for them with a common-sense hint .
he asked them why they were so dull  why did n't it occur to them to strip me .
in half a minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs !
and dear , dear , to think of it : i was the only embarrassed person there .
everybody discussed me ; and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage .
<name> <unk> was as naively interested as the rest , and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before .
it was the only compliment i got  if it was a compliment .
finally i was carried off in one direction , and my perilous clothes in another .
i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon , with some scant remnants for dinner , some <unk> straw for a bed , and no end of rats for company .
chapter v an inspiration i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long .
when i next came to myself , i seemed to have been asleep a very long time .
my first thought was , " well , what an astonishing dream i 've had !
i reckon i 've waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something ... .
i 'll nap again till the whistle blows , and then i 'll go down to the arms factory and have it out with hercules . "
but just then i heard the harsh music of <name> chains and bolts , a light flashed in my eyes , and that butterfly , <name> , stood before me !
i gasped with surprise ; my breath almost got away from me .
" what ! "
i said , " you here yet ?
go along with the rest of the dream !
scatter ! "
but he only laughed , in his light-hearted way , and fell to making fun of my sorry plight .
" all right , " i said resignedly , " let the dream go on ; i 'm in no hurry . "
" prithee what dream ? "
" what dream ?
why , the dream that i am in <name> 's court  a person who never existed ; and that i am talking to you , who are nothing but a work of the imagination . "
" oh , la , indeed !
and is it a dream that you 're to be burned to-morrow ?
<unk>  answer me that ! "
the shock that went through me was distressing .
i now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious , dream or no dream ; for i knew by past experience of the <unk> intensity of dreams , that to be burned to death , even in a dream , would be very far from being a jest , and was a thing to be avoided , by any means , fair or foul , that i could contrive .
so i said <unk> : " ah , <name> , good boy , only friend i 've got ,  for you are my friend , are n't you ?  do n't fail me ; help me to devise some way of escaping from this place ! "
" now do but hear thyself !
escape ?
why , man , the corridors are in guard and keep of men-at-arms . "
" no doubt , no doubt .
but how many , <name> ?
not many , i <name> ? "
" full a score .
one may not <name> to escape . "
after a pause  hesitatingly : " and there be other reasons  and <unk> . "
" other ones ?
what are they ? "
" well , they say  oh , but i dare n't , indeed dare n't ! "
" why , poor lad , what is the matter ?
why do you <unk> ?
why do you tremble so ? "
" oh , in sooth , there is need !
i do want to tell you , but  " " come , come , be brave , be a man  speak out , there 's a good lad ! "
he hesitated , pulled one way by <name> , the other way by fear ; then he stole to the door and peeped out , listening ; and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper , and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death .
" <name> , in his malice , has woven a spell about this dungeon , and there <unk> not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you !
now god pity me , i have told it !
ah , be kind to me , be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well ; for an thou betray me i am lost ! "
i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time ; and shouted : " <name> has wrought a spell !
<name> , forsooth !
that cheap old humbug , that <unk> old ass ?
bosh , pure bosh , the <unk> bosh in the world !
why , it does seem to me that of all the childish , idiotic , <unk> , <unk> superstitions that <unk>  oh , damn <name> ! "
but <name> had <unk> to his knees before i had half finished , and he was like to go out of his mind with fright .
" oh , beware !
these are awful words !
any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things .
oh call them back before it is too late ! "
now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking .
if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of <name> 's pretended magic as <name> was , certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things .
i went on thinking , and worked out a plan .
then i said : " get up .
pull yourself together ; look me in the eye .
do you know why i laughed ? "
" no  but for our blessed <name> 's sake , do it no more . "
" well , i 'll tell you why i laughed .
because i 'm a magician myself . "
" thou ! "
the boy recoiled a step , and caught his breath , for the thing hit him rather sudden ; but the aspect which he took on was very , very respectful .
i took quick note of that ; it indicated that a humbug did n't need to have a reputation in this asylum ; people stood ready to take him at his word , without that .
i resumed .
" i 've known <name> seven hundred years , and he  " " seven hun  " " do n't interrupt me .
he has died and come alive again thirteen times , and traveled under a new name every time : smith , jones , robinson , <name> , peters , <unk> , <name>  a new alias every time he turns up .
i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago ; i knew him in <name> five hundred years ago  he is always <unk> around in my way , everywhere i go ; he makes me tired .
he don't amount to shucks , as a magician ; knows some of the old common tricks , but has never got beyond the rudiments , and never <name> .
he is well enough for the provinces  <unk> stands and that sort of thing , you know  but dear me , he ought n't to set up for an expert  anyway not where there 's a real artist .
now look here , <name> , i am going to stand your friend , right along , and in return you must be mine .
i want you to do me a favor .
i want you to get word to the king that i am a magician myself  and the supreme grand <unk> and head of the tribe , at that ; and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that <name> make the fur fly in these realms if sir <name> 's project is carried out and any harm comes to me .
<name> you get that to the king for me ? "
the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me .
it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified , so unnerved , so demoralized .
but he promised everything ; and on my side he made me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend , and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him .
then he worked his way out , staying himself with his hand along the wall , like a sick person .
presently this thought occurred to me : how heedless i have been !
when the boy gets calm , he <name> wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place ; he <name> put this and that together , and <name> see that i am a humbug .
i worried over that heedless blunder for an hour , and called myself a great many hard names , meantime .
but finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals did n't reason ; that they never put this and that together ; that all their talk showed that they did n't know a discrepancy when they saw it .
i was at rest , then .
but as soon as one is at rest , in this world , off he goes on something else to worry about .
it occurred to me that i had made another blunder : i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat  i intending to invent a calamity at my leisure ; now the people who are the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to swallow miracles are the very ones who are <unk> to see you perform them ; suppose i should be called on for a sample ?
suppose i should be asked to name my calamity ?
yes , i had made a blunder ; i ought to have invented my calamity first .
" what shall i do ?
what can i say , to gain a little time ? "
i was in trouble again ; in the deepest kind of trouble ... " there 's a footstep !  they 're coming .
if i had only just a moment to think ... . good , i 've got it .
i 'm all right . "
you see , it was the eclipse .
it came into my mind in the <name> of time , how <name> , or <name> , or one of those people , played an eclipse as a saving trump once , on some savages , and i saw my chance .
i could play it myself , now , and it would n't be any plagiarism , either , because i should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties .
<name> came in , subdued , distressed , and said : " i <unk> the message to our liege the king , and straightway he had me to his presence .
he was <unk> even to the marrow , and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement , and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great ; but then came <name> and spoiled all ; for he persuaded the king that you are mad , and know not whereof you speak ; and said your threat is but foolishness and idle <unk> .
they disputed long , but in the end , <name> , <unk> , said , <unk> hath he not named his brave calamity ?
verily it is because he can not . '
this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king's mouth , and he could offer naught to turn the argument ; and so , reluctant , and full loth to do you the discourtesy , he yet <unk> you to consider his perplexed case , as noting how the matter stands , and name the calamity  if so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming .
oh , prithee delay not ; to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about .
oh , be thou wise  name the calamity ! "
i allowed silence to accumulate while i got my impressiveness together , and then said : " how long have i been shut up in this hole ? "
" ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent .
it is 9 of the morning now . "
" no !
then i have slept well , sure enough .
nine in the morning now !
and yet it is the very complexion of midnight , to a shade .
this is the 20th , then ? "
" the 20th  yes . "
" and i am to be burned alive to-morrow . "
the boy shuddered .
" at what hour ? "
" at high noon . "
" now then , i <name> tell you what to say . "
i paused , and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence ; then , in a voice deep , measured , charged with doom , i began , and rose by dramatically <unk> stages to my colossal climax , which i delivered in as sublime and <name> a way as ever i did such a thing in my life : " go back and tell the king that at that hour i <name> smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight ; i <name> blot out the sun , and he shall never shine again ; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth , and the peoples of the earth shall <unk> and die , to the last man ! "
i had to <name> the boy out myself , he sunk into such a collapse .
i handed him over to the soldiers , and went back .
chapter <name> the eclipse in the stillness and the darkness , realization soon began to supplement knowledge .
the mere knowledge of a fact is pale ; but when you come to realize your fact , it takes on color .
it is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart , and seeing it done .
in the stillness and the darkness , the knowledge that i was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time ; a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold .
but it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these , as soon as a man 's mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion , and he <unk> .
<name> springs up , and cheerfulness along with it , and then he is in good shape to do something for himself , if anything can be done .
when my rally came , it came with a bound .
i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me , and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides ; and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube , and my <unk> all vanished .
i was as happy a man as there was in the world .
i was even impatient for to-morrow to come , i so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation 's wonder and reverence .
besides , in a business way it would be the making of me ; i knew that .
meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind .
that was the <unk> that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people , it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise .
so , by and by when i heard footsteps coming , that thought was recalled to me , and i said to myself , " as sure as anything , it 's the compromise .
well , if it is good , all right , i <name> accept ; but if it is n't , i mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth . "
the door opened , and some men-at-arms appeared .
the leader said : " the stake is ready .
come ! "
the stake !
the strength went out of me , and i almost fell down .
it is hard to get one 's breath at such a time , such lumps come into one 's throat , and such <unk> ; but as soon as i could speak , i said : " but this is a mistake  the execution is to-morrow . "
" order changed ; been set forward a day .
haste thee ! "
i was lost .
there was no help for me .
i was dazed , stupefied ; i had no command over myself , i only wandered purposely about , like one out of his mind ; so the soldiers took hold of me , and pulled me along with them , out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors , and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world .
as we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle i got a shock ; for the first thing i saw was the stake , standing in the center , and near it the piled fagots and a monk .
on all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank , forming sloping terraces that were <name> with color .
the king and the <name> sat in their thrones , the most conspicuous figures there , of course .
to note all this , occupied but a second .
the next second <name> had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear , his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness .
he said : " tis through me the change was wrought !
and main hard have i worked to do it , too .
but when i revealed to them the calamity in store , and saw how mighty was the terror it did <unk> , then saw i also that this was the time to strike !
wherefore i diligently pretended , unto this and that and the other one , that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow ; and so if any would save the sun and the world , you must be slain to-day , while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack <unk> .
<unk> , it was but a dull lie , a most indifferent invention , but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it , in the frenzy of their fright , as it were salvation sent from heaven ; and all the while was i laughing in my sleeve the one moment , to see them so cheaply deceived , and <unk> god the next , that he was content to let the meanest of his creatures be his instrument to the saving of thy life .
ah how happy has the matter sped !
you <name> not need to do the sun a real hurt  ah , forget not that , on your soul forget it not !
only make a little darkness  only the littlest little darkness , mind , and cease with that .
it <name> be sufficient .
they <name> see that i spoke falsely ,  being ignorant , as they <name> fancy  and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear ; and they <name> set you free and make you great !
go to thy triumph , now !
but remember  ah , good friend , i implore thee remember my supplication , and do the blessed sun no hurt .
for my sake , thy true friend . "
i choked out some words through my grief and misery ; as much as to say i would spare the sun ; for which the lad 's eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death .
as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if i had been blindfold i should have supposed i was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people .
there was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity ; they were as rigid as stone images , and as pale ; and dread sat upon every countenance .
this hush continued while i was being chained to the stake ; it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles , my knees , my thighs , my body .
then there was a pause , and a deeper hush , if possible , and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch ; the multitude strained forward , gazing , and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it ; the monk raised his hands above my head , and his eyes toward the blue sky , and began some words in latin ; in this attitude he <unk> on and on , a little while , and then stopped .
i waited two or three moments ; then looked up ; he was standing there petrified .
with a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky .
i followed their eyes , as sure as guns , there was my eclipse beginning !
the life went boiling through my veins ; i was a new man !
the rim of black spread slowly into the sun 's disk , my heart beat higher and higher , and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky , motionless .
i knew that this gaze would be turned upon me , next .
when it was , i was ready .
i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck , with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun .
it was a <name> effect .
you could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave .
two shouts rang out , one close upon the heels of the other : " apply the torch ! "
" i forbid it ! "
the one was from <name> , the other from the king .
<name> started from his place  to apply the torch himself , i judged .
i said : " stay where you are .
if any man moves  even the king  before i give him leave , i <name> blast him with thunder , i <name> consume him with lightnings ! "
the multitude sank meekly into their seats , and i was just expecting they would .
<name> hesitated a moment or two , and i was on pins and needles during that little while .
then he sat down , and i took a good breath ; for i knew i was master of the situation now .
the king said : " be merciful , fair sir , and essay no further in this perilous matter , lest disaster follow .
it was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow ; but  " " your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie ?
it was a lie . "
that made an immense effect ; up went appealing hands everywhere , and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that i might be bought off at any price , and the calamity stayed .
the king was eager to comply .
he said : " name any terms , reverend sir , even to the <unk> of my kingdom ; but banish this calamity , spare the sun ! "
my fortune was made .
i would have taken him up in a minute , but i could n't stop an eclipse ; the thing was out of the question .
so i asked time to consider .
the king said : " how long  ah , how long , good sir ?
be merciful ; look , it <unk> darker , moment by moment .
prithee how long ? "
" not long .
half an hour  maybe an hour . "
there were a thousand pathetic protests , but i could n't shorten up any , for i could n't remember how long a total eclipse lasts .
i was in a puzzled condition , anyway , and wanted to think .
something was wrong about that eclipse , and the fact was very <unk> .
if this was n't the one i was after , how was i to tell whether this was the sixth century , or nothing but a dream ?
dear me , if i could only prove it was the latter !
here was a glad new <name> .
if the boy was right about the date , and this was surely the 20th , it wasn't the sixth century .
i reached for the monk 's sleeve , in considerable excitement , and asked him what day of the month it was .
<name> him , he said it was the <unk> !
it made me turn cold to hear him .
i begged him not to make any mistake about it ; but he was sure ; he knew it was the 21st .
so , that <unk> boy had <unk> things again !
the time of the day was right for the eclipse ; i had seen that for myself , in the beginning , by the dial that was near by .
yes , i was in king <name> 's court , and i might as well make the most out of it i could .
the darkness was steadily growing , the people becoming more and more distressed .
i now said : " i have reflected , sir king .
for a lesson , i <name> let this darkness proceed , and spread night in the world ; but whether i blot out the sun for good , or restore it , shall rest with you .
these are the terms , to wit : you shall remain king over all your dominions , and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship ; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive , and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state .
if i ca n't live on that , i sha'n't ask anybody to give me a lift .
is it satisfactory ? "
there was a prodigious roar of applause , and out of the midst of it the king 's voice rose , saying : " away with his bonds , and set him free !
and do him homage , high and low , <name> and poor , for he is become the king 's right hand , is clothed with power and authority , and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne !
now sweep away this creeping night , and bring the light and cheer again , that all the world may bless thee . "
but i said : " that a common man should be shamed before the world , is nothing ; but it were dishonor to the king if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame .
if i might ask that my clothes be brought again  " " they are not meet , " the king broke in .
" fetch raiment of another sort ; clothe him like a <name> ! "
my idea worked .
i wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total , otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness , and of course i could n't do it .
sending for the clothes gained some delay , but not enough .
so i had to make another excuse .
i said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement ; therefore i would let the darkness grow a while , and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same , the darkness should be dismissed .
neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement , but i had to stick to my point .
it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker , while i struggled with those awkward <unk> clothes .
it got to be pitch dark , at last , and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky .
at last the eclipse was total , and i was very glad of it , but everybody else was in misery ; which was quite natural .
i said : " the king , by his silence , still stands to the terms . "
then i lifted up my hands  stood just so a moment  then i said , with the most awful solemnity : " let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away ! "
there was no response , for a moment , in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush .
but when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out , a moment or two later , the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude ; and <name> was not the last of the wash , to be sure .
chapter vii <name> 's tower inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom , as far as political power and authority were concerned , much was made of me .
my raiment was of silks and <unk> and cloth of gold , and by consequence was very showy , also uncomfortable .
but habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes ; i was aware of that .
i was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle , after the king 's .
they were aglow with <unk> silken hangings , but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet , and they were <unk> rushes at that , being not all of one breed .
as for conveniences , properly speaking , there were n't any .
i mean little conveniences ; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life .
the big oaken chairs , graced with rude carvings , were well enough , but that was the stopping place .
there was no soap , no matches , no looking-glass  except a metal one , about as powerful as a pail of water .
and not a chromo .
i had been used to <unk> for years , and i saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for <name> had got worked into the fabric of my being , and was become a part of me .
it made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in east hartford , all unpretending as it was , you could n't go into a room but you would find an <unk> , or at least a <unk> <unk> over the door ; and in the parlor we had nine .
but here , even in my grand room of state , there was n't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a <unk> , which was either woven or knitted ( it had darned places in it ) , and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape ; and as for proportions , even <name> himself could n't have <unk> them more <unk> , after all his practice on those <unk> they call his " celebrated hampton court <unk> . "
<name> was a bird .
we had several of his <unk> ; one was his " miraculous draught of fishes , " where he puts in a miracle of his own  puts three men into a canoe which would n't have held a dog without upsetting .
i always admired to study r. 's <name> , it was so fresh and <unk> .
there was n't even a <name> or a <unk> in the castle .
i had a great many servants , and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom ; and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him .
there was no gas , there were no candles ; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light .
a lot of these <name> along the walls and modified the dark , just <unk> it down enough to make it dismal .
if you went out at night , your servants carried torches .
there were no books , pens , paper or ink , and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows .
it is a little thing  glass is  until it is absent , then it becomes a big thing .
but perhaps the worst of all was , that there wasn't any sugar , coffee , tea , or tobacco .
i saw that i was just another robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island , with no society but some more or less tame animals , and if i wanted to make life <unk> i must do as he did  invent , contrive , create , <unk> things ; set <name> and hand to work , and keep them busy .
well , that was in my line .
one thing troubled me along at first  the immense interest which people took in me .
apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me .
it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british world almost to death ; that while it lasted the whole country , from one end to the other , was in a pitiable state of panic , and the churches , <unk> , and <unk> overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come .
then had followed the news that the <unk> of this awful event was a stranger , a mighty magician at <name> 's court ; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle , and was just going to do it when his <name> was purchased , and he then dissolved his enchantments , and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction .
now if you consider that everybody believed that , and not only believed it , but never even dreamed of doubting it , you <name> easily understand that there was not a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me .
of course i was all the talk  all other subjects were dropped ; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety .
within twenty-four hours the <unk> began to arrive , and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming .
the village was crowded , and all the countryside .
i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes .
it came to be a great burden , as to time and trouble , but of course it was at the same time <unk> agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage .
it turned <unk> <name> green with envy and spite , which was a great satisfaction to me .
but there was one thing i couldn't understand  nobody had asked for an autograph .
i spoke to <name> about it .
by <name> !
i had to explain to him what it was .
then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests .
land !
think of that .
there was another thing that troubled me a little .
those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle .
that was natural .
to be able to <name> back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun , riding in the heavens , and be obeyed , would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors , and envied by them all ; but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselves  why , people would come a distance to see them .
the pressure got to be pretty strong .
there was going to be an eclipse of the moon , and i knew the date and hour , but it was too far away .
two years .
i would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it .
it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so , and come lagging along at a time when a body would n't have any use for it , as like as not .
if it had been booked for only a month away , i could have sold it short ; but , as matters stood , i couldn't seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good , so i gave up trying .
next , <name> found that old <name> was making himself busy on the sly among those people .
he was spreading a report that i was a humbug , and that the reason i did n't accommodate the people with a miracle was because i could n't .
i saw that i must do something .
i presently thought out a plan .
by my authority as executive i threw <name> into prison  the same cell i had occupied myself .
then i gave public notice by herald and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight , but about the end of that time i would take a moment's leisure and blow up <name> 's stone tower by fires from heaven ; in the meantime , whoso listened to evil reports about me , let him beware .
furthermore , i would perform but this one miracle at this time , and no more ; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured , i would turn the <unk> into horses , and make them useful .
quiet ensued .
i took <name> into my confidence , to a certain degree , and we went to work privately .
i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation , and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody .
that made his mouth safe enough .
<unk> we made a few bushels of first-rate blasting powder , and i superintended my <unk> while they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires .
this old stone tower was very massive  and rather ruinous , too , for it was <name> , and four hundred years old .
yes , and handsome , after a rude fashion , and clothed with <name> from base to summit , as with a shirt of scale mail .
it stood on a lonely eminence , in good view from the castle , and about half a mile away .
working by night , we stowed the powder in the tower  dug stones out , on the inside , and buried the powder in the walls themselves , which were fifteen feet thick at the base .
we put in a peck at a time , in a dozen places .
we could have blown up the tower of london with these charges .
when the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightning-rod , bedded it in one of the <unk> of powder , and ran wires from it to the other <unk> .
everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation , but on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people , through the heralds , to keep clear away  a quarter of a mile away .
then added , by command , that at some time during the twenty-four hours i would consummate the miracle , but would first give a brief notice ; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime , by <unk> in the same places if at night .
<unk> had been tolerably frequent of late , and i was not much afraid of a failure ; still , i should n't have cared for a delay of a day or two ; i should have explained that i was busy with affairs of state yet , and the people must wait .
of course , we had a blazing <name> day  almost the first one without a cloud for three weeks ; things always happen so .
i kept secluded , and watched the weather .
<name> dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time , and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements .
at last the wind sprang up and a cloud appeared  in the right quarter , too , and just at nightfall .
for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread and <unk> , then i judged it was time for me to appear .
i ordered the <unk> to be lit , and <name> liberated and sent to me .
a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward <name> 's tower .
already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far ; these people and the old turrets , being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great <unk> overhead , made a good deal of a picture .
<name> arrived in a gloomy mood .
i said : " you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm , and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation .
therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up your tower , but it is only fair to give you a chance ; now if you think you can break my enchantments and <name> off the fires , step to the bat , it 's your innings . "
" i can , fair sir , and i <name> .
doubt it not . "
he <name> an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof , and burnt a pinch of powder in it , which sent up a small cloud of <unk> smoke , whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable .
then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands .
he worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy , and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill .
by this time the storm had about reached us ; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows <unk> about , the first heavy drops of rain were falling , the world abroad was black as pitch , the lightning began to wink fitfully .
of course , my <name> would be loading itself now .
in fact , things were imminent .
so i said : " you have had time enough .
i have given you every advantage , and not interfered .
it is plain your magic is weak .
it is only fair that i begin now . "
i made about three passes in the air , and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks , along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday , and showed a thousand acres of human beings <unk> on the ground in a general collapse of consternation .
well , it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week .
this was the report ; but probably the facts would have modified it .
it was an effective miracle .
the great <unk> temporary population vanished .
there were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning , but they were all outward bound .
if i had advertised another miracle i could n't have raised an audience with a sheriff .
<name> 's stock was flat .
the king wanted to stop his wages ; he even wanted to banish him , but i interfered .
i said he would be useful to work the weather , and attend to small matters like that , and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little <unk> <unk> on him .
there was n't a rag of his tower left , but i had the government rebuild it for him , and advised him to take boarders ; but he was too high-toned for that .
and as for being grateful , he never even said thank you .
he was a rather hard lot , take him how you might ; but then you could n't fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so .
chapter viii the boss to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing ; but to have the <unk> world consent to it is a finer .
the tower episode solidified my power , and made it impregnable .
if any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that , they experienced a change of heart , now .
there was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters .
i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances .
for a time , i used to wake up , mornings , and smile at my " dream , " and listen for the colt 's factory whistle ; but that sort of thing played itself out , gradually , and at last i was fully able to realize that i was actually living in the sixth century , and in <unk> court , not a lunatic asylum .
after that , i was just as much at home in that century as i could have been in any other ; and as for preference , i would n't have traded it for the twentieth .
look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge , brains , pluck , and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country .
the grandest field that ever was ; and all my own ; not a competitor ; not a man who was n't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities ; whereas , what would i amount to in the twentieth century ?
i should be foreman of a factory , that is about all ; and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself .
what a jump i had made !
i could n't keep from thinking about it , and contemplating it , just as one does who has struck oil .
there was nothing back of me that could approach it , unless it might be <name> 's case ; and <name> 's only approached it , it did n't equal it , quite .
for it stands to reason that as <name> 's splendid financial <unk> <unk> nobody but the king , the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of <unk> , whereas i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun , and was popular by reason of it .
i was no shadow of a king ; i was the substance ; the king himself was the shadow .
my power was colossal ; and it was not a mere name , as such things have generally been , it was the genuine article .
i stood here , at the very spring and source of the second great period of the world 's history ; and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and <unk> , and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries ; and i could note the <unk> of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones : de <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <name> , and <name> the second 's <unk> <unk> ; but nowhere in the procession was my full-sized fellow visible .
i was a unique ; and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half , for sure .
yes , in power i was equal to the king .
at the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together .
that was the church .
i do not wish to disguise that fact .
i could n't , if i wanted to .
but never mind about that , now ; it <name> show up , in its proper place , later on .
it did n't cause me any trouble in the beginning  at least any of consequence .
well , it was a curious country , and full of interest .
and the people !
they were the <unk> and simplest and <unk> race ; why , they were nothing but rabbits .
it was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty <unk> of loyalty toward their king and church and nobility ; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and church and <name> than a slave has to love and honor the lash , or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him !
why , dear me , any kind of royalty , howsoever modified , any kind of aristocracy , howsoever <unk> , is rightly an insult ; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself , and do n't believe it when somebody else tells you .
it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason , and the <unk> people that have always figured as its <unk>  a company of monarchs and nobles who , as a rule , would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left , like their betters , to their own exertions .
the most of king <name> 's british nation were slaves , pure and simple , and bore that name , and wore the iron collar on their necks ; and the rest were slaves in fact , but without the name ; they imagined themselves men and freemen , and called themselves so .
the truth was , the nation as a body was in the world for one object , and one only : to <unk> before king and church and <name> ; to slave for them , sweat blood for them , starve that they might be fed , work that they might play , drink misery to the <unk> that they might be happy , go naked that they might wear silks and jewels , pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them , be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and <unk> of <unk> that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world .
and for all this , the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt ; and so <unk> were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor .
inherited ideas are a curious thing , and interesting to observe and examine .
i had mine , the king and his people had theirs .
in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit , and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands .
for instance , those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree , whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or had n't , were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals , bugs , insects ; whereas i had inherited the idea that human <unk> who can consent to masquerade in the <unk> of inherited dignities and <unk> titles , are of no good but to be laughed at .
the way i was looked upon was odd , but it was natural .
you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie : well , that is the idea .
they are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength ; they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers ; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him .
but does that make him one of them ?
no ; the <unk> tramp in the pit would smile at the idea .
he could n't comprehend it ; could n't take it in ; couldn't in any remote way conceive of it .
well , to the king , the nobles , and all the nation , down to the very slaves and tramps , i was just that kind of an elephant , and nothing more .
i was admired , also feared ; but it was as an animal is admired and feared .
the animal is not <unk> , neither was i ; i was not even respected .
i had no pedigree , no inherited title ; so in the king's and nobles ' eyes i was mere dirt ; the people regarded me with wonder and awe , but there was no reverence mixed with it ; through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship .
there you see the hand of that awful power , the <name> catholic church .
in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms .
before the day of the <unk> supremacy in the world , men were men , and held their heads up , and had a man 's pride and spirit and independence ; and what of greatness and position a person got , he got mainly by achievement , not by birth .
but then the church came to the front , with an axe to grind ; and she was wise , subtle , and knew more than one way to skin a cat  or a nation ; she invented " divine right of kings , " and propped it all around , brick by brick , with the <unk>  <unk> them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one ; she preached ( to the commoner ) humility , obedience to superiors , the beauty of self-sacrifice ; she preached ( to the commoner ) meekness under insult ; preached ( still to the commoner , always to the commoner ) <name> , meanness of spirit , <unk> under oppression ; and she introduced <unk> ranks and <unk> , and taught all the <name> populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them .
even down to my <unk> that poison was still in the blood of christendom , and the best of english <unk> was still content to see his <unk> <unk> continuing to hold a number of positions , such as <unk> and the throne , to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire ; in fact , he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things , he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it .
it seems to show that there isn't anything you ca n't stand , if you are only born and bred to it .
of course that taint , that reverence for rank and title , had been in our american blood , too  i know that ; but when i left <name> it had disappeared  at least to all intents and purposes .
the remnant of it was restricted to the <unk> and <unk> .
when a disease has worked its way down to that level , it may fairly be said to be out of the system .
but to return to my anomalous position in king <name> 's kingdom .
here i was , a giant among <unk> , a man among children , a master intelligence among intellectual moles : by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole british world ; and yet there and then , just as in the remote england of my <unk> , the <unk> <name> who could claim long descent from a king 's <unk> , acquired at second-hand from the slums of london , was a better man than i was .
such a personage was fawned upon in <name> 's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody , even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence , and his morals as base as his lineage .
there were times when he could sit down in the king 's presence , but i could n't .
i could have got a title easily enough , and that would have raised me a large step in everybody 's eyes ; even in the king 's , the giver of it .
but i did n't ask for it ; and i declined it when it was offered .
i could n't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions ; and it would n't have been fair , anyway , because as far back as i could go , our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister .
i could n't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and <unk> over any title except one that should come from the nation itself , the only legitimate source ; and such an one i hoped to win ; and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor , i did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride .
this title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith , one day , in a village , was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote ; in ten days it had swept the kingdom , and was become as familiar as the king 's name .
i was never known by any other designation afterward , whether in the nation 's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the <unk> of the sovereign .
this title , translated into modern speech , would be the boss .
elected by the nation .
that suited me .
and it was a pretty high title .
there were very few the 's , and i was one of them .
if you spoke of the duke , or the <name> , or the bishop , how could anybody tell which one you meant ?
but if you spoke of the king or the <name> or the boss , it was different .
well , i liked the king , and as king i respected him  respected the office ; at least respected it as much as i was capable of respecting any <unk> supremacy ; but as men i looked down upon him and his nobles  privately .
and he and they liked me , and respected my office ; but as an animal , without birth or sham title , they looked down upon me  and were not particularly private about it , either .
i did n't charge for my opinion about them , and they didn't charge for their opinion about me : the account was square , the books balanced , everybody was satisfied .
chapter ix the tournament they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot ; and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human <unk> they were , too , but just a little wearisome to the practical mind .
however , i was generally on hand  for two reasons : a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be liked  especially as a statesman ; and both as business man and statesman i wanted to study the tournament and see if i could n't invent an improvement on it .
that reminds me to remark , in passing , that the very first official thing i did , in my administration  and it was on the very first day of it , too  was to start a patent office ; for i knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab , and could n't travel any way but sideways or <unk> .
things ran along , a tournament nearly every week ; and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand  i mean sir launcelot and the rest  but i said i would by and by ; no hurry yet , and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going .
we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week , and as many as five hundred knights took part in it , from first to last .
they were weeks gathering .
they came on horseback from everywhere ; from the very ends of the country , and even from beyond the sea ; and many brought ladies , and all brought squires and troops of servants .
it was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd , as to <unk> , and very characteristic of the country and the time , in the way of high animal spirits , innocent <unk> of language , and <unk> indifference to morals .
it was fight or look on , all day and every day ; and sing , gamble , dance , <unk> half the night every night .
they had a most <name> good time .
you never saw such people .
those banks of beautiful ladies , shining in their barbaric splendors , would see a knight <unk> from his horse in the lists with a <unk> the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting , and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view ; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief , and look ostentatiously broken-hearted , and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public had n't found it out .
the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily , but i did n't mind it in the present circumstances , because it kept me from hearing the <unk> <unk> legs and arms from the day's cripples .
they ruined an uncommon good old <unk> saw for me , and broke the <unk> , too , but i let it pass .
and as for my axe  well , i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe to a surgeon i would pick my century .
i not only watched this tournament from day to day , but detailed an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and agriculture , and ordered him to report it ; for it was my purpose by and by , when i should have gotten the people along far enough , to start a newspaper .
the first thing you want in a new country , is a patent office ; then work up your school system ; and after that , out with your paper .
a newspaper has its faults , and plenty of them , but no matter , it 's hark from the tomb for a dead nation , and don't you forget it .
you ca n't <unk> a dead nation without it ; there is n't any way .
so i wanted to sample things , and be finding out what sort of <unk> i might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when i should come to need it .
well , the priest did very well , considering .
he got in all the details , and that is a good thing in a local item : you see , he had kept books for the <unk> of his church when he was younger , and there , you know , the money 's in the details ; the more details , the more swag : bearers , <unk> , candles , prayers  everything counts ; and if the bereaved do n't buy prayers enough you <name> up your candles with a forked pencil , and your <name> shows up all right .
and he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertise  no , i mean a knight that had influence ; and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration , for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles .
of course this novice 's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description , and therefore wanted the true ring ; but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple , and full of the <unk> and <unk> of the time , and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks .
here is an extract from it : then sir <name> de <name> isles and <unk> <unk> , knights of the castle , encountered with sir <unk> and sir <unk> , and sir <unk> smote down sir <unk> <unk> to the earth .
then came sir <unk> of the <unk> tower , and sir <unk> , knights of the castle , and there encountered with them sir <unk> de <unk> and sir <unk> de <unk> , that were two brethren , and there encountered sir <unk> with sir <unk> , and either brake their spears unto their hands , and then sir <unk> with sir <unk> , and either of them smote down other , horse and all , to the earth , and either parties rescued other and <unk> them again .
and sir <name> , and sir <unk> , knights of the castle , encountered with sir <unk> and sir <name> , and these four knights encountered mightily , and brake their spears to their hands .
then came sir <unk> from the castle , and there encountered with him sir <name> , and there sir <unk> the green knight smote down sir <name> , brother to sir launcelot .
all this was marked by <name> heralds , who bare him best , and their names .
then sir <unk> brake his spear upon sir gareth , but of that stroke sir <unk> fell to the earth .
when sir <unk> saw that , he bad sir gareth keep him , and sir gareth smote him to the earth .
then sir <unk> <unk> a spear to avenge his brother , and in the same wise sir gareth served him , and sir <unk> and his brother la <unk> male <unk> , and sir <unk> <name> <unk> , and sir <unk> <name> savage ; all these he bare down with one spear .
when king <unk> of ireland saw sir gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be , that one time seemed green , and another time , at his again coming , he seemed blue .
and thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color , so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him .
then sir <unk> the king of ireland encountered with sir gareth , and there sir gareth smote him from his horse , saddle and all .
and then came king <unk> of scotland , and sir gareth smote him down horse and man .
and in the same wise he served king <unk> of the land of gore .
and then there came in sir <unk> , and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the earth .
and <unk> 's son <unk> brake a spear upon sir gareth mightily and knightly .
and then sir <unk> the <name> <name> cried on high , knight with the many colors , well hast thou <unk> ; now make thee ready that i may just with thee .
sir gareth heard him , and he <unk> a great spear , and so they encountered together , and there the <name> brake his spear ; but sir gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm , that he reeled here and there , and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him .
truly , said king <name> , that knight with the many colors is a good knight .
wherefore the king called unto him sir launcelot , and prayed him to encounter with that knight .
sir , said launcelot , i may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this time , for he hath had <unk> enough this day , and when a good knight doth so well upon some day , it is no good knight 's part to let him of his worship , and , namely , when he <unk> a knight hath done so great labour ; for peradventure , said sir launcelot , his quarrel is here this day , and peradventure he is best beloved with this <name> of all that be here , for i see well he <unk> himself and <unk> him to do great deeds , and therefore , said sir launcelot , as for me , this day he shall have the honour ; though it lay in my power to put him from it , i would not .
there was an unpleasant little episode that day , which for reasons of state i struck out of my priest 's report .
you <name> have noticed that <name> was doing some great fighting in the engagement .
when i say <name> i mean sir gareth .
<name> was my private pet name for him ; it suggests that i had a deep affection for him , and that was the case .
but it was a private pet name only , and never spoken aloud to any one , much less to him ; being a <name> , he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me .
well , to proceed : i sat in the private box set apart for me as the king 's minister .
while sir <unk> was waiting for his turn to enter the lists , he came in there and sat down and began to talk ; for he was always making up to me , because i was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes , the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick .
i had always responded to his efforts as well as i could , and felt a very deep and real kindness for him , too , for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life , he had at least spared it me .
it was one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on american soil , from <name> down to artemus <name> .
it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the <unk> jokes for an hour and never got a laugh ; and then when he was leaving , some gray <unk> wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard , and " it was all they could do to keep from laughin ' right out in meetin ' . "
that anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling ; and yet i had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times , and cried and cursed all the way through .
then who can <name> to know what my feelings were , to hear this <unk> ass start in on it again , in the murky twilight of tradition , before the <name> of history , while even <unk> might be referred to as " the late <unk> , " and the crusades would n't be born for five hundred years yet ?
just as he finished , the <unk> came ; so , <unk> like a demon , he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings , and i knew nothing more .
it was some minutes before i came to , and then i opened my eyes just in time to see sir gareth fetch him an awful <unk> , and i unconsciously out with the prayer , " i <name> to gracious he 's killed ! "
but by ill-luck , before i had got half through with the words , sir gareth crashed into sir sagramor <name> desirous and sent him thundering over his horse 's <unk> , and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought i meant it for him .
well , whenever one of those people got a thing into his head , there was no getting it out again .
i knew that , so i saved my breath , and offered no explanations .
as soon as sir sagramor got well , he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us , and he named a day three or four years in the future ; place of settlement , the lists where the offense had been given .
i said i would be ready when he got back .
you see , he was going for the holy <unk> .
the boys all took a <unk> at the holy <unk> now and then .
it was a several years ' cruise .
they always put in the long absence <unk> around , in the most conscientious way , though none of them had any idea where the holy <unk> really was , and i do n't think any of them actually expected to find it , or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it .
you see , it was just the northwest passage of that day , as you may say ; that was all .
every year expeditions went out holy <unk> , and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them .
there was worlds of reputation in it , but no money .
why , they actually wanted me to put in !
well , i should smile .
chapter x beginnings of civilization the round table soon heard of the challenge , and of course it was a good deal discussed , for such things interested the boys .
the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures , so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away .
i excused myself for the present ; i said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly ; then i should be ready ; all the chances were that at the end of that time sir sagramor would still be out <unk> , so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement ; i should then have been in office six or seven years , and i believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without its working any harm .
i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished .
in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under way  nuclei of future vast factories , the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization .
in these were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find , and i kept agents out raking the country for more , all the time .
i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts  experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling .
these nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats , for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit  for i was afraid of the church .
i had started a <unk> and a lot of <unk> the first thing ; as a result , i now had an admirable system of <unk> schools in full blast in those places , and also a complete variety of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition .
everybody could be any kind of a <name> he wanted to ; there was perfect freedom in that matter .
but i confined public religious teaching to the churches and the <unk> , permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings .
i could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian without any trouble , but that would have been to affront a law of human nature : spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites , complexions , and features , and a man is only at his best , morally , when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion , <unk> , and stature of the individual who wears it ; and , besides , i was afraid of a united church ; it makes a mighty power , the mightiest conceivable , and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands , as it is always bound to do , it means death to human <name> and paralysis to human thought .
all mines were <name> property , and there were a good many of them .
they had formerly been worked as savages always work mines  holes <unk> in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand , at the rate of a ton a day ; but i had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as i could .
yes , i had made pretty handsome progress when sir <unk> challenge struck me .
four years rolled by  and then !
well , you would never imagine it in the world .
unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands .
the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government .
an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government , if the conditions were the same , namely , the despot the <unk> individual of the human race , and his lease of life perpetual .
but as a perishable perfect man must die , and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor , an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government , it is the worst form that is possible .
my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command .
unsuspected by this dark land , i had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose !
it was fenced away from the public view , but there it was , a gigantic and unassailable fact  and to be heard from , yet , if i lived and had luck .
there it was , as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano , standing innocent with its <unk> summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels .
my schools and churches were children four years before ; they were grown-up now ; my shops of that day were vast factories now ; where i had a dozen trained men then , i had a thousand now ; where i had one brilliant expert then , i had fifty now .
i stood with my hand on the cock , so to speak , ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment .
but i was not going to do the thing in that sudden way .
it was not my policy .
the people could not have stood it ; and , moreover , i should have had the established <name> catholic church on my back in a minute .
no , i had been going cautiously all the while .
i had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time , whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees , and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition , and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things .
i was turning on my light <unk> at a time , and meant to continue to do so .
i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom , and they were doing very well .
i meant to work this racket more and more , as time wore on , if nothing occurred to frighten me .
one of my deepest secrets was my west point  my military academy .
i kept that most jealously out of sight ; and i did the same with my naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport .
both were <unk> to my satisfaction .
<name> was twenty-two now , and was my head executive , my right hand .
he was a darling ; he was equal to anything ; there wasn't anything he could n't turn his hand to .
of late i had been training him for journalism , for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line ; nothing big , but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my <unk> .
he took to it like a duck ; there was an editor concealed in him , sure .
already he had doubled himself in one way ; he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth .
his journalistic style was climbing , steadily ; it was already up to the back settlement alabama <name> , and could n't be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor .
we had another large departure on hand , too .
this was a telegraph and a telephone ; our first venture in this line .
these wires were for private service only , as yet , and must be kept private until a <unk> day should come .
we had a gang of men on the road , working mainly by night .
they were stringing ground wires ; we were afraid to put up poles , for they would attract too much inquiry .
ground wires were good enough , in both instances , for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect .
my men had orders to strike across country , avoiding roads , and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence , and leaving experts in charge .
nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom , for nobody ever went intentionally to any place , but only struck it by accident in his wanderings , and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was .
at one time and another we had sent out <unk> expeditions to survey and map the kingdom , but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble .
so we had given the thing up , for the present ; it would be poor wisdom to <unk> the church .
as for the general condition of the country , it was as it had been when i arrived in it , to all intents and purposes .
i had made changes , but they were necessarily slight , and they were not noticeable .
thus far , i had not even meddled with taxation , outside of the taxes which provided the <name> revenues .
i had <unk> those , and put the service on an effective and righteous basis .
as a result , these revenues were already <unk> , and yet the burden was so much more <unk> distributed than before , that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief , and the praises of my administration were hearty and general .
personally , i struck an interruption , now , but i did not mind it , it could not have happened at a better time .
earlier it could have annoyed me , but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along .
the king had reminded me several times , of late , that the postponement i had asked for , four years before , had about run out now .
it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a <name> with sir sagramor , who was still out <unk> , but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions , and might be found any year , now .
so you see i was expecting this interruption ; it did not take me by surprise .
chapter xi the yankee in search of adventures there never was such a country for wandering liars ; and they were of both sexes .
hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving ; and generally loaded with a tale about some <name> or other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel , usually a giant .
now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a <unk> from an entire stranger , would be to ask for credentials  yes , and a pointer or two as to locality of castle , best route to it , and so on .
but nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing at that .
no , everybody swallowed these people 's lies whole , and never asked a question of any sort or about anything .
well , one day when i was not around , one of these people came along  it was a she one , this time  and told a tale of the usual pattern .
her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle , along with forty-four other young and beautiful girls , pretty much all of them princesses ; they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years ; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers , each with four arms and one eye  the eye in the center of the forehead , and as big as a fruit .
sort of fruit not mentioned ; their usual <unk> in statistics .
would you believe it ?
the king and the whole round table were in <unk> over this preposterous opportunity for adventure .
every knight of the table jumped for the chance , and begged for it ; but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me , who had not asked for it at all .
by an effort , i contained my <name> when <name> brought me the news .
but he  he could not contain his .
his mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge  delight in my good fortune , gratitude to the king for this splendid <name> of his favor for me .
he could keep neither his legs nor his body still , but <unk> about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness .
on my side , i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this <unk> , but i kept my vexation under the surface for policy 's sake , and did what i could to let on to be glad .
indeed , i said i was glad .
and in a way it was true ; i was as glad as a person is when he is scalped .
well , one must make the best of things , and not waste time with useless fretting , but get down to business and see what can be done .
in all lies there is wheat among the chaff ; i must get at the wheat in this case : so i sent for the girl and she came .
she was a comely enough creature , and soft and modest , but , if signs went for anything , she did n't know as much as a <name> 's watch .
i said : " my dear , have you been questioned as to particulars ? "
she said she had n't .
" well , i did n't expect you had , but i thought i would ask , to make sure ; it 's the way i 've been raised .
now you must n't take it <unk> if i remind you that as we do n't know you , we must go a little slow .
you may be all right , of course , and we 'll <name> that you are ; but to take it for granted is n't business .
you understand that .
i 'm obliged to ask you a few questions ; just answer up fair and square , and do n't be afraid .
where do you live , when you are at home ? "
" in the land of <unk> , fair sir . "
" land of <unk> .
i do n't remember hearing of it before .
parents living ? "
" as to that , i know not if they be yet on live , sith it is many years that i have lain shut up in the castle . "
" your name , please ? "
" i <unk> the <unk> <unk> la <unk> , an it please you . "
" do you know anybody here who can identify you ? "
" that were not likely , fair lord , i being come hither now for the first time . "
" have you brought any letters  any documents  any proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful ? "
" of a <unk> , no ; and wherefore should i ?
have i not a tongue , and can not i say all that myself ? "
" but your saying it , you know , and somebody else 's saying it , is different . "
" different ?
how might that be ?
i fear me i do not understand . "
" do n't understand ?
land of  why , you see  you see  why , great <name> , ca n't you understand a little thing like that ?
ca n't you understand the difference between your  why do you look so innocent and idiotic ! "
" i ?
in truth i know not , but an it were the <name> of god . "
" yes , yes , i reckon that 's about the size of it .
do n't mind my seeming excited ; i 'm not .
let us change the subject .
now as to this castle , with forty-five princesses in it , and three <unk> at the head of it , tell me  where is this harem ? "
" harem ? "
" the castle , you understand ; where is the castle ? "
" oh , as to that , it is great , and strong , and well <unk> , and lieth in a far country .
yes , it is many leagues . "
" how many ? "
" ah , fair sir , it were <unk> hard to tell , they are so many , and do so lap the one upon the other , and being made all in the same image and <unk> with the same color , one may not know the one league from its fellow , nor how to count them except they be taken apart , and ye wit well it were god 's work to do that , being not within man 's capacity ; for ye <name> note  " " hold on , hold on , never mind about the distance ; whereabouts does the castle lie ?
what 's the direction from here ? "
" ah , please you sir , it hath no direction from here ; by reason that the road lieth not straight , but <unk> evermore ; wherefore the direction of its place <unk> not , but is some time under the one sky and anon under another , <unk> if ye be minded that it is in the east , and <unk> <unk> , ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle , and this <name> <unk> again and yet again and still again , it <name> grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the <name> of him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it <unk> him , and if it please him not , <name> the rather that even all castles and all directions <unk> vanish out of the earth , leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant , so warning his creatures that where he <name> he <name> , and where he <name> not he  " " oh , that 's all right , that 's all right , give us a rest ; never mind about the direction , <name> the direction  i beg pardon , i beg a thousand pardons , i am not well to-day ; pay no attention when i <unk> , it is an old habit , an old , bad habit , and hard to get rid of when one 's digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born ; good land !
a man ca n't keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old .
but come  never mind about that ; let 's  have you got such a thing as a map of that region about you ?
now a good map  " " is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas , which , being boiled in oil , and an onion and salt added thereto , doth  " " what , a map ?
what are you talking about ?
do n't you know what a map is ?
there , there , never mind , do n't explain , i hate explanations ; they fog a thing up so that you ca n't tell anything about it .
run along , dear ; <unk> ; show her the way , <name> . "
oh , well , it was reasonably plain , now , why these donkeys didn't prospect these liars for details .
it may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere , but i do n't believe you could have sluiced it out with a <unk> ; nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting , even ; it was a case for dynamite .
why , she was a perfect ass ; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel .
it kind of sizes up the whole party .
and think of the simple ways of this court : this wandering wench had n't any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country .
in fact , he was glad to see her , glad to hear her tale ; with that adventure of hers to offer , she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner .
just as i was <unk> these reflections , <name> came back .
i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl ; had n't got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle .
the youth looked a little surprised , or puzzled , or something , and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for .
" why , great guns , " i said , " do n't i want to find the castle ?
and how else would i go about it ? "
" la , sweet your worship , one may lightly answer that , i <unk> .
she <name> go with thee .
they always do .
she <name> ride with thee . "
" ride with me ?
nonsense ! "
" but of a truth she <name> .
she <name> ride with thee .
thou shalt see . "
" what ?
she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me  alone  and i as good as engaged to be married ?
why , it 's scandalous .
think how it would look . "
my , the dear face that rose before me !
the boy was eager to know all about this tender matter .
i swore him to secrecy and then whispered her name  " puss <unk> . "
he looked disappointed , and said he did n't remember the countess .
how natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank .
he asked me where she lived .
" in east har  " i came to myself and stopped , a little confused ; then i said , " never mind , now ; i 'll tell you some time . "
and might he see her ?
would i let him see her some day ?
it was but a little thing to promise  thirteen hundred years or so  and he so eager ; so i said yes .
but i sighed ; i couldn't help it .
and yet there was no sense in sighing , for she wasn't born yet .
but that is the way we are made : we do n't reason , where we feel ; we just feel .
my expedition was all the talk that day and that night , and the boys were very good to me , and made much of me , and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment , and come to be as anxious for me to hive those <unk> and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract .
well , they were good children  but just children , that is all .
and they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants , and how to scoop them in ; and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments , and gave me <unk> and other rubbish to put on my wounds .
but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if i was such a wonderful <unk> as i was pretending to be , i ought not to need <unk> or instructions , or charms against enchantments , and , least of all , arms and armor , on a <unk> of any kind  even against <unk> dragons , and devils hot from perdition , let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after , these commonplace <unk> of the back settlements .
i was to have an early breakfast , and start at <name> , for that was the usual way ; but i had the demon 's own time with my armor , and this delayed me a little .
it is troublesome to get into , and there is so much detail .
first you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body , for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron ; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail  these are made of small steel links woven together , and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor , it <unk> into a pile like a peck of wet <unk> ; it is very heavy and is nearly the <unk> material in the world for a night shirt , yet plenty used it for that  tax collectors , and reformers , and one-horse kings with a defective title , and those sorts of people ; then you put on your shoes  <unk> roofed over with <unk> bands of steel  and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels .
next you buckle your <unk> on your legs , and your <unk> on your thighs ; then come your <unk> and your breastplate , and you begin to feel crowded ; then you hitch onto the breastplate the <unk> of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is <unk> out behind so you can sit down , and is n't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle , either for looks or for wear , or to wipe your hands on ; next you belt on your sword ; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms , your iron <unk> onto your hands , your iron <unk> onto your head , with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to <name> over the back of your neck  and there you are , snug as a candle in a <unk> .
this is no time to dance .
well , a man that is packed away like that is a nut that is n't worth the cracking , there is so little of the meat , when you get down to it , by comparison with the shell .
the boys helped me , or i never could have got in .
just as we finished , sir <unk> happened in , and i saw that as like as not i had n't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip .
how stately he looked ; and tall and broad and grand .
he had on his head a conical steel <unk> that only came down to his ears , and for <unk> had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose ; and all the rest of him , from neck to heel , was flexible chain mail , trousers and all .
but pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment , which of course was of chain mail , as i said , and <name> straight from his shoulders to his ankles ; and from his middle to the bottom , both before and behind , was divided , so that he could ride and let the skirts <name> down on each side .
he was going <unk> , and it was just the outfit for it , too .
i would have given a good deal for that ulster , but it was too late now to be fooling around .
the sun was just up , the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck ; so it would n't be etiquette for me to tarry .
you do n't get on your horse yourself ; no , if you tried it you would get disappointed .
they <name> you out , just as they <name> a <unk> man to the drug store , and put you on , and help get you to rights , and fix your feet in the stirrups ; and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else  like somebody that has been married on a sudden , or struck by lightning , or something like that , and has n't quite fetched around yet , and is sort of numb , and ca n't just get his bearings .
then they stood up the mast they called a spear , in its socket by my left foot , and i gripped it with my hand ; lastly they <name> my shield around my neck , and i was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea .
everybody was as good to me as they could be , and a maid of honor gave me the <unk> her own self .
there was nothing more to do now , but for that damsel to get up behind me on a <unk> , which she did , and put an arm or so around me to hold on .
and so we started , and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets .
and everybody we met , going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us , except some shabby little boys on the outskirts .
they said : " oh , what a <name> ! "
and hove clods at us .
in my experience boys are the same in all ages .
they do n't respect anything , they do n't care for anything or anybody .
they say " go up , <unk> " to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity ; they <unk> me in the holy gloom of the middle ages ; and i had seen them act the same way in <unk> administration ; i remember , because i was there and helped .
the prophet had his bears and settled with his boys ; and i wanted to get down and settle with mine , but it would n't answer , because i could n't have got up again .
i hate a country without a <name> .
chapter xii slow torture straight off , we were in the country .
it was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn .
from <unk> we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below , with streams winding through them , and island groves of trees here and there , and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black <unk> of shade ; and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills , blue with haze , stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon , with at wide intervals a dim <unk> of white or gray on a <unk> , which we knew was a castle .
we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew , and we moved like spirits , the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall ; we dreamed along through <unk> in a mist of green light that got its tint from the <unk> roof of leaves overhead , and by our feet the clearest and coldest of <unk> went <unk> and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music , comfortable to hear ; and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and <name> gloom of the forest , where furtive wild things whisked and <unk> by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was ; and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable <unk> of the woods .
and by and by out we would swing again into the glare .
about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare  it was along there somewhere , a couple of hours or so after <unk>  it was n't as pleasant as it had been .
it was beginning to get hot .
this was quite noticeable .
we had a very long pull , after that , without any shade .
now it is curious how <unk> little <unk> grow and multiply after they once get a start .
things which i did n't mind at all , at first , i began to mind now  and more and more , too , all the time .
the first ten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i did n't seem to care ; i got along , and said never mind , it is n't any matter , and dropped it out of my mind .
but now it was different ; i wanted it all the time ; it was nag , nag , nag , right along , and no rest ; i couldn't get it out of my mind ; and so at last i lost my temper and said <name> a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it .
you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet ; and some other things ; but it was that kind of a helmet that you ca n't take off by yourself .
that had n't occurred to me when i put it there ; and in fact i did n't know it .
i supposed it would be particularly convenient there .
and so now , the thought of its being there , so handy and close by , and yet not <unk> , made it all the worse and the harder to bear .
yes , the thing that you ca n't get is the thing that you want , mainly ; every one has noticed that .
well , it took my mind off from everything else ; took it clear off , and centered it in my helmet ; and mile after mile , there it stayed , imagining the handkerchief , picturing the handkerchief ; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes , and i could n't get at it .
it seems like a little thing , on paper , but it was not a little thing at all ; it was the most real kind of misery .
i would not say it if it was not so .
i made up my mind that i would <name> along a <unk> next time , let it look how it might , and people say what they would .
of course these iron <unk> of the round table would think it was scandalous , and maybe raise <unk> about it , but as for me , give me comfort first , and style afterwards .
so we jogged along , and now and then we struck a stretch of dust , and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry ; and of course i said things i ought n't to have said , i do n't deny that .
i am not better than others .
we could n't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain , not even an ogre ; and , in the mood i was in then , it was well for the ogre ; that is , an ogre with a handkerchief .
most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor ; but so i got his bandanna , he could keep his hardware , for all of me .
meantime , it was getting hotter and hotter in there .
you see , the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time .
well , when you are hot , that way , every little thing <unk> you .
when i trotted , i rattled like a crate of dishes , and that annoyed me ; and moreover i could n't seem to stand that shield <unk> and banging , now about my breast , now around my back ; and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and <unk> in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does , and as we didn't create any breeze at that gait , i was like to get fried in that stove ; and besides , the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute .
and you had to be always changing hands , and passing your spear over to the other foot , it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time .
well , you know , when you perspire that way , in rivers , there comes a time when you  when you  well , when you <unk> .
you are inside , your hands are outside ; so there you are ; nothing but iron between .
it is not a light thing , let it sound as it may .
first it is one place ; then another ; then some more ; and it goes on spreading and spreading , and at last the territory is all occupied , and nobody can imagine what you feel like , nor how unpleasant it is .
and when it had got to the worst , and it seemed to me that i could not stand anything more , a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose , and the bars were stuck and would n't work , and i could n't get the <unk> up ; and i could only shake my head , which was baking hot by this time , and the fly  well , you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty  he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip , and lip to ear , and buzz and buzz all around in there , and keep on lighting and biting , in a way that a person , already so distressed as i was , simply could not stand .
so i gave in , and got <unk> to <unk> the helmet and relieve me of it .
then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water , and i drank and then stood up , and she poured the rest down inside the armor .
one can not think how refreshing it was .
she continued to fetch and pour until i was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable .
it was good to have a rest  and peace .
but nothing is quite perfect in this life , at any time .
i had made a pipe a while back , and also some pretty fair tobacco ; not the real thing , but what some of the indians use : the inside bark of the <name> , dried .
these comforts had been in the helmet , and now i had them again , but no matches .
gradually , as the time wore along , one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding  that we were <unk> .
an armed novice can not mount his horse without help and plenty of it .
<name> was not enough ; not enough for me , anyway .
we had to wait until somebody should come along .
waiting , in silence , would have been agreeable enough , for i was full of matter for reflection , and wanted to give it a chance to work .
i wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even <unk> men could ever have learned to wear armor , considering its inconveniences ; and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what i had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives .
i wanted to think that out ; and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out ; but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances .
you couldn't think , where <name> was .
she was a quite <unk> creature and good-hearted , but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill , and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city .
if she had had a cork she would have been a comfort .
but you ca n't cork that kind ; they would die .
her clack was going all day , and you would think something would surely happen to her works , by and by ; but no , they never got out of order ; and she never had to slack up for words .
she could grind , and pump , and <unk> , and buzz by the week , and never stop to oil up or blow out .
and yet the result was just nothing but wind .
she never had any ideas , any more than a fog has .
she was a perfect <unk> ; i mean for jaw , jaw , jaw , talk , talk , talk , jabber , jabber , jabber ; but just as good as she could be .
i had n't minded her mill that morning , on account of having that hornets ' nest of other troubles ; but more than once in the afternoon i had to say : " take a rest , child ; the way you are using up all the domestic air , the kingdom <name> have to go to importing it by to-morrow , and it's a low enough treasury without that . "
chapter xiii freemen yes , it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented .
only a little while back , when i was riding and suffering , what a heaven this peace , this rest , this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this <unk> stream would have seemed , where i could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then ; yet already i was getting dissatisfied ; partly because i could not light my pipe  for , although i had long ago started a match factory , i had forgotten to bring matches with me  and partly because we had nothing to eat .
here was another illustration of the childlike <unk> of this age and people .
a man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey , and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear .
there was probably not a knight of all the round table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff .
and yet there could not be anything more sensible .
it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet , but i was interrupted in the act , and had to make an excuse and lay them aside , and a dog got them .
night approached , and with it a storm .
the darkness came on fast .
we must camp , of course .
i found a good shelter for the <unk> under a rock , and went off and found another for myself .
but i was obliged to remain in my armor , because i could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow <unk> to help , because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk .
it would not have amounted to that in reality , because i had clothes on underneath ; but the prejudices of one 's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump , and i knew that when it came to stripping off that <unk> iron petticoat i should be embarrassed .
with the storm came a change of weather ; and the stronger the wind blew , and the wilder the rain lashed around , the colder and colder it got .
pretty soon , various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm ; and while some of them behaved well enough , and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet , the majority were of a restless , uncomfortable sort , and never stayed still , but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what ; especially the ants , which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour , and are a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again .
it would be my advice to persons situated in this way , to not roll or thrash around , because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on , and this makes things worse than they were before , and of course makes you <unk> harder , too , if you can .
still , if one did not roll and thrash around he would die ; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other ; there is no real choice .
even after i was frozen solid i could still distinguish that tickling , just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment .
i said i would never wear armor after this trip .
all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living fire , as you may say , on account of that swarm of <unk> , that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head : how do people stand this miserable armor ?
how have they managed to stand it all these generations ?
how can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day ?
when the morning came at last , i was in a bad enough plight : seedy , drowsy , fagged , from want of sleep ; weary from thrashing around , famished from long fasting ; pining for a bath , and to get rid of the animals ; and crippled with rheumatism .
and how had it fared with the nobly born , the titled aristocrat , the <unk> <unk> la <unk> ?
why , she was as fresh as a squirrel ; she had slept like the dead ; and as for a bath , probably neither she nor any other <name> in the land had ever had one , and so she was not missing it .
measured by modern standards , they were merely modified savages , those people .
this <name> <name> showed no impatience to get to breakfast  and that <unk> of the savage , too .
on their journeys those britons were used to long <unk> , and knew how to bear them ; and also how to freight up against probable <unk> before starting , after the style of the indian and the <unk> .
as like as not , <name> was loaded for a <unk> stretch .
we were off before sunrise , <name> riding and i limping along behind .
in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road .
they were as humble as animals to me ; and when i proposed to breakfast with them , they were so flattered , so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that i was in <name> .
my <name> put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side ; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle  a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them , and not because it insulted or offended them , for it did n't .
and yet they were not slaves , not <unk> .
by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen .
<unk> of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree : small " independent " farmers , artisans , etc .
; which is to say , they were the nation , the actual nation ; they were about all of it that was useful , or worth saving , or really <unk> , and to <unk> them would have been to <unk> the nation and leave behind some <unk> , some refuse , in the shape of a king , nobility and gentry , idle , unproductive , acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying , and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world .
and yet , by ingenious contrivance , this gilded minority , instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged , was marching head up and banners flying , at the other end of it ; had elected itself to be the nation , and these innumerable <unk> had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth ; and not only that , but to believe it right and as it should be .
the priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of god ; and so , not reflecting upon how unlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms , and especially such poor transparent ones as this , they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet .
the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly american ear .
they were freemen , but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission ; they could not prepare their own bread , but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his <unk> , and pay roundly for the same ; they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds , nor buy a piece of somebody else 's without remembering him in cash for the privilege ; they had to harvest his grain for him gratis , and be ready to come at a moment 's notice , leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm ; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields , and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless <unk> trampled the grain around the trees ; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil ; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves , and when the swarms from my lord 's dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird , for awful would the penalty be ; when the harvest was at last gathered , then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it : first the church carted off its fat tenth , then the king 's commissioner took his twentieth , then my lord 's people made a mighty <unk> upon the remainder ; after which , the skinned <name> had <name> to bestow the remnant in his barn , in case it was worth the trouble ; there were taxes , and taxes , and taxes , and more taxes , and taxes again , and yet other taxes  upon this free and independent pauper , but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop , none upon the wasteful nobility or the <unk> church ; if the baron would sleep <unk> , the <name> must sit up all night after his day's work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet ; if the <unk> daughter  but no , that last infamy of monarchical government is <unk> ; and finally , if the <name> , grown desperate with his tortures , found his life unendurable under such conditions , and sacrificed it and fled to death for <name> and refuge , the gentle church condemned him to eternal fire , the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back , and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors .
and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop 's road three days each  gratis ; every head of a family , and every son of a family , three days each , gratis , and a day or so added for their servants .
why , it was like reading about <name> and the french , before the ever memorable and blessed revolution , which swept a thousand years of such <unk> away in one swift <unk> of blood  one : a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell .
there were two " reigns of terror , " if we would but remember it and consider it ; the one wrought murder in hot passion , the other in heartless cold blood ; the one lasted mere months , the other had lasted a thousand years ; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons , the other upon a hundred millions ; but our <unk> are all for the " horrors " of the minor terror , the momentary terror , so to speak ; whereas , what is the horror of swift death by the axe , compared with lifelong death from hunger , cold , insult , cruelty , and <unk> ?
what is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake ?
a city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over ; but all <name> could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror  that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves .
these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me , were as full of humble reverence for their king and church and nobility as their worst enemy could <name> .
there was something pitifully ludicrous about it .
i asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed , who , with a free vote in every man 's hand , would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever , whether gifted or <unk> , to the exclusion of all other families  including the <unk> 's ; and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank , and clothed on with offensive <unk> glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the <unk> families  including his own .
they all looked <unk> , and said they did n't know ; that they had never thought about it before , and it had n't ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could have a say in the government .
i said i had seen one  and that it would last until it had an established church .
again they were all <unk>  at first .
but presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again ; and state it slowly , so it could soak into his understanding .
i did it ; and after a little he had the idea , and he brought his fist down and said he did n't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way ; and that to steal from a nation its <name> and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes .
i said to myself : " this one 's a man .
if i were backed by enough of his sort , i would make a strike for the welfare of this country , and try to prove myself its <unk> citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government . "
you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one 's country , not to its institutions or its <unk> .
the country is the real thing , the substantial thing , the eternal thing ; it is the thing to watch over , and care for , and be loyal to ; institutions are extraneous , they are its mere clothing , and clothing can wear out , become ragged , cease to be comfortable , cease to protect the body from <name> , disease , and death .
to be loyal to rags , to shout for rags , to worship rags , to die for rags  that is a loyalty of <unk> , it is pure animal ; it belongs to monarchy , was invented by monarchy ; let monarchy keep it .
i was from connecticut , whose constitution declares " that all political power is inherent in the people , and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit ; and that they have at all times an undeniable and <unk> right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient . "
under that gospel , the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth 's political clothes are worn out , and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit , is <unk> ; he is a traitor .
that he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay , does not excuse him ; it is his duty to agitate anyway , and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does .
and now here i was , in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population .
for the nine hundred and ninety-four to express dissatisfaction with the <unk> system and propose to change it , would have made the whole six shudder as one man , it would have been so <unk> , so dishonorable , such putrid black treason .
so to speak , i was become a <unk> in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work , and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends .
it seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four <unk> needed was a new deal .
the thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the <unk> and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution ; but i knew that the <name> <unk> or the <unk> <name> who tries such a thing without first <unk> his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left .
i had never been accustomed to getting left , even if i do say it myself .
wherefore , the " deal " which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the <unk> sort .
so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and <unk> herd of human sheep , but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him .
after i had finished , i got him to lend me a little ink from his veins ; and with this and a <unk> i wrote on a piece of bark  put him in the <unk>  and gave it to him , and said : " take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of <unk> <name> <unk> , whom i call <name> , and he <name> understand . "
" he is a priest , then , " said the man , and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face .
" how  a priest ?
did n't i tell you that no <unk> of the church , no <unk> of pope or bishop can enter my <unk> ?
didn't i tell you that you could n't enter unless your religion , whatever it might be , was your own free property ? "
" marry , it is so , and for that i was glad ; wherefore it liked me not , and bred in me a cold doubt , to hear of this priest being there . "
" but he is n't a priest , i tell you . "
the man looked far from satisfied .
he said : " he is not a priest , and yet can read ? "
" he is not a priest and yet can read  yes , and write , too , for that matter .
i taught him myself . "
the man 's face cleared .
" and it is the first thing that you yourself <name> be taught in that factory  " " i ?
i would give blood out of my heart to know that <name> .
why , i <name> be your slave , your  " " no you wo n't , you wo n't be anybody 's slave .
take your family and go along .
your lord the bishop <name> confiscate your small property , but no matter .
<name> <name> fix you all right . "
chapter xiv " defend thee , lord " i paid three pennies for my breakfast , and a most extravagant price it was , too , seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money ; but i was feeling good by this time , and i had always been a kind of <unk> anyway ; and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing , scant as their provision was , and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet , where , these pennies being made of iron and not <unk> in weight , my <unk> 's worth was a good deal of a burden to me .
i spent money rather too freely in those days , it is true ; but one reason for it was that i had n't got the proportions of things entirely adjusted , even yet , after so long a sojourn in britain  had n't got along to where i was able to absolutely realize that a <name> in <name> 's land and a couple of dollars in connecticut were about one and the same thing : just twins , as you may say , in purchasing power .
if my start from camelot could have been delayed a very few days i could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint , and that would have pleased me ; and them , too , not less .
i had adopted the american values exclusively .
in a week or two now , cents , <unk> , <unk> , quarters , and <unk> , and also a trifle of gold , would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom , and i looked to see this new blood <unk> up its life .
the farmers were bound to throw in something , to sort of offset my liberality , whether i would or no ; so i let them give me a flint and steel ; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed <name> and me on our horse , i lit my pipe .
when the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet , all those people broke for the woods , and <name> went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud .
they thought i was one of those <unk> dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars .
i had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance .
then i told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies .
and i promised , with my hand on my heart , that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead .
the procession moved with a good deal of promptness .
there were no casualties to report , for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen .
i lost some time , now , for these big children , their fears gone , became so <unk> with wonder over my <unk> fireworks that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go .
still the delay was not wholly unproductive , for it took all that time to get <name> thoroughly wonted to the new thing , she being so close to it , you know .
it plugged up her conversation mill , too , for a considerable while , and that was a gain .
but above all other benefits <unk> , i had learned something .
i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along , now .
we tarried with a holy hermit , that night , and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon .
we were crossing a vast meadow by way of <unk> , and i was musing absently , hearing nothing , seeing nothing , when <name> suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning , with the cry : " defend thee , lord !  peril of life is toward ! "
and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood .
i looked up and saw , far off in the shade of a tree , half a dozen armed knights and their squires ; and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of <unk> for the mount .
my pipe was ready and would have been lit , if i had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without <unk> anybody .
i lit up at once , and by the time i had got a good head of reserved steam on , here they came .
all together , too ; none of those chivalrous <unk> which one reads so much about  one courtly rascal at a time , and the rest standing by to see fair play .
no , they came in a body , they came with a whirr and a rush , they came like a volley from a battery ; came with heads low down , plumes streaming out behind , lances advanced at a level .
it was a handsome sight , a beautiful sight  for a man up a tree .
i laid my <name> in rest and waited , with my heart beating , till the iron wave was just ready to break over me , then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet .
you should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter !
this was a finer sight than the other one .
but these people stopped , two or three hundred yards away , and this troubled me .
my satisfaction collapsed , and fear came ; i judged i was a lost man .
but <name> was radiant ; and was going to be eloquent  but i stopped her , and told her my magic had miscarried , somehow or other , and she must mount , with all despatch , and we must ride for life .
no , she would n't .
she said that my enchantment had disabled those knights ; they were not riding on , because they could n't ; wait , they would drop out of their saddles presently , and we would get their horses and harness .
i could not deceive such trusting simplicity , so i said it was a mistake ; that when my fireworks killed at all , they killed instantly ; no , the men would not die , there was something wrong about my apparatus , i could n't tell what ; but we must hurry and get away , for those people would attack us again , in a minute .
<name> laughed , and said : " <unk> , sir , they be not of that breed !
sir launcelot <name> give battle to dragons , and <name> abide by them , and <name> assail them again , and yet again , and still again , until he do conquer and destroy them ; and so likewise <name> sir <unk> and sir <unk> and sir <unk> , and mayhap others , but there be none else that <name> venture it , let the idle say what the idle <name> .
and , la , as to yonder base <unk> , think ye they have not their fill , but yet <name> more ? "
" well , then , what are they waiting for ?
why do n't they leave ?
nobody 's <unk> .
good land , i 'm willing to let bygones be bygones , i 'm sure . "
" leave , is it ?
oh , give thyself <unk> as to that .
they dream not of it , no , not they .
they wait to yield them . "
" come  really , is that <unk> '  as you people say ?
if they want to , why do n't they ? "
" it would like them much ; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed , ye would not hold them <unk> .
they fear to come . "
" well , then , suppose i go to them instead , and  " " ah , wit ye well they would not abide your coming .
i <name> go . "
and she did .
she was a handy person to have along on a raid .
i would have considered this a doubtful errand , myself .
i presently saw the knights riding away , and <name> coming back .
that was a relief .
i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings  i mean in the conversation ; otherwise the interview would n't have been so short .
but it turned out that she had managed the business well ; in fact , admirably .
she said that when she told those people i was the boss , it hit them where they lived : " smote them sore with fear and dread " was her word ; and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require .
so she swore them to appear at <name> 's court within two days and yield them , with horse and harness , and be my knights henceforth , and subject to my command .
how much better she managed that thing than i should have done it myself !
she was a <name> .
chapter xv <name> 's tale " and so i 'm proprietor of some knights , " said i , as we rode off .
" who would ever have supposed that i should live to list up assets of that sort .
i <name> n't know what to do with them ; unless i raffle them off .
how many of them are there , <name> ? "
" seven , please you , sir , and their squires . "
" it is a good haul .
who are they ?
where do they <name> out ? "
" where do they <name> out ? "
" yes , where do they live ? "
" ah , i understood thee not .
that <name> i tell <unk> . "
then she said musingly , and softly , turning the words daintily over her tongue : " <name> they out  <name> they out  where <name>  where do they <name> out ; eh , right so ; where do they <name> out .
of a truth the phrase hath a fair and <unk> <name> , and is prettily worded withal .
i <name> repeat it anon and anon in mine <unk> , whereby i may peradventure learn it .
where do they <name> out .
even so !
already it <unk> <unk> from my tongue , and <unk> as  " " do n't forget the cowboys , <name> . "
" cowboys ? "
" yes ; the knights , you know : you were going to tell me about them .
a while back , you remember .
<unk> speaking , game 's called . "
" game  " " yes , yes , yes !
go to the bat .
i mean , get to work on your statistics , and do n't burn so much kindling getting your fire started .
tell me about the knights . "
" i <name> well , and lightly <name> begin .
so they two departed and rode into a great forest .
and  " " great <name> ! "
you see , i recognized my mistake at once .
i had set her works a-going ; it was my own fault ; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts .
and she generally began without a preface and finished without a result .
if you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing , or answer with a couple of words , and go back and say the sentence over again .
so , interruptions only did harm ; and yet i had to interrupt , and interrupt pretty frequently , too , in order to save my life ; a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day .
" great <name> ! "
i said in my distress .
she went right back and began over again : " so they two departed and rode into a great forest .
and  " " which two ? "
" sir gawaine and sir <unk> .
and so they came to an <name> of monks , and there were well lodged .
so on the morn they heard their masses in the <name> , and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest ; then was sir gawaine ware in a valley by a turret , of twelve fair damsels , and two knights armed on great horses , and the damsels went to and fro by a tree .
and then was sir gawaine ware how there <name> a white shield on that tree , and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it , and some threw mire upon the shield  " " now , if i had n't seen the like myself in this country , <name> , i would n't believe it .
but i 've seen it , and i can just see those creatures now , parading before that shield and acting like that .
the women here do certainly act like all possessed .
yes , and i mean your best , too , society 's very choicest brands .
the humblest <unk> along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness , <name> , modesty , manners , to the highest duchess in <name> 's land . "
" <unk> ? "
" yes , but do n't you ask me to explain ; it 's a new kind of a girl ; they do n't have them here ; one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault , and he ca n't get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years , it 's such shabby mean conduct and so <unk> ; the fact is , no gentleman ever does it  though i  well , i myself , if i 've got to confess  " " peradventure she  " " never mind her ; never mind her ; i tell you i could n't ever explain her so you would understand . "
" even so be it , sith ye are so minded .
then sir gawaine and sir <unk> went and saluted them , and asked them why they did that despite to the shield .
sirs , said the damsels , we shall tell you .
there is a knight in this country that <unk> this white shield , and he is a passing good man of his hands , but he <unk> all ladies and <unk> , and therefore we do all this despite to the shield .
i <name> say you , said sir gawaine , it <unk> evil a good knight to despise all ladies and <unk> , and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause , and peradventure he <unk> in some other places ladies and <unk> , and to be loved again , and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of  " " man of prowess  yes , that is the man to please them , <name> .
man of brains  that is a thing they never think of .
<name> <unk>  <name> <unk>  <name> l. sullivan  pity but you could be here .
you would have your legs under the round table and a 'sir ' in front of your names within the twenty-four hours ; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and <unk> of the court in another twenty-four .
the fact is , it is just a sort of <unk> court of comanches , and there is n't a squaw in it who does n't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the <name> with the biggest string of scalps at his belt . "
"  and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of , said sir gawaine .
now , what is his name ?
sir , said they , his name is marhaus the king 's son of ireland . "
" son of the king of ireland , you mean ; the other form does n't mean anything .
and look out and hold on tight , now , we must jump this gully ... .
there , we are all right now .
this horse belongs in the circus ; he is born before his time . "
" i know him well , said sir <unk> , he is a passing good knight as any is on live . "
" on live .
if you 've got a fault in the world , <name> , it is that you are a shade too archaic .
but it is n't any matter . "
"  for i saw him once proved at a <unk> where many knights were gathered , and that time there might no man withstand him .
ah , said sir gawaine , damsels , <unk> ye are to blame , for it is to suppose he that <name> that shield there <name> not be long therefrom , and then may those knights match him on horseback , and that is more your worship than thus ; for i <name> abide no longer to see a knight 's shield <unk> .
and therewith sir <unk> and sir gawaine departed a little from them , and then were they ware where sir marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them .
and when the twelve damsels saw sir marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild , so that some of them fell by the way .
then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield , and said on high , sir marhaus defend thee .
and so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on marhaus , and sir marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse 's back  " " well , that is just the trouble about this state of things , it ruins so many horses . "
" that saw the other knight of the turret , and dressed him toward marhaus , and they went so eagerly together , that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down , horse and man , stark dead  " " another horse gone ; i tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up .
i do n't see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it . "
.
.
.
.
" so these two knights came together with great random  " i saw that i had been asleep and missed a chapter , but i didn't say anything .
i judged that the <name> knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time , and this turned out to be the <unk> "
 that sir <unk> smote sir marhaus that his spear <unk> in pieces on the shield , and sir marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth , and hurt sir <unk> on the left side  " " the truth is , <unk> , these <unk> are a little too simple ; the vocabulary is too limited , and so , by consequence , descriptions suffer in the matter of variety ; they run too much to level <unk> of fact , and not enough to picturesque detail ; this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous ; in fact the fights are all alike : a couple of people come together with great random  random is a good word , and so is <unk> , for that matter , and so is <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> and a hundred others , but land !
a body ought to discriminate  they come together with great random , and a spear is <unk> , and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down , horse and man , over his <unk> and brake his neck , and then the next candidate comes <unk> in , and <unk> his spear , and the other man <unk> his shield , and down he goes , horse and man , over his <unk> , and brake his neck , and then there 's another elected , and another and another and still another , till the material is all used up ; and when you come to figure up results , you ca n't tell one fight from another , nor who whipped ; and as a picture , of living , raging , roaring battle , sho !
why , it 's pale and noiseless  just ghosts scuffling in a fog .
dear me , what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle ?  the burning of rome in nero 's time , for instance ?
why , it would merely say , <unk> burned down ; no insurance ; boy <unk> a window , fireman brake his neck ! '
why , that ai n't a picture ! "
it was a good deal of a lecture , i thought , but it did n't disturb <name> , did n't turn a feather ; her steam soared steadily up again , the minute i took off the lid : " then sir marhaus turned his horse and rode toward gawaine with his spear .
and when sir gawaine saw that , he dressed his shield , and they <unk> their spears , and they came together with all the might of their horses , that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields , but sir gawaine 's spear brake  " " i knew it would . "
 " but sir marhaus 's spear held ; and therewith sir gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth  " " just so  and brake his back . "
 " and lightly sir gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword , and dressed him toward sir marhaus on foot , and therewith either came unto other eagerly , and smote together with their swords , that their shields flew in <unk> , and they bruised their <unk> and their <unk> , and wounded either other .
but sir gawaine , fro it passed nine of the clock , waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased .
all this espied sir marhaus , and had great wonder how his might increased , and so they wounded other passing sore ; and then when it was come noon  " the pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days : " <unk> haven !
ten minutes for refreshments  <unk> 'll strike the <unk> two minutes before train leaves  passengers for the shore line please take seats in the rear <unk> , this <unk> do n't go no <unk>  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , p  <unk> ! "
 " and waxed past noon and <name> toward <unk> .
sir <unk> strength <unk> and waxed passing faint , that <unk> he might <unk> any longer , and sir marhaus was then bigger and bigger  " " which strained his armor , of course ; and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that . "
 " and so , sir knight , said sir marhaus , i have well felt that ye are a passing good knight , and a marvelous man of might as ever i felt any , while it <unk> , and our quarrels are not great , and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt , for i feel you are passing feeble .
ah , said sir gawaine , gentle knight , ye say the word that i should say .
and therewith they took off their <unk> and either kissed other , and there they swore together either to love other as brethren  " but i lost the thread there , and dozed off to slumber , thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength  strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration , and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch  should not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose .
take a jackass , for instance : a jackass has that kind of strength , and puts it to a useful purpose , and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass ; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass .
it is a mixture that is always ineffectual , and should never have been attempted in the first place .
and yet , once you start a mistake , the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it .
when i came to myself again and began to listen , i perceived that i had lost another chapter , and that <unk> had wandered a long way off with her people .
" and so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones , and thereby they saw a fair stream of water ; above thereby was the head of the stream , a fair fountain , and three damsels sitting thereby .
in this country , said sir marhaus , came never knight since it was christened , but he found strange adventures  " " this is not good form , <unk> .
sir marhaus the king 's son of ireland talks like all the rest ; you ought to give him a <unk> , or at least a characteristic <unk> ; by this means one would recognize him as soon as he spoke , without his ever being named .
it is a common literary device with the great authors .
you should make him say , 'in this country , be <unk> , came never knight since it was christened , but he found strange adventures , be <unk> . '
you see how much better that sounds . "
 " came never knight but he found strange adventures , be <unk> .
of a truth it doth indeed , fair lord , albeit 't is passing hard to say , though peradventure that <name> not tarry but better speed with usage .
and then they rode to the damsels , and either saluted other , and the eldest had a <name> of gold about her head , and she was <unk> <name> of age or more  " " the damsel was ? "
" even so , dear lord  and her hair was white under the <name>  " " <unk> teeth , nine dollars a set , as like as not  the <unk> kind , that go up and down like a <unk> when you eat , and fall out when you laugh . "
" the second damsel was of thirty <name> of age , with a <unk> of gold about her head .
the third damsel was but fifteen year of age  " billows of thought came rolling over my soul , and the voice faded out of my hearing !
fifteen !
break  my heart !
oh , my lost darling !
just her age who was so gentle , and lovely , and all the world to me , and whom i shall never see again !
how the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time , a happy time , so many , many centuries hence , when i used to wake in the soft summer mornings , out of sweet dreams of her , and say " hello , central ! "
just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a " hello , <name> ! "
that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear .
she got three dollars a week , but she was worth it .
i could not follow <unk> 's further explanation of who our captured knights were , now  i mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were .
my interest was gone , my thoughts were far away , and sad .
by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale , caught here and there and now and then , i merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse , and one rode north , another east , the other south , to seek adventures , and meet again and lie , after year and day .
year and day  and without baggage .
it was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country .
the sun was now setting .
it was about three in the afternoon when <unk> had begun to tell me who the cowboys were ; so she had made pretty good progress with it  for her .
she would arrive some time or other , no doubt , but she was not a person who could be hurried .
we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground ; a huge , strong , venerable structure , whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with <name> , and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun .
it was the largest castle we had seen , and so i thought it might be the one we were after , but <name> said no .
she did not know who owned it ; she said she had passed it without calling , when she went down to camelot .
chapter xvi <name> <name> <name> if knights <unk> were to be believed , not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in .
as a matter of fact , knights <unk> were not persons to be believed  that is , measured by modern standards of veracity ; yet , measured by the standards of their own time , and scaled accordingly , you got the truth .
it was very simple : you <unk> a statement <unk> per cent ; the rest was fact .
now after making this allowance , the truth remained that if i could find out something about a castle before ringing the door-bell  i mean hailing the <unk>  it was the sensible thing to do .
so i was pleased when i saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle .
as we approached each other , i saw that he wore a plumed helmet , and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel , but bore a curious addition also  a stiff square garment like a herald 's <unk> .
however , i had to smile at my own forgetfulness when i got nearer and read this sign on his <unk> : " <unk> 's soap  all the <unk> use it . "
that was a little idea of my own , and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the <unk> and uplifting of this nation .
in the first place , it was a furtive , underhand blow at this nonsense of knight <unk> , though nobody suspected that but me .
i had started a number of these people out  the bravest knights i could get  each <unk> between <unk> bearing one device or another , and i judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous ; and then , even the <unk> ass that hadn't any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion .
secondly , these missionaries would gradually , and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm , introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility , and from them it would work down to the people , if the priests could be kept quiet .
this would undermine the church .
i mean would be a step toward that .
next , education  next , freedom  and then she would begin to crumble .
it being my conviction that any established church is an established crime , an established <unk> , i had no scruples , but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it .
why , in my own former day  in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time  there were old englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country : a " free " country with the corporation act and the test still in force in it  timbers propped against men's liberties and <unk> consciences to shore up an established <unk> with .
my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their <unk>  the showy gilding was a neat idea , i could have got the king to wear a <unk> for the sake of that barbaric splendor  they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was ; and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it , get them to try it on a dog .
the <unk> next move was to get the family together and try it on himself ; he was to stop at no experiment , however desperate , that could convince the nobility that soap was harmless ; if any final doubt remained , he must catch a hermit  the woods were full of them ; saints they called themselves , and saints they were believed to be .
they were unspeakably holy , and worked miracles , and everybody stood in awe of them .
if a hermit could survive a wash , and that failed to convince a duke , give him up , let him alone .
whenever my missionaries overcame a knight <unk> on the road they washed him , and when he got well they swore him to go and get a <unk> and <unk> soap and civilization the rest of his days .
as a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees , and the reform was steadily spreading .
my soap factory felt the strain early .
at first i had only two hands ; but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen , and running night and day ; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer , and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear , although i told him it was worse up there than anywhere else , but he said he wanted plenty of air ; and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway , and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he would n't strangle him .
there were ladies present , too , but much these people ever cared for that ; they would swear before children , if the wind was their way when the factory was going .
this missionary knight 's name was la <unk> male <unk> , and he said that this castle was the abode of <name> <name> <name> , sister of king <name> , and wife of king <unk> , monarch of a realm about as big as the district of columbia  you could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom .
" kings " and " kingdoms " were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in <name> 's time , when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they could n't stretch out without a passport .
la <unk> was much depressed , for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign .
he had not worked off a cake ; yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade , even to the washing of a hermit ; but the hermit died .
this was , indeed , a bad failure , for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr , and would take his place among the saints of the <name> calendar .
thus made he his moan , this poor sir la <unk> male <unk> , and <unk> passing sore .
and so my heart bled for him , and i was moved to comfort and stay him .
wherefore i said : " forbear to grieve , fair knight , for this is not a defeat .
we have brains , you and i ; and for such as have brains there are no defeats , but only victories .
observe how we <name> turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement ; an advertisement for our soap ; and the biggest one , to draw , that was ever thought of ; an advertisement that <name> transform that mount washington defeat into a matterhorn victory .
we <name> put on your <unk> , <unk> by the elect . '
how does that strike you ? "
" verily , it is <unk> bethought ! "
" well , a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little <unk> ad , it 's a corker . "
so the poor <unk> 's griefs vanished away .
he was a brave fellow , and had done mighty feats of arms in his time .
his chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine , which he had once made with a damsel named <unk> , who was as handy with her tongue as was <name> , though in a different way , for her tongue <unk> forth only railings and insult , whereas <name> 's music was of a <unk> sort .
i knew his story well , and so i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell .
he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it .
<name> and i discussed his story , as we rode along , and she said that la <unk> 's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip ; for the king 's fool had overthrown him on the first day , and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror , but <unk> did n't do it ; and also persisted afterward in sticking to him , after all his defeats .
but , said i , suppose the <name> should decline to accept his spoil ?
she said that that would n't answer  he must .
he could n't decline ; it would n't be regular .
i made a note of that .
if <name> 's music got to be too burdensome , some time , i would let a knight defeat me , on the chance that she would desert to him .
in due time we were challenged by the <unk> , from the castle walls , and after a parley admitted .
i have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit .
but it was not a disappointment , for i knew mrs. <name> <name> by reputation , and was not expecting anything pleasant .
she was held in awe by the whole realm , for she had made everybody believe she was a great <unk> .
all her ways were wicked , all her instincts devilish .
she was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice .
all her history was black with crime ; and among her crimes murder was common .
i was most curious to see her ; as curious as i could have been to see satan .
to my surprise she was beautiful ; black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive , age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its <unk> freshness .
she could have passed for old <unk> ' granddaughter , she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son .
as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence .
king <unk> was there , a <unk> old man with a subdued look ; and also the son , sir <unk> <name> <unk> , in whom i was , of course , interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights , and also on account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus , which <name> had been <unk> me with .
but <name> was the main attraction , the conspicuous personality here ; she was head chief of this household , that was plain .
she caused us to be seated , and then she began , with all manner of pretty graces and <unk> , to ask me questions .
dear me , it was like a bird or a flute , or something , talking .
i felt persuaded that this woman must have been <unk> , lied about .
she <unk> along , and <unk> along , and presently a handsome young <name> , clothed like the rainbow , and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave , came with something on a golden <unk> , and , kneeling to present it to her , <unk> his graces and lost his balance , and so fell lightly against her knee .
she slipped a <name> into him in as <unk> a way as another person would have <unk> a rat !
poor child !
he <unk> to the floor , twisted his silken limbs in one great straining <unk> of pain , and was dead .
out of the old king was wrung an involuntary " <unk> ! "
of compassion .
the look he got , made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more <unk> in it .
sir <unk> , at a sign from his mother , went to the anteroom and called some servants , and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk .
i saw that she was a good housekeeper , for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no <unk> in handling the body and getting it out ; when they came with fresh clean towels , she sent back for the other kind ; and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going , she indicated a crimson <unk> the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked .
it was plain to me that la <unk> male <unk> had failed to see the mistress of the house .
often , how louder and clearer than any tongue , does dumb circumstantial evidence speak .
<name> <name> <name> rippled along as musically as ever .
marvelous woman .
and what a glance she had : when it fell in reproof upon those servants , they shrunk and <unk> as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud .
i could have got the habit myself .
it was the same with that poor old <unk> <unk> ; he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension ; she could not even turn toward him but he winced .
in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about king <name> , forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother .
that one little compliment was enough .
she clouded up like storm ; she called for her guards , and said : " hale me these <unk> to the dungeons . "
that struck cold on my ears , for her dungeons had a reputation .
nothing occurred to me to say  or do .
but not so with <name> .
as the guard laid a hand upon me , she piped up with the <unk> confidence , and said : " god 's wounds , dost thou <unk> destruction , thou maniac ?
it is the boss ! "
now what a happy idea that was !  and so simple ; yet it would never have occurred to me .
i was born modest ; not all over , but in spots ; and this was one of the spots .
the effect upon madame was electrical .
it cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments ; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright .
she said : " la , but do list to thine <unk> !
as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who has vanquished <name> , and not be jesting .
by mine enchantments i foresaw your coming , and by them i knew you when you entered here .
i did but play this little jest with <name> to surprise you into some display of your <name> , as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires , consuming them to ashes on the spot , a <name> much beyond mine own ability , yet one which i have long been <unk> curious to see . "
the guards were less curious , and got out as soon as they got permission .
chapter xvii a <name> banquet madame , seeing me pacific and <unk> , no doubt judged that i was deceived by her excuse ; for her fright dissolved away , and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody , that the thing grew to be embarrassing .
however , to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers .
i <name> say this much for the nobility : that , tyrannical , murderous , <unk> , and morally rotten as they were , they were deeply and enthusiastically religious .
nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the <unk> enjoined by the church .
more than once i had seen a <name> who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage , stop to pray before cutting his throat ; more than once i had seen a <name> , after <unk> and <unk> his enemy , retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks , without even waiting to <name> the body .
there was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even <unk> <unk> , that <unk> saint , ten centuries later .
all the nobles of britain , with their families , attended divine service morning and night daily , in their private chapels , and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides .
the credit of this belonged entirely to the church .
although i was no friend to that catholic church , i was obliged to admit this .
and often , in spite of me , i found myself saying , " what would this country be without the church ? "
after prayers we had dinner in a great <unk> hall which was lighted by hundreds of <unk> , and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the <name> degree of the hosts .
at the head of the hall , on a dais , was the table of the king , <name> , and their son , <name> <unk> .
stretching down the hall from this , was the general table , on the floor .
at this , above the salt , sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families , of both sexes ,  the resident court , in effect  <unk> persons ; below the salt sat minor officers of the household , with their principal subordinates : altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting , and about as many <unk> servants standing behind their chairs , or serving in one capacity or another .
it was a very fine show .
in a gallery a band with cymbals , horns , <unk> , and other horrors , opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude <unk> or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as " in the sweet bye and bye . "
it was new , and ought to have been rehearsed a little more .
for some reason or other the <name> had the <unk> hanged , after dinner .
after this music , the priest who stood behind the <name> table said a <name> long <name> in ostensible latin .
then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts , and darted , rushed , flew , fetched and carried , and the mighty feeding began ; no words anywhere , but absorbing attention to business .
the rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison , and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery .
the havoc continued an hour and a half , and unimaginable was the destruction of <unk> .
of the chief feature of the feast  the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start  nothing was left but the semblance of a <unk> ; and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes .
with the <unk> and so on , the heavy drinking began  and the talk .
gallon after gallon of wine and <unk> disappeared , and everybody got comfortable , then happy , then <unk> joyous  both sexes ,  and by and by pretty noisy .
men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear , but nobody blushed ; and when the nub was sprung , the assemblage let go with a <unk> that shook the fortress .
ladies answered back with <unk> that would almost have made <name> <name> of <unk> or even the great <name> of england hide behind a handkerchief , but nobody hid here , but only laughed  howled , you may say .
in pretty much all of these dreadful stories , ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes , but that did n't worry the chaplain any , he had his laugh with the rest ; more than that , upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was <name> that night .
by midnight everybody was fagged out , and sore with laughing ; and , as a rule , drunk : some <unk> , some affectionately , some <unk> , some <unk> , some dead and under the table .
of the ladies , the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess , whose <unk> this was ; and indeed she was a spectacle , sure enough .
just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the regent <unk> , at the famous dinner whence she was carried , <unk> , intoxicated , and helpless , to her bed , in the lost and lamented days of the ancient regime .
suddenly , even while the priest was lifting his hands , and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing , there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired <name> , leaning upon a <unk> ; and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the <name> and cried out : " the wrath and curse of god fall upon you , woman without pity , who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick , nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him ! "
everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright , for a curse was an awful thing to those people ; but the <name> rose up majestic , with the <unk> in her eye , and flung back this ruthless command : " lay hands on her !
to the stake with her ! "
the guards left their posts to obey .
it was a shame ; it was a cruel thing to see .
what could be done ?
<name> gave me a look ; i knew she had another inspiration .
i said : " do what you choose . "
she was up and facing toward the <name> in a moment .
she indicated me , and said : " madame , he saith this may not be .
recall the commandment , or he <name> dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the <unk> fabric of a dream ! "
confound it , what a crazy contract to pledge a person to !
what if the <name>  but my consternation subsided there , and my panic passed off ; for the <name> , all in a collapse , made no show of resistance but gave a <unk> sign and sunk into her seat .
when she reached it she was sober .
so were many of the others .
the assemblage rose , <unk> ceremony to the winds , and rushed for the door like a mob ; overturning chairs , smashing crockery , tugging , struggling , shouldering , crowding  anything to get out before i should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space .
well , well , well , they were a superstitious lot .
it is all a body can do to conceive of it .
the poor <name> was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to <name> the <unk> without first consulting me .
i was very sorry for her  indeed , any one would have been , for she was really suffering ; so i was willing to do anything that was reasonable , and had no <name> to <name> things to wanton extremities .
i therefore considered the matter thoughtfully , and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that sweet bye and bye again , which they did .
then i saw that she was right , and gave her permission to <name> the whole band .
this little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the <name> .
a statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of <unk> authority upon all occasions that offer , for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates , and thus tends to undermine his strength .
a little concession , now and then , where it can do no harm , is the wiser policy .
now that the <name> was at ease in her mind once more , and <unk> happy , her wine naturally began to assert itself again , and it got a little the start of her .
i mean it set her music going  her silver <name> of a tongue .
dear me , she was a master talker .
it would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired man and very sleepy .
i wished i had gone off to bed when i had the chance .
now i must stick it out ; there was no other way .
so she <unk> along and along , in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle , until by and by there came , as if from deep down under us , a far-away sound , as of a muffled shriek  with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl .
the <name> stopped , and her eyes lighted with pleasure ; she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens .
the sound bored its way up through the stillness again .
" what is it ? "
i said .
" it is truly a stubborn soul , and <unk> long .
it is many hours now . "
" <unk> what ? "
" the rack .
come  ye shall see a blithe sight .
an he yield not his secret now , ye shall see him torn asunder . "
what a silky smooth <unk> she was ; and so composed and serene , when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that man 's pain .
conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches , we tramped along echoing corridors , and down stone stairways dank and dripping , and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night  a chill , uncanny journey and a long one , and not made the shorter or the <unk> by the <unk> 's talk , which was about this sufferer and his crime .
he had been accused by an anonymous <unk> , of having killed a stag in the <name> preserves .
i said : " anonymous testimony is n't just the right thing , your highness .
it were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser . "
" i had not thought of that , it being but of small consequence .
but an i would , i could not , for that the accuser came masked by night , and told the forester , and straightway got him hence again , and so the forester knoweth him not . "
" then is this unknown the only person who saw the stag killed ? "
" marry , no man saw the killing , but this unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay , and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester . "
" so the unknown was near the dead stag , too ?
is n't it just possible that he did the killing himself ?
his loyal zeal  in a mask  looks just a shade suspicious .
but what is your highness 's idea for racking the prisoner ?
where is the profit ? "
" he <name> not confess , else ; and then were his soul lost .
for his crime his life is forfeited by the law  and of a <unk> <name> i see that he <unk> it !  but it were peril to my own soul to let him die <unk> and <unk> .
nay , i were a fool to fling me into hell for his accommodation . "
" but , your highness , suppose he has nothing to confess ? "
" as to that , we shall see , anon .
an i rack him to death and he confess not , it <name> peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confess  ye <name> <name> that that is sooth ?
then shall i not be damned for an <unk> man that had naught to confess  wherefore , i shall be safe . "
it was the stubborn unreasoning of the time .
it was useless to argue with her .
arguments have no chance against petrified training ; they wear it as little as the waves wear a <name> .
and her training was everybody 's .
the brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective .
as we entered the <unk> i caught a picture that <name> not go from me ; i wish it would .
a native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back , with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over <unk> at either end .
there was no color in him ; his features were <unk> and set , and <unk> stood upon his forehead .
a priest bent over him on each side ; the executioner stood by ; guards were on duty ; smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls ; in a corner crouched a poor young creature , her face drawn with anguish , a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes , and in her lap lay a little child asleep .
just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn , which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman ; but i shouted , and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke .
i could not let this horror go on ; it would have killed me to see it .
i asked the <name> to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately ; and when she was going to object i spoke in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before her servants , but i must have my way ; for i was king <unk> representative , and was speaking in his name .
she saw she had to yield .
i asked her to <unk> me to these people , and then leave me .
it was not pleasant for her , but she took the pill ; and even went further than i was meaning to require .
i only wanted the backing of her own authority ; but she said : " ye <name> do in all things as this lord shall command .
it is the boss . "
it was certainly a good word to <unk> with : you could see it by the squirming of these rats .
the <name> 's guards fell into line , and she and they marched away , with their <unk> , and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating <unk> .
i had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed , and <unk> applied to his hurts , and wine given him to drink .
the woman crept near and looked on , eagerly , lovingly , but <unk> ,  like one who fears a repulse ; indeed , she tried furtively to touch the man 's forehead , and jumped back , the picture of fright , when i turned unconsciously toward her .
it was pitiful to see .
" lord , " i said , " stroke him , lass , if you want to .
do anything you 're a mind to ; do n't mind me . "
why , her eyes were as grateful as an animal 's , when you do it a kindness that it understands .
the baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the man 's in a minute and her hands <unk> his hair , and her happy tears running down .
the man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes , which was all he could do .
i judged i might clear the den , now , and i did ; cleared it of all but the family and myself .
then i said : " now , my friend , tell me your side of this matter ; i know the other side . "
the man moved his head in sign of refusal .
but the woman looked pleased  as it seemed to me  pleased with my suggestion .
i went on  " you know of me ? "
" yes .
all do , in <name> 's realms . "
" if my reputation has come to you right and straight , you should not be afraid to speak . "
the woman broke in , eagerly : " ah , fair my lord , do thou persuade him !
thou canst an thou wilt .
ah , he <unk> so ; and it is for me  for me !
and how can i bear it ?
i would i might see him die  a sweet , swift death ; oh , my <name> , i can not bear this one ! "
and she fell to sobbing and <unk> about my feet , and still imploring .
imploring what ?
the man 's death ?
i could not quite get the bearings of the thing .
but <name> interrupted her and said : " peace !
ye wit not what ye ask .
shall i starve whom i love , to win a gentle death ?
i <unk> thou <unk> me better . "
" well , " i said , " i ca n't quite make this out .
it is a puzzle .
now  " " ah , dear my lord , an ye <name> but persuade him !
consider how these his tortures wound me !
oh , and he <name> not speak !  whereas , the healing , the solace that lie in a blessed swift death  " " what are you <unk> about ?
he 's going out from here a free man and whole  he 's not going to die . "
the man 's white face lit up , and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of <name> , and cried out : " he is saved !  for it is the king 's word by the mouth of the king's servant  <name> , the king whose word is gold ! "
" well , then you do believe i can be trusted , after all .
why did n't you before ? "
" who doubted ?
not i , indeed ; and not she . "
" well , why would n't you tell me your story , then ? "
" ye had made no promise ; else had it been otherwise . "
" i see , i see ... . and yet i believe i do n't quite see , after all .
you stood the torture and refused to confess ; which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess  " " i , my lord ?
how so ?
it was i that killed the deer ! "
" you did ?
oh , dear , this is the most mixed-up business that ever  " " dear lord , i begged him on my knees to confess , but  " " you did !
it gets thicker and thicker .
what did you want him to do that for ? "
" sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain . "
" well  yes , there is reason in that .
but he did n't want the quick death . "
" he ?
why , of a <unk> he did . "
" well , then , why in the world didn't he confess ? "
" ah , sweet sir , and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter ? "
" oh , heart of gold , now i see it !
the bitter law takes the convicted man 's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans .
they could torture you to death , but without conviction or confession they could not <name> your wife and baby .
you stood by them like a man ; and you  true wife and the woman that you are  you would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and death  well , it <unk> a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice .
i 'll book you both for my colony ; you 'll like it there ; it 's a factory where i 'm going to turn groping and <unk> <unk> into men . "
chapter xviii in the <name> 's dungeons well , i arranged all that ; and i had the man sent to his home .
i had a great <name> to rack the executioner ; not because he was a good , painstaking and <unk> official ,  for surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions well  but to pay him back for wantonly <unk> and otherwise distressing that young woman .
the priests told me about this , and were generously hot to have him punished .
something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then .
i mean , episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and <unk> , but that many , even the great majority , of these that were down on the ground among the common people , were sincere and <unk> , and devoted to the <unk> of human troubles and sufferings .
well , it was a thing which could not be helped , so i seldom fretted about it , and never many minutes at a time ; it has never been my way to bother much about things which you ca n't cure .
but i did not like it , for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an established church .
we must have a religion  it goes without saying  but my idea is , to have it cut up into forty free sects , so that they <name> police each other , as had been the case in the united states in my time .
concentration of power in a political machine is bad ; and an established church is only a political machine ; it was invented for that ; it is nursed , <unk> , preserved for that ; it is an enemy to human <name> , and does no good which it could not better do in a <unk> and scattered condition .
that was n't law ; it was n't gospel : it was only an opinion  my opinion , and i was only a man , one man : so it wasn't worth any more than the pope 's  or any less , for that matter .
well , i could n't rack the executioner , neither would i overlook the just complaint of the priests .
the man must be punished somehow or other , so i degraded him from his office and made him leader of the band  the new one that was to be started .
he begged hard , and said he could n't play  a plausible excuse , but too thin ; there was n't a musician in the country that could .
the <name> was a good deal outraged , next morning when she found she was going to have neither <name> 's life nor his property .
but i told her she must bear this cross ; that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the man 's life and his property , there were <unk> circumstances , and so in <name> the king's name i had pardoned him .
the deer was <unk> the man 's fields , and he had killed it in sudden passion , and not for gain ; and he had carried it into the <name> forest in the <name> that that might make detection of the <unk> impossible .
confound her , i couldn't make her see that sudden passion is an <unk> circumstance in the killing of venison  or of a person  so i gave it up and let her <unk> it out .
i did think i was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the <name> modified that crime .
" crime ! "
she exclaimed .
" how thou <unk> !
crime , forsooth !
man , i am going to pay for him ! "
oh , it was no use to waste sense on her .
training  training is everything ; training is all there is to a person .
we speak of nature ; it is folly ; there is no such thing as nature ; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training .
we have no thoughts of our own , no opinions of our own ; they are transmitted to us , trained into us .
all that is original in us , and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us , can be covered up and hidden by the point of a <unk> needle , all the rest being atoms contributed by , and inherited from , a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the <unk> or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and <unk> developed .
and as for me , all that i think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage , this pathetic drift between the <unk> , is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life , and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly me : the rest may land in <unk> and welcome for all i care .
no , confound her , her intellect was good , she had brains enough , but her training made her an ass  that is , from a <unk> point of view .
to kill the <name> was no crime  it was her right ; and upon her right she stood , serenely and unconscious of offense .
she was a result of generations of training in the <unk> and <unk> belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one .
well , we must give even satan his due .
she deserved a compliment for one thing ; and i tried to pay it , but the words stuck in my throat .
she had a right to kill the boy , but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him .
that was law for some other people , but not for her .
she knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad , and that i ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it , but i could n't  my mouth refused .
i could n't help seeing , in my fancy , that poor old <unk> with the broken heart , and that fair young creature lying butchered , his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood .
how could she pay for him !
whom could she pay ?
and so , well knowing that this woman , trained as she had been , deserved praise , even <unk> , i was yet not able to utter it , trained as i had been .
the best i could do was to fish up a compliment from outside , so to speak  and the pity of it was , that it was true : " madame , your people <name> adore you for this . "
quite true , but i meant to <name> her for it some day if i lived .
some of those laws were too bad , altogether too bad .
a master might kill his slave for nothing  for mere spite , malice , or to pass the time  just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with his slave , that is to say , anybody .
a gentleman could kill a free commoner , and pay for him  cash or <unk> .
a <name> could kill a <name> without expense , as far as the law was concerned , but <unk> in kind were to be expected .
<unk> could kill <unk> , except the commoner and the slave ; these had no privileges .
if they killed , it was murder , and the law wouldn't stand murder .
it made short work of the <unk>  and of his family , too , if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks .
if a commoner gave a <name> even so much as a <unk> which did n't kill or even hurt , he got <unk> dose for it just the same ; they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses , and all the world came to see the show , and crack jokes , and have a good time ; and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough , and as properly <unk> , as any that have been printed by the pleasant <unk> in his chapter about the <unk> of <name> xv 's poor awkward enemy .
i had had enough of this grisly place by this time , and wanted to leave , but i could n't , because i had something on my mind that my conscience kept <unk> me about , and would n't let me forget .
if i had the <unk> of man , he would n't have any conscience .
it is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person ; and although it certainly does a great deal of good , it can not be said to pay , in the long run ; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort .
still , this is only my opinion , and i am only one man ; others , with less experience , may think differently .
they have a right to their view .
i only stand to this : i have noticed my conscience for many years , and i know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else i started with .
i suppose that in the beginning i prized it , because we prize anything that is ours ; and yet how foolish it was to think so .
if we look at it in another way , we see how absurd it is : if i had an anvil in me would i prize it ?
of course not .
and yet when you come to think , there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil  i mean for comfort .
i have noticed it a thousand times .
and you could dissolve an anvil with acids , when you could n't stand it any longer ; but there is n't any way that you can work off a conscience  at least so it <name> stay worked off ; not that i know of , anyway .
there was something i wanted to do before leaving , but it was a disagreeable matter , and i hated to go at it .
well , it bothered me all the morning .
i could have mentioned it to the old king , but what would be the use ?  he was but an extinct volcano ; he had been active in his time , but his fire was out , this good while , he was only a stately <unk> now ; gentle enough , and kindly enough for my purpose , without doubt , but not <unk> .
he was nothing , this so-called king : the <name> was the only power there .
and she was a vesuvius .
as a favor , she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you , but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city .
however , i reflected that as often as any other way , when you are expecting the worst , you get something that is not so bad , after all .
so i braced up and placed my matter before her <name> highness .
i said i had been having a general <unk> at camelot and among neighboring castles , and with her permission i would like to examine her collection , her bric-a-brac  that is to say , her prisoners .
she resisted ; but i was expecting that .
but she finally consented .
i was expecting that , too , but not so soon .
that about ended my discomfort .
she called her guards and torches , and we went down into the dungeons .
these were down under the <unk> foundations , and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock .
some of these cells had no light at all .
in one of them was a woman , in foul rags , who sat on the ground , and would not answer a question or speak a word , but only looked up at us once or twice , through a cobweb of tangled hair , as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life ; after that , she sat bowed , with her <unk> fingers idly <unk> in her lap , and gave no further sign .
this poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age , apparently ; but only apparently ; she had been there nine years , and was eighteen when she entered .
she was a commoner , and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir <unk> <unk> <unk> , a neighboring lord whose <unk> her father was , and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called <name> <unk> du <unk> , and , moreover , had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood .
the young husband had interfered at that point , believing the bride 's life in danger , and had flung the <name> out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests , in the parlor , and left him there astonished at this strange treatment , and <unk> embittered against both bride and groom .
the said lord being cramped for <unk> had asked the <name> to accommodate his two criminals , and here in her <unk> they had been ever since ; hither , indeed , they had come before their crime was an hour old , and had never seen each other since .
here they were , <unk> like toads in the same rock ; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other , yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not .
all the first years , their only question had been  asked with <unk> and tears that might have moved stones , in time , perhaps , but hearts are not stones : " is he alive ? "
" is she alive ? "
but they had never got an answer ; and at last that question was not asked any more  or any other .
i wanted to see the man , after hearing all this .
he was thirty-four years old , and looked sixty .
he sat upon a squared block of stone , with his head bent down , his <unk> resting on his knees , his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face , and he was muttering to himself .
he raised his <name> and looked us slowly over , in a listless dull way , blinking with the distress of the torchlight , then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us .
there were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present .
on his wrists and ankles were <unk> , old smooth scars , and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with <unk> and fetters attached ; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground , and was thick with rust .
chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner .
i could not rouse the man ; so i said we would take him to her , and see  to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him , once  roses , pearls , and dew made flesh , for him ; a <unk> , the <unk> of nature : with eyes like no other eyes , and voice like no other voice , and a freshness , and lithe young <name> , and beauty , that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams  as he thought  and to no other .
the sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping ; the sight of her  but it was a disappointment .
they sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each other 's faces a while , with a sort of weak animal curiosity ; then forgot each other 's presence , and dropped their eyes , and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about .
i had them taken out and sent to their friends .
the <name> did not like it much .
not that she felt any personal interest in the matter , but she thought it disrespectful to sir <unk> <unk> <unk> .
however , i assured her that if he found he could n't stand it i would fix him so that he could .
i set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful <unk> , and left only one in captivity .
he was a lord , and had killed another lord , a sort of kinsman of the <name> .
that other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him , but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat .
however , it was not for that that i left him jailed , but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages .
the <name> was bound to <name> him for killing her kinsman , but i would not allow it : it was no crime to kill an assassin .
but i said i was willing to let her <name> him for destroying the well ; so she concluded to put up with that , as it was better than nothing .
dear me , for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven men and women were shut up there !
indeed , some were there for no distinct offense at all , but only to gratify somebody 's spite ; and not always the <name> 's by any means , but a friend 's .
the newest prisoner 's crime was a mere remark which he had made .
he said he believed that men were about all alike , and one man as good as another , barring clothes .
he said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd , he could n't tell the king from a quack doctor , nor a duke from a hotel clerk .
apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training .
i set him loose and sent him to the factory .
some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice , and in each of these an <unk> had been pierced outward to the daylight , and so the captive had a thin <name> from the blessed sun for his comfort .
the case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard .
from his dusky <unk> hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the <unk> and see his own home off yonder in the valley ; and for twenty-two years he had watched it , with <unk> and longing , through that crack .
he could see the lights shine there at night , and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come out  his wife and children , some of them , no doubt , though he could not make out at that distance .
in the course of years he noted festivities there , and tried to rejoice , and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be .
and he noted funerals ; and they wrung his heart .
he could make out the coffin , but he could not determine its size , and so could not tell whether it was wife or child .
he could see the procession form , with priests and mourners , and move solemnly away , bearing the secret with them .
he had left behind him five children and a wife ; and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue , and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant .
so he had lost five of his treasures ; there must still be one remaining  one now infinitely , unspeakably precious ,  but which one ?
wife , or child ?
that was the question that tortured him , by night and by day , asleep and awake .
well , to have an interest , of some sort , and half a <name> of light , when you are in a dungeon , is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect .
this man was in pretty good condition yet .
by the time he had finished telling me his <unk> tale , i was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself , if you have got average human curiosity ; that is to say , i was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left .
so i took him over home myself ; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was , too  <unk> and <unk> of frantic <name> , and whole <unk> of happy tears ; and by <name> !
we found the aforetime young matron <unk> toward the imminent verge of her half century , and the babies all men and women , and some of them married and experimenting <unk> themselves  for not a soul of the tribe was dead !
conceive of the ingenious <unk> of that <name> : she had a special hatred for this prisoner , and she had invented all those funerals herself , to <unk> his heart with ; and the <unk> stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the <unk> a funeral short , so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing .
but for me , he never would have got out .
<name> <name> <name> hated him with her whole heart , and she never would have softened toward him .
and yet his crime was committed more in <unk> than deliberate depravity .
he had said she had red hair .
well , she had ; but that was no way to speak of it .
when red-headed people are above a certain social grade their hair is <unk> .
consider it : among these forty-seven captives there were five whose names , offenses , and dates of <unk> were no longer known !
one woman and four men  all bent , and wrinkled , and <unk> patriarchs .
they themselves had long ago forgotten these details ; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them , nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way .
the succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that god had put them there , for some wise purpose or other , and teach them that <name> , <unk> , and submission to oppression was what he loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank , had traditions about these poor old human ruins , but nothing more .
these traditions went but little way , for they concerned the length of the <unk> only , and not the names of the offenses .
and even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years : how much longer this privation has lasted was not <unk> .
the king and the <name> knew nothing about these poor creatures , except that they were heirlooms , assets inherited , along with the throne , from the former firm .
nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons , and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value , and had felt no interest in them .
i said to the <name> : " then why in the world did n't you set them free ? "
the question was a <unk> .
she did n't know why she had n't , the thing had never come up in her mind .
so here she was , <unk> the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle <unk> , without knowing it .
it seemed plain to me now , that with her training , those inherited prisoners were merely property  nothing more , nothing less .
well , when we inherit property , it does not occur to us to throw it away , even when we do not value it .
when i brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sun  previously <unk> them , in <name> for eyes so long <unk> by light  they were a spectacle to look at .
skeletons , <unk> , goblins , pathetic <unk> , every one ; <unk> possible children of monarchy by the <name> of god and the established church .
i muttered absently : " i wish i could photograph them ! "
you have seen that kind of people who <name> never let on that they do n't know the meaning of a new big word .
the more ignorant they are , the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven't shot over their heads .
the <name> was just one of that sort , and was always making the <unk> blunders by reason of it .
she hesitated a moment ; then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension , and she said she would do it for me .
i thought to myself : she ?
why what can she know about <unk> ?
but it was a poor time to be thinking .
when i looked around , she was moving on the procession with an axe !
well , she certainly was a curious one , was <name> <name> <name> .
i have seen a good many kinds of women in my time , but she laid over them all for variety .
and how sharply characteristic of her this episode was .
she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession ; but being in doubt , it was just like her to try to do it with an axe .
chapter xix <unk> as a trade <name> and i were on the road again , next morning , bright and early .
it was so good to open up one 's lungs and take in whole <unk> <unk> of the blessed god 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> air once more , after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical <unk> of that intolerable old <unk> !
i mean , for me : of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for <name> , for she had been used to high life all her days .
poor girl , her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while , and i was expecting to get the consequences .
i was right ; but she had stood by me most <unk> in the castle , and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic <unk> which were worth more for the occasion than <unk> double their size ; so i thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while , if she wanted to , and i felt not a pang when she started it up : " now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <name> of age southward  " " are you going to see if you can work up another <unk> on the trail of the cowboys , <name> ? "
" even so , fair my lord . "
" go ahead , then .
i wo n't interrupt this time , if i can help it .
begin over again ; start fair , and shake out all your reefs , and i <name> load my pipe and give good attention . "
" now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <name> of age southward .
and so they came into a deep forest , and by fortune they were <unk> , and rode along in a deep way , and at the last they came into a <unk> where abode the duke of south marches , and there they asked harbour .
and on the morn the duke sent unto sir marhaus , and bad him make him ready .
and so sir marhaus arose and armed him , and there was a mass <name> afore him , and he brake his fast , and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle , there they should do the battle .
so there was the duke already on horseback , clean armed , and his six sons by him , and every each had a spear in his hand , and so they encountered , whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him , but sir marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them .
then came the four sons by couples , and two of them brake their spears , and so did the other two .
and all this while sir marhaus touched them not .
then sir marhaus ran to the duke , and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth .
and so he served his sons .
and then sir marhaus alight down , and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him .
and then some of his sons recovered , and would have set upon sir marhaus .
then sir marhaus said to the duke , cease thy sons , or else i <name> do the uttermost to you all .
when the duke saw he might not escape the death , he cried to his sons , and charged them to yield them to sir marhaus .
and they kneeled all down and put the <unk> of their swords to the knight , and so he received them .
and then they <unk> up their father , and so by their common assent promised unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king <name> , and thereupon at <unk> after , to come he and his sons , and put them in the king 's <name> .
* [ <unk> : the story is borrowed , language and all , from the <unk> <unk>  m.t . ]
" even so standeth the history , fair sir boss .
now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to <name> 's court ! "
" why , <name> , you ca n't mean it ! "
" an i speak not sooth , let it be the worse for me . "
" well , well , well ,  now who would ever have thought it ?
one whole duke and six <unk> ; why , <name> , it was an elegant haul .
<unk> is a most <unk> trade , and it is tedious hard work , too , but i begin to see that there is money in it , after all , if you have luck .
not that i would ever engage in it as a business , for i would n't .
no sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation .
a successful whirl in the <unk> line  now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts ?
it 's just a corner in pork , that 's all , and you ca n't make anything else out of it .
you 're <name>  yes ,  suddenly <name>  for about a day , maybe a week ; then somebody corners the market on you , and down goes your <unk> ; ai n't that so , <name> ? "
" <unk> it be that my mind <unk> , <unk> simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come <unk> and <unk>  " " there 's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way , <name> , it 's so , just as i say .
i know it 's so .
and , moreover , when you come right down to the <unk> , <unk> is worse than pork ; for whatever happens , the pork 's left , and so somebody 's benefited anyway ; but when the market breaks , in a <unk> whirl , and every knight in the pool passes in his checks , what have you got for assets ?
just a <unk> of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware .
can you call those assets ?
give me pork , every time .
am i right ? "
" ah , peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters <unk> the <unk> of these but late <unk> <unk> and <unk> whereby not i alone nor you alone , but every each of us , <unk>  " " no , it 's not your head , <name> .
your head 's all right , as far as it goes , but you do n't know business ; that 's where the trouble is .
it <unk> you to argue about business , and you 're wrong to be always trying .
however , that aside , it was a good haul , anyway , and <name> breed a handsome crop of reputation in <unk> court .
and speaking of the cowboys , what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old .
now there 's <name> <name> <name> , as fresh and young as a <unk> <unk> , to all appearances , and here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with sword and <name> at his time of life , after raising such a family as he has raised .
as i understand it , sir gawaine killed seven of his sons , and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to take into camp .
and then there was that damsel of sixty <name> of age still <unk> around in her frosty bloom  how old are you , <name> ? "
it was the first time i ever struck a still place in her .
the mill had shut down for repairs , or something .
chapter xx the ogre 's castle between six and nine we made ten miles , which was plenty for a horse carrying triple  man , woman , and armor ; then we stopped for a long <unk> under some trees by a limpid <name> .
right so came by and by a knight riding ; and as he <name> near he made <unk> moan , and by the words of it i perceived that he was cursing and swearing ; yet nevertheless was i glad of his coming , for that i saw he bore a <unk> whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ : " use peterson 's <unk> <unk>  all the go . "
i was glad of his coming , for even by this token i knew him for knight of mine .
it was sir <unk> de la <unk> , a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending sir launcelot down over his <unk> once .
he was never long in a stranger 's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact .
but there was another fact of nearly the same size , which he never pushed upon anybody <unk> , and yet never withheld when asked : that was , that the reason he did n't quite succeed was , that he was interrupted and sent down over <unk> himself .
this innocent vast <unk> did not see any particular difference between the two facts .
i liked him , for he was <name> in his work , and very valuable .
and he was so fine to look at , with his broad mailed shoulders , and the grand <unk> set of his plumed head , and his big shield with its quaint device of a <unk> hand clutching a <unk> <unk> , with motto : " try <unk> . "
this was a <unk> that i was introducing .
he was <unk> , he said , and indeed he looked it ; but he would not alight .
he said he was after the <unk> man ; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew .
the <unk> referred to was sir <unk> of <unk> , a brave knight , and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once , with no less a mogul than sir <unk> himself  although not successfully .
he was of a light and laughing disposition , and to him nothing in this world was serious .
it was for this reason that i had chosen him to work up a <unk> sentiment .
there were no stoves yet , and so there could be nothing serious about <unk> .
all that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change , and have them established in <unk> toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage .
sir <unk> was very bitter , and brake out anew with <unk> .
he said he had cursed his soul to rags ; and yet he would not get down from his horse , neither would he take any rest , or listen to any comfort , until he should have found sir <unk> and settled this account .
it appeared , by what i could piece together of the <unk> fragments of his statement , that he had chanced upon sir <unk> at <name> of the morning , and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and <unk> , he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for <unk> and <unk> with characteristic zeal sir <unk> had plunged away at once upon this quest , and after three hours of awful <unk> riding had overhauled his game .
and behold , it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before !
poor old creatures , it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth .
" <unk> him , " said sir <unk> , " an i do not <unk> him an i may find him , leave it to me ; for never no knight that <unk> <unk> or aught else may do me this <unk> and bide on live , an i may find him , the which i have <unk> sworn a great oath this day . "
and with these words and others , he lightly took his spear and <unk> him thence .
in the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves , in the edge of a poor village .
he was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years ; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now ; but to him these were all strangers , his memory was gone , his mind was stagnant .
it seemed incredible that a man could <unk> half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat , but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it .
they could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood , when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother 's hands and went away into that long oblivion .
the people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his <unk> and forgotten offense ; but this old wife knew ; and so did her old child , who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name , a thought , a formless image , a tradition , all her life , and now was suddenly <unk> into actual flesh and blood and set before her face .
it was a curious situation ; yet it is not on that account that i have made room for it here , but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious .
to wit , that this dreadful matter brought from these <unk> people no outburst of rage against these <unk> .
they had been <unk> and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness .
yes , here was a curious revelation , indeed , of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery .
their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of <name> , resignation , dumb <unk> acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life .
their very imagination was dead .
when you can say that of a man , he has struck bottom , i reckon ; there is no lower deep for him .
i rather wished i had gone some other road .
this was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind .
for it could not help bringing up the <unk> fact that , all gentle cant and <unk> to the contrary notwithstanding , no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by <unk> talk and moral <unk> : it being immutable law that all revolutions that <name> succeed must begin in blood , whatever may answer afterward .
if history teaches anything , it teaches that .
what this folk needed , then , was a reign of terror and a <unk> , and i was the wrong man for them .
two days later , toward noon , <name> began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy .
she said we were approaching the <unk> castle .
i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock .
the object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind ; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment , and roused up in me a smart interest .
<unk> excitement increased every moment ; and so did mine , for that sort of thing is catching .
my heart got to thumping .
you ca n't reason with your heart ; it has its own laws , and <unk> about things which the intellect <unk> .
presently , when <name> slid from the horse , motioned me to stop , and went creeping stealthily , with her head bent nearly to her knees , toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity , the <unk> grew stronger and quicker .
and they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity ; and also while i was creeping to her side on my knees .
her eyes were burning now , as she pointed with her finger , and said in a panting whisper : " the castle !
the castle !
lo , where it looms ! "
what a welcome disappointment i experienced !
i said : " castle ?
it is nothing but a <unk> ; a <unk> with a wattled fence around it . "
she looked surprised and distressed .
the animation faded out of her face ; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent .
then : " it was not enchanted aforetime , " she said in a musing fashion , as if to herself .
" and how strange is this <name> , and how awful  that to the one perception it is enchanted and <unk> in a base and shameful aspect ; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted , hath suffered no change , but stands firm and stately still , girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers .
and god shield us , how it <unk> the heart to see again these gracious captives , and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces !
we have tarried along , and are to blame . "
i saw my cue .
the castle was enchanted to me , not to her .
it would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion , it couldn't be done ; i must just humor it .
so i said : " this is a common case  the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another .
you have heard of it before , <name> , though you have n't happened to experience it .
but no harm is done .
in fact , it is lucky the way it is .
if these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves , it would be necessary to break the enchantment , and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment .
and hazardous , too ; for in attempting a <unk> without the true key , you are liable to err , and turn your hogs into dogs , and the dogs into cats , the cats into rats , and so on , and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally , or to an <unk> gas which you ca n't follow  which , of course , amounts to the same thing .
but here , by good luck , no one 's eyes but mine are under the enchantment , and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it .
these ladies remain ladies to you , and to themselves , and to everybody else ; and at the same time they <name> suffer in no way from my delusion , for when i know that an ostensible hog is a <name> , that is enough for me , i know how to treat her . "
" thanks , oh , sweet my lord , thou <unk> like an <name> .
and i know that thou wilt deliver them , for that thou <name> minded to great deeds and <name> as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to <name> and to do , as any that is on live . "
" i <name> not leave a <name> in the sty , <name> .
are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are <unk> <unk>  " " the <unk> , are they changed also ?
it is most wonderful .
now am i fearful ; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine <unk> of stature are to thee invisible ?
ah , go warily , fair sir ; this is a mightier <unk> than i <unk> . "
" you be easy , <name> .
all i need to know is , how much of an ogre is invisible ; then i know how to locate his vitals .
do n't you be afraid , i <name> make short work of these <unk> .
stay where you are . "
i left <name> kneeling there , <unk> but plucky and hopeful , and rode down to the <unk> , and struck up a trade with the <unk> .
i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies , which was rather above latest quotations .
i was just in time ; for the church , the lord of the manor , and the rest of the <unk> would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock , leaving the <unk> very short of hogs and <name> out of princesses .
but now the tax people could be paid in cash , and there would be a stake left besides .
one of the men had ten children ; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the <unk> one for <unk> , the wife burst out upon him , and offered him a child and said : " thou beast without bowels of <name> , why leave me my child , yet <name> me of the <unk> to feed it ? "
how curious .
the same thing had happened in the wales of my day , under this same old established church , which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise .
i sent the three men away , and then opened the sty gate and beckoned <name> to come  which she did ; and not leisurely , but with the rush of a prairie fire .
and when i saw her fling herself upon those hogs , with tears of <name> running down her cheeks , and strain them to her heart , and kiss them , and caress them , and call them reverently by grand princely names , i was ashamed of her , ashamed of the human race .
we had to drive those hogs home  ten miles ; and no ladies were ever more <unk> or contrary .
they would stay in no road , no path ; they broke out through the brush on all sides , and flowed away in all directions , over rocks , and hills , and the roughest places they could find .
and they must not be struck , or roughly accosted ; <name> could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank .
the <unk> old sow of the lot had to be called my <name> , and your highness , like the rest .
it is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs , in armor .
there was one small countess , with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back , that was the devil for perversity .
she gave me a race of an hour , over all sorts of country , and then we were right where we had started from , having made not a <name> of real progress .
i seized her at last by the tail , and brought her along squealing .
when i overtook <name> she was horrified , and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train .
we got the hogs home just at dark  most of them .
the <name> <unk> de <unk> was missing , and two of her ladies in waiting : namely , miss <name> <unk> , and the <unk> <name> <unk> , the former of these two being a young black sow with a white <name> in her forehead , and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward <unk> on the starboard side  a couple of the <unk> blisters to drive that i ever saw .
also among the missing were several mere <unk>  and i wanted them to stay missing ; but no , all that <unk> had to be found ; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end .
of course , the whole drove was housed in the house , and , great guns !  well , i never saw anything like it .
nor ever heard anything like it .
and never smelt anything like it .
it was like an insurrection in a <unk> .
chapter xxi the pilgrims when i did get to bed at last i was unspeakably tired ; the stretching out , and the relaxing of the <unk> muscles , how luxurious , how delicious !
but that was as far as i could get  sleep was out of the question for the present .
the ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again , and kept me broad awake .
being awake , my thoughts were busy , of course ; and mainly they busied themselves with <unk> curious delusion .
here she was , as sane a person as the kingdom could produce ; and yet , from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman .
my land , the power of training !
of influence !
of education !
it can bring a body up to believe anything .
i had to put myself in <name> 's place to realize that she was not a lunatic .
yes , and put her in mine , to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught .
if i had told <name> i had seen a wagon , <unk> by enchantment , spin along fifty miles an hour ; had seen a man , <unk> with magic powers , get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds ; and had listened , without any <unk> help , to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away , <name> would not merely have supposed me to be crazy , she would have thought she knew it .
everybody around her believed in enchantments ; nobody had any doubts ; to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty , and its occupants into hogs , would have been the same as my doubting among connecticut people the <unk> of the telephone and its wonders ,  and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind , an unsettled reason .
yes , <name> was sane ; that must be admitted .
if i also would be sane  to <name>  i must keep my superstitions about <unk> and <unk> locomotives , balloons , and <unk> , to myself .
also , i believed that the world was not flat , and had n't pillars under it to support it , nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above ; but as i was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions , i recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter , too , if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman .
the next morning <name> assembled the swine in the dining-room and gave them their breakfast , waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island , ancient and modern , have always felt for rank , let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may .
i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my lofty official rank ; but i had n't , and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint .
<name> and i had our breakfast at the second table .
the family were not at home .
i said : " how many are in the family , <name> , and where do they keep themselves ? "
" family ? "
" yes . "
" which family , good my lord ? "
" why , this family ; your own family . "
" sooth to say , i understand you not .
i have no family . "
" no family ?
why , <name> , is n't this your home ? "
" now how indeed might that be ?
i have no home . "
" well , then , whose house is this ? "
" ah , wit you well i would tell you an i knew myself . "
" come  you do n't even know these people ?
then who invited us here ? "
" none invited us .
we but came ; that is all . "
" why , woman , this is a most extraordinary performance .
the effrontery of it is beyond admiration .
we blandly march into a man 's house , and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth , and then it turns out that we do n't even know the man 's name .
how did you ever venture to take this extravagant <name> ?
i supposed , of course , it was your home .
what <name> the man say ? "
" what <name> he say ?
forsooth what can he say but give thanks ? "
" thanks for what ? "
her face was filled with a puzzled surprise : " verily , thou <unk> mine understanding with strange words .
do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to <name> his house withal ? "
" well , no  when you come to that .
no , it 's an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this . "
" then let him be thankful , and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility ; he were a dog , else , and the heir and ancestor of dogs . "
to my mind , the situation was uncomfortable .
it might become more so .
it might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on .
so i said : " the day is wasting , <name> .
it is time to get the nobility together and be moving . "
" wherefore , fair sir and boss ? "
" we want to take them to their home , do n't we ? "
" la , but list to him !
they be of all the regions of the earth !
each must <unk> to her own home ; <unk> you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as he hath appointed that created life , and thereto death likewise with help of <name> , who by sin done through persuasion of his <unk> , she being wrought upon and <unk> by the <unk> of the great enemy of man , that serpent <unk> satan , aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by <unk> spite and envy <unk> in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature <unk> so white and pure <unk> it hove with the shining multitudes its <unk> in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that <name> estate and  " " great <name> ! "
" my lord ? "
" well , you know we have n't got time for this sort of thing .
don't you see , we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we ca n't .
we must n't talk now , we must act .
you want to be careful ; you mustn't let your mill get the start of you that way , at a time like this .
to business now  and sharp 's the word .
who is to take the aristocracy home ? "
" even their friends .
these <name> come for them from the far parts of the earth . "
this was lightning from a clear sky , for <unk> ; and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner .
she would remain to deliver the goods , of course .
" well , then , <name> , as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended , i <name> go home and report ; and if ever another one  " " i also am ready ; i <name> go with thee . "
this was recalling the pardon .
" how ?
you <name> go with me ?
why should you ? "
" <name> i be traitor to my knight , dost think ?
that were dishonor .
i may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some <unk> champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me .
i were to blame an i thought that that might ever <unk> . "
" elected for the long term , " i sighed to myself .
" i may as well make the best of it . "
so then i spoke up and said : " all right ; let us make a start . "
while she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork , i gave that whole peerage away to the servants .
and i asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and <unk> ; but they considered that that would be hardly worth while , and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom , and therefore likely to make talk .
a departure from custom  that settled it ; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that .
the servants said they would follow the fashion , a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance ; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls , and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible .
it was a kind of satire on nature : it was the scientific method , the <unk> method ; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record ; and the <unk> could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years .
the first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims .
it was not going our way , but we joined it , nevertheless ; for it was hourly being borne in upon me now , that if i would govern this country wisely , i must be posted in the details of its life , and not at second hand , but by personal observation and scrutiny .
this company of pilgrims resembled chaucer 's in this : that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show , and a corresponding variety of costume .
there were young men and old men , young women and old women , lively folk and grave folk .
they rode upon mules and horses , and there was not a <unk> in the party ; for this specialty was to remain unknown in england for nine hundred years yet .
it was a pleasant , friendly , sociable herd ; pious , happy , <name> and full of unconscious <unk> and innocent <unk> .
what they regarded as the <name> tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best english society twelve centuries later .
practical jokes worthy of the english wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line , and compelled the <unk> applause ; and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other , you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along ; and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake .
<name> knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage , and she posted me .
she said : " they journey to the valley of holiness , for to be blessed of the <unk> hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from sin . "
" where is this watering place ? "
" it lieth a <unk> journey hence , by the borders of the land that <unk> the cuckoo kingdom . "
" tell me about it .
is it a celebrated place ? "
" oh , of a truth , yes .
there be none more so .
of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks .
belike were none in the world more holy than these ; for they gave themselves to study of pious books , and spoke not the one to the other , or indeed to any , and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto , and slept hard , and prayed much , and washed never ; also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay .
right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy <unk> , and visited by <name> and poor , and <unk> . "
" proceed . "
" but always there was lack of water there .
whereas , upon a time , the holy abbot prayed , and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place .
now were the fickle monks tempted of the fiend , and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by <unk> and <unk> that he would construct a bath ; and when he was become <unk> and might not resist more , he said have ye your <name> , then , and granted that they asked .
now <name> thou what 't is to forsake the ways of purity the which he <unk> , and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense .
these monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow ; and lo , in that moment his sign appeared , in miraculous rebuke !
for his insulted waters ceased to flow , and utterly vanished away . "
" they fared mildly , <name> , considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country . "
" belike ; but it was their first sin ; and they had been of perfect life for long , and differing in naught from the angels .
prayers , tears , <unk> of the flesh , all was vain to beguile that water to flow again .
even processions ; even <unk> ; even <unk> candles to the virgin , did fail every each of them ; and all in the land did <name> . "
" how odd to find that even this industry has its financial <unk> , and at times sees its <unk> and greenbacks <unk> to zero , and everything come to a standstill .
go on , <name> . "
" and so upon a time , after year and day , the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath .
and behold , his anger was in that moment appeased , and the waters gushed richly forth again , and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure . "
" then i take it nobody has washed since . "
" he that would essay it could have his halter free ; yes , and swiftly would he need it , too . "
" the community has prospered since ? "
" even from that very day .
the fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands .
from every land came monks to join ; they came even as the fishes come , in shoals ; and the monastery added building to building , and yet others to these , and so spread wide its arms and took them in .
and nuns came , also ; and more again , and yet more ; and built over against the monastery on the <name> side of the vale , and added building to building , until mighty was that nunnery .
and these were friendly unto those , and they joined their loving labors together , and together they built a fair great <unk> asylum midway of the valley between . "
" you spoke of some hermits , <name> . "
" these have gathered there from the ends of the earth .
a hermit <unk> best where there be multitudes of pilgrims .
ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting .
if any shall mention a hermit of a kind he <unk> new and not to be found but in some far strange land , let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that valley of holiness , and whatsoever be his breed , it <unk> not , he shall find a sample of it there . "
i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored face , purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact ; but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up , in the immemorial way , to that same old anecdote  the one sir <unk> told me , what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it .
i excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession , sad at heart , willing to go hence from this troubled life , this vale of tears , this brief day of broken rest , of cloud and storm , of weary struggle and monotonous defeat ; and yet shrinking from the change , as remembering how long eternity is , and how many have <unk> thither who know that anecdote .
early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims ; but in this one was no merriment , no jokes , no laughter , no playful ways , nor any happy <unk> , whether of youth or age .
yet both were here , both age and youth ; gray old men and women , strong men and women of middle age , young husbands , young wives , little boys and girls , and three babies at the breast .
even the children were <unk> ; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down , and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair .
they were slaves .
chains led from their fettered feet and their <unk> hands to a <unk> belt about their waists ; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart , by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line .
they were on foot , and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days , upon the cheapest odds and ends of food , and stingy rations of that .
they had slept in these chains every night , bundled together like swine .
they had upon their bodies some poor rags , but they could not be said to be clothed .
their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were <unk> and <unk> .
their naked feet were torn , and none walked without a limp .
originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates , but about half had been sold on the trip .
the trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end .
with this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain , and straightened them up .
he did not speak ; the whip conveyed his <name> without that .
none of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by ; they showed no consciousness of our presence .
and they made no sound but one ; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file , as forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison .
the file moved in a cloud of its own making .
all these faces were gray with a coating of dust .
one has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses , and has written his idle thought in it with his finger .
i was reminded of this when i noticed the faces of some of those women , young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom , how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces , plain to see , and lord , how plain to read !
for it was the track of tears .
one of these young mothers was but a girl , and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing , and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child , a breast that ought not to know trouble yet , but only the gladness of the morning of life ; and no doubt  she reeled just then , giddy with fatigue , and down came the lash and flicked a <unk> of skin from her naked shoulder .
it stung me as if i had been hit instead .
the master halted the file and jumped from his horse .
he stormed and swore at this girl , and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness , and as this was the last chance he should have , he would settle the account now .
she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg , and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror , but the master gave no attention .
he snatched the child from her , and then made the <unk> who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body ; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed , she shrieking and struggling the while piteously .
one of the men who was holding her turned away his face , and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged .
all our pilgrims looked on and commented  on the expert way in which the whip was handled .
they were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment .
this was what slavery could do , in the way of <unk> what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling ; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people , and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that .
i wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free , but that would not do .
i must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the country 's laws and the citizen 's rights <unk> .
if i lived and prospered i would be the death of slavery , that i was resolved upon ; but i would try to fix it so that when i became its executioner it should be by command of the nation .
just here was the wayside shop of a smith ; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back , <unk> here where her irons could be taken off .
they were removed ; then there was a <unk> between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith .
the moment the girl was delivered from her irons , she flung herself , all tears and frantic <unk> , into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped .
he strained her to his breast , and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses , and washed them with the rain of his tears .
i suspected .
i inquired .
yes , i was right ; it was husband and wife .
they had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away , and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight ; and even after that , we could still make out the fading <unk> of those receding shrieks .
and the husband and father , with his wife and child gone , never to be seen by him again in life ?  well , the look of him one might not bear at all , and so i turned away ; but i knew i should never get his picture out of my mind again , and there it is to this day , to wring my <unk> whenever i think of it .
we put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall , and when i rose next morning and looked abroad , i was ware where a knight came riding in the golden <name> of the new day , and recognized him for knight of mine  sir <unk> <name> cure hardy .
he was in the gentlemen 's furnishing line , and his <unk> specialty was plug hats .
he was clothed all in steel , in the <unk> armor of the time  up to where his helmet ought to have been ; but he had n't any helmet , he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat , and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see .
it was another of my <unk> schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd .
sir <unk> 's saddle was <name> about with leather hat boxes , and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it .
i dressed and ran down to welcome sir <unk> and get his news .
" how is trade ? "
i asked .
" ye <name> note that i have but these four left ; yet were they sixteen <unk> i got me from camelot . "
" why , you have certainly done nobly , sir <unk> .
where have you been <unk> of late ? "
" i am but now come from the valley of holiness , please you sir . "
" i am pointed for that place myself .
is there anything stirring in the <unk> , more than common ? "
" by the mass ye may not question it ! ... .
give him good feed , boy , and stint it not , an thou <unk> thy crown ; so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as i bid ... . sir , it is <unk> news i bring , and  be these pilgrims ?
then ye may not do better , good folk , than gather and hear the tale i have to tell , sith it <unk> you , <unk> as ye go to find that ye <name> not find , and seek that ye <name> seek in vain , my life being hostage for my word , and my word and message being these , namely : that a <unk> has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years , which was the first and last time that that said misfortune <unk> the holy valley in that form by commandment of the most high <unk> by reasons just and causes <unk> contributing , wherein the matter  " " the miraculous <unk> hath ceased to flow ! "
this shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once .
" ye say well , good people .
i was <unk> to it , even when ye spake . "
" has somebody been washing again ? "
" nay , it is suspected , but none believe it .
it is thought to be some other sin , but none wit what . "
" how are they feeling about the calamity ? "
" none may describe it in words .
the <unk> is these nine days dry .
the prayers that did begin then , and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes , and the holy processions , none of these have ceased nor night nor day ; and so the monks and the nuns and the <unk> be all exhausted , and do <name> up prayers writ upon parchment , sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice .
and at last they sent for thee , sir boss , to try magic and enchantment ; and if you could not come , then was the messenger to fetch <name> , and he is there these three days now , and saith he <name> fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it ; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his <unk> to <unk> them hither and help , but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet , even so much as might <unk> as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he <unk> betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task ; and if ye  " breakfast was ready .
as soon as it was over i showed to sir <unk> these words which i had written on the inside of his hat : " chemical department , laboratory extension , section g. <unk> .
send two of first size , two of no .
3 , and six of no .
4 , together with the proper <unk> details  and two of my trained assistants . "
and i said : " now get you to camelot as fast as you can fly , brave knight , and show the writing to <name> , and tell him to have these required matters in the valley of holiness with all possible dispatch . "
" i <name> well , sir boss , " and he was off .
chapter xxii the holy fountain the pilgrims were human beings .
otherwise they would have acted differently .
they had come a long and difficult journey , and now when the journey was nearly finished , and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist , they did n't do as horses or cats or <unk> would probably have done  turn back and get at something profitable  no , anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain , they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be .
there is no accounting for human beings .
we made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness , and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features .
that is , its large features .
these were the three masses of buildings .
they were distant and isolated <unk> shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert  and was .
such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death .
but there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its <unk> ; this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze , and so faintly , so softly , that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits .
we reached the monastery before dark , and there the males were given lodging , but the women were sent over to the nunnery .
the bells were close at hand now , and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom .
a superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face .
everywhere , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> appeared , flitted about and disappeared , noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream , and as uncanny .
the old abbot 's <name> to see me was pathetic .
even to tears ; but he did the shedding himself .
he said : " delay not , son , but get to thy saving work .
an we bring not the water back again , and soon , we are ruined , and the good work of two hundred years must end .
and see thou do it with enchantments that be holy , for the church <name> not endure that work in her cause be done by devil 's magic . "
" when i work , father , be sure there <name> be no devil 's work connected with it .
i shall use no arts that come of the devil , and no elements not created by the hand of god .
but is <name> working strictly on pious lines ? "
" ah , he said he would , my son , he said he would , and took oath to make his promise good . "
" well , in that case , let him proceed . "
" but surely you <name> not sit idle by , but help ? "
" it <name> not answer to mix methods , father ; neither would it be professional courtesy .
two of a trade must not <unk> each other .
we might as well cut rates and be done with it ; it would arrive at that in the end .
<name> has the contract ; no other magician can touch it till he throws it up . "
" but i <name> take it from him ; it is a terrible emergency and the act is thereby justified .
and if it were not so , who <name> give law to the church ?
the church giveth law to all ; and what she wills to do , that she may do , hurt whom it may .
i <name> take it from him ; you shall begin upon the moment . "
" it may not be , father .
no doubt , as you say , where power is supreme , one can do as one likes and suffer no injury ; but we poor magicians are not so situated .
<name> is a very good magician in a small way , and has quite a neat provincial reputation .
he is struggling along , doing the best he can , and it would not be etiquette for me to take his job until he himself <unk> it . "
the abbot 's face lighted .
" ah , that is simple .
there are ways to persuade him to abandon it . "
" <unk> , father , it <unk> not , as these people say .
if he were persuaded against his <name> , he would load that well with a malicious enchantment which would balk me until i found out its secret .
it might take a month .
i could set up a little enchantment of mine which i call the telephone , and he could not find out its secret in a hundred years .
yes , you perceive , he might block me for a month .
would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this ? "
" a month !
the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder .
have it thy way , my son .
but my heart is heavy with this disappointment .
leave me , and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting , even as i have done these ten long days , <unk> thus the thing that is called rest , the prone body making outward sign of repose where inwardly is none . "
of course , it would have been best , all round , for <name> to <unk> etiquette and quit and call it half a day , since he would never be able to start that water , for he was a true magician of the time ; which is to say , the big miracles , the ones that gave him his reputation , always had the luck to be performed when nobody but <name> was present ; he could n't start this well with all this crowd around to see ; a crowd was as bad for a magician 's miracle in that day as it was for a <unk> 's miracle in mine ; there was sure to be some <unk> on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything .
but i did not want <name> to retire from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively myself ; and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot , and that would take two or three days .
my presence gave the monks <name> , and cheered them up a good deal ; insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days .
as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food , their spirits began to rise fast ; when the <unk> began to go round they rose faster .
by the time everybody was <unk> over , the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it ; so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line .
matters got to be very jolly .
good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter ; and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells .
at last i ventured a story myself ; and vast was the success of it .
not right off , of course , for the native of those islands does not , as a rule , dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing ; but the fifth time i told it , they began to crack in places ; the eight time i told it , they began to crumble ; at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks ; and at the fifteenth they disintegrated , and i got a broom and swept them up .
this language is <unk> .
those islanders  well , they are slow pay at first , in the matter of return for your investment of effort , but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast .
i was at the well next day <unk> .
<name> was there , enchanting away like a beaver , but not raising the moisture .
he was not in a pleasant humor ; and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too <unk> for a novice he <unk> his tongue and cursed like a bishop  french bishop of the regency days , i mean .
matters were about as i expected to find them .
the " fountain " was an ordinary well , it had been dug in the ordinary way , and stoned up in the ordinary way .
there was no miracle about it .
even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous ; i could have told it myself , with one hand tied behind me .
the well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a <unk> chapel , whose walls were <name> with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good ; pictures historically <unk> of <unk> miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking .
that is , nobody but angels ; they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the fore  so as to get put in the picture , perhaps .
angels are as fond of that as a fire company ; look at the old masters .
the <unk> was dimly lighted by lamps ; the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks , and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone <unk> outside in the chapel  when there was water to draw , i mean  and none but monks could enter the <unk> .
i entered it , for i had temporary authority to do so , by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate .
but he had n't entered it himself .
he did everything by incantations ; he never worked his intellect .
if he had stepped in there and used his eyes , instead of his disordered mind , he could have cured the well by natural means , and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way ; but no , he was an old <unk> , a magician who believed in his own magic ; and no magician can thrive who is <unk> with a superstition like that .
i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak ; that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape .
i measured the chain  98 feet .
then i called in a couple of monks , locked the door , took a candle , and made them lower me in the bucket .
when the chain was all paid out , the candle confirmed my suspicion ; a considerable section of the wall was gone , exposing a good big fissure .
i almost regretted that my theory about the well 's trouble was correct , because i had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle .
i remembered that in <name> , many centuries later , when an oil well ceased to flow , they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo .
if i should find this well dry and no explanation of it , i could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it .
it was my idea to appoint <name> .
however , it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb .
one can not have everything the way he would like it .
a man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment , anyway ; he ought to make up his mind to get even .
that is what i did .
i said to myself , i am in no hurry , i can wait ; that bomb <name> come good yet .
and it did , too .
when i was above ground again , i turned out the monks , and let down a <unk> ; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep , and there was forty-one feet of water in it .
i called in a monk and asked : " how deep is the well ? "
" that , sir , i wit not , having never been told . "
" how does the water usually stand in it ? "
" near to the top , these two centuries , as the testimony <unk> , brought down to us through our predecessors . "
it was true  as to recent times at least  for there was witness to it , and better witness than a monk ; only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use , the rest of it was <unk> and <name> .
what had happened when the well gave out that other time ?
without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak , and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by <unk> that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again .
the leak had befallen again now , and these children would have prayed , and <unk> , and <unk> their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away , and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a <unk> into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter .
old habit of mind is one of the <unk> things to get away from in the world .
it transmits itself like physical form and feature ; and for a man , in those days , to have had an idea that his ancestors had n't had , would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate .
i said to the monk : " it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well , but we <name> try , if my brother <name> fails .
brother <name> is a very passable artist , but only in the <unk> line , and he may not succeed ; in fact , is not likely to succeed .
but that should be nothing to his discredit ; the man that can do this kind of miracle knows enough to keep hotel . "
" hotel ?
i mind not to have heard  " " of hotel ?
it 's what you call <unk> .
the man that can do this miracle can keep <unk> .
i can do this miracle ; i shall do this miracle ; yet i do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain . "
" none knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood , indeed ; for it is of record that aforetime it was <unk> difficult and took a year .
<unk> , god send you good success , and to that end <name> we pray . "
as a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult .
many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising .
that monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise ; he would fill up the others .
in two days the solicitude would be booming .
on my way home at noon , i met <name> .
she had been <unk> the hermits .
i said : " i would like to do that myself .
this is wednesday .
is there a <unk> ? "
" a which , please you , sir ? "
" <unk> .
do they keep open afternoons ? "
" who ? "
" the hermits , of course . "
" keep open ? "
" yes , keep open .
is n't that plain enough ?
do they knock off at noon ? "
" knock off ? "
" knock off ?  yes , knock off .
what is the matter with knock off ?
i never saw such a <unk> ; ca n't you understand anything at all ?
in plain terms , do they shut up shop , draw the game , bank the fires  " " shut up shop , draw  " " there , never mind , let it go ; you make me tired .
you ca n't seem to understand the simplest thing . "
" i would i might please thee , sir , and it is to me dole and sorrow that i fail , albeit sith i am but a simple damsel and taught of none , being from the cradle <unk> in those deep waters of learning that do <unk> with a sovereignty him that <unk> of that most <name> sacrament , investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the humble mortal who , by bar and lack of that great consecration <unk> in his own <unk> estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief do lie <unk> and <unk> , and so , when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery , these <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , it is but by the <name> of god that he burst not for envy of the mind that can <unk> , and tongue that can deliver so great and <unk> miracles of speech , and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler mind , and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders , then if so be this <unk> is not vain but sooth and true , wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and may not lightly be <unk> , nor had been , an ye had noted this complexion of mood and mind and understood that that i would i could not , and that i could not i might not , nor yet nor might nor could , nor <unk> nor <unk> , might be by advantage turned to the desired would , and so i pray you <name> of my fault , and that ye <name> of your kindness and your <name> forgive it , good my master and most dear lord . "
i could n't make it all out  that is , the details  but i got the general idea ; and enough of it , too , to be ashamed .
it was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the <unk> infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she could n't get their drift ; and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could , too , and no fault of hers that she couldn't fetch the home plate ; and so i apologized .
then we <unk> pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together , and better friends than ever .
i was gradually coming to have a mysterious and <unk> reverence for this girl ; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those <unk> <unk> sentences of hers , it was borne in upon me that i was standing in the awful presence of the mother of the <name> language .
i was so impressed with this , that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me i unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence , and stood uncovered ; and if words had been water , i had been drowned , sure .
she had exactly the <name> way ; whatever was in her mind to be delivered , whether a mere remark , or a sermon , or a <unk> , or the history of a war , she would get it into a single sentence or die .
whenever the literary <name> dives into a sentence , that is the last you are going to see of him till he <unk> on the other side of his atlantic with his verb in his mouth .
we drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon .
it was a most strange menagerie .
the chief emulation among them seemed to be , to see which could manage to be the <unk> and most prosperous with vermin .
their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent <unk> .
it was one <unk> 's pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested ; it was another 's to <name> against a rock , all day long , conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray ; it was another 's to go naked and crawl around on all fours ; it was another 's to drag about with him , year in and year out , eighty pounds of iron ; it was another 's to never lie down when he slept , but to stand among the <unk> and snore when there were pilgrims around to look ; a woman , who had the white hair of age , and no other apparel , was black from crown to heel with forty-seven years of holy <unk> from water .
groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects , lost in reverent wonder , and envious of the <unk> sanctity which these pious <unk> had won for them from an exacting heaven .
by and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones .
he was a mighty celebrity ; his fame had penetrated all christendom ; the <name> and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence .
his stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley ; and it took all that space to hold his crowds .
his stand was a pillar sixty feet high , with a broad platform on the top of it .
he was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up there  bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet .
it was his way of praying .
i timed him with a stop watch , and he made <unk> revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds .
it seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste .
it was one of the most useful motions in mechanics , the <unk> movement ; so i made a note in my memorandum book , purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it .
i afterward carried out that scheme , and got five years ' good service out of him ; in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand first-rate <unk> shirts , which was ten a day .
i worked him sundays and all ; he was going , sundays , the same as week days , and it was no use to waste the power .
these shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materials  i furnished those myself , it would not have been right to make him do that  and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece , which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in <unk> .
they were regarded as a perfect protection against sin , and advertised as such by my knights everywhere , with the <unk> and <unk> ; insomuch that there was not a <name> or a <unk> or a dead wall in england but you could read on it at a mile distance : " buy the only genuine st. <unk> ; patronized by the nobility .
patent applied for . "
there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with .
as it extended , i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings , and a <unk> thing for <unk> and that sort , with ruffles down the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> up with a <unk> to leeward and then hauled aft with a <unk> and <unk> up with a <unk> in the standing rigging forward of the <unk> .
yes , it was a <name> .
but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg , and i found that there was something the matter with the other one ; so i stocked the business and unloaded , taking sir <unk> de <unk> into camp financially along with certain of his friends ; for the works stopped within a year , and the good saint got him to his rest .
but he had earned it .
i can say that for him .
when i saw him that first time  however , his personal condition <name> not quite bear description here .
you can read it in the lives of the saints .
* [ <unk> the details concerning the hermits , in this chapter , are from lecky  but greatly modified .
this book not being a history but only a tale , the majority of the historian 's <name> details were too strong for reproduction in it.  editor ] chapter xxiii restoration of the fountain saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while .
<name> was still burning <unk> , and pawing the air , and muttering <unk> as hard as ever , but looking pretty <unk> , for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet .
finally i said : " how does the thing promise by this time , partner ? "
" behold , i am even now busied with trial of the <unk> enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the east ; an it fail me , naught can avail .
peace , until i finish . "
he raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region , and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits , for the wind was their way , and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog .
he poured out volumes of speech to match , and <unk> his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way .
at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting , and about exhausted .
now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns , and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of <unk> , all drawn by the prodigious smoke , and all in a grand state of excitement .
the abbot inquired anxiously for results .
<name> said : " if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters , this which i have but just essayed had done it .
it has failed ; whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is a truth established ; the sign of this failure is , that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the east , and whose name none may utter and live , has laid his spell upon this well .
the mortal does not breathe , nor ever <name> , who can penetrate the secret of that spell , and without that secret none can break it .
the water <name> flow no more forever , good father .
i have done what man could .
suffer me to go . "
of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation .
he turned to me with the signs of it in his face , and said : " ye have heard him .
is it true ? "
" part of it is . "
" not all , then , not all !
what part is true ? "
" that that spirit with the russian name has put his spell upon the well . "
" god 's wounds , then are we ruined ! "
" possibly . "
" but not certainly ?
ye mean , not certainly ? "
" that is it . "
" wherefore , ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell  " " yes , when he says that , he says what is n't necessarily true .
there are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chance  that is , some small , some trifling chance  of success . "
" the conditions  " " oh , they are nothing difficult .
only these : i want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile , entirely to myself from sunset to-day until i remove the ban  and nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority . "
" are these all ? "
" yes . "
" and you have no fear to try ? "
" oh , none .
one may fail , of course ; and one may also succeed .
one can try , and i am ready to chance it .
i have my conditions ? "
" these and all others ye may name .
i <name> issue commandment to that effect . "
" wait , " said <name> , with an evil smile .
" ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirit 's name ? "
" yes , i know his name . "
" and wit you also that to know it <unk> not of itself , but ye must likewise pronounce it ?
<unk> !
knew ye that ? "
" yes , i knew that , too . "
" you had that knowledge !
<name> a fool ?
are ye minded to utter that name and die ? "
" utter it ?
why certainly .
i would utter it if it was welsh . "
" ye are even a dead man , then ; and i go to tell <name> . "
" that 's all right .
take your <unk> and get along .
the thing for you to do is to go home and work the weather , <name> w .
<name> . "
it was a home shot , and it made him wince ; for he was the worst <unk> in the kingdom .
whenever he ordered up the <unk> along the coast there was a week 's dead calm , sure , and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained <unk> .
but i kept him in the weather bureau right along , to undermine his reputation .
however , that shot raised his <unk> , and instead of starting home to report my death , he said he would remain and enjoy it .
my two experts arrived in the evening , and pretty well fagged , for they had traveled double tides .
they had <unk> along , and had brought everything i needed  tools , pump , lead pipe , greek fire , sheaves of big rockets , <name> candles , colored fire <unk> , electric apparatus , and a lot of <unk>  everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle .
they got their supper and a nap , and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite <unk> the required conditions .
we took possession of the well and its surroundings .
my boys were experts in all sorts of things , from the <unk> up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument .
an hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in <unk> fashion , and the water began to rise .
then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel , locked up the place , and went home to bed .
before the noon mass was over , we were at the well again ; for there was a deal to do yet , and i was determined to spring the miracle before midnight , for business reasons : for whereas a miracle worked for the church on a week-day is worth a good deal , it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a <name> .
in nine hours the water had risen to its customary level  that is to say , it was within twenty-three feet of the top .
we put in a little iron pump , one of the first turned out by my works near the capital ; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the <unk> and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold , where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time .
we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel , where we <unk> it down fast , poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom , then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand , all the different breeds of rockets there are ; and they made a portly and imposing sheaf , i can tell you .
we grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder , we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of the roof  blue on one corner , green on another , red on another , and purple on the last  and grounded a wire in each .
about two hundred yards off , in the flat , we built a pen of <unk> , about four feet high , and laid planks on it , and so made a platform .
we covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion , and topped it off with the abbot 's own throne .
when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race , you want to get in every detail that <name> count ; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye ; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest ; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth .
i know the value of these things , for i know human nature .
you ca n't throw too much style into a miracle .
it costs trouble , and work , and sometimes money ; but it pays in the end .
well , we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel , and then brought them under the ground to the platform , and hid the batteries there .
we put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude , and that finished the work .
my idea was , doors open at <unk> , performance to begin at <unk> sharp .
i wished i could charge admission , but of course that would n't answer .
i instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10 , before anybody was around , and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time , and make the fur fly .
then we went home to supper .
the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time ; and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley .
the lower end of the valley was become one huge camp ; we should have a good house , no question about that .
<unk> went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt , which put every pulse up to fever heat .
they gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at <unk> , up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear ; the bells would then cease from tolling , and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places .
i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot 's solemn procession hove in sight  which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence , because it was a <unk> black night and no torches permitted .
with it came <name> , and took a front seat on the platform ; he was as good as his word for once .
one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban , but they were there , just the same .
the moment the bells stopped , those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave , and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow , and then it solidified itself , and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to  well , miles .
we had a solemn <unk> , now , for about twenty minutes  a thing i had counted on for effect ; it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy .
at length , out of the silence a <name> latin chant  men 's voices  broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night , a majestic tide of <name> .
i had put that up , too , and it was one of the best effects i ever invented .
when it was finished i stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad , for two minutes , with my face uplifted  that always produces a dead hush  and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of <unk> which caused hundreds to tremble , and many women to faint : " <unk> ! "
just as i was moaning out the closing <unk> of that word , i touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare !
it was immense  that effect !
lots of people shrieked , women curled up and quit in every direction , <unk> collapsed by <unk> .
the abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers .
<name> held his grip , but he was astonished clear down to his <unk> ; he had never seen anything to begin with that , before .
now was the time to pile in the effects .
i lifted my hands and groaned out this word  as it were in agony : " <unk> ! "
 and turned on the red fire !
you should have heard that atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue !
after sixty seconds i shouted : " <unk> <unk> ! "
 and lit up the green fire !
after waiting only forty seconds this time , i spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words : " <unk> ! "
 and whirled on the purple glare !
there they were , all going at once , red , blue , green , purple !  four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft , and spreading a blinding <unk> noonday to the furthest confines of that valley .
in the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky , his <unk> stopped for the first time in twenty years .
i knew the boys were at the pump now and ready .
so i said to the abbot : " the time is come , father .
i am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve .
you want to brace up , and take hold of something . "
then i shouted to the people : " behold , in another minute the spell <name> be broken , or no mortal can break it .
if it break , all <name> know it , for you <name> see the sacred water gush from the chapel door ! "
i stood a few moments , to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who could n't hear , and so convey it to the furthest ranks , then i made a grand exhibition of extra <unk> and <unk> , and shouted : " lo , i command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now <unk> into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him , and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit , there to lie bound a thousand years .
by his own dread name i command it  <unk> ! "
then i touched off the hogshead of rockets , and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire <unk> itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush , and burst in <unk> into a storm of flashing jewels !
one mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people  then suddenly broke into a wild <unk> of <name>  for there , fair and plain in the uncanny glare , they saw the freed water leaping forth !
the old abbot could not speak a word , for tears and the <unk> in his throat ; without utterance of any sort , he folded me in his arms and mashed me .
it was more eloquent than speech .
and harder to get over , too , in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel .
you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it ; kiss it , and pet it , and <unk> it , and talk to it as if it were alive , and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings , just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost , and was come home again .
yes , it was pretty to see , and made me think more of them than i had done before .
i sent <name> home on a shutter .
he had caved in and gone down like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name , and had never come to since .
he never had heard that name before ,  neither had i  but to him it was the right one .
any jumble would have been the right one .
he admitted , afterward , that that spirit 's own mother could not have pronounced that name better than i did .
he never could understand how i survived it , and i did n't tell him .
it is only young magicians that give away a secret like that .
<name> spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it .
but he did n't arrive .
when i started to the chapel , the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me , as if i had been some kind of a superior being  and i was .
i was aware of that .
i took along a night shift of monks , and taught them the mystery of the pump , and set them to work , for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night , consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it .
to those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself , and they were full of wonder over it ; and of admiration , too , of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance .
it was a great night , an immense night .
there was reputation in it .
i could hardly get to sleep for <unk> over it .
chapter xxiv a rival magician my influence in the valley of holiness was something prodigious now .
it seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account .
the thought came to me the next morning , and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in .
according to history , the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash .
it might be that there was a <unk> of this <unk> still remaining .
so i sounded a brother : " would n't you like a bath ? "
he shuddered at the thought  the thought of the peril of it to the well  but he said with feeling : " one needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy .
would god i might wash me !
but it may not be , fair sir , tempt me not ; it is forbidden . "
and then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that i was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed , if it sized up my whole influence and <unk> the pile .
so i went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this brother .
he <unk> at the idea  i do n't mean that you could see him <unk> , for of course you could n't see it without you scraped him , and i did n't care enough about it to scrape him , but i knew the <unk> was there , just the same , and within a <unk> 's thickness of the surface , too  <unk> , and trembled .
he said : " ah , son , ask aught else thou wilt , and it is thine , and freely granted out of a grateful heart  but this , oh , this !
would you drive away the blessed water again ? "
" no , father , i <name> not drive it away .
i have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain . "
a large interest began to show up in the old man 's face .
" my knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune , which was caused by quite another sort of sin . "
" these are brave words  but  but right welcome , if they be true . "
" they are true , indeed .
let me build the bath again , father .
let me build it again , and the fountain shall flow forever . "
" you promise this ?  you promise it ?
say the word  say you promise it ! "
" i do promise it . "
" then <name> i have the first bath myself !
go  get ye to your work .
tarry not , tarry not , but go . "
i and my boys were at work , straight off .
the ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery , not a stone missing .
they had been left just so , all these <unk> , and avoided with a pious fear , as things accursed .
in two days we had it all done and the water in  a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in .
it was running water , too .
it came in , and went out , through the ancient pipes .
the old abbot kept his word , and was the first to try it .
he went down black and shaky , leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of <unk> ; but he came back white and joyful , and the game was made !
another triumph scored .
it was a good campaign that we made in that valley of holiness , and i was very well satisfied , and ready to move on now , but i struck a disappointment .
i caught a heavy cold , and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine .
of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there .
this was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me , what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace .
when at last i got out , i was a shadow .
but everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses , and these brought cheer back into my life , and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again ; so i gained fast .
<name> was worn out with nursing ; so i made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone , leaving her at the nunnery to rest up .
my idea was to disguise myself as a <name> of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot .
this would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the <unk> and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms .
there was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it .
if i went among them as a gentleman , there would be restraints and <unk> which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles , and i should get no further than the outside shell .
one morning i was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip , and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley , when i came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice , and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and <unk> .
i knew he had lately been offered a situation in the great sahara , where lions and <unk> made the <unk> peculiarly attractive and difficult , and had gone to africa to take possession , so i thought i would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation .
my surprise was great : the place was newly swept and scoured .
then there was another surprise .
back in the gloom of the cavern i heard the clink of a little <name> , and then this exclamation : " hello central !
is this you , camelot ?  behold , thou <unk> glad thy heart an thou hast <name> to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places  here standeth in the flesh his <unk> the boss , and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak ! "
now what a radical reversal of things this was ; what a <unk> together of extravagant incongruities ; what a fantastic conjunction of <unk> and <unk>  the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one , the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office !
the telephone clerk stepped into the light , and i recognized one of my young fellows .
i said : " how long has this office been established here , <unk> ? "
" but since midnight , fair sir boss , an it please you .
we saw many lights in the valley , and so judged it well to make a station , for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size . "
" quite right .
it is n't a town in the customary sense , but it's a good stand , anyway .
do you know where you are ? "
" of that i have had no time to make inquiry ; for <unk> my comradeship moved hence upon their labors , leaving me in charge , i got me to needed rest , purposing to inquire when i waked , and report the place 's name to camelot for record . "
" well , this is the valley of holiness . "
it did n't take ; i mean , he did n't start at the name , as i had supposed he would .
he merely said : " i <name> so report it . "
" why , the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here !
you did n't hear of them ? "
" ah , ye <name> remember we move by night , and avoid speech with all .
we learn naught but that we get by the telephone from camelot . "
" why they know all about this thing .
have n't they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain ? "
" oh , that ?
indeed yes .
but the name of this valley doth <unk> differ from the name of that one ; indeed to differ wider were not pos  " " what was that name , then ? "
" the valley of <unk> . "
" that explains it .
confound a telephone , anyway .
it is the very demon for conveying <unk> of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense .
but no matter , you know the name of the place now .
call up camelot . "
he did it , and had <name> sent for .
it was good to hear my boy's voice again .
it was like being home .
after some affectionate <unk> , and some account of my late illness , i said : " what is new ? "
" the king and <name> and many of the court do start even in this hour , to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored , and cleanse themselves of sin , and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true <unk> to the clouds  an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile , sith 't was i that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order . "
" does the king know the way to this place ? "
" the king ?  no , nor to any other in his realms , mayhap ; but the lads that <unk> you with your miracle <name> be his guide and lead the way , and appoint the places for rests at <unk> and sleeps at night . "
" this <name> bring them here  when ? "
" <unk> , or later , the third day . "
" anything else in the way of news ? "
" the king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him ; one regiment is complete and officered . "
" the mischief !
i wanted a main hand in that myself .
there is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army . "
" yes  and now ye <name> <name> to know there 's not so much as one west pointer in that regiment . "
" what are you talking about ?
are you in <name> ? "
" it is truly as i have said . "
" why , this makes me uneasy .
who were chosen , and what was the method ?
<unk> examination ? "
" indeed , i know naught of the method .
i but know this  these officers be all of <name> family , and are born  what is it you call it ?  <unk> . "
" there 's something wrong , <name> . "
" comfort yourself , then ; for two candidates for a <unk> do travel hence with the king  young nobles both  and if you but wait where you are you <name> hear them questioned . "
" that is news to the purpose .
i <name> get one west pointer in , anyway .
mount a man and send him to that school with a message ; let him kill horses , if necessary , but he must be there before sunset to-night and say  " " there is no need .
i have laid a ground wire to the school .
prithee let me connect you with it . "
it sounded good !
in this atmosphere of <unk> and lightning communication with distant regions , i was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation .
i realized , then , what a creepy , dull , inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years , and how i had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it .
i gave my order to the superintendent of the academy personally .
i also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches .
i was getting tired of doing without these conveniences .
i could have them now , as i wasn't going to wear armor any more at present , and therefore could get at my pockets .
when i got back to the monastery , i found a thing of interest going on .
the abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall , observing with childish wonder and <name> the performances of a new magician , a fresh arrival .
his dress was the extreme of the fantastic ; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an indian <unk> wears .
he was mowing , and mumbling , and gesticulating , and drawing <unk> figures in the air and on the floor ,  the regular thing , you know .
he was a celebrity from <name>  so he said , and that was enough .
that sort of evidence was as good as gold , and passed current everywhere .
how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this <unk> terms .
his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment ; and what he had done at any time in the past , and what he would do at any time in the future .
he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of the east was doing now ?
the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer  this reverend crowd would like to know what that monarch was at , just as this moment .
the fraud went through some more <unk> , and then made grave announcement : " the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar  one , two , three pieces , and they be all of silver . "
a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out , all around : " it is marvelous ! "
" wonderful ! "
" what study , what labor , to have acquired a so amazing power as this ! "
would they like to know what the supreme lord of <unk> was doing ?
yes .
he told them what the supreme lord of <unk> was doing .
then he told them what the sultan of egypt was at ; also what the king of the remote seas was about .
and so on and so on ; and with each new <name> the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher .
they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time ; but no , he never had to hesitate , he always knew , and always with unerring precision .
i saw that if this thing went on i should lose my supremacy , this fellow would capture my following , i should be left out in the cold .
i must put a <unk> in his wheel , and do it right away , too .
i said : " if i might ask , i should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing . "
" speak , and freely .
i <name> tell you . "
" it <name> be difficult  perhaps impossible . "
" my <name> knoweth not that word .
the more difficult it is , the more certainly <name> i reveal it to you . "
you see , i was working up the interest .
it was getting pretty high , too ; you could see that by the <unk> necks all around , and the <unk> breathing .
so now i <unk> it : " if you make no mistake  if you tell me truly what i want to know  i <name> give you two hundred silver pennies . "
" the fortune is mine !
i <name> tell you what you would know . "
" then tell me what i am doing with my right hand . "
" <unk> ! "
there was a general gasp of surprise .
it had not occurred to anybody in the crowd  that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who was n't ten thousand miles away .
the magician was hit hard ; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before , and it <unk> him ; he did n't know how to meet it .
he looked stunned , confused ; he could n't say a word .
" come , " i said , " what are you waiting for ?
is it possible you can answer up , right off , and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing , and yet ca n't tell what a person is doing who is n't three yards from you ?
persons behind me know what i am doing with my right hand  they <name> <unk> you if you tell correctly . "
he was still dumb .
" very well , i 'll tell you why you do n't speak up and tell ; it is because you do n't know .
you a magician !
good friends , this tramp is a mere fraud and liar . "
this distressed the monks and terrified them .
they were not used to hearing these awful beings called names , and they did not know what might be the consequence .
there was a dead silence now ; superstitious <unk> were in every mind .
the magician began to pull his wits together , and when he presently smiled an easy , <unk> smile , it spread a mighty relief around ; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive .
he said : " it hath struck me speechless , the frivolity of this <unk> speech .
let all know , if perchance there be any who know it not , that <unk> of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings , princes , emperors , them that be born in the purple and them only .
had ye asked me what <name> the great king is doing , it were another matter , and i had told ye ; but the doings of a subject interest me not . "
" oh , i misunderstood you .
i thought you said <unk> , ' and so i supposed <unk> ' included  well , anybody ; that is , everybody . "
" it doth  anybody that is of lofty birth ; and the better if he be <name> . "
" that , it <unk> , might well be , " said the abbot , who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster , " for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness .
our <name> the king  " " would you know of him ? "
broke in the <unk> .
" most gladly , yea , and gratefully . "
everybody was full of awe and interest again right away , the <unk> idiots .
they watched the incantations <unk> , and looked at me with a " there , now , what can you say to that ? "
air , when the announcement came : " the king is weary with the <name> , and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a <unk> sleep . "
" god 's <unk> upon him ! "
said the abbot , and crossed himself ; " may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul . "
" and so it might be , if he were sleeping , " i said , " but the king is not sleeping , the king rides . "
here was trouble again  a conflict of authority .
nobody knew which of us to believe ; i still had some reputation left .
the <unk> scorn was stirred , and he said : " lo , i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days , but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an <unk> to help . "
" you have lived in the woods , and lost much by it .
i use incantations myself , as this good brotherhood are aware  but only on occasions of moment . "
when it comes to <unk> , i reckon i know how to keep my end up .
that <unk> made this fellow squirm .
the abbot inquired after the <name> and the court , and got this information : " they be all on sleep , being overcome by fatigue , like as to the king . "
i said : " that is merely another lie .
half of them are about their amusements , the <name> and the other half are not sleeping , they ride .
now perhaps you can spread yourself a little , and tell us where the king and <name> and all that are this moment riding with them are going ? "
" they sleep now , as i said ; but on the morrow they <name> ride , for they go a journey toward the sea . "
" and where <name> they be the day after to-morrow at <unk> ? "
" far to the north of camelot , and half their journey <name> be done . "
" that is another lie , by the space of a hundred and fifty miles .
their journey <name> not be merely half done , it <name> be all done , and they <name> be here , in this valley . "
that was a <name> shot !
it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement , and it rocked the <unk> to his base .
i followed the thing right up : " if the king does not arrive , i <name> have myself ridden on a rail : if he does i <name> ride you on a rail instead . "
next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line .
i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way .
i kept these matters to myself .
the third day 's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon .
there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming ; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state ; a strange thing , truly .
only one thing could explain this : that other magician had been cutting under me , sure .
this was true .
i asked a friend of mine , a monk , about it , and he said , yes , the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all , but stay at home .
think of that !
observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country .
these people had seen me do the very <unk> bit of magic in history , and the only one within their memory that had a positive value , and yet here they were , ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere <unk> word .
however , it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all , so i went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o'clock to meet him .
and that was the sort of state he arrived in .
the abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome , and no stir of life or clang of <unk> to glad his spirit .
he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces .
the next minute the bells were <unk> furiously , and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns , who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession ; and with them went that magician  and he was on a rail , too , by the abbot 's order ; and his reputation was in the mud , and mine was in the sky again .
yes , a man can keep his <unk> current in such a country , but he ca n't sit around and do it ; he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along .
chapter xxv a <unk> examination when the king traveled for change of air , or made a progress , or visited a distant <name> whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep , part of the administration moved with him .
it was a fashion of the time .
the commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the valley , whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home .
and although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king , he kept some of his business functions going just the same .
he touched for the evil , as usual ; he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases , for he was himself chief justice of the king 's bench .
he shone very well in this latter office .
he was a wise and humane judge , and he clearly did his honest best and fairest ,  according to his lights .
that is a large reservation .
his lights  i mean his rearing  often colored his decisions .
whenever there was a dispute between a <name> or gentleman and a person of lower degree , the king 's <unk> and sympathies were for the former class always , whether he suspected it or not .
it was impossible that this should be otherwise .
the <unk> effects of slavery upon the <unk> moral perceptions are known and conceded , the world over ; and a privileged class , an aristocracy , is but a band of <unk> under another name .
this has a harsh sound , and yet should not be offensive to any  even to the <name> himself  unless the fact itself be an offense : for the statement simply <unk> a fact .
the repulsive feature of slavery is the thing , not its name .
one needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize  and in but indifferently modified measure  the very air and tone of the actual <unk> ; and behind these are the <unk> 's spirit , the <unk> 's blunted feeling .
they are the result of the same cause in both cases : the <unk> old and <unk> custom of regarding himself as a superior being .
the king 's judgments wrought frequent <unk> , but it was merely the fault of his training , his natural and unalterable sympathies .
he was as <unk> for a <unk> as would be the average mother for the position of <unk> to starving children in <unk> ; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest .
one very curious case came before the king .
a young girl , an orphan , who had a considerable estate , married a fine young fellow who had nothing .
the girl 's property was within a <unk> held by the church .
the bishop of the diocese , an arrogant <unk> of the great nobility , claimed the girl 's estate on the ground that she had married privately , and thus had cheated the church out of one of its rights as lord of the <unk>  the one heretofore referred to as <name> <unk> du <unk> .
the penalty of refusal or avoidance was <unk> .
the girl 's defense was , that the lordship of the <unk> was vested in the bishop , and the particular right here involved was not transferable , but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated ; and that an older law , of the church itself , strictly barred the bishop from exercising it .
it was a very odd case , indeed .
it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of london raised the money that built the mansion house .
a person who had not taken the sacrament according to the <unk> rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of london .
thus <unk> were <unk> ; they could not run if asked , they could not serve if elected .
the aldermen , who without any question were yankees in disguise , hit upon this neat device : they passed a by-law imposing a fine of <unk> upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff , and a fine of <unk> upon any person who , after being elected sheriff , refused to serve .
then they went to work and elected a lot of <unk> , one after another , and kept it up until they had collected <unk> in fines ; and there stands the stately mansion house to this day , to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of yankees slipped into london and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth .
the girl 's case seemed strong to me ; the bishop 's case was just as strong .
i did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole .
but he got out .
i append his decision : " truly i find small difficulty here , the matter being even a child 's affair for <unk> .
an the young bride had conveyed notice , as in duty bound , to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop , she had suffered no loss , for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him , for temporary <unk> , eligible to the exercise of his said right , and thus would she have kept all she had .
whereas , failing in her first duty , she hath by that failure failed in all ; for whoso , clinging to a rope , <unk> it above his hands , must fall ; it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound , neither any deliverance from his peril , as he shall find .
<unk> , the woman's case is rotten at the source .
it is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods , even to the last farthing that she doth possess , and be thereto <unk> in the costs .
next ! "
here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old .
poor young creatures !
they had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts .
these clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the <unk> stretch of the <unk> laws allowed to people of their degree ; and in these pretty clothes , she crying on his shoulder , and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair , they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless , <unk> , <unk> ; why , the very beggars by the <unk> were not so poor as they .
well , the king was out of the hole ; and on terms satisfactory to the church and the rest of the aristocracy , no doubt .
men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy , but the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote , brutal laws are impossible .
<name> 's people were of course poor material for a republic , because they had been <unk> so long by monarchy ; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote .
there is a phrase which has grown so common in the world 's mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning  the sense and meaning implied when it is used ; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being " capable of self-government " ; and the implied sense of it is , that there has been a nation somewhere , some time or other which wasn't capable of it  was n't as able to govern itself as some <unk> <unk> were or would be to govern it .
the master minds of all nations , in all ages , have sprung in <unk> multitude from the mass of the nation , and from the mass of the nation only  not from its privileged classes ; and so , no matter what the nation 's intellectual grade was ; whether high or low , the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor , and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself .
which is to assert an always <unk> fact : that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people ; and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades , all the way down to the lowest .
king <name> had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations .
i had not supposed he would move in the matter while i was away ; and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers ; i had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination ; and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my west pointers .
that ought to have been attended to before i left ; for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he could n't wait but must get about it at once , and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head .
i was impatient to see what this was ; and to show , too , how much more admirable was the one which i should display to the examining board .
i intimated this , gently , to the king , and it fired his curiosity .
when the board was assembled , i followed him in ; and behind us came the candidates .
one of these candidates was a bright young west pointer of mine , and with him were a couple of my west point professors .
when i saw the board , i did not know whether to cry or to laugh .
the head of it was the officer known to later centuries as <unk> <unk> !
the two other members were chiefs of <unk> in his department ; and all three were priests , of course ; all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests .
my candidate was called first , out of courtesy to me , and the head of the board opened on him with official solemnity : " name ? "
" <unk> . "
" son of ? "
" webster . "
" webster  webster .
h 'm  i  my memory <unk> to recall the name .
condition ? "
" weaver . "
" weaver !  god keep us ! "
the king was staggered , from his summit to his foundations ; one clerk fainted , and the others came near it .
the chairman pulled himself together , and said indignantly : " it is sufficient .
get you hence . "
but i appealed to the king .
i begged that my candidate might be examined .
the king was willing , but the board , who were all well-born folk , implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver 's son .
i knew they did n't know enough to examine him anyway , so i joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors .
i had had a <unk> prepared , and it was put up now , and the circus began .
it was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war , and wallow in details of battle and siege , of supply , transportation , mining and <unk> , grand tactics , big strategy and little strategy , signal service , infantry , cavalry , artillery , and all about siege guns , field guns , gatling guns , rifled guns , smooth bores , musket practice , revolver practice  and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of , you understand  and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical <unk> on the <unk> that would stump the angels themselves , and do it like nothing , too  all about <unk> , and comets , and <unk> , and constellations , and mean time , and <unk> time , and dinner time , and bedtime , and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could <name> or <unk> an enemy with and make him wish he had n't come  and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last , i was proud enough to hug him , and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified , partly drunk , and wholly caught out and snowed under .
i judged that the cake was ours , and by a large majority .
education is a great thing .
this was the same youth who had come to west point so ignorant that when i asked him , " if a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle , what ought he to do ? "
answered up naively and said : " get up and brush himself . "
one of the young nobles was called up now .
i thought i would question him a little myself .
i said : " can your lordship read ? "
his face flushed indignantly , and he fired this at me : " <unk> me for a clerk ?
i trow i am not of a blood that  " " answer the question ! "
he crowded his wrath down and made out to answer " no . "
" can you write ? "
he wanted to resent this , too , but i said : " you <name> confine yourself to the questions , and make no comments .
you are not here to air your blood or your graces , and nothing of the sort <name> be permitted .
can you write ? "
" no . "
" do you know the multiplication table ? "
" i wit not what ye refer to . "
" how much is 9 times 6 ? "
" it is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the <unk> of it hath not in my <unk> occurred , and so , not having no need to know this thing , i abide barren of the knowledge . "
" if a trade a barrel of onions to b , worth 2 pence the bushel , in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a <name> , and c kill the dog before delivery , because bitten by the same , who mistook him for d , what sum is still due to a from b , and which party pays for the dog , c or d , and who gets the money ?
if a , is the <name> sufficient , or may he claim <unk> damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog , and <unk> as earned <unk> , that is to say , <unk> ? "
" verily , in the <unk> and <unk> providence of god , who <unk> in mysterious ways his wonders to perform , have i never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and <unk> of the ducts of thought .
wherefore i beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several <unk> from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine , for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is , whereas an i tried to help i should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought . "
" what do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation ? "
" if there be such , mayhap his <name> the king did <unk> them whilst that i lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed to hear his proclamation . "
" what do you know of the science of optics ? "
" i know of governors of places , and <unk> of castles , and sheriffs of counties , and many like small offices and titles of honor , but him you call the science of optics i have not heard of before ; peradventure it is a new dignity . "
" yes , in this country . "
try to conceive of this <unk> gravely applying for an official position , of any kind under the sun !
why , he had all the <unk> of a typewriter <unk> , if you leave out the disposition to contribute <unk> <unk> of your grammar and <unk> .
it was unaccountable that he did n't attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job .
but that did n't prove that he had n't material in him for the disposition , it only proved that he was n't a typewriter <unk> yet .
after nagging him a little more , i let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out , on the line of scientific war , and found him empty , of course .
he knew somewhat about the warfare of the time  <unk> around for <unk> , and <unk> in the tournament ring , and such things  but otherwise he was empty and useless .
then we took the other young <name> in hand , and he was the first one 's twin , for ignorance and incapacity .
i delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough .
they were examined in the previous order of precedence .
" name , so please you ? "
" <unk> , son of sir <unk> , baron of barley mash . "
" grandfather ? "
" also sir <unk> , baron of barley mash . "
" great-grandfather ? "
" the same name and title . "
" <unk> ? "
" we had none , worshipful sir , the line failing before it had reached so far back . "
" it <unk> not .
it is a good four generations , and <unk> the requirements of the rule . "
" <unk> what rule ? "
i asked .
" the rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the candidate is not eligible . "
" a man not eligible for a <unk> in the army unless he can prove four generations of <name> descent ? "
" even so ; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned without that qualification . "
" oh , come , this is an astonishing thing .
what good is such a qualification as that ? "
" what good ?
it is a hardy question , fair sir and boss , since it doth go far to <unk> the wisdom of even our holy mother church herself . "
" as how ? "
" for that she hath established the self-same rule regarding saints .
by her law none may be <unk> until he hath lain dead four generations . "
" i see , i see  it is the same thing .
it is wonderful .
in the one case a man lies <unk> four generations  <unk> in ignorance and sloth  and that <unk> him to command live people , and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands ; and in the other case , a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations , and that <unk> him for office in the celestial camp .
does the king's <name> approve of this strange law ? "
the king said : " why , truly i see naught about it that is strange .
all places of honor and of profit do belong , by natural right , to them that be of <name> blood , and so these dignities in the army are their property and would be so without this or any rule .
the rule is but to <name> a limit .
its purpose is to keep out too recent blood , which would bring into contempt these offices , and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them .
i were to blame an i permitted this calamity .
you can permit it an you are minded so to do , for you have the delegated authority , but that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not comprehensible to any . "
" i yield .
proceed , sir chief of the herald 's college . "
the chairman resumed as follows : " by what illustrious achievement for the honor of the throne and state did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the british nobility ? "
" he built a <unk> . "
" sire , the board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command , and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor . "
the competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself .
so there was a tie in military qualifications that far .
he stood aside a moment , and sir <unk> was questioned further : " of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line ? "
" she came of the highest landed gentry , yet she was not <name> ; she was gracious and pure and charitable , of a blameless life and character , insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best <name> in the land . "
" that <name> do .
stand down . "
he called up the competing <unk> again , and asked : " what was the rank and condition of the <unk> who conferred british nobility upon your great house ? "
" she was a king 's <unk> and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own <unk> merit from the sewer where she was born . "
" ah , this , indeed , is true nobility , this is the right and perfect <unk> .
the <unk> is yours , fair lord .
hold it not in contempt ; it is the humble step which <name> lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine . "
i was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation .
i had promised myself an easy and <unk> triumph , and this was the outcome !
i was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face .
i told him to go home and be patient , this was n't the end .
i had a private audience with the king , and made a proposition .
i said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities , and he could n't have done a wiser thing .
it would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it ; in fact , add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country , even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it ; and thus make it the crack regiment , the envied regiment , the king 's own regiment , and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way , and go whither it would and come when it pleased , in time of war , and be utterly swell and independent .
this would make that regiment the heart 's <name> of all the nobility , and they would all be satisfied and happy .
then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials , and officer it with <unk> , as was proper  <unk> selected on a basis of mere efficiency  and we would make this regiment toe the line , allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint , and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering , to the end that whenever the king 's own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and <unk> around amongst <unk> and have a good time , it could go without uneasiness , knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it , and business going to be continued at the old stand , same as usual .
the king was charmed with the idea .
when i noticed that , it gave me a valuable notion .
i thought i saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last .
you see , the royalties of the <unk> stock were a long-lived race and very fruitful .
whenever a child was born to any of these  and it was pretty often  there was wild <name> in the nation 's mouth , and piteous sorrow in the nation 's heart .
the <name> was questionable , but the grief was honest .
because the event meant another call for a <name> <name> .
long was the list of these royalties , and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown .
yet <name> could not believe this latter fact , and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the <name> grants .
if i could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying <unk> from his own pocket , i could have made a grand <unk> over it , and it would have had a good effect with the nation ; but no , he would n't hear of such a thing .
he had something like a religious passion for <name> <name> ; he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag , and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution .
if i ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in england that would humble itself to hold out the hat  however , that is as far as i ever got ; he always cut me short there , and peremptorily , too .
but i believed i saw my chance at last .
i would form this crack regiment out of officers alone  not a single private .
half of it should consist of nobles , who should fill all the places up to <unk> , and serve gratis and pay their own expenses ; and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood .
these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenant-general up to field marshal , and be gorgeously <unk> and equipped and fed by the state .
moreover  and this was the master stroke  it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a <unk> gaudy and <unk> title ( which i would presently invent ) , and they and they only in all england should be so addressed .
finally , all princes of the blood should have free choice ; join that regiment , get that great title , and renounce the <name> <name> , or stay out and receive a <name> .
<unk> touch of all : unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be born into the regiment , and start fair , with good wages and a permanent situation , upon due notice from the parents .
all the boys would join , i was sure of that ; so , all existing grants would be relinquished ; that the newly born would always join was equally certain .
within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly , the <name> <name> , would cease to be a living fact , and take its place among the curiosities of the past .
chapter xxvi the first newspaper when i told the king i was going out disguised as a petty <name> to scour the country and <unk> myself with the humbler life of the people , he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute , and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself  nothing should stop him  he would drop everything and go along  it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day .
he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once ; but i showed him that that would n't answer .
you see , he was <unk> for the <unk>  to touch for it , i mean  and it would n't be right to disappoint the house and it would n't make a delay worth considering , anyway , it was only a <unk> stand .
and i thought he ought to tell the <name> he was going away .
he clouded up at that and looked sad .
i was sorry i had spoken , especially when he said mournfully : " thou <unk> that launcelot is here ; and where launcelot is , she <unk> not the going forth of the king , nor what day he <unk> . "
of course , i changed the subject .
yes , <unk> was beautiful , it is true , but take her all around she was pretty slack .
i never meddled in these matters , they were n't my affair , but i did hate to see the way things were going on , and i do n't mind saying that much .
many 's the time she had asked me , " sir boss , hast seen sir launcelot about ? "
but if ever she went fretting around for the king i did n't happen to be around at the time .
there was a very good <unk> for the <unk> business  very tidy and creditable .
the king sat under a canopy of state ; about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full <unk> .
conspicuous , both for location and personal outfit , stood <unk> , a hermit of the <unk> species , to introduce the sick .
all abroad over the spacious floor , and clear down to the doors , in a thick jumble , lay or sat the <unk> , under a strong light .
it was as good as a <unk> ; in fact , it had all the look of being gotten up for that , though it was n't .
there were eight hundred sick people present .
the work was slow ; it lacked the interest of novelty for me , because i had seen the ceremonies before ; the thing soon became tedious , but the proprieties required me to stick it out .
the doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them , and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of <unk> contact with a king , and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch .
up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar .
when you consider how much that amount of money would buy , in that age and country , and how usual it was to be <unk> , when not dead , you would understand that the annual <unk> appropriation was just the river and harbor <name> of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus .
so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the <unk> .
i covered <unk> of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from camelot on my adventures , and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into <unk> <unk> and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the king 's evil department ; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin , you see , and do its work for it .
it might strain the nickel some , but i judged it could stand it .
as a rule , i do not approve of watering stock , but i considered it square enough in this case , for it was just a gift , anyway .
of course , you can water a gift as much as you want to ; and i generally do .
the old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin , as a rule , but some of them were <name> ; they were <unk> , and seldom <unk> than a moon that is a week past the full ; they were hammered , not <unk> , and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters , and looked like them .
i judged that a sharp , bright new nickel , with a first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and <unk> on the other , and a blooming pious motto , would take the tuck out of <unk> as handy as a nobler coin and please the <unk> fancy more ; and i was right .
this batch was the first it was tried on , and it worked to a charm .
the saving in expense was a notable economy .
you <name> see that by these figures : we touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients ; at former rates , this would have cost the government about $ 240 ; at the new rate we pulled through for about $ 35 , thus saving upward of $ 200 at one swoop .
to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke , consider these other figures : the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days ' average wages of every individual of the population , counting every individual as if he were a man .
if you take a nation of <unk> , where average wages are $ 2 per day , three days ' wages taken from each individual <name> provide $ <unk> and pay the government 's expenses .
in my day , in my own country , this money was collected from <unk> , and the citizen imagined that the foreign <unk> paid it , and it made him comfortable to think so ; whereas , in fact , it was paid by the american people , and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the <unk> and the annual cost to the sucking child of the <unk> was precisely the same  each paid $ 6 .
nothing could be <unk> than that , i reckon .
well , scotland and ireland were tributary to <name> , and the united populations of the british islands amounted to something less than <unk> .
a mechanic 's average wage was 3 cents a day , when he paid his own keep .
by this rule the national government 's expenses were $ <unk> a year , or about $ 250 a day .
thus , by the <unk> of <unk> for gold on a <unk> day , i not only injured no one , dissatisfied no one , but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day 's national expense into the bargain  a saving which would have been the equivalent of $ <unk> in my day in <name> .
in making this <unk> i had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source  the wisdom of my boyhood  for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom , howsoever lowly may be its origin : in my boyhood i had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause .
the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin , the coin would answer me better than the buttons ; all hands were happy and nobody hurt .
<unk> took the patients as they came .
he examined the candidate ; if he could n't <unk> he was warned off ; if he could he was passed along to the king .
a priest pronounced the words , " they shall lay their hands on the sick , and they shall recover . "
then the king stroked the <unk> , while the reading continued ; finally , the patient graduated and got his nickel  the king hanging it around his neck himself  and was dismissed .
would you think that that would cure ?
it certainly did .
any <unk> <name> cure if the patient 's <name> is strong in it .
up by <unk> there was a chapel where the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there  the girl said so herself  and they built the chapel upon that spot and <name> a picture in it representing the occurrence  a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach ; whereas , on the contrary , thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound ; and even the well could look upon it and live .
of course , when i was told these things i did not believe them ; but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb .
i saw the cures effected myself ; and they were real cures and not questionable .
i saw cripples whom i had seen around camelot for years on crutches , arrive and pray before that picture , and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp .
there were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony .
in other places people operated on a patient 's mind , without saying a word to him , and cured him .
in others , experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them , and appealed to their <name> , and those patients went away cured .
wherever you find a king who can't cure the <unk> you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne  the subject 's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign  has passed away .
in my youth the monarchs of england had ceased to touch for the evil , but there was no occasion for this diffidence : they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty .
well , when the priest had been droning for three hours , and the good king polishing the evidences , and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever , i got to feeling intolerably bored .
i was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state .
for the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his <unk> stroked ; again those words were being <unk> out : " they shall lay their hands on the sick "  when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears : " camelot weekly <unk> and literary volcano !   latest irruption  only two cents  all about the big miracle in the valley of holiness ! "
one greater than kings had arrived  the newsboy .
but i was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth , and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do .
i dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper ; the <unk> of the world went around the corner to get my change ; is around the corner yet .
it was delicious to see a newspaper again , yet i was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display <unk> .
i had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence , respect , deference , so long that they sent a <unk> little cold wave through me : high times in the valley of holiness !
  the <unk> <unk> !
  <unk> <name> works his arts , but gets left ?
  but the boss scores on his first innings !
  the miraculous well <unk> amid awful <unk> of infernal fire and smoke <unk> !
  the <unk> astonished !
  unparalleled <unk> !
 and so on , and so on .
yes , it was too loud .
once i could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it , but now its note was discordant .
it was good arkansas journalism , but this was not arkansas .
moreover , the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits , and perhaps lose us their advertising .
indeed , there was too <unk> a tone of <unk> all through the paper .
it was plain i had undergone a considerable change without noticing it .
i found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little <unk> which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life .
there was an abundance of the following breed of items , and they <unk> me : local smoke and cinders .
sir launcelot met up with old king <unk> of ireland unexpectedly last <unk> over on the moor south of sir <unk> <name> <unk> 's hog <unk> .
the widow has been notified .
expedition no .
3 <name> start <unk> the first of <unk> month on a search <unk> sir <unk> <name> desirous .
it is in <unk> and of the renowned knight of the red lawns , <unk> by sir <unk> of <unk> , who is <unk> .
intelligent , <unk> <unk> , and in every way a brick , and fur ther assisted by sir <unk> the <name> <unk> , who is no huckleberry <unk> .
this is no <unk> , these boys mean <unk> & s .
the readers of the <unk> <name> re <unk> to learn that the <unk> and popular sir <unk> of gaul , who <unk> <unk> his four weeks ' stay at the bull and <unk> , this city , has won every heart by his polished manners and elegant <unk> , <name> pull out to-day for home .
give us another call , <name> !
the <unk> end of the funeral of the late sir <unk> the duke 's son of cornwall , killed in an encounter with the giant of the knotted <unk> last tuesday on the borders of the plain of enchantment was in the hands of the ever affable and efficient mumble , <name> of <unk> , then whom there exists none by whom it were a more satisfying pleasure to have the last sad offices performed .
give him a trial .
the cordial thanks of the <unk> office are due , from editor down to devil , to the ever courteous and thought <unk> lord high stew d of the <unk> third assistant v t for several <name> <unk> of ice cream a quality calculated to make the <unk> of the <unk> hu mid with <unk> <unk> ; and it done it .
when this administration wants to chalk up a desirable name for early promotion , the <unk> would like a chance to <unk> .
the <unk> <name> dewlap , of south <unk> , is visiting her uncle , the popular host of the <unk> 's board <unk> ho & se , liver <name> , this city .
young <unk> the <unk> is home again , and looks much improved by his vacation round-up among the out lying <unk> .
see his ad .
of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning ; i knew that quite well , and yet it was somehow disappointing .
the " court circular " pleased me better ; indeed , its simple and dignified <unk> was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful <unk> .
but even it could have been improved .
do what one may , there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular , i acknowledge that .
there is a profound <unk> about its facts that <unk> and defeats one 's sincerest efforts to make them <name> and <unk> .
the best way to manage  in fact , the only sensible way  is to disguise <unk> of fact under variety of form : skin your fact each time and lay on a new <unk> of words .
it <unk> the eye ; you think it is a new fact ; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything ; this excites you , and you drain the whole column , with a good appetite , and perhaps never notice that it 's a barrel of soup made out of a single bean .
<name> 's way was good , it was simple , it was dignified , it was direct and business-like ; all i say is , it was not the best way : court circular .
on monday , the king rode in the <unk> "
tuesday , " " " " <unk> " " " " thursday " " " " friday , " " " " saturday " " " " <name> , " " " however , take the paper by and large , i was vastly pleased with it .
little <unk> of a mechanical sort were observable here and there , but there were not enough of them to amount to anything , and it was good enough arkansas <unk> , anyhow , and better than was needed in <name> 's day and realm .
as a rule , the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame ; but i did not much mind these things .
they are common defects of my own , and one must n't criticise other people on grounds where he ca n't stand perpendicular himself .
i was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal , but i got only a few bites , and then had to postpone , because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions : what is this curious thing ?
what is it for ?
is it a handkerchief ?  saddle blanket ?  part of a shirt ?
what is it made of ?
how thin it is , and how dainty and frail ; and how it rattles .
<name> it wear , do you think , and wo n't the rain injure it ?
is it writing that appears on it , or is it only ornamentation ?
they suspected it was writing , because those among them who knew how to read latin and had a <unk> of greek , recognized some of the letters , but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole .
i put my information in the simplest form i could : " it is a public journal ; i <name> explain what that is , another time .
it is not cloth , it is made of paper ; some time i <name> explain what paper is .
the lines on it are reading matter ; and not written by hand , but printed ; by and by i <name> explain what printing is .
a thousand of these sheets have been made , all exactly like this , in every minute detail  they ca n't be told apart . "
then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration : " a thousand !
verily a mighty work  a year 's work for many men . "
" no  merely a day 's work for a man and a boy . "
they crossed themselves , and <unk> out a protective prayer or two .
" <unk>  a miracle , a wonder !
dark work of enchantment . "
i let it go at that .
then i read in a low voice , to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance , part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well , and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through : " <unk> ! "
" how true ! "
" amazing , amazing ! "
" these be the very <unk> as they happened , in marvelous exactness ! "
and might they take this strange thing in their hands , and feel of it and examine it ?  they would be very careful .
yes .
so they took it , handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region ; and gently felt of its texture , caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch , and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes .
these grouped bent heads , these charmed faces , these speaking eyes  how beautiful to me !
for was not this my darling , and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and <unk> compliment to it ?
i knew , then , how a mother feels when women , whether strangers or friends , take her new baby , and close themselves about it with one eager impulse , and bend their heads over it in a <unk> adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not , for that time .
i knew how she feels , and that there is no other satisfied ambition , whether of king , conqueror , or poet , that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment .
during all the rest of the <unk> my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall , and my happy eye was upon it always , and i sat motionless , steeped in satisfaction , drunk with enjoyment .
yes , this was heaven ; i was tasting it once , if i might never taste it more .
chapter xxvii the yankee and the king travel incognito about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the <name> of the lowly raiment he was to wear .
the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around , whereas the lowest ranks of <unk> were banged fore and aft both ; the slaves were <unk> , and allowed their hair free growth .
so i inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that <name> below it .
i also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a <unk> long ; and tried to do it <unk> , and succeeded .
it was a villainous <unk> .
when he got his <unk> sandals on , and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth , which <name> straight from his neck to his <unk> , he was no longer the <unk> man in his kingdom , but one of the <unk> and most commonplace and unattractive .
we were dressed and <unk> alike , and could pass for small farmers , or farm <unk> , or shepherds , or <unk> ; yes , or for village artisans , if we chose , our costume being in effect universal among the poor , because of its strength and <unk> .
i do n't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person , but i do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire  manufactured material , you understand .
we slipped away an hour before <name> , and by broad <unk> had made eight or ten miles , and were in the midst of a <unk> settled country .
i had a pretty heavy knapsack ; it was laden with provisions  provisions for the king to taper down on , till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage .
i found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside , and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with .
then i said i would find some water for him , and strolled away .
part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself .
it had always been my custom to stand when in his presence ; even at the council board , except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one , extending over hours ; then i had a trifling little <unk> thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache .
i did n't want to break him in suddenly , but do it by degrees .
we should have to sit together now when in company , or people would notice ; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it .
i found the water some three hundred yards away , and had been resting about twenty minutes , when i heard voices .
that is all right , i thought  peasants going to work ; nobody else likely to be stirring this early .
but the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road  <unk> clad people of quality , with <unk> and servants in their train !
i was off like a shot , through the bushes , by the shortest cut .
for a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before i could get to him ; but desperation gives you wings , you know , and i canted my body forward , inflated my breast , and held my breath and flew .
i arrived .
and in plenty good enough time , too .
" pardon , my king , but it 's no time for ceremony  jump !
jump to your feet  some quality are coming ! "
" is that a <name> ?
let them come . "
" but my liege !
you must not be seen sitting .
rise !  and stand in humble posture while they pass .
you are a peasant , you know . "
" true  i had forgot it , so lost was i in planning of a huge war with gaul "  he was up by this time , but a farm could have got up quicker , if there was any kind of a boom in real estate  " and <unk> a thought came <unk> <unk> this majestic dream the which  " " a humbler attitude , my lord the king  and quick !
duck your head !
 more !  still more !  droop it ! "
he did his honest best , but lord , it was no great things .
he looked as humble as the leaning tower at pisa .
it is the most you could say of it .
indeed , it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering <unk> all along the line , and a gorgeous <unk> at the tail end of it raised his whip ; but i jumped in time and was under it when it fell ; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed , i spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice .
he mastered himself for the moment , but it was a sore tax ; he wanted to eat up the procession .
i said : " it would end our adventures at the very start ; and we , being without weapons , could do nothing with that armed gang .
if we are going to succeed in our <unk> , we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant . "
" it is wisdom ; none can <unk> it .
let us go on , sir boss .
i <name> take note and learn , and do the best i may . "
he kept his word .
he did the best he could , but i 've seen better .
if you have ever seen an active , heedless , enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long , and an anxious mother at its heels all the while , and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment , you 've seen the king and me .
if i could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like , i should have said , no , if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant , let him take the <unk> ; i can do better with a menagerie , and last longer .
and yet , during the first three days i never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling .
if he could pass muster anywhere during his early <unk> it would be in small inns and on the road ; so to these places we confined ourselves .
yes , he certainly did the best he could , but what of that ?
he did n't improve a bit that i could see .
he was always frightening me , always breaking out with fresh <unk> , in new and unexpected places .
toward evening on the second day , what does he do but blandly fetch out a <name> from inside his robe !
" great guns , my liege , where did you get that ? "
" from a <unk> at the inn , <unk> <name> . "
" what in the world possessed you to buy it ? "
" we have escaped divers dangers by wit  thy wit  but i have bethought me that it were but <name> if i bore a weapon , too .
thine might fail thee in some pinch . "
" but people of our condition are not allowed to <name> arms .
what would a lord say  yes , or any other person of whatever condition  if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person ? "
it was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then .
i persuaded him to throw the <name> away ; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself .
we walked along , silent and thinking .
finally the king said : " when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient , or that hath a peril in it , why do you not warn me to cease from that project ? "
it was a startling question , and a <unk> .
i did n't quite know how to take hold of it , or what to say , and so , of course , i ended by saying the natural thing : " but , sire , how can i know what your thoughts are ? "
the king stopped dead in his tracks , and stared at me .
" i believed thou wert greater than <name> ; and truly in magic thou <name> .
but prophecy is greater than magic .
<name> is a prophet . "
i saw i had made a blunder .
i must get back my lost ground .
after a deep reflection and careful planning , i said : " sire , i have been misunderstood .
i <name> explain .
there are two kinds of prophecy .
one is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off , the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away .
which is the mightier gift , do you think ? "
" oh , the last , most surely ! "
" true .
does <name> possess it ? "
" partly , yes .
he foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away . "
" has he ever gone beyond that ? "
" he would not claim more , i think . "
" it is probably his limit .
all prophets have their limit .
the limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years . "
" these are few , i <unk> . "
" there have been two still greater ones , whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years , and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty . "
" <unk> , it is marvelous ! "
" but what are these in comparison with me ?
they are nothing . "
" what ?
canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as  " " seven hundred years ?
my liege , as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half ! "
my land , you should have seen the king 's eyes spread slowly open , and lift the earth 's entire atmosphere as much as an inch !
that settled <unk> <name> .
one never had any occasion to prove his facts , with these people ; all he had to do was to state them .
it never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement .
" now , then , " i continued , " i could work both kinds of prophecy  the long and the short  if i chose to take the trouble to keep in practice ; but i seldom exercise any but the long kind , because the other is beneath my dignity .
it is <unk> to <name> 's sort  <unk> prophets , as we call them in the profession .
of course , i <unk> up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy , but not often  hardly ever , in fact .
you <name> remember that there was great talk , when you reached the valley of holiness , about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival , two or three days beforehand . "
" indeed , yes , i mind it now . "
" well , i could have done it as much as forty times easier , and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain , if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days . "
" how amazing that it should be so ! "
" yes , a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing that 's only five hundred seconds off . "
" and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way ; it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first , for , indeed , it is so close by that one <unk> might almost see it .
in truth , the law of prophecy doth contradict the <unk> , most strangely making the difficult easy , and the easy difficult . "
it was a wise head .
a peasant 's cap was no safe disguise for it ; you could know it for a king 's under a <unk> , if you could hear it work its intellect .
i had a new trade now , and plenty of business in it .
the king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them .
from that time out , i prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand .
i have done some indiscreet things in my day , but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst .
still , it had its <unk> .
a prophet does n't have to have any brains .
they are good to have , of course , for the ordinary exigencies of life , but they are no use in professional work .
it is the <unk> vocation there is .
when the spirit of prophecy comes upon you , you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest , and <unk> your jaw and leave it alone ; it <name> work itself : the result is prophecy .
every day a <unk> or so came along , and the sight of them fired the king 's martial spirit every time .
he would have forgotten himself , sure , and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree , and so i always got him well out of the road in time .
then he would stand and look with all his eyes ; and a proud light would flash from them , and his nostrils would <unk> like a <unk> 's , and i knew he was longing for a brush with them .
but about noon of the third day i had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the <unk> that had fallen to my share two days before ; a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave <unk> , i was so loath to institute it ; but now i had just had a fresh reminder : while striding heedlessly along , with jaw spread and intellect at rest , for i was <unk> , i <unk> my toe and fell sprawling .
i was so pale i could n't think for a moment ; then i got softly and carefully up and <unk> my knapsack .
i had that dynamite bomb in it , done up in wool in a box .
it was a good thing to have along ; the time would come when i could do a valuable miracle with it , maybe , but it was a nervous thing to have about me , and i did n't like to ask the king to <name> it .
yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society .
i got it out and slipped it into my <unk> , and just then here came a couple of knights .
the king stood , stately as a statue , gazing toward them  had forgotten himself again , of course  and before i could get a word of warning out , it was time for him to skip , and well that he did it , too .
he supposed they would turn aside .
turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot ?
when had he ever turned aside himself  or ever had the chance to do it , if a peasant saw him or any other <name> knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble ?
the knights paid no attention to the king at all ; it was his place to look out himself , and if he had n't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down , and laughed at besides .
the king was in a flaming fury , and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most <name> vigor .
the knights were some little distance by now .
they halted , greatly surprised , and turned in their saddles and looked back , as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we .
then they wheeled and started for us .
not a moment must be lost .
i started for them .
i passed them at a rattling gait , and as i went by i flung out a <unk> <unk> <unk> insult which made the king 's effort poor and cheap by comparison .
i got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how .
they had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up ; then , frantic with rage , they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around , and the next moment here they came , breast to breast .
i was seventy yards off , then , and scrambling up a great <unk> at the roadside .
when they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level , depressed their mailed heads , and so , with their <unk> plumes streaming straight out behind , most gallant to see , this lightning express came tearing for me !
when they were within fifteen yards , i sent that bomb with a sure aim , and it struck the ground just under the horses ' noses .
yes , it was a neat thing , very neat and pretty to see .
it resembled a steamboat explosion on the mississippi ; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and <unk> .
i say we , for the king joined the audience , of course , as soon as he had got his breath again .
there was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come  in trying to explain it , i mean ; as for filling it up , that service would be comparatively prompt , and would fall to the lot of a select few  peasants of that <unk> ; and they would n't get anything for it , either .
but i explained it to the king myself .
i said it was done with a dynamite bomb .
this information did him no damage , because it left him as intelligent as he was before .
however , it was a <name> miracle , in his eyes , and was another settler for <name> .
i thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it could n't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right .
otherwise he would be <unk> it every time we had a good subject , and that would be inconvenient , because i had n't any more bombs along .
chapter xxviii drilling the king on the morning of the fourth day , when it was just sunrise , and we had been tramping an hour in the chill <name> , i came to a resolution : the king must be drilled ; things could not go on so , he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled , or we could n't ever venture to enter a dwelling ; the very cats would know this <unk> for a humbug and no peasant .
so i called a halt and said : " sire , as between clothes and countenance , you are all right , there is no discrepancy ; but as between your clothes and your bearing , you are all wrong , there is a most noticeable discrepancy .
your soldierly stride , your lordly port  these <name> not do .
you stand too straight , your looks are too high , too confident .
the cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders , they do not droop the <name> , they do not depress the high level of the <unk> , they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and <name> out the signs of them in <unk> body and <unk> step .
it is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things .
you must learn the trick ; you must imitate the <unk> of poverty , misery , oppression , insult , and the other several and common <unk> that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters , or the very infants <name> know you for better than your disguise , and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at .
pray try to walk like this . "
the king took careful note , and then tried an imitation .
" pretty fair  pretty fair .
<name> a little lower , please  there , very good .
eyes too high ; pray do n't look at the horizon , look at the ground , ten steps in front of you .
ah  that is better , that is very good .
wait , please ; you betray too much vigor , too much decision ; you want more of a <unk> .
look at me , please  this is what i mean ... . now you are getting it ; that is the idea  at least , it sort of approaches it ... .
yes , that is pretty fair .
but !  there is a great big something wanting , i do n't quite know what it is .
please walk thirty yards , so that i can get a perspective on the thing ... . now , then  your head 's right , speed 's right , shoulders right , eyes right , <name> right , gait , carriage , general style right  everything 's right !
and yet the fact remains , the aggregate 's wrong .
the account do n't balance .
do it again , please ... . now i think i begin to see what it is .
yes , i've struck it .
you see , the genuine <unk> is wanting ; that's what 's the trouble .
it 's all amateur  mechanical details all right , almost to a hair ; everything about the delusion perfect , except that it do n't <unk> . "
" what , then , must one do , to prevail ? "
" let me think ...
i ca n't seem to quite get at it .
in fact , there is n't anything that can right the matter but practice .
this is a good place for it : roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait , a region not liable to interruption , only one field and one hut in sight , and they so far away that nobody could see us from there .
it <name> be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you , sire . "
after the drill had gone on a little while , i said : " now , sire , imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder , and the family are before us .
proceed , please  accost the head of the house . "
the king unconsciously straightened up like a monument , and said , with frozen <unk> : " <unk> , bring a seat ; and serve to me what cheer ye have . "
" ah , your <name> , that is not well done . "
" in what <unk> it ? "
" these people do not call each other <unk> . "
" nay , is that true ? "
" yes ; only those above them call them so . "
" then must i try again .
i <name> call him <unk> . "
" <unk> ; for he may be a <name> . "
" ah  so .
then peradventure i should call him goodman . "
" that would answer , your <name> , but it would be still better if you said friend , or brother . "
" brother !  to dirt like that ? "
" ah , but we are pretending to be dirt like that , too . "
" it is even true .
i <name> say it .
brother , bring a seat , and thereto what cheer ye have , withal .
now 't is right . "
" not quite , not wholly right .
you have asked for one , not us  for one , not both ; food for one , a seat for one . "
the king looked puzzled  he was n't a very heavy weight , intellectually .
his head was an <unk> ; it could stow an idea , but it had to do it a grain at a time , not the whole idea at once .
" would you have a seat also  and sit ? "
" if i did not sit , the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals  and playing the deception pretty poorly , too . "
" it is well and truly said !
how wonderful is truth , come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may !
yes , he must bring out seats and food for both , and in serving us present not <unk> and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other . "
" and there is even yet a detail that needs correcting .
he must bring nothing outside ; we <name> go in  in among the dirt , and possibly other repulsive things ,  and take the food with the household , and after the fashion of the house , and all on equal terms , except the man be of the <unk> class ; and finally , there <name> be no <unk> and no napkin , whether he be <unk> or free .
please walk again , my liege .
there  it is better  it is the best yet ; but not perfect .
the shoulders have known no <unk> burden than iron mail , and they <name> not stoop . "
" give me , then , the bag .
i <name> learn the spirit that <unk> with burdens that have not honor .
it is the spirit that <unk> the shoulders , i <unk> , and not the weight ; for armor is heavy , yet it is a proud burden , and a man standeth straight in it ... . nay , but me no <unk> , offer me no objections .
i <name> have the thing .
strap it upon my back . "
he was complete now with that knapsack on , and looked as little like a king as any man i had ever seen .
but it was an obstinate pair of shoulders ; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive <unk> .
the drill went on , i <unk> and correcting : " now , make believe you are in debt , and eaten up by relentless creditors ; you are out of work  which is <unk> , let us say  and can get none ; and your wife is sick , your children are crying because they are hungry  " and so on , and so on .
i drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes .
but lord , it was only just words , words  they meant nothing in the world to him , i might just as well have whistled .
words realize nothing , <unk> nothing to you , unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe .
there are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about " the working classes , " and satisfy themselves that a day 's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day 's hard <name> toil , and is <unk> entitled to much bigger pay .
why , they really think that , you know , because they know all about the one , but have n't tried the other .
but i know all about both ; and so far as i am concerned , there is n't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a <unk> thirty days , but i <name> do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down  and i <name> be satisfied , too .
intellectual " work " is <unk> ; it is a pleasure , a dissipation , and is its own highest reward .
the poorest paid architect , engineer , general , author , sculptor , painter , lecturer , advocate , <unk> , actor , preacher , singer is <unk> in heaven when he is at work ; and as for the musician with the <unk> in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him  why , certainly , he is at work , if you wish to call it that , but lord , it 's a sarcasm just the same .
the law of work does seem utterly unfair  but there it is , and nothing can change it : the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it , the higher shall be his pay in cash , also .
and it 's also the very law of those transparent <unk> , <unk> nobility and kingship .
chapter xxix the smallpox hut when we arrived at that hut at <unk> , we saw no signs of life about it .
the field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before , and had a skinned look , so exhaustively had it been harvested and <unk> .
fences , sheds , everything had a ruined look , and were eloquent of poverty .
no animal was around anywhere , no living thing in sight .
the stillness was awful , it was like the stillness of death .
the cabin was a <unk> one , whose thatch was black with age , and ragged from lack of repair .
the door stood a trifle ajar .
we approached it stealthily  on tiptoe and at <unk>  for that is the way one 's feeling makes him do , at such a time .
the king knocked .
we waited .
no answer .
knocked again .
no answer .
i pushed the door softly open and looked in .
i made out some dim forms , and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me , as one does who is wakened from sleep .
presently she found her voice : " have <name> ! "
she pleaded .
" all is taken , nothing is left . "
" i have not come to take anything , poor woman . "
" you are not a priest ? "
" no . "
" nor come not from the lord of the manor ? "
" no , i am a stranger . "
" oh , then , for the fear of god , who visits with misery and death such as be harmless , tarry not here , but fly !
this place is under his curse  and his church 's . "
" let me come in and help you  you are sick and in trouble . "
i was better used to the dim light now .
i could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me .
i could see how emaciated she was .
" i tell you the place is under the church 's ban .
save yourself  and go , before some <unk> see thee here , and report it . "
" give yourself no trouble about me ; i do n't care anything for the church 's curse .
let me help you . "
" now all good spirits  if there be any such  bless thee for that word .
would god i had a sup of water !  but hold , hold , forget i said it , and fly ; for there is that here that even he that <unk> not the church must fear : this disease whereof we die .
leave us , thou brave , good stranger , and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give . "
but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the <name> .
it was ten yards away .
when i got back and entered , the king was within , and was opening the shutter that closed the <unk> , to let in air and light .
the place was full of a foul stench .
i put the bowl to the woman's lips , and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face .
smallpox !
i sprang to the king , and said in his ear : " out of the door on the instant , sire !
the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of camelot two years ago . "
he did not budge .
" of a truth i shall remain  and likewise help . "
i whispered again : " king , it must not be .
you must go . "
" ye mean well , and ye speak not <unk> .
but it were shame that a king should know fear , and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor .
peace , i <name> not go .
it is you who must go .
the church 's ban is not upon me , but it <unk> you to be here , and she <name> deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass . "
it was a desperate place for him to be in , and might cost him his life , but it was no use to argue with him .
if he considered his knightly honor at stake here , that was the end of argument ; he would stay , and nothing could prevent it ; i was aware of that .
and so i dropped the subject .
the woman spoke : " fair sir , of your kindness <name> ye climb the ladder there , and bring me news of what ye find ?
be not afraid to report , for times can come when even a mother 's heart is past breaking  being already broke . "
" abide , " said the king , " and give the woman to eat .
i <name> go . "
and he put down the knapsack .
i turned to start , but the king had already started .
he halted , and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light , and had not noticed us thus far , or spoken .
" is it your husband ? "
the king asked .
" yes . "
" is he asleep ? "
" god be thanked for that one <name> , yes  these three hours .
where shall i pay to the full , my gratitude !
for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he <unk> now . "
i said : " we <name> be careful .
we <name> not wake him . "
" ah , no , that ye <name> not , for he is dead . "
" dead ? "
" yes , what triumph it is to know it !
none can harm him , none insult him more .
he is in heaven now , and happy ; or if not there , he <unk> in hell and is content ; for in that place he <name> find neither abbot nor yet bishop .
we were boy and girl together ; we were man and wife these five and twenty years , and never separated till this day .
think how long that is to love and suffer together .
this morning was he out of his mind , and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields ; and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther , still lightly gossiping , and entered into those other fields we know not of , and was shut away from mortal sight .
and so there was no parting , for in his fancy i went with him ; he knew not but i went with him , my hand in his  my young soft hand , not this withered claw .
ah , yes , to go , and know it not ; to separate and know it not ; how could one go peace  fuller than that ?
it was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne . "
there was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was .
it was the king descending .
i could see that he was bearing something in one arm , and assisting himself with the other .
he came forward into the light ; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen .
she was but half conscious ; she was dying of smallpox .
here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility , its utmost summit ; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed , with all the odds against the <unk> , no reward set upon the contest , and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud ; and yet the king 's bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel .
he was great now ; <unk> great .
the rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition  i would see to that ; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon , like the rest , it would be a king in commoner 's garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted .
he laid the girl down by her mother , who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart , and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the child 's eyes , but that was all .
the mother <name> over her , kissing her , petting her , and imploring her to speak , but the lips only moved and no sound came .
i snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack , but the woman forbade me , and said : " no  she does not suffer ; it is better so .
it might bring her back to life .
none that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt .
for look you  what is left to live for ?
her brothers are gone , her father is gone , her mother <unk> , the church 's curse is upon her , and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road .
she is desolate .
i have not asked you , good heart , if her sister be still on live , here overhead ; i had no need ; ye had gone back , else , and not left the poor thing forsaken  " " she lieth at peace , " interrupted the king , in a subdued voice .
" i would not change it .
how <name> is this day in happiness !
ah , my <name> , thou shalt join thy sister soon  <unk> on thy way , and these be merciful friends that <name> not hinder . "
and so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again , and softly stroking her face and hair , and kissing her and calling her by endearing names ; but there was scarcely sign of response now in the <unk> eyes .
i saw tears well from the king 's eyes , and trickle down his face .
the woman noticed them , too , and said : " ah , i know that sign : <unk> a wife at home , poor soul , and you and she have gone hungry to bed , many 's the time , that the little ones might have your crust ; you know what poverty is , and the daily insults of your betters , and the heavy hand of the church and the king . "
the king winced under this accidental <unk> , but kept still ; he was learning his part ; and he was playing it well , too , for a pretty dull beginner .
i struck up a diversion .
i offered the woman food and liquor , but she refused both .
she would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death .
then i slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft , and laid it by her .
this broke her down again , and there was another scene that was full of <unk> .
by and by i made another diversion , and beguiled her to sketch her story .
" ye know it well yourselves , having suffered it  for truly none of our condition in britain escape it .
it is the old , weary tale .
we fought and struggled and succeeded ; meaning by success , that we lived and did not die ; more than that is not to be claimed .
no troubles came that we could not outlive , till this year brought them ; then came they all at once , as one might say , and overwhelmed us .
years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm ; in the best part of it , too  a grievous wrong and shame  " " but it was his right , " interrupted the king .
" none <unk> that , indeed ; an the law mean anything , what is the lord 's is his , and what is mine is his also .
our farm was ours by lease , therefore 't was likewise his , to do with it as he would .
some little time ago , three of those trees were found hewn down .
our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime .
well , in his lordship 's dungeon there they lie , who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess .
they have naught to confess , being innocent , wherefore there <name> they remain until they die .
ye know that right well , i <unk> .
think how this left us ; a man , a woman and two children , to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force , yes , and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort .
when my lord 's crop was nearly ready for the harvest , so also was ours ; when his <name> rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing , he would not allow that i and my two girls should count for our three captive sons , but for only two of them ; so , for the lacking one were we daily fined .
all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect ; and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage .
in the end the fines ate up our crop  and they took it all ; they took it all and made us harvest it for them , without pay or food , and we starving .
then the worst came when i , being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys , and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair , uttered a deep blasphemy  oh !
a thousand of them !
 against the church and the church 's ways .
it was ten days ago .
i had fallen sick with this disease , and it was to the priest i said the words , for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the <unk> hand of god .
he carried my trespass to his betters ; i was stubborn ; wherefore , presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me , fell the curse of rome .
" since that day we are avoided , shunned with horror .
none has come near this hut to know whether we live or not .
the rest of us were taken down .
then i roused me and got up , as wife and mother <name> .
it was little they could have eaten in any case ; it was less than little they had to eat .
but there was water , and i gave them that .
how they craved it !
and how they blessed it !
but the end came yesterday ; my strength broke down .
yesterday was the last time i ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive .
i have lain here all these hours  these ages , ye may say  listening , listening for any sound up there that  " she gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter , then cried out , " oh , my darling ! "
and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms .
she had recognized the <unk> .
chapter xxx the tragedy of the <unk> at midnight all was over , and we sat in the presence of four corpses .
we covered them with such rags as we could find , and started away , fastening the door behind us .
their home must be these people 's grave , for they could not have <name> burial , or be admitted to consecrated ground .
they were as dogs , wild beasts , <unk> , and no soul that valued its <name> of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts .
we had not moved four steps when i caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel .
my heart flew to my throat .
we must not be seen coming from that house .
i plucked at the king 's robe and we <name> back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin .
" now we are safe , " i said , " but it was a close call  so to speak .
if the night had been lighter he might have seen us , no doubt , he seemed to be so near . "
" mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all . "
" true .
but man or beast , it <name> be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way . "
" hark !
it cometh hither . "
true again .
the step was coming toward us  straight toward the hut .
it must be a beast , then , and we might as well have saved our trepidation .
i was going to step out , but the king laid his hand upon my arm .
there was a moment of silence , then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door .
it made me shiver .
presently the knock was repeated , and then we heard these words in a guarded voice : " mother !
father !
open  we have got free , and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts ; and we may not tarry , but must fly !
and  but they answer not .
mother !
father !  " i <name> the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered : " come  now we can get to the road . "
the king hesitated , was going to demur ; but just then we heard the door give way , and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead .
" come , my liege !
in a moment they <name> strike a light , and then <name> follow that which it would break your heart to hear . "
he did not hesitate this time .
the moment we were in the road i ran ; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed .
i did not want to think of what was happening in the hut  i couldn't bear it ; i wanted to drive it out of my mind ; so i struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind : " i have had the disease those people died of , and so have nothing to fear ; but if you have not had it also  " he broke in upon me to say he was in trouble , and it was his conscience that was troubling him : " these young men have got free , they say  but how ?
it is not likely that their lord hath set them free . "
" oh , no , i make no doubt they escaped . "
" that is my trouble ; i have a fear that this is so , and your suspicion doth confirm it , you having the same fear . "
" i should not call it by that name though .
i do suspect that they escaped , but if they did , i am not sorry , certainly . "
" i am not sorry , i think  but  " " what is it ?
what is there for one to be troubled about ? "
" if they did escape , then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord ; for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage from persons of their base degree . "
there it was again .
he could see only one side of it .
he was born so , educated so , his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality , brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream .
to <unk> these men without proof , and starve their kindred , was no harm , for they were merely peasants and subject to the <name> and pleasure of their lord , no matter what fearful form it might take ; but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage , and a thing not to be <unk> by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste .
i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the subject  and even then an outside matter did it for me .
this was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill  a red glow , a good way off .
" that 's a fire , " said i .
fires interested me considerably , because i was getting a good deal of an insurance business started , and was also training some horses and building some steam <unk> , with an eye to a paid fire department by and by .
the priests opposed both my fire and life insurance , on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of god ; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least , but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck , they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god , and was just as bad .
so they managed to damage those industries more or less , but i got even on my accident business .
as a rule , a knight is a <unk> , and some times even a <unk> , and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a <unk> , but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while ; and so of late you could n't clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my <unk> in every helmet .
we stood there awhile , in the thick darkness and stillness , looking toward the red blur in the distance , and trying to make out the meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night .
sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote ; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature , it dulled and sank again , carrying its mystery with it .
we started down the hill in its direction , and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darkness  darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls .
we groped along down for half a mile , perhaps , that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time .
the coming storm threatening more and more , with now and then a little shiver of wind , a faint show of lightning , and dull <unk> of distant thunder .
i was in the lead .
i ran against something  a soft heavy something which gave , slightly , to the impulse of my weight ; at the same moment the lightning glared out , and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree !
that is , it seemed to be writhing , but it was not .
it was a <unk> sight .
straightway there was an <unk> explosion of thunder , and the bottom of heaven fell out ; the rain poured down in a deluge .
no matter , we must try to cut this man down , on the chance that there might be life in him yet , must n't we ?
the lightning came quick and sharp now , and the place was alternately noonday and midnight .
one moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light , and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness .
i told the king we must cut him down .
the king at once objected .
" if he hanged himself , he was willing to lose him property to his lord ; so let him be .
if others hanged him , belike they had the right  let him <name> . "
" but  " " but me no <unk> , but even leave him as he is .
and for yet another reason .
when the lightning cometh again  there , look abroad . "
two others hanging , within fifty yards of us !
" it is not weather meet for doing useless <unk> unto dead folk .
they are past thanking you .
come  it is unprofitable to tarry here . "
there was reason in what he said , so we moved on .
within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning , and altogether it was a grisly excursion .
that murmur was a murmur no longer , it was a roar ; a roar of men 's voices .
a man came flying by now , dimly through the darkness , and other men chasing him .
they disappeared .
presently another case of the kind occurred , and then another and another .
then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fire  it was a large <unk> , and little or nothing was left of it  and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit .
i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers .
we would better get away from the light , until matters should improve .
we stepped back a little , and hid in the edge of the wood .
from this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob .
the fearful work went on until nearly <name> .
then , the fire being out and the storm spent , the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased , and darkness and stillness reigned again .
we ventured out , and hurried cautiously away ; and although we were worn out and sleepy , we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us .
then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal <unk> , and got what was to be had .
a woman was up and about , but the man was still asleep , on a straw <unk> , on the <name> floor .
the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night .
she became talkative , then , and asked if we had heard of the terrible <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> .
yes , we had heard of them , but what we wanted now was rest and sleep .
the king broke in : " sell us the house and take yourselves away , for we be perilous company , being late come from people that died of the spotted death . "
it was good of him , but unnecessary .
one of the commonest decorations of the nation was the <unk> face .
i had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated .
she made us entirely welcome , and had no fears ; and plainly she was immensely impressed by the king 's proposition ; for , of course , it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king's humble appearance who was ready to buy a man 's house for the sake of a night 's lodging .
it gave her a large respect for us , and she strained the <name> possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable .
we slept till far into the afternoon , and then got up hungry enough to make <unk> fare quite <unk> to the king , the more particularly as it was scant in quantity .
and also in variety ; it consisted solely of onions , salt , and the national black bread made out of <unk> .
the woman told us about the affair of the evening before .
at ten or eleven at night , when everybody was in bed , the <unk> burst into flames .
the country-side swarmed to the rescue , and the family were saved , with one exception , the master .
he did not appear .
everybody was frantic over this loss , and two brave <unk> sacrificed their lives in <unk> the burning house seeking that valuable personage .
but after a while he was found  what was left of him  which was his corpse .
it was in a <unk> three hundred yards away , bound , gagged , stabbed in a dozen places .
who had done this ?
suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron ; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and <unk> .
a suspicion was enough ; my lord 's <unk> retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people , and were promptly joined by the community in general .
the woman 's husband had been active with the mob , and had not returned home until nearly <name> .
he was gone now to find out what the general result had been .
while we were still talking he came back from his quest .
his report was revolting enough .
eighteen persons hanged or butchered , and two <unk> and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire .
" and how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults ? "
" thirteen . "
" then every one of them was lost ? "
" yes , all . "
" but the people arrived in time to save the family ; how is it they could save none of the prisoners ? "
the man looked puzzled , and said : " would one unlock the vaults at such a time ?
marry , some would have escaped . "
" then you mean that nobody did unlock them ? "
" none went near them , either to lock or unlock .
it standeth to reason that the bolts were fast ; wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch , so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape , but be taken .
none were taken . "
" <unk> , three did escape , " said the king , " and ye <name> do well to publish it and set justice upon their track , for these <unk> the baron and fired the house . "
i was just expecting he would come out with that .
for a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it ; then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces , and they began to ask questions .
i answered the questions myself , and narrowly watched the effects produced .
i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere ; that our hosts ' continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real .
the king did not notice the change , and i was glad of that .
i worked the conversation around toward other details of the night 's proceedings , and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction .
the painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor .
this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord , it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil 's whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him , without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter .
this man had been out helping to <name> his neighbors , and had done his work with zeal , and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion , with nothing back of it <unk> as evidence , still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it .
this was depressing  to a man with the dream of a republic in his head .
it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away , when the " poor whites " of our south who were always despised and frequently insulted by the <unk> around them , and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst , were yet <unk> ready to side with the <unk> in all political moves for the <unk> and <unk> of slavery , and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them .
and there was only one <unk> feature connected with that pitiful piece of history ; and that was , that secretly the " poor white " did detest the <unk> , and did feel his own shame .
that feeling was not brought to the surface , but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out , under <unk> circumstances , was something  in fact , it was enough ; for it showed that a man is at bottom a man , after all , even if it does n't show on the outside .
well , as it turned out , this charcoal <unk> was just the twin of the southern " poor white " of the far future .
the king presently showed impatience , and said : " an ye <unk> here all the day , justice <name> <unk> .
think ye the criminals <name> abide in their father 's house ?
they are fleeing , they are not waiting .
you should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track . "
the woman paled slightly , but quite perceptibly , and the man looked <unk> and irresolute .
i said : " come , friend , i <name> walk a little way with you , and explain which direction i think they would try to take .
if they were merely <unk> of the <unk> or some kindred absurdity i would try to protect them from capture ; but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house , that is another matter . "
the last remark was for the king  to quiet him .
on the road the man pulled his resolution together , and began the march with a steady gait , but there was no eagerness in it .
by and by i said : " what relation were these men to you  cousins ? "
he turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him , and stopped , trembling .
" ah , my god , how know ye that ? "
" i did n't know it ; it was a chance guess . "
" poor lads , they are lost .
and good lads they were , too . "
" were you actually going yonder to tell on them ? "
he did n't quite know how to take that ; but he said , hesitatingly : " <unk> " " then i think you are a damned scoundrel ! "
it made him as glad as if i had called him an <name> .
" say the good words again , brother !
for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an i failed of my duty . "
" duty ?
there is no duty in the matter , except the duty to keep still and let those men get away .
they 've done a righteous deed . "
he looked pleased ; pleased , and touched with apprehension at the same time .
he looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming , and then said in a cautious voice : " from what land come you , brother , that you speak such perilous words , and seem not to be afraid ? "
" they are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste , i take it .
you would not tell anybody i said them ? "
" i ?
i would be drawn asunder by wild horses first . "
" well , then , let me say my say .
i have no fears of your repeating it .
i think devil 's work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people .
that old baron got only what he deserved .
if i had my way , all his kind should have the same luck . "
fear and depression vanished from the man 's manner , and <unk> and a brave animation took their place : " even though you be a spy , and your words a trap for my <unk> , yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them , i would go to the gallows happy , as having had one good feast at least in a starved life .
and i <name> say my say now , and ye may report it if ye be so minded .
i helped to <name> my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master 's cause ; the others helped for none other reason .
all rejoice to-day that he is dead , but all do go about seemingly sorrowing , and shedding the hypocrite 's tear , for in that lies safety .
i have said the words , i have said the words !
the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth , and the reward of that taste is sufficient .
lead on , an ye <name> , be it even to the scaffold , for i am ready . "
there it was , you see .
a man is a man , at bottom .
whole ages of abuse and oppression can not crush the manhood clear out of him .
whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken .
yes , there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existed  even the russians ; plenty of manhood in them  even in the germans  if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy , to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it .
we should see certain things yet , let us <name> and believe .
first , a modified monarchy , till <name> 's days were done , then the destruction of the throne , nobility abolished , every member of it bound out to some useful trade , universal suffrage instituted , and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain .
yes , there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while .
chapter xxxi <name> we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now , and talked .
we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of <unk> and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again .
and meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet , never lost its novelty for me since i had been in <name> 's kingdom : the behavior  born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste  of chance passers-by toward each other .
toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his <unk> tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat <unk> , the <unk> was deeply reverent ; to the gentleman he was abject ; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and <unk> ; and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered , this chap 's nose was in the air  he couldn't even see him .
well , there are times when one would like to <name> the whole human race and finish the farce .
presently we struck an incident .
a small mob of <unk> boys and girls came tearing out of the woods , scared and shrieking .
the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old .
they implored help , but they were so beside themselves that we could n't make out what the matter was .
however , we plunged into the wood , they <unk> in the lead , and the trouble was quickly revealed : they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope , and he was kicking and struggling , in the process of choking to death .
we rescued him , and fetched him around .
it was some more human nature ; the admiring little folk imitating their elders ; they were playing mob , and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for .
it was not a dull excursion for me .
i managed to put in the time very well .
i made various <unk> , and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to .
a thing which naturally interested me , as a statesman , was the matter of wages .
i picked up what i could under that head during the afternoon .
a man who has n't had much experience , and doesn't think , is apt to measure a nation 's prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages ; if the wages be high , the nation is prosperous ; if low , it is n't .
which is an error .
it is n't what sum you get , it 's how much you can buy with it , that's the important thing ; and it 's that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name .
i could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century .
in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day , gold <unk> ; in the south he got fifty  payable in confederate <unk> worth a dollar a bushel .
in the north a suit of <unk> cost three dollars  a day 's wages ; in the south it cost seventy-five  which was two days ' wages .
other things were in proportion .
consequently , wages were twice as high in the north as they were in the south , because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had .
yes , i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation  lots of <unk> , lots of mills , lots of cents , a good many <unk> , and some silver ; all this among the artisans and <unk> generally ; yes , and even some gold  but that was at the bank , that is to say , the goldsmith 's .
i dropped in there while <name> , the son of <name> , was <unk> with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt , and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece .
they furnished it  that is , after they had chewed the piece , and rung it on the counter , and tried acid on it , and asked me where i got it , and who i was , and where i was from , and where i was going to , and when i expected to get there , and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions ; and when they got aground , i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily ; told them i owned a dog , and his name was watch , and my first wife was a free <name> baptist , and her grandfather was a <unk> , and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip , and died in the <name> of a glorious resurrection , and so on , and so on , and so on , till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied , and also a shade put out ; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength , and so he did n't give me any lip , but i noticed he took it out of his underlings , which was a perfectly natural thing to do .
yes , they changed my twenty , but i judged it strained the bank a little , which was a thing to be expected , for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two <unk> <name> for you all of a sudden .
he could do it , maybe ; but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket ; which was probably this <unk> thought , too ; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration .
our new money was not only handsomely circulating , but its language was already glibly in use ; that is to say , people had dropped the names of the former moneys , and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or <unk> now .
it was very gratifying .
we were progressing , that was sure .
i got to know several master mechanics , but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith , dowley .
he was a live man and a brisk talker , and had two <unk> and three apprentices , and was doing a raging business .
in fact , he was getting <name> , hand over fist , and was vastly respected .
<name> was very proud of having such a man for a friend .
he had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal , but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man .
dowley and i <unk> at once ; i had had just such picked men , splendid fellows , under me in the colt arms factory .
i was bound to see more of him , so i invited him to come out to <name> 's <name> , and dine with us .
<name> was appalled , and held his breath ; and when the grandee accepted , he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension .
<name> 's <name> was <unk>  but only for a moment ; then he grew thoughtful , then sad ; and when he heard me tell dowley i should have <unk> , the boss <name> , and <unk> , the boss wheelwright , out there , too , the <unk> on his face turned to chalk , and he lost his grip .
but i knew what was the matter with him ; it was the expense .
he saw ruin before him ; he judged that his financial days were numbered .
however , on our way to invite the others , i said : " you must allow me to have these friends come ; and you must also allow me to pay the costs . "
his face cleared , and he said with spirit : " but not all of it , not all of it .
ye can not well bear a burden like to this alone . "
i stopped him , and said : " now let 's understand each other on the spot , old friend .
i am only a farm bailiff , it is true ; but i am not poor , nevertheless .
i have been very fortunate this year  you would be astonished to know how i have <unk> .
i tell you the honest truth when i say i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care that for the expense ! "
and i snapped my fingers .
i could see myself rise a foot at a time in <name> 's estimation , and when i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style and altitude .
" so you see , you must let me have my way .
you ca n't contribute a cent to this orgy , that 's settled . "
" it 's grand and good of you  " " no , it is n't .
you 've opened your house to jones and me in the most generous way ; jones was remarking upon it to-day , just before you came back from the village ; for although he would n't be likely to say such a thing to you  because jones is n't a talker , and is diffident in society  he has a good heart and a grateful , and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated ; yes , you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us  " " ah , brother , 't is nothing  such hospitality ! "
" but it is something ; the best a man has , freely given , is always something , and is as good as a <name> can do , and ranks right along beside it  for even a <name> can but do his best .
and so we 'll shop around and get up this <unk> now , and do n't you worry about the expense .
i 'm one of the worst <unk> that ever was born .
why , do you know , sometimes in a single week i spend  but never mind about that  you 'd never believe it anyway . "
and so we went <unk> along , dropping in here and there , <unk> things , and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot , and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it , in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged .
the raiment of <name> and his wife was of coarse <unk> and <unk> respectively , and resembled township maps , it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added , township by township , in the course of five or six years , until hardly a <unk> of the original garments was surviving and present .
now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits , on account of that swell company , and i did n't know just how to get at it  with delicacy , until at last it struck me that as i had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king , it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort ; so i said : " and <name> , there 's another thing which you must permit  out of kindness for jones  because you would n't want to offend him .
he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way , but he is so diffident he could n't venture it himself , and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame <name> and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him  you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing  and so i said i would , and we would keep mum .
well , his idea was , a new outfit of clothes for you both  " " oh , it is <unk> !
it may not be , brother , it may not be .
consider the vastness of the sum  " " <name> the vastness of the sum !
try to keep quiet for a moment , and see how it would seem ; a body ca n't get in a word <unk> , you talk so much .
you ought to cure that , <name> ; it is n't good form , you know , and it <name> grow on you if you do n't check it .
yes , we 'll step in here now and price this man 's stuff  and don't forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had anything to do with it .
you ca n't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is .
he 's a farmer  pretty fairly well-to-do farmer  and i 'm his bailiff ; but  the imagination of that man !
why , sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off , you'd think he was one of the swells of the earth ; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer  especially if he talked agriculture .
he thinks he 's a <unk> of a farmer ; thinks he 's old <unk> from <unk> ; but between you and me privately he do n't know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom  still , whatever he talks about , you want to drop your <unk> and listen , the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before , and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it .
that <name> please jones . "
it tickled <name> to the marrow to hear about such an odd character ; but it also prepared him for accidents ; and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and ca n't remember it more than about half the time , you ca n't take too many precautions .
this was the best store we had come across yet ; it had everything in it , in small quantities , from <unk> and <unk> all the way down to fish and <unk> jewelry .
i concluded i would bunch my whole <unk> right here , and not go <unk> around any more .
so i got rid of <name> , by sending him off to invite the <name> and the wheelwright , which left the field free to me .
for i never care to do a thing in a quiet way ; it 's got to be theatrical or i don't take any interest in it .
i showed up money enough , in a careless way , to corral the shopkeeper 's respect , and then i wrote down a list of the things i wanted , and handed it to him to see if he could read it .
he could , and was proud to show that he could .
he said he had been educated by a priest , and could both read and write .
he ran it through , and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy <name> .
well , and so it was , for a little concern like that .
i was not only providing a swell dinner , but some odds and ends of extras .
i ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of <name> , the son of <name> , by saturday evening , and send me the <name> at dinner-time <name> .
he said i could depend upon his promptness and <unk> , it was the rule of the house .
he also observed that he would throw in a couple of <unk> for the <name> gratis  that everybody was using them now .
he had a mighty opinion of that clever device .
i said : " and please fill them up to the middle <name> , too ; and add that to the <name> . "
he would , with pleasure .
he filled them , and i took them with me .
i could n't venture to tell him that the <unk> was a little invention of my own , and that i had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government price  which was the merest trifle , and the shopkeeper got that , not the government .
we furnished them for nothing .
the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall .
he had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back , and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again .
chapter xxxii dowley 's humiliation well , when that cargo arrived toward sunset , saturday afternoon , i had my hands full to keep the <name> from fainting .
they were sure jones and i were ruined past help , and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy .
you see , in addition to the <unk> , which called for a sufficiently round sum , i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family : for instance , a big lot of wheat , a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit 's ; also a <unk> deal dinner-table ; also two entire pounds of salt , which was another piece of extravagance in those people 's eyes ; also crockery , stools , the clothes , a small cask of beer , and so on .
i instructed the <name> to keep quiet about this <unk> , so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little .
concerning the new clothes , the simple couple were like children ; they were up and down , all night , to see if it was n't nearly daylight , so that they could put them on , and they were into them at last as much as an hour before <name> was due .
then their pleasure  not to say delirium  was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered .
the king had slept just as usual  like the dead .
the <name> could not thank him for their clothes , that being forbidden ; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were .
which all went for nothing : he did n't notice any change .
it turned out to be one of those <name> and rare fall days which is just a <name> day <unk> down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors .
toward noon the guests arrived , and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances .
even the king 's reserve melted a little , though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at first .
i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer ; but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that , and not elaborate it any .
because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you did n't warn him , his tongue was so handy , and his spirit so willing , and his information so uncertain .
dowley was in fine feather , and i early got him started , and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero , and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum .
self-made man , you know .
they know how to talk .
they do deserve more credit than any other breed of men , yes , that is true ; and they are among the very first to find it out , too .
he told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him ; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived ; how his day 's work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long , and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a <unk> condition ; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith , who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering , when he was totally unprepared , to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade  or " mystery " as dowley called it .
that was his first great rise , his first gorgeous stroke of fortune ; and you saw that he could n't yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being .
he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship , but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in <unk> <unk> and made him feel unspeakably <name> and fine .
" i remember me of that day ! "
the wheelwright sang out , with enthusiasm .
" and i likewise ! "
cried the <name> .
" i would not believe they were thine own ; in <name> i could not . "
" nor other ! "
shouted dowley , with sparkling eyes .
" i was like to lose my character , the neighbors <unk> i had mayhap been stealing .
it was a great day , a great day ; one <unk> not days like that . "
yes , and his master was a fine man , and prosperous , and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year , and with it white bread , true <unk> bread ; in fact , lived like a lord , so to speak .
and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter .
" and now consider what is come to pass , " said he , impressively .
" two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table . "
he made a pause here , to let that fact sink home , then added  " and eight times salt meat . "
" it is even true , " said the wheelwright , with bated breath .
" i know it of mine own knowledge , " said the <name> , in the same reverent fashion .
" on my table <unk> white bread every <name> in the year , " added the master smith , with solemnity .
" i leave it to your own consciences , friends , if this is not also true ? "
" by my head , yes , " cried the <name> .
" i can testify it  and i do , " said the wheelwright .
" and as to furniture , ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is . "
he waved his hand in fine gesture of granting <name> and <unk> freedom of speech , and added : " speak as ye are moved ; speak as ye would speak ; an i were not here . "
" ye have five stools , and of the sweetest workmanship at that , albeit your family is but three , " said the wheelwright , with deep respect .
" and six wooden <unk> , and six <unk> of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal , " said the <name> , impressively .
" and i say it as knowing god is my judge , and we tarry not here alway , but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body , be they false or be they sooth . "
" now ye know what manner of man i am , brother jones , " said the smith , with a fine and friendly condescension , " and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of <unk> to strangers till their <unk> and quality be assured , but trouble yourself not , as concerning that ; wit ye well ye shall find me a man that <unk> not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that <unk> a right heart in his body , be his worldly estate howsoever modest .
and in token of it , here is my hand ; and i say with my own mouth we are equals  equals "  and he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it .
the king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance , and let go of it as willingly as a <name> lets go of a fish ; all of which had a good effect , for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness .
the dame brought out the table now , and set it under the tree .
it caused a visible stir of surprise , it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal .
but the surprise rose higher still when the dame , with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore , but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity , slowly unfolded an actual <unk> tablecloth and spread it .
that was a notch above even the blacksmith 's domestic grandeurs , and it hit him hard ; you could see it .
but <name> was in paradise ; you could see that , too .
then the dame brought two fine new stools  whew !
that was a sensation ; it was visible in the eyes of every guest .
then she brought two more  as calmly as she could .
sensation again  with awed murmurs .
again she brought two  walking on air , she was so proud .
the guests were petrified , and the <name> muttered : " there is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence . "
as the dame turned away , <name> could n't help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot ; so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it : " these suffice ; leave the rest . "
so there were more yet !
it was a fine effect .
i could n't have played the hand better myself .
from this out , the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade , and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped " oh 's " and " ah 's , " and mute <unk> of hands and eyes .
she fetched crockery  new , and plenty of it ; new wooden <unk> and other table furniture ; and beer , fish , chicken , a goose , eggs , roast beef , roast mutton , a ham , a small roast pig , and a wealth of genuine white <unk> bread .
take it by and large , that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before .
and while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe , i sort of waved my hand as if by accident , and the storekeeper 's son emerged from space and said he had come to collect .
" that 's all right , " i said , indifferently .
" what is the amount ?
give us the items . "
then he read off this <name> , while those three amazed men listened , and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over <name> 's : 2 pounds salt .

3,000 he ceased .
there was a pale and awful silence .
not a limb stirred .
not a <unk> betrayed the passage of breath .
" is that all ? "
i asked , in a voice of the most perfect calmness .
" all , fair sir , save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head <unk> <unk> .
if it would like you , i <name> <unk>  " " it is of no consequence , " i said , accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference ; " give me the grand total , please . "
the clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself , and said : " thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty <unk> ! "
the wheelwright fell off his stool , the others grabbed the table to save themselves , and there was a deep and general ejaculation of : " god be with us in the day of disaster ! "
the clerk hastened to say : " my father <unk> me to say he can not honorably require you to pay it all at this time , and therefore only <unk> you  " i paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze , but , with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness , got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table .
ah , you should have seen them stare !
the clerk was astonished and charmed .
he asked me to retain one of the dollars as security , until he could go to town and  i interrupted : " what , and fetch back nine cents ?
nonsense !
take the whole .
keep the change . "
there was an amazed murmur to this effect : " verily this being is made of money !
he <unk> it away even as if it were dirt . "
the blacksmith was a crushed man .
the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune .
i said to <name> and his wife : " good folk , here is a little trifle for you "  handing the <unk> as if it were a matter of no consequence , though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash ; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude , i turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day : " well , if we are all ready , i judge the dinner is .
come , fall to . "
ah , well , it was immense ; yes , it was a <name> .
i do n't know that i ever put a situation together better , or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available .
the blacksmith  well , he was simply mashed .
land !
i would n't have felt what that man was feeling , for anything in the world .
here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand <unk> twice a year , and his fresh meat twice a month , and his salt meat twice a week , and his white bread every <name> the year round  all for a family of three ; the entire cost for the year not above <unk> ( <unk> cents , two mills and six <unk> ) , and all of a sudden here comes along a man who <unk> out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out ; and not only that , but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums .
yes , dowley was a good deal wilted , and <unk> and collapsed ; he had the aspect of a <unk> that 's been stepped on by a cow .
chapter xxxiii sixth century political economy however , i made a dead set at him , and before the first third of the dinner was reached , i had him happy again .
it was easy to do  in a country of ranks and castes .
you see , in a country where they have ranks and castes , a man is n't ever a man , he is only part of a man , he ca n't ever get his full growth .
you prove your superiority over him in station , or rank , or fortune , and that 's the end of it  he knuckles down .
you ca n't insult him after that .
no , i do n't mean quite that ; of course you can insult him , i only mean it 's difficult ; and so , unless you 've got a lot of useless time on your hands it does n't pay to try .
i had the smith 's reverence now , because i was apparently immensely prosperous and <name> ; i could have had his adoration if i had had some little <unk> title of nobility .
and not only his , but any <unk> in the land , though he were the mightiest production of all the ages , in intellect , worth , and character , and i bankrupt in all three .
this was to remain so , as long as england should exist in the earth .
with the spirit of prophecy upon me , i could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable <unk> and other <name> and <name> <unk> , and leave <unk> the <unk> of this world  after god  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , morse , stephenson , <name> .
the king got his cargo aboard , and then , the talk not turning upon battle , conquest , or <unk> duel , he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap .
mrs. <name> cleared the table , placed the beer keg handy , and went away to eat her dinner of <unk> in humble privacy , and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort  business and wages , of course .
at a first glance , things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom  whose lord was king <unk>  as compared with the state of things in my own region .
they had the " protection " system in full force here , whereas we were working along down toward <unk> , by easy stages , and were now about half way .
before long , dowley and i were doing all the talking , the others hungrily listening .
dowley warmed to his work , snuffed an advantage in the air , and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me , and they did have something of that look : " in your country , brother , what is the wage of a master bailiff , master hind , <name> , shepherd , <unk> ? "
" twenty-five <unk> a day ; that is to say , a quarter of a cent . "
the smith 's face beamed with <name> .
he said : " with us they are allowed the double of it !
and what may a mechanic get  carpenter , <unk> , <name> , painter , blacksmith , wheelwright , and the like ? "
" on the average , fifty <unk> ; half a cent a day . "
" <unk> !
with us they are allowed a hundred !
with us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day !
i count out the tailor , but not the others  they are all allowed a cent a day , and in driving times they get more  yes , up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen <unk> a day .
i 've paid a hundred and fifteen myself , within the week .
<unk> for protection  to <unk> with <unk> ! "
and his face shone upon the company like a <unk> .
but i didn't scare at all .
i rigged up my <unk> , and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth  drive him all in  drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground .
here is the way i started in on him .
i asked : " what do you pay a pound for salt ? "
" a hundred <unk> . "
" we pay forty .
what do you pay for beef and mutton  when you buy it ? "
that was a neat hit ; it made the color come .
" it <unk> somewhat , but not much ; one may say seventy-five <unk> the pound . "
" we pay thirty-three .
what do you pay for eggs ? "
" fifty <unk> the dozen . "
" we pay twenty .
what do you pay for beer ? "
" it <unk> us eight and one-half <unk> the pint . "
" we get it for four ; twenty-five bottles for a cent .
what do you pay for wheat ? "
" at the rate of nine hundred <unk> the bushel . "
" we pay four hundred .
what do you pay for a man 's <unk> suit ? "
" thirteen cents . "
" we pay six .
what do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic ? "
" we pay eight cents , four mills . "
" well , observe the difference : you pay eight cents and four mills , we pay only four cents . "
i prepared now to sock it to him .
i said : " look here , dear friend , what 's become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes ago ?  "  and i looked around on the company with placid satisfaction , for i had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot , you see , without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all .
" what 's become of those <name> high wages of yours ?  i seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them , it appears to me . "
but if you <name> believe me , he merely looked surprised , that is all !
he did n't grasp the situation at all , did n't know he had walked into a trap , did n't discover that he was in a trap .
i could have shot him , from sheer vexation .
with cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out : " marry , i seem not to understand .
it is proved that our wages be double thine ; how then may it be that <unk> knocked therefrom the stuffing ?  an <unk> not the <unk> word , this being the first time under <name> and providence of god it hath been granted me to hear it . "
well , i was stunned ; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on his part , and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind  if you might call it mind .
my position was simple enough , plain enough ; how could it ever be simplified more ?
however , i must try : " why , look here , brother dowley , do n't you see ?
your wages are merely higher than ours in name , not in fact . "
" hear him !
they are the double  ye have confessed it yourself . "
" <unk> , i do n't deny that at all .
but that 's got nothing to do with it ; the amount of the wages in mere coins , with meaningless names attached to them to know them by , has got nothing to do with it .
the thing is , how much can you buy with your wages ?
 that 's the idea .
while it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year , and with us only about a dollar and seventy-five  " " there  ye 're confessing it again , ye 're confessing it again ! "
" confound it , i 've never denied it , i tell you !
what i say is this .
with us half a dollar buys more than a dollar buys with you  and therefore it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common-sense , that our wages are higher than yours . "
he looked dazed , and said , despairingly : " verily , i can not make it out .
ye 've just said ours are the higher , and with the same breath ye take it back . "
" oh , great <name> , is n't it possible to get such a simple thing through your head ?
now look here  let me illustrate .
we pay four cents for a woman 's stuff gown , you pay <unk> , which is four mills more than double .
what do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm ? "
" two mills a day . "
" very good ; we allow but half as much ; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day ; and  " " again ye 're <unk>  " " wait !
now , you see , the thing is very simple ; this time you'll understand it .
for instance , it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown , at 2 mills a day  7 weeks ' work ; but ours earns hers in forty days  two days short of 7 weeks .
your woman has a gown , and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ; ours has a gown , and two days ' wages left , to buy something else with .
there  now you understand it ! "
he looked  well , he merely looked dubious , it 's the most i can say ; so did the others .
i waited  to let the thing work .
dowley spoke at last  and betrayed the fact that he actually had n't gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet .
he said , with a trifle of hesitancy : " but  but  ye can not fail to <name> that two mills a day is better than one . "
shucks !
well , of course , i hated to give it up .
so i chanced another <unk> : " let us suppose a case .
suppose one of your <unk> goes out and buys the following articles : " 1 pound of salt ; 1 dozen eggs ; 1 dozen pints of beer ; 1 bushel of wheat ; 1 <unk> suit ; 5 pounds of beef ; 5 pounds of mutton .
" the lot <name> cost him 32 cents .
it takes him 32 working days to earn the money  5 weeks and 2 days .
let him come to us and work 32 days at half the wages ; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents ; they <name> cost him a shade under 29 days ' work , and he <name> have about half a week 's wages over .
<name> it through the year ; he would save nearly a week 's wages every two months , your man nothing ; thus saving five or six weeks ' wages in a year , your man not a cent .
now i reckon you understand that <unk> wages ' and <unk> wages ' are phrases that do n't mean anything in the world until you find out which of them <name> buy the most ! "
it was a <unk> .
but , alas !
it did n't crush .
no , i had to give it up .
what those people valued was high wages ; it did n't seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not .
they stood for " protection , " and swore by it , which was reasonable enough , because interested parties had <unk> them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages .
i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent. , while the cost of living had gone up 100 ; and that with us , in a shorter time , wages had advanced 40 per cent .
while the cost of living had gone steadily down .
but it did n't do any good .
nothing could <unk> their strange beliefs .
well , i was <unk> under a sense of defeat .
<unk> defeat , but what of that ?
that did n't soften the smart any .
and to think of the circumstances !
the first statesman of the age , the <unk> man , the <unk> man in the entire world , the loftiest <unk> head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries , sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith !
and i could see that those others were sorry for me  which made me blush till i could smell my whiskers scorching .
put yourself in my place ; feel as mean as i did , as ashamed as i felt  would n't you have struck below the belt to get even ?
yes , you would ; it is simply human nature .
well , that is what i did .
i am not trying to justify it ; i 'm only saying that i was mad , and anybody would have done it .
well , when i make up my mind to hit a man , i do n't plan out a <unk> ; no , that is n't my way ; as long as i 'm going to hit him at all , i 'm going to hit him a <unk> .
and i do n't jump at him all of a sudden , and risk making a blundering half-way business of it ; no , i get away off yonder to one side , and work up on him gradually , so that he never suspects that i 'm going to hit him at all ; and by and by , all in a flash , he 's flat on his back , and he ca n't tell for the life of him how it all happened .
that is the way i went for brother dowley .
i started to talking lazy and comfortable , as if i was just talking to pass the time ; and the oldest man in the world could n't have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up : " boys , there 's a good many curious things about law , and custom , and usage , and all that sort of thing , when you come to look at it ; yes , and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement , too .
there are written laws  they perish ; but there are also unwritten laws  they are eternal .
take the unwritten law of wages : it says they 've got to advance , little by little , straight through the centuries .
and notice how it works .
we know what wages are now , here and there and yonder ; we strike an average , and say that's the wages of to-day .
we know what the wages were a hundred years ago , and what they were two hundred years ago ; that 's as far back as we can get , but it suffices to give us the law of progress , the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation ; and so , without a document to help us , we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago .
good , so far .
do we stop there ?
no .
we stop looking backward ; we face around and apply the law to the future .
my friends , i can tell you what people 's wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know , for hundreds and hundreds of years . "
" what , goodman , what ! "
" yes .
in seven hundred years wages <name> have risen to six times what they are now , here in your region , and farm hands <name> be allowed 3 cents a day , and mechanics 6 . "
" i <unk> i might die now and live then ! "
interrupted <unk> , the wheelwright , with a fine <unk> glow in his eye .
" and that is n't all ; they 'll get their board besides  such as it is : it wo n't <unk> them .
two hundred and fifty years later  pay attention now  a mechanic 's wages <name> be  mind you , this is law , not <unk> ; a mechanic 's wages <name> then be twenty cents a day ! "
there was a general gasp of awed astonishment , <unk> the <name> murmured , with raised eyes and hands : " more than three weeks ' pay for one day 's work ! "
" riches !  of a truth , yes , riches ! "
muttered <name> , his breath coming quick and short , with excitement .
" wages <name> keep on rising , little by little , little by little , as steadily as a tree grows , and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there 'll be at least one country where the mechanic 's average wage <name> be two hundred cents a day ! "
it knocked them absolutely dumb !
not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes .
then the <unk> said <unk> : " might i but live to see it ! "
" it is the income of an <name> ! "
said <unk> .
" an <name> , say ye ? "
said dowley ; " ye could say more than that and speak no lie ; there 's no <name> in the realm of <unk> that hath an income like to that .
income of an <name>  <unk> !
it 's the income of an <name> ! "
" now , then , that is what is going to happen as regards wages .
in that remote day , that man <name> earn , with one week 's work , that <name> of goods which it takes you upwards of fifty weeks to earn now .
some other pretty surprising things are going to happen , too .
brother dowley , who is it that determines , every spring , what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic , laborer , and servant shall be for that year ? "
" sometimes the courts , sometimes the town council ; but most of all , the magistrate .
ye may say , in general terms , it is the magistrate that fixes the wages . "
" does n't ask any of those poor devils to help him fix their wages for them , does he ? "
" <unk> !
that were an idea !
the master that 's to pay him the money is the one that 's rightly concerned in that matter , ye <name> notice . "
" yes  but i thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it , too ; and even his wife and children , poor creatures .
the masters are these : nobles , <name> men , the prosperous generally .
these few , who do no work , determine what pay the vast hive shall have who do work .
you see ?
they 're a <unk> '  a trade union , to coin a new phrase  who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give .
thirteen hundred years hence  so says the unwritten law  the <unk> ' <name> be the other way , and then how these fine people 's posterity <name> fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions !
yes , indeed !
the magistrate <name> tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century ; and then all of a sudden the <unk> <name> consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this <unk> sort of thing ; and he <name> rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself .
ah , he <name> have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle . "
" do ye believe  " " that he actually <name> help to fix his own wages ?
yes , indeed .
and he <name> be strong and able , then . "
" brave times , brave times , of a truth ! "
sneered the prosperous smith .
" oh ,  and there 's another detail .
in that day , a master may hire a man for only just one day , or one week , or one month at a time , if he wants to . "
" what ? "
" it 's true .
moreover , a magistrate wo n't be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not . "
" <name> there be no law or sense in that day ? "
" both of them , dowley .
in that day a man <name> be his own property , not the property of magistrate and master .
and he can leave town whenever he wants to , if the wages do n't suit him !  and they can't put him in the <unk> for it . "
" perdition catch such an age ! "
shouted dowley , in strong indignation .
" an age of dogs , an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority !
the <unk>  " " oh , wait , brother ; say no good word for that institution .
i think the <unk> ought to be abolished . "
" a most strange idea .
why ? "
" well , i 'll tell you why .
is a man ever put in the <unk> for a capital crime ? "
" no . "
" is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him ? "
there was no answer .
i had scored my first point !
for the first time , the smith was n't up and ready .
the company noticed it .
good effect .
" you do n't answer , brother .
you were about to <unk> the <unk> a while ago , and shed some pity on a future age that is n't going to use it .
i think the <unk> ought to be abolished .
what usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the <unk> for some little offense that did n't amount to anything in the world ?
the mob try to have some fun with him , do n't they ? "
" yes . "
" they begin by <unk> him ; and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another ? "
" yes . "
" then they throw dead cats at him , do n't they ? "
" yes . "
" well , then , suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him  and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community , for his pride , or his prosperity , or one thing or another  stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently , do n't they ? "
" there is no doubt of it . "
" as a rule he is crippled for life , is n't he ?  jaws broken , teeth smashed out ?  or legs mutilated , <unk> , presently cut off ?
 or an eye knocked out , maybe both eyes ? "
" it is true , god knoweth it . "
" and if he is unpopular he can depend on dying , right there in the stocks , ca n't he ? "
" he surely can !
one may not deny it . "
" i take it none of you are unpopular  by reason of pride or insolence , or conspicuous prosperity , or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village ?
you would n't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks ? "
dowley winced , visibly .
i judged he was hit .
but he did n't betray it by any spoken word .
as for the others , they spoke out plainly , and with strong feeling .
they said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a man 's chance in them was , and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging .
" well , to change the subject  for i think i 've established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished .
i think some of our laws are pretty unfair .
for instance , if i do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks , and you know i did it and yet keep still and do n't report me , you <name> get the stocks if anybody informs on you . "
" ah , but that would serve you but right , " said dowley , " for you must inform .
so saith the law . "
the others <unk> .
" well , all right , let it go , since you vote me down .
but there's one thing which certainly is n't fair .
the magistrate fixes a mechanic 's wage at one cent a day , for instance .
the law says that if any master shall venture , even under utmost press of business , to pay anything over that cent a day , even for a single day , he shall be both fined and <unk> for it ; and whoever knows he did it and does n't inform , they also shall be fined and <unk> .
now it seems to me unfair , dowley , and a deadly peril to all of us , that because you <unk> confessed , a while ago , that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen <unk>  " oh , i tell you it was a <unk> !
you ought to have seen them to go to pieces , the whole gang .
i had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly , that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags .
a fine effect .
in fact , as fine as any i ever produced , with so little time to work it up in .
but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little .
i was expecting to scare them , but i was n't expecting to scare them to death .
they were mighty near it , though .
you see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the <unk> ; and to have that thing staring them in the face , and every one of them distinctly at the <name> of me , a stranger , if i chose to go and report  well , it was awful , and they could n't seem to recover from the shock , they could n't seem to pull themselves together .
pale , shaky , dumb , pitiful ?
why , they were n't any better than so many dead men .
it was very uncomfortable .
of course , i thought they would appeal to me to keep mum , and then we would shake hands , and take a drink all round , and laugh it off , and there an end .
but no ; you see i was an unknown person , among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people , a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness , and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates .
appeal to me to be gentle , to be fair , to be generous ?
of course , they wanted to , but they could n't dare .
chapter xxxiv the yankee and the king sold as slaves well , what had i better do ?
nothing in a hurry , sure .
i must get up a diversion ; anything to employ me while i could think , and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again .
there sat <name> , petrified in the act of trying to get the <name> of his <unk>  turned to stone , just in the attitude he was in when my <unk> fell , the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers .
so i took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery .
mystery !
a simple little thing like that ; and yet it was mysterious enough , for that race and that age .
i never saw such an awkward people , with machinery ; you see , they were totally unused to it .
the <unk> was a little double-barreled tube of <unk> glass , with a neat little trick of a spring to it , which upon pressure would let a shot escape .
but the shot would n't hurt anybody , it would only drop into your hand .
in the gun were two sizes  wee <unk> shot , and another sort that were several times larger .
they were money .
the <unk> shot represented <unk> , the larger ones mills .
so the gun was a purse ; and very handy , too ; you could pay out money in the dark with it , with accuracy ; and you could <name> it in your mouth ; or in your vest pocket , if you had one .
i made them of several sizes  one size so large that it would <name> the equivalent of a dollar .
using shot for money was a good thing for the government ; the metal cost nothing , and the money could n't be <unk> , for i was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower .
" paying the shot " soon came to be a common phrase .
yes , and i knew it would still be passing men 's lips , away down in the nineteenth century , yet none would suspect how and when it originated .
the king joined us , about this time , mightily refreshed by his nap , and feeling good .
anything could make me nervous now , i was so uneasy  for our lives were in danger ; and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the king 's eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other ; confound it , why must he go and choose such a time as this ?
i was right .
he began , straight off , in the most innocently artful , and transparent , and <unk> way , to lead up to the subject of agriculture .
the cold sweat broke out all over me .
i wanted to whisper in his ear , " man , we are in awful danger !
every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men's confidence ; don't waste any of this golden time . "
but of course i could n't do it .
whisper to him ?
it would look as if we were <unk> .
so i had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and <unk> along about his damned onions and things .
at first the tumult of my own thoughts , summoned by the <unk> and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull , kept up such a hurrah and confusion and <unk> and drumming that i could n't take in a word ; but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to <unk> and fall into position and form line of battle , a sort of order and quiet ensued and i caught the boom of the king 's batteries , as if out of remote distance : "  were not the best way , methinks , albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point , some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome <name> when stricken early from the tree  " the audience showed signs of life , and sought each other 's eyes in a surprised and troubled <unk> "
 <unk> others do yet maintain , with much show of reason , that this is not of necessity the case , <unk> that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the <unk> state  " the audience exhibited distinct distress ; yes , and also <unk> "
 yet are they clearly wholesome , the more especially when one doth <unk> the <unk> of their nature by <unk> of the <unk> juice of the wayward cabbage  " the wild light of terror began to glow in these men 's eyes , and one of them muttered , " these be errors , every one  god hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer . "
i was in miserable apprehension ; i sat upon <unk> "
 and further <unk> the known truth that in the case of animals , the young , which may be called the green fruit of the creature , is the better , all confessing that when a goat is ripe , his fur doth heat and sore <unk> his flesh , the which defect , taken in connection with his several <unk> habits , and <unk> appetites , and godless attitudes of mind , and <unk> quality of morals  " they rose and went for him !
with a fierce shout , " the one would betray us , the other is mad !
kill them !
kill them ! "
they flung themselves upon us .
what <name> flamed up in the king 's eye !
he might be lame in agriculture , but this kind of thing was just in his line .
he had been fasting long , he was hungry for a fight .
he hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back .
" st. <name> for britain ! "
and he <unk> the wheelwright .
the <name> was big , but i laid him out like nothing .
the three gathered themselves up and came again ; went down again ; came again ; and kept on repeating this , with native british pluck , until they were battered to jelly , reeling with exhaustion , and so blind that they could n't tell us from each other ; and yet they kept right on , hammering away with what might was left in them .
hammering each other  for we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled , and struggled , and <unk> , and pounded , and bit , with the strict and <unk> attention to business of so many <unk> .
we looked on without apprehension , for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us , and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion .
well , while they were gradually playing out , it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of <name> .
i looked around ; he was nowhere to be seen .
oh , but this was ominous !
i pulled the king 's sleeve , and we glided away and rushed for the hut .
no <name> there , no <name> there !
they had gone to the road for help , sure .
i told the king to give his heels wings , and i would explain later .
we made good time across the open ground , and as we darted into the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view , with <name> and his wife at their head .
they were making a world of noise , but that could n't hurt anybody ; the wood was dense , and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle .
ah , but then came another sound  dogs !
yes , that was quite another matter .
it magnified our contract  we must find running water .
we tore along at a good gait , and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur .
we struck a stream and darted into it .
we waded swiftly down it , in the dim forest light , for as much as three hundred yards , and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water .
we climbed up on this bough , and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree ; now we began to hear those sounds more plainly ; so the mob had struck our trail .
for a while the sounds approached pretty fast .
and then for another while they did n't .
no doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream , and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again .
when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage , the king was satisfied , but i was doubtful .
i believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree , and i judged it worth while to try .
we tried it , and made a success of it , though the king slipped , at the junction , and came near failing to connect .
we got comfortable <unk> and satisfactory concealment among the foliage , and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt .
presently we heard it coming  and coming on the jump , too ; yes , and down both sides of the stream .
louder  louder  next minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings , <unk> , <unk> , and swept by like a cyclone .
" i was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them , " said i , " but i do n't mind the disappointment .
come , my liege , it were well that we make good use of our time .
we've flanked them .
dark is coming on , presently .
if we can cross the stream and get a good start , and borrow a couple of horses from somebody 's pasture to use for a few hours , we shall be safe enough . "
we started down , and got nearly to the lowest limb , when we seemed to hear the hunt returning .
we stopped to listen .
" yes , " said i , " they 're baffled , they 've given it up , they 're on their way home .
we <name> climb back to our roost again , and let them go by . "
so we climbed back .
the king listened a moment and said : " they still search  i wit the sign .
we did best to abide . "
he was right .
he knew more about hunting than i did .
the noise approached steadily , but not with a rush .
the king said : " they reason that we were <unk> by no <unk> start of them , and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water . "
" yes , sire , that is about it , i am afraid , though i was hoping better things . "
the noise <name> nearer and nearer , and soon the van was drifting under us , on both sides of the water .
a voice called a halt from the other bank , and said : " an they were so minded , they could get to <name> tree by this branch that <unk> , and yet not touch ground .
ye <name> do well to send a man up it . "
" marry , that we <name> do ! "
i was obliged to admire my <unk> in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it .
but , do n't you know , there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight ?
awkwardness and stupidity can .
the best <unk> in the world does n't need to fear the second best <unk> in the world ; no , the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before ; he does n't do the thing he ought to do , and so the expert is n't prepared for him ; he does the thing he ought not to do ; and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot .
well , how could i , with all my gifts , make any valuable preparation against a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one ?
and that is what he did .
he went for the wrong tree , which was , of course , the right one by mistake , and up he started .
matters were serious now .
we remained still , and awaited developments .
the peasant toiled his difficult way up .
the king raised himself up and stood ; he made a leg ready , and when the comer 's head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud , and down went the man floundering to the ground .
there was a wild outbreak of anger below , and the mob swarmed in from all around , and there we were <unk> , and prisoners .
another man started up ; the <unk> bough was detected , and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge .
the king ordered me to play <unk> and keep the bridge .
for a while the enemy came thick and fast ; but no matter , the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach .
the king 's spirits rose , his <name> was limitless .
he said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night , for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country-side .
however , the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves ; wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans .
they had no weapons , but there were plenty of stones , and stones might answer .
we had no objections .
a stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while , but it was n't very likely ; we were well protected by boughs and foliage , and were not visible from any good aiming point .
if they would but waste half an hour in <unk> , the dark would come to our help .
we were feeling very well satisfied .
we could smile ; almost laugh .
but we did n't ; which was just as well , for we should have been interrupted .
before the stones had been raging through the leaves and <unk> from the boughs fifteen minutes , we began to notice a smell .
a couple of <unk> of it was enough of an explanation  it was smoke !
our game was up at last .
we recognized that .
when smoke invites you , you have to come .
they raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher , and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree , they broke out in a storm of <unk> .
i got enough breath to say : " proceed , my liege ; after you is manners . "
the king gasped : " follow me down , and then back thyself against one side of the trunk , and leave me the other .
then <name> we fight .
let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste . "
then he descended , barking and coughing , and i followed .
i struck the ground an instant after him ; we sprang to our appointed places , and began to give and take with all our might .
the powwow and racket were prodigious ; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and <unk> blows .
suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd , and a voice shouted : " hold  or ye are dead men ! "
how good it sounded !
the owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman : picturesque and costly raiment , the aspect of command , a hard countenance , with complexion and features marred by dissipation .
the mob fell humbly back , like so many <unk> .
the gentleman inspected us critically , then said sharply to the peasants : " what are ye doing to these people ? "
" they be madmen , worshipful sir , that have come wandering we know not whence , and  " " ye know not whence ?
do ye pretend ye know them not ? "
" most honored sir , we speak but the truth .
they are strangers and unknown to any in this region ; and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever  " " peace !
ye know not what ye say .
they are not mad .
who are ye ?
and whence are ye ?
explain . "
" we are but peaceful strangers , sir , " i said , " and traveling upon our own concerns .
we are from a far country , and unacquainted here .
we have purposed no harm ; and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us .
as you have divined , sir , we are not mad ; neither are we violent or bloodthirsty . "
the gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly : " lash me these animals to their <unk> ! "
the mob vanished in an instant ; and after them plunged the horsemen , laying about them with their whips and <unk> riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush .
the shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance , and soon the horsemen began to <unk> back .
meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely , but had dug no particulars out of us .
we were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us , but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country .
when the escort were all returned , the gentleman said to one of his servants : " bring the <unk> and mount these people . "
" yes , my lord . "
we were placed toward the rear , among the servants .
we traveled pretty fast , and finally <name> rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles .
my lord went immediately to his room , after ordering his supper , and we saw no more of him .
at <name> in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start .
my lord 's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent <name> , and said : " ye have said ye should continue upon this road , which is our direction likewise ; wherefore my lord , the <name> grip , hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride , and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that <unk> <unk> , <unk> ye shall be out of peril . "
we could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer .
we jogged along , six in the party , at a moderate and comfortable gait , and in conversation learned that my lord grip was a very great personage in his own region , which lay a day's journey beyond <unk> .
we loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town .
we dismounted , and left our thanks once more for my lord , and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square , to see what might be the object of interest .
it was the remnant of that old <unk> band of slaves !
so they had been dragging their chains about , all this weary time .
that poor husband was gone , and also many others ; and some few purchases had been added to the gang .
the king was not interested , and wanted to move along , but i was absorbed , and full of pity .
i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity .
there they sat , grounded upon the ground , silent , <unk> , with bowed heads , a pathetic sight .
and by hideous contrast , a <unk> orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away , in <unk> <unk> of " our glorious british liberties ! "
i was boiling .
i had forgotten i was a plebeian , i was remembering i was a man .
cost what it might , i would mount that rostrum and  click !
the king and i were handcuffed together !
our companions , those servants , had done it ; my lord grip stood looking on .
the king burst out in a fury , and said : " what <unk> this <unk> jest ? "
my lord merely said to his head miscreant , coolly : " put up the slaves and sell them ! "
slaves !  the word had a new sound  and how unspeakably awful !
the king lifted his <unk> and brought them down with a deadly force ; but my lord was out of the way when they arrived .
a dozen of the rascal 's servants sprang forward , and in a moment we were helpless , with our hands bound behind us .
we so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen , that we got the interested attention of that <unk> orator and his patriotic crowd , and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude .
the orator said : " if , indeed , ye are freemen , ye have nought to fear  the <unk> liberties of britain are about ye for your shield and shelter !
( applause . )
ye shall soon see .
bring forth your proofs . "
" what proofs ? "
" proof that ye are freemen . "
ah  i remembered !
i came to myself ; i said nothing .
but the king stormed out : " <unk> insane , man .
it were better , and more in reason , that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are not freemen . "
you see , he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws ; by words , not by effects .
they take a meaning , and get to be very vivid , when you come to apply them to yourself .
all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed ; some turned away , no longer interested .
the orator said  and this time in the tones of business , not of sentiment : " an ye do not know your country 's laws , it were time ye learned them .
ye are strangers to us ; ye <name> not deny that .
ye may be freemen , we do not deny that ; but also ye may be slaves .
the law is clear : it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves , it <unk> you to prove ye are not . "
i said : " dear sir , give us only time to send to <unk> ; or give us only time to send to the valley of holiness  " " peace , good man , these are extraordinary requests , and you may not <name> to have them granted .
it would cost much time , and would <unk> inconvenience your master  " " master , idiot ! "
stormed the king .
" i have no master , i myself am the m  " " silence , for god 's sake ! "
i got the words out in time to stop the king .
we were in trouble enough already ; it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics .
there is no use in stringing out the details .
the <name> put us up and sold us at auction .
this same infernal law had existed in our own south in my own time , more than thirteen hundred years later , and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me ; but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience , a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly <unk> .
well , that 's the way we are made .
yes , we were sold at auction , like swine .
in a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price ; but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed , every time i think of it .
the king of england brought seven dollars , and his prime minister nine ; whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and i as easily worth fifteen .
but that is the way things always go ; if you force a sale on a dull market , i do n't care what the property is , you are going to make a poor business of it , and you can make up your mind to it .
if the <name> had had wit enough to  however , there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account .
let him go , for the present ; i took his number , so to speak .
the <unk> bought us both , and hitched us onto that long chain of his , and we constituted the rear of his procession .
we took up our line of march and passed out of <unk> at noon ; and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the king of england and his chief minister , marching <unk> and fettered and yoked , in a slave convoy , could move by all manner of idle men and women , and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely , and yet never attract a curious eye , never provoke a single remark .
dear , dear , it only shows that there is nothing <unk> about a king than there is about a tramp , after all .
he is just a cheap and hollow <unk> when you do n't know he is a king .
but reveal his quality , and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him .
i reckon we are all fools .
born so , no doubt .
chapter xxxv a pitiful incident it 's a world of surprises .
the king brooded ; this was natural .
what would he brood about , should you say ?
why , about the prodigious nature of his fall , of course  from the loftiest place in the world to the lowest ; from the most illustrious station in the world to the <unk> ; from the grandest vocation among men to the <unk> .
no , i take my oath that the thing that <unk> him most , to start with , was not this , but the price he had fetched !
he couldn't seem to get over that seven dollars .
well , it stunned me so , when i first found it out , that i could n't believe it ; it did n't seem natural .
but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it , i saw i was mistaken ; it was natural .
for this reason : a king is a mere <unk> , and so a king 's feelings , like the impulses of an automatic doll , are mere <unk> ; but as a man , he is a reality , and his feelings , as a man , are real , not phantoms .
it shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth , and the king certainly wasn't anything more than an average man , if he was up that high .
confound him , he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars , sure  a thing which was plainly nonsense , and full or the <unk> conceit ; i was n't worth it myself .
but it was tender ground for me to argue on .
in fact , i had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead .
i had to throw conscience aside , and <unk> concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars ; whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages , the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money , and during the next thirteen centuries would n't see one that was worth the fourth of it .
yes , he tired me .
if he began to talk about the crops ; or about the recent weather ; or about the condition of politics ; or about dogs , or cats , or morals , or theology  no matter what  i sighed , for i knew what was coming ; he was going to get out of it a <unk> of that tiresome <unk> sale .
wherever we halted where there was a crowd , he would give me a look which said plainly : " if that thing could be tried over again now , with this kind of folk , you would see a different result . "
well , when he was first sold , it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars ; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying i wished he had fetched a hundred .
the thing never got a chance to die , for every day , at one place or another , possible <unk> looked us over , and , as often as any other way , their comment on the king was something like this : " here 's a <unk> chump with a <unk> style .
pity but style was <unk> . "
at last this sort of remark produced an evil result .
our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king .
so he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty .
i could have given the man some valuable advice , but i did n't ; you mustn't volunteer advice to a <unk> unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for .
i had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king 's style to a peasant 's style , even when he was a willing and anxious pupil ; now then , to undertake to reduce the king 's style to a slave 's style  and by force  go to !
it was a stately contract .
never mind the details  it <name> save me trouble to let you imagine them .
i <name> only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well ; the king 's body was a sight to see  and to weep over ; but his spirit ?  why , it was n't even <unk> .
even that dull clod of a <unk> was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who <name> remain a man till he dies ; whose bones you can break , but whose manhood you ca n't .
this man found that from his first effort down to his latest , he could n't ever come within reach of the king , but the king was ready to plunge for him , and did it .
so he gave up at last , and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired .
the fact is , the king was a good deal more than a king , he was a man ; and when a man is a man , you ca n't knock it out of him .
we had a rough time for a month , tramping to and fro in the earth , and suffering .
and what englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time ?
his <name> the king !
yes ; from being the most indifferent , he was become the most interested .
he was become the bitterest <unk> of the institution i had ever heard talk .
and so i ventured to ask once more a question which i had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that i had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further .
would he abolish slavery ?
his answer was as sharp as before , but it was music this time ; i should n't ever wish to hear pleasanter , though the profanity was not good , being awkwardly put together , and with the <unk> almost in the middle instead of at the end , where , of course , it ought to have been .
i was ready and willing to get free now ; i had n't wanted to get free any sooner .
no , i can not quite say that .
i had wanted to , but i had not been willing to take desperate chances , and had always <unk> the king from them .
but now  ah , it was a new atmosphere !
<name> would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now .
i set about a plan , and was straightway charmed with it .
it would require time , yes , and <name> , too , a great deal of both .
one could invent quicker ways , and fully as sure ones ; but none that would be as picturesque as this ; none that could be made so dramatic .
and so i was not going to give this one up .
it might delay us months , but no matter , i would <name> it out or break something .
now and then we had an adventure .
one night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for .
almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog , the driving snow was so thick .
you could n't see a thing , and we were soon lost .
the <unk> lashed us desperately , for he saw ruin before him , but his lashings only made matters worse , for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor .
so we had to stop at last and <unk> down in the snow where we were .
the storm continued until toward midnight , then ceased .
by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead , and others past moving and threatened with death .
our master was nearly beside himself .
he stirred up the living , and made us stand , jump , slap ourselves , to restore our circulation , and he helped as well as he could with his whip .
now came a diversion .
we heard shrieks and yells , and soon a woman came running and crying ; and seeing our group , she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection .
a mob of people came tearing after her , some with torches , and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease , and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat .
this poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human , she was so battered and bloody .
the mob wanted to burn her .
well , now , what do you suppose our master did ?
when we closed around this poor creature to shelter her , he saw his chance .
he said , burn her here , or they should n't have her at all .
imagine that !
they were willing .
they fastened her to a post ; they brought wood and piled it about her ; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast ; and our brute , with a heart solely for business , lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother .
that was the sort of master we had .
i took his number .
that snow-storm cost him nine of his flock ; and he was more brutal to us than ever , after that , for many days together , he was so enraged over his loss .
we had adventures all along .
one day we ran into a procession .
and such a procession !
all the <unk> of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it ; and all drunk at that .
in the van was a cart with a coffin in it , and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby , which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while , and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it ; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her , happy and content , <unk> her breast with its dimpled fat hand , which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart .
men and women , boys and girls , trotted along beside or after the cart , hooting , shouting profane and <unk> remarks , singing snatches of foul song , skipping , dancing  a very holiday of <unk> , a sickening sight .
we had struck a suburb of london , outside the walls , and this was a sample of one sort of london society .
our master secured a good place for us near the gallows .
a priest was in attendance , and he helped the girl climb up , and said comforting words to her , and made the <unk> provide a stool for her .
then he stood there by her on the gallows , and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet , then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near , and then began to tell the story of the case .
and there was pity in his voice  how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land !
i remember every detail of what he said , except the words he said it in ; and so i change it into my own words : " law is intended to <unk> out justice .
sometimes it fails .
this can not be helped .
we can only grieve , and be resigned , and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law , and that his fellows may be few .
a law sends this poor young thing to death  and it is right .
but another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child  and before god that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death !
" a little while ago this young thing , this child of eighteen years , was as happy a wife and mother as any in england ; and her lips were blithe with song , which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts .
her young husband was as happy as she ; for he was doing his whole duty , he worked early and late at his <unk> , his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned , he was <unk> , he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family , he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation .
by consent of a treacherous law , instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away !
that young husband was waylaid and impressed , and sent to sea .
the wife knew nothing of it .
she sought him everywhere , she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears , the broken eloquence of her despair .
weeks dragged by , she watching , waiting , hoping , her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery .
little by little all her small possessions went for food .
when she could no longer pay her rent , they turned her out of doors .
she begged , while she had strength ; when she was starving at last , and her milk failing , she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent , thinking to sell it and save her child .
but she was seen by the owner of the cloth .
she was put in jail and brought to trial .
the man testified to the facts .
a plea was made for her , and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf .
she spoke , too , by permission , and said she did steal the cloth , but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts , criminal or other , swam meaningless through her <name> and she knew nothing rightly , except that she was so hungry !
for a moment all were touched , and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her , seeing that she was so young and friendless , and her case so piteous , and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression ; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true , and most pitiful as well , still there was much small theft in these days , and <unk> <name> here would be a danger to property  oh , my god , is there no property in ruined homes , and <unk> babes , and broken hearts that british law holds precious !  and so he must require sentence .
" when the judge put on his black cap , the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up , his lip quivering , his face as gray as ashes ; and when the awful words came , he cried out , 'oh , poor child , poor child , i did not know it was death ! '
and fell as a tree falls .
when they lifted him up his reason was gone ; before the sun was set , he had taken his own life .
a kindly man ; a man whose heart was right , at bottom ; add his murder to this that is to be now done here ; and charge them both where they belong  to the rulers and the bitter laws of britain .
the time is come , my child ; let me pray over thee  not for thee , dear abused poor heart and innocent , but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death , who need it more . "
after his prayer they put the noose around the young girl 's neck , and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear , because she was devouring the baby all the time , wildly kissing it , and snatching it to her face and her breast , and drenching it with tears , and half moaning , half shrieking all the while , and the baby crowing , and laughing , and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play .
even the <unk> could n't stand it , but turned away .
when all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother 's arms , and stepped quickly out of her reach ; but she clasped her hands , and made a wild spring toward him , with a shriek ; but the rope  and the <unk>  held her short .
then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried : " one more kiss  oh , my god , one more , one more ,  it is the dying that begs it ! "
she got it ; she almost smothered the little thing .
and when they got it away again , she cried out : " oh , my child , my darling , it <name> die !
it has no home , it has no father , no friend , no mother  " " it has them all ! "
said that good priest .
" all these <name> i be to it till i die . "
you should have seen her face then !
gratitude ?
lord , what do you want with words to express that ?
words are only painted fire ; a look is the fire itself .
she gave that look , and carried it away to the treasury of heaven , where all things that are divine belong .
chapter xxxvi an encounter in the dark london  to a slave  was a sufficiently interesting place .
it was merely a great big village ; and mainly mud and thatch .
the streets were muddy , crooked , <unk> .
the populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags , and splendors , of nodding plumes and shining armor .
the king had a palace there ; he saw the outside of it .
it made him sigh ; yes , and swear a little , in a poor juvenile sixth century way .
we saw knights and grandees whom we knew , but they did n't know us in our rags and dirt and raw <unk> and bruises , and would n't have recognized us if we had hailed them , nor stopped to answer , either , it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain .
<name> passed within ten yards of me on a mule  hunting for me , i imagined .
but the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square , while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for <unk> pennies .
it was the sight of a newsboy  and i could n't get at him !
still , i had one comfort  here was proof that <name> was still alive and banging away .
i meant to be with him before long ; the thought was full of cheer .
i had one little glimpse of another thing , one day , which gave me a great uplift .
it was a wire stretching from <unk> to <unk> .
telegraph or telephone , sure .
i did very much wish i had a little piece of it .
it was just what i needed , in order to <name> out my project of escape .
my idea was to get loose some night , along with the king , then gag and bind our master , change clothes with him , batter him into the aspect of a stranger , hitch him to the <unk> , assume possession of the property , march to camelot , and  but you get my idea ; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise i would wind up with at the palace .
it was all feasible , if i could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which i could shape into a <unk> .
i could then undo the lumbering <unk> with which our chains were fastened , whenever i might choose .
but i never had any luck ; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way .
however , my chance came at last .
a gentleman who had come twice before to <unk> for me , without result , or indeed any approach to a result , came again .
i was far from expecting ever to belong to him , for the price asked for me from the time i was first <unk> was exorbitant , and always provoked either anger or derision , yet my master stuck stubbornly to it  twenty-two dollars .
he would n't bate a cent .
the king was greatly admired , because of his grand physique , but his kingly style was against him , and he was n't <unk> ; nobody wanted that kind of a slave .
i considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price .
no , i was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom i have spoken of , but he had something which i expected would belong to me eventually , if he would but visit us often enough .
it was a steel thing with a long pin to it , with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front .
there were three of them .
he had disappointed me twice , because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe ; but this time i succeeded ; i captured the lower clasp of the three , and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way .
i had a chance to be glad about a minute , then straightway a chance to be sad again .
for when the purchase was about to fail , as usual , the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus  in modern english : " i 'll tell you what i 'll do .
i 'm tired supporting these two for no good .
give me twenty-two dollars for this one , and i 'll throw the other one in . "
the king could n't get his breath , he was in such a fury .
he began to choke and gag , and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing .
" an ye <name> keep the offer open  " " 't is open till the morrow at this hour . "
" then i <name> answer you at that time , " said the gentleman , and disappeared , the master following him .
i had a time of it to cool the king down , but i managed it .
i whispered in his ear , to this effect : " your <name> <name> go for nothing , but after another fashion .
and so shall i. to-night we shall both be free . "
" ah !
how is that ? "
" with this thing which i have stolen , i <name> unlock these locks and cast off these chains to-night .
when he comes about <unk> to inspect us for the night , we <name> seize him , gag him , batter him , and early in the morning we <name> march out of this town , proprietors of this caravan of slaves . "
that was as far as i went , but the king was charmed and satisfied .
that evening we waited patiently for our <unk> to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign , for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it .
it is best to keep your own secrets .
no doubt they fidgeted only about as usual , but it did n't seem so to me .
it seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring .
as the time dragged on i got nervously afraid we should n't have enough of it left for our needs ; so i made several premature attempts , and merely delayed things by it ; for i could n't seem to touch a <unk> , there in the dark , without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebody 's sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang .
but finally i did get my last iron off , and was a free man once more .
i took a good breath of relief , and reached for the king's irons .
too late !
in comes the master , with a light in one hand and his heavy <unk> in the other .
i snuggled close among the wallow of <unk> , to conceal as nearly as possible that i was naked of irons ; and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me .
but he did n't approach .
he stopped , gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute , evidently thinking about something else ; then set down his light , moved musingly toward the door , and before a body could imagine what he was going to do , he was out of the door and had closed it behind him .
" quick ! "
said the king .
" fetch him back ! "
of course , it was the thing to do , and i was up and out in a moment .
but , dear me , there were no lamps in those days , and it was a dark night .
but i glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away .
i darted for it , threw myself upon it , and then there was a state of things and lively !
we fought and <unk> and struggled , and <name> a crowd in no time .
they took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could , and , in fact , couldn't have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight .
then a tremendous row broke out behind us , and as much as half of our audience left us , with a rush , to invest some sympathy in that .
lanterns began to swing in all directions ; it was the watch gathering from far and near .
presently a <unk> fell across my back , as a reminder , and i knew what it meant .
i was in custody .
so was my adversary .
we were marched off toward prison , one on each side of the watchman .
here was disaster , here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction !
i tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was i who had been fighting him ; and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for <unk> and petty <unk> , as was the custom ; and what might  just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction , the freckled light from the watchman 's tin lantern fell on it , and , by <name> , he was the wrong man !
chapter xxxvii an awful predicament sleep ?
it was impossible .
it would naturally have been impossible in that <unk> cavern of a jail , with its mangy crowd of drunken , quarrelsome , and <unk> <unk> .
but the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of , was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the <unk> in consequence of that intolerable <unk> of mine .
it was a long night , but the morning got around at last .
i made a full and <name> explanation to the court .
i said i was a slave , the property of the great <name> grip , who had arrived just after dark at the <unk> inn in the village on the other side of the water , and had stopped there over night , by compulsion , he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder .
i had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician ; i was doing my best ; naturally i was running with all my might ; the night was dark , i ran against this common person here , who seized me by the throat and began to <unk> me , although i told him my errand , and implored him , for the sake of the great <name> my master 's mortal peril  the common person interrupted and said it was a lie ; and was going to explain how i rushed upon him and attacked him without a word  " silence , <unk> ! "
from the court .
" take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time .
go ! "
then the court begged my pardon , and hoped i would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court 's fault that this high-handed thing had happened .
i said i would make it all right , and so took my leave .
took it just in time , too ; he was starting to ask me why i did n't fetch out these facts the moment i was arrested .
i said i would if i had thought of it  which was true  but that i was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of me  and so forth and so on , and got myself away , still mumbling .
i did n't wait for breakfast .
no grass grew under my feet .
i was soon at the slave quarters .
empty  everybody gone !
that is , everybody except one body  the <unk> 's .
it lay there all battered to pulp ; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight .
there was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door , and workmen , assisted by the police , were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in .
i picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as i , and got his account of the matter .
" there were sixteen slaves here .
they rose against their master in the night , and thou seest how it ended . "
" yes .
how did it begin ? "
" there was no witness but the slaves .
they said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way  by magic arts 't was thought , by reason that he had no key , and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured .
when the master discovered his loss , he was mad with despair , and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick , who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end . "
" this is dreadful .
it <name> go hard with the slaves , no doubt , upon the trial . "
" marry , the trial is over . "
" over ! "
" would they be a week , think you  and the matter so simple ?
they were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it . "
" why , i do n't see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time . "
" which ones ?
indeed , they considered not particulars like to that .
they condemned them in a body .
wit ye not the law ?  which men say the romans left behind them here when they went  that if one slave <unk> his master all the slaves of that man must die for it . "
" true .
i had forgotten .
and when <name> these die ? "
" belike within a four and twenty hours ; albeit some say they <name> wait a pair of days more , if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime . "
the missing one !
it made me feel uncomfortable .
" is it likely they <name> find him ? "
" before the day is spent  yes .
they seek him everywhere .
they stand at the gates of the town , with certain of the slaves who <name> discover him to them if he cometh , and none can pass out but he <name> be first examined . "
" might one see the place where the rest are confined ? "
" the outside of it  yes .
the inside of it  but ye <name> not want to see that . "
i took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off .
at the first second-hand clothing shop i came to , up a back street , i got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage , and bound up my face with a liberal bandage , saying i had a toothache .
this concealed my worst bruises .
it was a transformation .
i no longer resembled my former self .
then i struck out for that wire , found it and followed it to its den .
it was a little room over a <unk> shop  which meant that business was n't very brisk in the telegraphic line .
the young chap in charge was drowsing at his table .
i locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom .
this alarmed the young fellow , and he was going to make a noise ; but i said : " save your wind ; if you open your mouth you are dead , sure .
tackle your instrument .
lively , now !
call camelot . "
" this doth <unk> me !
how should such as you know aught of such matters as  " " call camelot !
i am a desperate man .
call camelot , or get away from the instrument and i <name> do it myself . "
" what  you ? "
" yes  certainly .
stop <unk> .
call the palace . "
he made the call .
" now , then , call <name> . "
" <name> who ? "
" never mind <name> who .
say you want <name> ; you 'll get an answer . "
he did so .
we waited five <unk> minutes  ten minutes  how long it did seem !  and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice ; for <name> had been my own pupil .
" now , my lad , vacate !
they would have known my touch , maybe , and so your call was surest ; but i 'm all right now . "
he vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen  but it didn't win .
i used a cipher .
i did n't waste any time in <unk> with <name> , but squared away for business , <unk>  thus : " the king is here and in danger .
we were captured and brought here as slaves .
we should not be able to prove our identity  and the fact is , i am not in a position to try .
send a telegram for the palace here which <name> <name> conviction with it . "
his answer came straight back : " they do n't know anything about the telegraph ; they have n't had any experience yet , the line to london is so new .
better not venture that .
they might <name> you .
think up something else . "
might <name> us !
little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts .
i could n't think up anything for the moment .
then an idea struck me , and i started it along : " send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead ; and send them on the jump .
let them enter by the southwest gate , and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm . "
the answer was prompt : " they shall start in half an hour . "
" all right , <name> ; now tell this lad here that i 'm a friend of yours and a <unk> ; and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine . "
the instrument began to talk to the youth and i hurried away .
i fell to ciphering .
in half an hour it would be nine o'clock .
knights and horses in heavy armor could n't travel very fast .
these would make the best time they could , and now that the ground was in good condition , and no snow or mud , they would probably make a <unk> gait ; they would have to change horses a couple of times ; they would arrive about six , or a little after ; it would still be plenty light enough ; they would see the white cloth which i should tie around my right arm , and i would take command .
we would surround that prison and have the king out in no time .
it would be showy and picturesque enough , all things considered , though i would have preferred noonday , on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have .
now , then , in order to increase the strings to my bow , i thought i would look up some of those people whom i had formerly recognized , and make myself known .
that would help us out of our scrape , without the knights .
but i must proceed cautiously , for it was a risky business .
i must get into sumptuous raiment , and it would n't do to run and jump into it .
no , i must work up to it by degrees , buying suit after suit of clothes , in shops wide apart , and getting a little finer article with each change , until i should finally reach silk and <name> , and be ready for my project .
so i started .
but the scheme fell through like <unk> !
the first corner i turned , i came plump upon one of our slaves , <unk> around with a watchman .
i coughed at the moment , and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow .
i judge he thought he had heard that cough before .
i turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter , <unk> things and watching out of the corner of my eye .
those people had stopped , and were talking together and looking in at the door .
i made up my mind to get out the back way , if there was a back way , and i asked the <unk> if i could step out there and look for the escaped slave , who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere , and said i was an officer in disguise , and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge , and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he need n't wait , but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when i <unk> him out .
she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers , and she started on the errand at once .
i slipped out the back way , locked the door behind me , put the key in my pocket and started off , chuckling to myself and comfortable .
well , i had gone and spoiled it again , made another mistake .
a double one , in fact .
there were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device , but no , i must pick out a picturesque one ; it is the crying defect of my character .
and then , i had ordered my procedure upon what the officer , being human , would naturally do ; whereas when you are least expecting it , a man <name> now and then go and do the very thing which it 's not natural for him to do .
the natural thing for the officer to do , in this case , was to follow straight on my heels ; he would find a stout oaken door , securely locked , between him and me ; before he could break it down , i should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling <unk> in britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character .
but instead of doing the natural thing , the officer took me at my word , and followed my instructions .
and so , as i came trotting out of that <unk> de sac , full of satisfaction with my own cleverness , he turned the corner and i walked right into his handcuffs .
if i had known it was a <unk> de sac  however , there is n't any <unk> a blunder like that , let it go .
charge it up to profit and loss .
of course , i was indignant , and swore i had just come ashore from a long voyage , and all that sort of thing  just to see , you know , if it would deceive that slave .
but it did n't .
he knew me .
then i reproached him for betraying me .
he was more surprised than hurt .
he stretched his eyes wide , and said : " what , wouldst have me let thee , of all men , escape and not <name> with us , when <unk> the very cause of our hanging ?
go to ! "
" go to " was their way of saying " i should smile ! "
or " i like that ! "
queer talkers , those people .
well , there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case , and so i dropped the matter .
when you ca n't cure a disaster by argument , what is the use to argue ?
it is n't my way .
so i only said : " you 're not going to be hanged .
none of us are . "
both men laughed , and the slave said : " ye have not ranked as a fool  before .
you might better keep your reputation , seeing the strain would not be for long . "
" it <name> stand it , i reckon .
before to-morrow we shall be out of prison , and free to go where we <name> , besides . "
the witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb , made a rasping noise in his throat , and said : " out of prison  yes  ye say true .
and free likewise to go where ye <name> , so ye wander not out of his <name> the devil 's sultry realm . "
i kept my temper , and said , indifferently : " now i suppose you really think we are going to <name> within a day or two . "
" i thought it not many minutes ago , for so the thing was decided and proclaimed . "
" ah , then you 've changed your mind , is that it ? "
" even that .
i only thought , then ; i know , now . "
i felt <unk> , so i said : " oh , <unk> servant of the law , condescend to tell us , then , what you know . "
" that ye <name> all be hanged to-day , at <unk> !
oho !
that shot hit home !
<name> upon me . "
the fact is i did need to <name> upon somebody .
my knights couldn't arrive in time .
they would be as much as three hours too late .
nothing in the world could save the king of england ; nor me , which was more important .
more important , not merely to me , but to the nation  the only nation on earth standing ready to <name> into civilization .
i was sick .
i said no more , there wasn't anything to say .
i knew what the man meant ; that if the missing slave was found , the postponement would be <unk> , the execution take place to-day .
well , the missing slave was found .
chapter xxxviii sir launcelot and knights to the rescue nearing four in the afternoon .
the scene was just outside the walls of london .
a cool , comfortable , superb day , with a brilliant sun ; the kind of day to make one want to live , not die .
the multitude was prodigious and far-reaching ; and yet we fifteen poor devils had n't a friend in it .
there was something painful in that thought , look at it how you might .
there we sat , on our tall scaffold , the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies .
we were being made a holiday spectacle .
they had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry , and these were there in full force , with their ladies .
we recognized a good many of them .
the crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king .
the moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up , in his fantastic rags , with face bruised out of all recognition , and proclaimed himself <name> , king of britain , and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched .
it startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter .
it wounded his dignity , and he locked himself up in silence .
then , although the crowd begged him to go on , and tried to provoke him to it by <unk> , jeers , and shouts of : " let him speak !
the king !
the king !
his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his serene and sacred <unk> ! "
but it went for nothing .
he put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved .
he certainly was great in his way .
absently , i had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm .
when the crowd noticed this , they began upon me .
they said : " doubtless this <unk> is his minister  observe his costly badge of office ! "
i let them go on until they got tired , and then i said : " yes , i am his minister , the boss ; and to-morrow you <name> hear that from camelot which  " i got no further .
they drowned me out with joyous derision .
but presently there was silence ; for the sheriffs of london , in their official robes , with their subordinates , began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin .
in the hush which followed , our crime was recited , the death warrant read , then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer .
then a slave was blindfolded ; the <unk> unslung his rope .
there lay the smooth road below us , we upon one side of it , the banked multitude wailing its other side  a good clear road , and kept free by the police  how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it !
but no , it was out of the possibilities .
i followed its receding thread out into the distance  not a horseman on it , or sign of one .
there was a jerk , and the slave <name> dangling ; dangling and hideously squirming , for his limbs were not tied .
a second rope was unslung , in a moment another slave was dangling .
in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air .
it was dreadful .
i turned away my head a moment , and when i turned back i missed the king !
they were <unk> him !
i was paralyzed ; i could n't move , i was choking , my tongue was petrified .
they finished <unk> him , they led him under the rope .
i couldn't shake off that clinging impotence .
but when i saw them put the noose around his neck , then everything let go in me and i made a spring to the rescue  and as i made it i shot one more glance abroad  by <name> !
here they came , <unk> !  five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles !
the grandest sight that ever was seen .
lord , how the plumes streamed , how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of <unk> wheels !
i waved my right arm as launcelot swept in  he recognized my rag  i tore away noose and bandage , and shouted : " on your knees , every rascal of you , and salute the king !
who fails shall sup in hell to-night ! "
i always use that high style when i 'm <unk> an effect .
well , it was <name> to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard .
and it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been <unk> and insulting .
and as he stood apart there , receiving this homage in rags , i thought to myself , well , really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king , after all .
i was immensely satisfied .
take the whole situation all around , it was one of the <unk> effects i ever <unk> .
and presently up comes <name> , his own self !
and winks , and says , very <unk> : " good deal of a surprise , was n't it ?
i knew you 'd like it .
i've had the boys practicing this long time , privately ; and just hungry for a chance to show off . "
chapter xxxix the yankee 's fight with the knights home again , at camelot .
a morning or two later i found the paper , damp from the press , by my plate at the breakfast table .
i turned to the advertising columns , knowing i should find something of personal interest to me there .
it was this : de par <name> roi .
know that the great lord and <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir sagramor <name> desirous having condescended to meet the king 's minister , <name> <unk> <unk> , the which is <unk> the boss , for <unk> of offence anciently given , these <name> engage in the lists by camelot about the fourth hour of the morning of the sixteenth day of this next succeeding month .
the battle <name> be a l <unk> , sith the said offence was of a deadly sort , admitting of no composition .
de par <name> roi <name> 's editorial reference to this affair was to this effect : it <name> be observed , by a <unk> at our advertising columns , that the <unk> <unk> is to be favored with a treat of <name> usual interest in the tournament line .
the n <unk> of the artists are warrant of good <unk> .
the <unk> <name> be open at noon of the 13th ; ad mission 3 cents , reserved <unk> 5 ; pro <unk> to go to the hospital fund the <name> pair and all the court <name> be <unk> ent .
with these exceptions , and the press and the clergy , the free list is strict <unk> suspended .
parties are hereby warn <name> against buying tickets of speculators ; they <name> not be good at the door .
everybody knows and likes the boss , everybody knows and likes sir <unk> .
; come , let us give the lads a good send off .
remember , the proceeds go to a great and free <name> , and one whose broad <unk> stretches out its help <unk> hand , warm with the blood of a <unk> <unk> heart , to all that suffer , regardless of race , creed , condition or color  the only <name> yet established in the earth which has no <unk> stop cock on its compassion , but says here flows the stream , let all come and drink !
turn out , all hands !
fetch along your <unk> and your <unk> and have a good time .
pie for sale on the grounds , and rocks to crack it with ; and <unk>  three drops of lime juice to a barrel of water .
n.b .
this is the first tournament under the new law , <unk> allow each <unk> to use any weapon he may <unk> fer .
you may want to make a note of that .
up to the day set , there was no talk in all britain of anything but this combat .
all other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of men 's thoughts and interest .
it was not because a tournament was a great matter , it was not because sir sagramor had found the holy <unk> , for he had not , but had failed ; it was not because the second ( official ) personage in the kingdom was one of the <unk> ; no , all these features were commonplace .
yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating .
it was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men , so to speak , but a duel between two mighty magicians ; a duel not of muscle but of mind , not of human skill but of superhuman <name> and craft ; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master <unk> of the age .
it was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this ; they could be but child's play , contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods .
yes , all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between <name> and me , a measuring of his magic powers against mine .
it was known that <name> had been busy whole days and nights together , <unk> sir sagramor 's arms and armor with <unk> powers of offense and defense , and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men .
against sir sagramor , so <unk> and protected , a thousand knights could accomplish nothing ; against him no known enchantments could prevail .
these facts were sure ; regarding them there was no doubt , no reason for doubt .
there was but one question : might there be still other enchantments , unknown to <name> , which could render sir sagramor 's veil transparent to me , and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons ?
this was the one thing to be decided in the lists .
until then the world must remain in suspense .
so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here , and the world was right , but it was not the one they had in their minds .
no , a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die : the life of <unk> .
i was a champion , it was true , but not the champion of the frivolous black arts , i was the champion of hard <unk> common-sense and reason .
i was entering the lists to either destroy <unk> or be its victim .
vast as the <unk> were , there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists , at ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th .
the mammoth <unk> was clothed in flags , streamers , and <name> tapestries , and packed with several acres of <unk> tributary kings , their suites , and the british aristocracy ; with our own <name> gang in the chief place , and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and <unk>  well , i never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippi sunset and the <name> borealis .
the huge camp of <unk> and <unk> tents at one end of the lists , with a <unk> sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge , was another fine sight .
you see , every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling ; for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret , and so here was their chance .
if i won my fight with sir sagramor , others would have the right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond .
down at our end there were but two tents ; one for me , and another for my servants .
at the appointed hour the king made a sign , and the heralds , in their <unk> , appeared and made proclamation , naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel .
there was a pause , then a ringing <unk> , which was the signal for us to come forth .
all the multitude caught their breath , and an eager curiosity flashed into every face .
out from his tent rode great sir sagramor , an imposing tower of iron , stately and rigid , his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand , his grand horse 's face and breast cased in steel , his body clothed in <name> trappings that almost dragged the ground  oh , a most <name> picture .
a great shout went up , of welcome and admiration .
and then out i came .
but i did n't get any shout .
there was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment , then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea , but a warning <unk> cut its career short .
i was in the simplest and <unk> of gymnast costumes  <unk> tights from neck to heel , with blue silk <unk> about my loins , and bareheaded .
my horse was not above medium size , but he was alert , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , and just a greyhound to go .
he was a beauty , glossy as silk , and naked as he was when he was born , except for bridle and <unk> .
the iron tower and the gorgeous <unk> came <unk> but gracefully <unk> down the lists , and we tripped lightly up to meet them .
we halted ; the tower saluted , i responded ; then we wheeled and rode side by side to the <unk> and faced our king and <name> , to whom we made obeisance .
the <name> exclaimed : " alack , sir boss , wilt fight naked , and without <name> or sword or  " but the king checked her and made her understand , with a polite phrase or two , that this was none of her business .
the bugles rang again ; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists , and took position .
now old <name> stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned him into hamlet 's ghost ; the king made a sign , the bugles blew , sir sagramor laid his great <name> in rest , and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind , and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him  <unk> my ear the while , as if noting the invisible <unk> position and progress by hearing , not sight .
a chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him , and one brave voice flung out a <unk> word for me  said : " go it , slim <name> ! "
it was an even bet that <name> had procured that favor for me  and furnished the language , too .
when that formidable <unk> was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside without an effort , and the big knight swept by , scoring a blank .
i got plenty of applause that time .
we turned , braced up , and down we came again .
another blank for the knight , a roar of applause for me .
this same thing was repeated once more ; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his temper , and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down .
why , he had n't any show in the world at that ; it was a game of tag , with all the advantage on my side ; i whirled out of his path with ease whenever i chose , and once i slapped him on the back as i went to the rear .
finally i took the <name> into my own hands ; and after that , turn , or twist , or do what he would , he was never able to get behind me again ; he found himself always in front at the end of his <unk> .
so he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists .
his temper was clear gone now , and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine .
i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle , and grasped the coil in my right hand .
this time you should have seen him come !  it was a business trip , sure ; by his gait there was blood in his eye .
i was sitting my horse at ease , and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head ; the moment he was under way , i started for him ; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet , i sent the <unk> spirals of the rope <unk> through the air , then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge .
the next moment the rope sprang taut and <unk> sir sagramor out of the saddle !
great <name> , but there was a sensation !
unquestionably , the popular thing in this world is novelty .
these people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before , and it carried them clear off their feet with delight .
from all around and everywhere , the shout went up : " encore !
encore ! "
i wondered where they got the word , but there was no time to cipher on <unk> matters , because the whole <unk> hive was just humming now , and my prospect for trade could n't have been better .
the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramor had been assisted to his tent , i hauled in the slack , took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again .
i was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for sir sagramor , and that could n't take long where there were so many hungry candidates .
indeed , they elected one straight off  sir <unk> de revel .
<unk> !
here he came , like a house afire ; i dodged : he passed like a flash , with my <unk> coils settling around his neck ; a second or so later , <unk> !
his saddle was empty .
i got another encore ; and another , and another , and still another .
when i had <unk> five men out , things began to look serious to the <unk> , and they stopped and consulted together .
as a result , they decided that it was time to <unk> etiquette and send their greatest and best against me .
to the astonishment of that little world , i <unk> sir <unk> de <unk> , and after him sir <unk> .
so you see there was simply nothing to be done now , but play their right bower  bring out the <unk> of the superb , the mightiest of the mighty , the great sir launcelot himself !
a proud moment for me ?
i should think so .
yonder was <name> , king of britain ; yonder was <unk> ; yes , and whole tribes of little provincial kings and <unk> ; and in the <unk> camp yonder , renowned knights from many lands ; and likewise the <unk> body known to chivalry , the knights of the table round , the most illustrious in christendom ; and biggest fact of all , the very sun of their shining system was yonder <unk> his <name> , the <unk> point of forty thousand adoring eyes ; and all by myself , here was i laying for him .
across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain <unk> of west hartford , and i wished she could see me now .
in that moment , down came the invincible , with the rush of a whirlwind  the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward  the fateful coils went circling through the air , and before you could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his back , and kissing my hand to the storm of waving <unk> and the <unk> of applause that greeted me !
said i to myself , as i coiled my lariat and <name> it on my <unk> , and sat there drunk with <name> , " the victory is perfect  no other <name> venture against me  <unk> is dead . "
now imagine my astonishment  and everybody else 's , too  to hear the peculiar <unk> which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists !
there was a mystery here ; i could n't account for this thing .
next , i noticed <name> gliding away from me ; and then i noticed that my lasso was gone !
the old <unk> expert had stolen it , sure , and slipped it under his robe .
the bugle blew again .
i looked , and down came sagramor riding again , with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely <unk> .
i trotted up to meet him , and pretended to find him by the sound of his horse 's hoofs .
he said : " <unk> quick of ear , but it <name> not save thee from this ! "
and he touched the hilt of his great sword .
" an ye are not able to see it , because of the influence of the veil , know that it is no <unk> <name> , but a sword  and i <unk> ye <name> not be able to avoid it . "
his <unk> was up ; there was death in his smile .
i should never be able to dodge his sword , that was plain .
somebody was going to die this time .
if he got the drop on me , i could name the corpse .
we rode forward together , and saluted the royalties .
this time the king was disturbed .
he said : " where is thy strange weapon ? "
" it is stolen , sire . "
" hast another at hand ? "
" no , sire , i brought only the one . "
then <name> mixed in : " he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring .
there exists none other but that one .
it <unk> to the king of the demons of the sea .
this man is a <unk> , and ignorant , else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight <unk> only , and then it <unk> away to its home under the sea . "
" then is he <unk> , " said the king .
" sir <unk> , ye <name> <name> him leave to borrow . "
" and i <name> lend ! "
said sir launcelot , limping up .
" he is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live , and he shall have mine . "
he put his hand on his sword to draw it , but sir sagramor said : " stay , it may not be .
he shall fight with his own weapons ; it was his privilege to choose them and bring them .
if he has erred , on his head be it . "
" knight ! "
said the king .
" <unk> <unk> with passion ; it <unk> thy mind .
wouldst kill a naked man ? "
" an he do it , he shall answer it to me , " said sir launcelot .
" i <name> answer it to any he that <unk> ! "
retorted sir sagramor hotly .
<name> broke in , rubbing his hands and smiling his <unk> smile of malicious gratification : " 't is well said , right well said !
and 't is enough of <unk> , let my lord the king deliver the battle signal . "
the king had to yield .
the bugle made proclamation , and we turned apart and rode to our stations .
there we stood , a hundred yards apart , facing each other , rigid and motionless , like <unk> statues .
and so we remained , in a <unk> hush , as much as a full minute , everybody gazing , nobody stirring .
it seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal .
but at last he lifted his hand , the clear note of the bugle followed , sir sagramor 's long blade described a flashing curve in the air , and it was superb to see him come .
i sat still .
on he came .
i did not move .
people got so excited that they shouted to me : " fly , fly !
save thyself !
this is <unk> ! "
i never <unk> so much as an inch till that thundering apparition had got within fifteen paces of me ; then i snatched a <unk> revolver out of my holster , there was a flash and a roar , and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened .
here was a <unk> horse plunging by , and yonder lay sir sagramor , stone dead .
the people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible , no hurt upon his body , nothing like a wound .
there was a hole through the breast of his <unk> , but they attached no importance to a little thing like that ; and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood , none came in sight because of the clothing and <unk> under the armor .
the body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it .
they were stupefied with astonishment naturally .
i was requested to come and explain the miracle .
but i remained in my tracks , like a statue , and said : " if it is a command , i <name> come , but my lord the king knows that i am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any <name> to come against me . "
i waited .
nobody challenged .
then i said : " if there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won , i do not wait for them to challenge me , i challenge them . "
" it is a gallant offer , " said the king , " and well <unk> you .
whom <name> you name first ? "
" i name none , i challenge all !
here i stand , and dare the chivalry of england to come against me  not by individuals , but in mass ! "
" what ! "
shouted a score of knights .
" you have heard the challenge .
take it , or i proclaim you <unk> knights and vanquished , every one ! "
it was a " bluff " you know .
at such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth ; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to " call , " and you rake in the chips .
but just this once  well , things looked <unk> !
in just no time , five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles , and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me .
i snatched both revolvers from the <unk> and began to measure distances and calculate chances .
bang !
one saddle empty .
bang !
another one .
bang  bang , and i <unk> two .
well , it was nip and tuck with us , and i knew it .
if i spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people , the twelfth man would kill me , sure .
and so i never did feel so happy as i did when my ninth <unk> its man and i detected the wavering in the crowd which is <unk> of panic .
an instant lost now could knock out my last chance .
but i did n't lose it .
i raised both revolvers and pointed them  the halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment , then broke and fled .
the day was mine .
<unk> was a doomed institution .
the march of civilization was begun .
how did i feel ?
ah , you never could imagine it .
and <unk> <name> ?
his stock was flat again .
somehow , every time the magic of <unk> tried conclusions with the magic of science , the magic of <unk> got left .
chapter xl three years later when i broke the back of <unk> that time , i no longer felt obliged to work in secret .
so , the very next day i exposed my hidden schools , my mines , and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world .
that is to say , i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth .
well , it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly .
the knights were temporarily down , but if i would keep them so i must just simply <unk> them  nothing short of that would answer .
you see , i was " <unk> " that last time in the field ; it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion , if i gave them a chance .
so i must not give them time ; and i did n't .
i renewed my challenge , engraved it on brass , posted it up where any priest could read it to them , and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper .
i not only renewed it , but added to its proportions .
i said , name the day , and i would take fifty assistants and stand up against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it .
i was not <unk> this time .
i meant what i said ; i could do what i promised .
there was n't any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge .
even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of " put up , or shut up . "
they were wise and did the latter .
in all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning .
consider the three years sped .
now look around on england .
a happy and prosperous country , and strangely altered .
schools everywhere , and several colleges ; a number of pretty good newspapers .
even authorship was taking a start ; sir <unk> the humorist was first in the field , with a volume of gray-headed jokes which i had been familiar with during thirteen centuries .
if he had left out that old <unk> one about the lecturer i would n't have said anything ; but i could n't stand that one .
i suppressed the book and hanged the author .
slavery was dead and gone ; all men were equal before the law ; taxation had been <unk> .
the telegraph , the telephone , the phonograph , the typewriter , the <unk> , and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor .
we had a steamboat or two on the thames , we had steam warships , and the beginnings of a steam commercial <name> ; i was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover <name> .
we were building several lines of railway , and our line from camelot to london was already finished and in operation .
i was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor .
my idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility , and make them useful and keep them out of mischief .
the plan worked very well , the competition for the places was hot .
the conductor of the <unk> express was a duke ; there was n't a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of <name> .
they were good men , every one , but they had two defects which i could n't cure , and so had to wink at : they would n't lay aside their armor , and they would " knock down " fare  i mean <name> the company .
there was hardly a knight in all the land who was n't in some useful employment .
they were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities ; their <unk> for wandering , and their experience in it , made them altogether the most effective <unk> of civilization we had .
they went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and <name> and battle-axe , and if they couldn't persuade a person to try a <unk> on the <unk> plan , or a <unk> , or a <unk> fence , or a prohibition journal , or any of the other thousand and one things they <unk> for , they removed him and passed on .
i was very happy .
things were working steadily toward a secretly <unk> point .
you see , i had two schemes in my head which were the <unk> of all my projects .
the one was to overthrow the catholic church and set up the protestant <name> on its ruins  not as an established church , but a <unk> one ; and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by , commanding that upon <name> 's death unlimited suffrage should be introduced , and given to men and women alike  at any rate to all men , wise or unwise , and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one .
<name> was good for thirty years yet , he being about my own age  that is to say , forty  and i believed that in that time i could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the world  a rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed .
the result to be a republic .
well , i may as well confess , though i do feel ashamed when i think of it : i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself .
yes , there was more or less human nature in me ; i found that out .
<name> was with me as concerned the revolution , but in a modified way .
his idea was a republic , without privileged orders , but with a hereditary <name> family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate .
he believed that no nation that had ever known the <name> of worshiping a <name> family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy .
i urged that kings were dangerous .
he said , then have cats .
he was sure that a <name> family of cats would answer every purpose .
they would be as useful as any other <name> family , they would know as much , they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries , the same disposition to get up <unk> with other <name> cats , they would be <unk> vain and absurd and never know it , they would be wholly <unk> ; finally , they would have as sound a divine right as any other <name> house , and " <name> vii , or <name> xi , or <name> xiv by the <name> of god king , " would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary <name> <unk> with tights on .
" and as a rule , " said he , in his neat modern english , " the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king , and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation , for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarch 's .
the worship of royalty being founded in <unk> , these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties , and indeed more so , because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody , beheaded nobody , imprisoned nobody , inflicted no cruelties or <unk> of any sort , and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king , and would certainly get it .
the eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system , and <name> butchers would presently begin to disappear ; their subjects would fill the vacancies with <unk> from our own <name> house ; we should become a factory ; we should supply the thrones of the world ; within forty years all europe would be governed by cats , and we should furnish the cats .
the reign of universal peace would begin then , to end no more forever ... .
<unk>  <unk> !  wow ! "
<name> him , i supposed he was in <name> , and was beginning to be persuaded by him , until he exploded that <unk> and startled me almost out of my clothes .
but he never could be in <name> .
he did n't know what it was .
he had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy , but he was too <unk> to know it , or care anything about it , either .
i was going to give him a scolding , but <name> came flying in at that moment , wild with terror , and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice .
i ran and took her in my arms , and lavished caresses upon her and said , <unk> : " speak , darling , speak !
what is it ? "
her head fell limp upon my bosom , and she gasped , almost <unk> : " <unk> ! "
" quick ! "
i shouted to <name> ; " telephone the king 's <unk> to come ! "
in two minutes i was kneeling by the child 's crib , and <name> was <unk> servants here , there , and everywhere , all over the palace .
i took in the situation almost at a glance  membranous croup !
i bent down and whispered : " wake up , sweetheart !
<unk> . "
she opened her soft eyes languidly , and made out to say : " papa . "
that was a comfort .
she was far from dead yet .
i sent for preparations of sulphur , i <unk> out the <unk> myself ; for i do n't sit down and wait for doctors when <name> or the child is sick .
i knew how to nurse both of them , and had had experience .
this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life , and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the <unk> on its <unk> when even its mother could n't .
sir launcelot , in his richest armor , came striding along the great hall now on his way to the <unk> ; he was president of the <unk> , and occupied the siege perilous , which he had bought of sir <unk> ; for the <unk> consisted of the knights of the round table , and they used the round table for business purposes now .
seats at it were worth  well , you would never believe the figure , so it is no use to state it .
sir launcelot was a bear , and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines , and was just getting ready to squeeze the <unk> to-day ; but what of that ?
he was the same old launcelot , and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick , that was enough for him ; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him , he would come right in here and stand by little <unk> for all he was worth .
and that was what he did .
he shied his helmet into the corner , and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the <unk> .
by this time <name> had built a blanket canopy over the crib , and everything was ready .
sir launcelot got up steam , he and i loaded up the kettle with <unk> lime and <unk> acid , with a touch of <unk> acid added thereto , then filled the thing up with water and inserted the <unk> under the canopy .
everything was <unk> now , and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch .
<name> was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of <unk> with <unk> and <unk> for us , and told us to smoke as much as we pleased , it could n't get under the canopy , and she was used to smoke , being the first <name> in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown .
well , there could n't be a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his <name> armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy <unk> .
he was a beautiful man , a lovely man , and was just intended to make a wife and children happy .
but , of course <unk>  however , it 's no use to cry over what 's done and ca n't be helped .
well , he stood <unk> with me , right straight through , for three days and nights , till the child was out of danger ; then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her , with his plumes falling about her golden head , then laid her softly in <unk> lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall , between the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and <unk> , and so disappeared .
and no instinct warned me that i should never look upon him again in this world !
lord , what a world of <unk> it is .
the doctors said we must take the child away , if we would coax her back to health and strength again .
and she must have <unk> .
so we took a man-of-war , and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons , and went cruising about , and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the french coast , and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there .
the little king of that region offered us his hospitalities , and we were glad to accept .
if he had had as many conveniences as he lacked , we should have been plenty comfortable enough ; even as it was , we made out very well , in his queer old castle , by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship .
at the end of a month i sent the vessel home for fresh supplies , and for news .
we expected her back in three or four days .
she would bring me , along with other news , the result of a certain experiment which i had been starting .
it was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry , keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief , and at the same time preserve the best thing in them , which was their hardy spirit of emulation .
i had had a choice band of them in private training for some time , and the date was now arriving for their first public effort .
this experiment was baseball .
in order to give the thing vogue from the start , and place it out of the reach of criticism , i chose my <unk> by rank , not capacity .
there was n't a knight in either team who was n't a <unk> sovereign .
as for material of this sort , there was a <unk> of it always around <name> .
you couldn't throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king .
of course , i could n't get these people to leave off their armor ; they wouldn't do that when they bathed .
they consented to <unk> the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other , but that was the most they would do .
so , one of the teams wore <unk> <unk> , and the other wore <unk> made of my new <unk> steel .
their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing i ever saw .
being <unk> , they never skipped out of the way , but stood still and took the result ; when a <unk> was at the bat and a ball hit him , it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes .
and when a man was running , and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base , it was like an <unk> coming into port .
at first i appointed men of no rank to act as umpires , but i had to <unk> that .
these people were no easier to please than other <unk> .
the umpire 's first decision was usually his last ; they broke him in two with a bat , and his friends <unk> him home on a shutter .
when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game , <unk> got to be unpopular .
so i was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him .
here are the names of the <unk> : <unk> <unk> king <name> .
emperor <name> .
king lot of <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of <unk> .
king <unk> of ireland .
king <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of little britain .
king <name> of cornwall .
king labor .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> of <unk> .
king <unk> .
king of the lake .
king <unk> la <unk> .
the <unk> of syria .
umpire  <name> .
the first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people ; and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see .
everything would be favorable ; it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now , and nature was all <unk> out in her new clothes .
chapter <unk> the <unk> however , my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters ; our child began to lose ground again , and we had to go to sitting up with her , her case became so serious .
we could n't bear to allow anybody to help in this service , so we two stood <unk> , day in and day out .
ah , <name> , what a right heart she had , how simple , and genuine , and good she was !
she was a flawless wife and mother ; and yet i had married her for no other particular reasons , except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field .
she had hunted britain over for me ; had found me at the <unk> outside of london , and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the <unk> way and as of right .
i was a new <unk> , and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her , sooner or later .
she could n't see how , but i cut argument short and we had a wedding .
now i did n't know i was drawing a prize , yet that was what i did draw .
within the <unk> i became her <unk> ; and ours was the dearest and <unk> comradeship that ever was .
people talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex .
what is the best of that sort , as compared with the friendship of man and wife , where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same ?
there is no place for comparison between the two friendships ; the one is earthly , the other divine .
in my dreams , along at first , i still wandered thirteen centuries away , and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and <unk> all up and down the <unk> vacancies of a vanished world .
many a time <name> heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep .
with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child , conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine .
it touched me to tears , and it also nearly knocked me off my feet , too , when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward , and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me : " the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved , here made holy , and the music of it <name> abide alway in our ears .
now thou'lt kiss me , as knowing the name i have given the child . "
but i did n't know it , all the same .
i had n't an idea in the world ; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game ; so i never let on , but said : " yes , i know , sweetheart  how dear and good it is of you , too !
but i want to hear these lips of yours , which are also mine , utter it first  then its music <name> be perfect . "
pleased to the marrow , she murmured : " <unk> ! "
i did n't laugh  i am always thankful for that  but the strain ruptured every cartilage in me , and for weeks afterward i could hear my bones clack when i walked .
she never found out her mistake .
the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised , and not pleased ; but i told her i had given order for it : that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality , in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake .
this was not true .
but it answered .
well , during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib , and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sick-room .
then our reward came : the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend .
grateful ?
it is n't the term .
there isn't any term for it .
you know that yourself , if you've watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one <unk> smile that you could cover with your hand .
why , we were back in this world in one instant !
then we looked the same startled thought into each other 's eyes at the same moment ; more than two weeks gone , and that ship not back yet !
in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train .
they had been steeped in troubled <unk> all this time  their faces showed it .
i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea .
where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its <unk> flocks ?
vanished , every one !
not a sail , from verge to verge , not a <unk>  just a dead and empty solitude , in place of all that brisk and breezy life .
i went swiftly back , saying not a word to anybody .
i told <name> this ghastly news .
we could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain .
had there been an invasion ?
an earthquake ?
a pestilence ?
had the nation been swept out of existence ?
but guessing was <unk> .
i must go  at once .
i borrowed the king's navy  a " ship " no bigger than a steam launch  and was soon ready .
the parting  ah , yes , that was hard .
as i was devouring the child with last kisses , it <unk> up and <unk> out its vocabulary !
 the first time in more than two weeks , and it made fools of us for <name> .
the darling <unk> of childhood !  dear me , there 's no music that can touch it ; and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness , knowing it <name> never visit his bereaved ear again .
well , how good it was to be able to <name> that gracious memory away with me !
i approached england the next morning , with the wide highway of salt water all to myself .
there were ships in the harbor , at dover , but they were naked as to sails , and there was no sign of life about them .
it was <name> ; yet at canterbury the streets were empty ; strangest of all , there was not even a priest in sight , and no stroke of a <name> fell upon my ear .
the <unk> of death was everywhere .
i could n't understand it .
at last , in the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession  just a family and a few friends following a coffin  no priest ; a funeral without <name> , book , or candle ; there was a church there close at hand , but they passed it by weeping , and did not enter it ; i glanced up at the belfry , and there <name> the <name> , shrouded in black , and its tongue tied back .
now i knew !
now i understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england .
invasion ?
invasion is a <unk> to it .
it was the <unk> !
i asked no questions ; i did n't need to ask any .
the church had struck ; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise , and go warily .
one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes , and when we were safe beyond the town i put them on , and from that time i traveled alone ; i could not risk the embarrassment of company .
a miserable journey .
a desolate silence everywhere .
even in london itself .
traffic had ceased ; men did not talk or laugh , or go in groups , or even in couples ; they moved aimlessly about , each man by himself , with his head down , and woe and terror at his heart .
the tower showed recent <unk> .
verily , much had been happening .
of course , i meant to take the train for camelot .
train !
why , the station was as vacant as a cavern .
i moved on .
the journey to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen .
the monday and the tuesday differed in no way from the <name> .
i arrived far in the night .
from being the best <unk> town in the kingdom and the most like a <unk> sun of anything you ever saw , it was become simply a blot  a blot upon darkness  that is to say , it was darker and <unk> than the rest of the darkness , and so you could see it a little better ; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical  a sort of sign that the church was going to keep the upper hand now , and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that .
i found no life stirring in the somber streets .
i groped my way with a heavy heart .
the vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop , not a spark visible about it .
the drawbridge was down , the great gate stood wide , i entered without challenge , my own heels making the only sound i heard  and it was sepulchral enough , in those huge vacant courts .
chapter <unk> war !
i found <name> alone in his quarters , drowned in melancholy ; and in place of the electric light , he had <unk> the ancient <unk> , and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains drawn tight .
he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly , saying : " oh , it 's worth a billion <unk> to look upon a live person again ! "
he knew me as easily as if i had n't been disguised at all .
which frightened me ; one may easily believe that .
" quick , now , tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster , " i said .
" how did it come about ? "
" well , if there had n't been any <name> <unk> , it would n't have come so early ; but it would have come , anyway .
it would have come on your own account by and by ; by luck , it happened to come on the <name> 's . "
" and sir launcelot 's ? "
" just so . "
" give me the details . "
" i reckon you <name> <name> that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the <name> and sir launcelot  " " yes , king <name> 's . "
"  and only one heart that was without suspicion  " " yes  the king 's ; a heart that is n't capable of thinking evil of a friend . "
" well , the king might have gone on , still happy and unsuspecting , to the end of his days , but for one of your modern improvements  the <unk> .
when you left , three miles of the london , canterbury and dover were ready for the rails , and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the <unk> .
it was wildcat , and everybody knew it .
the stock was for sale at a <unk> .
what does sir launcelot do , but  " " yes , i know ; he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song ; then he bought about twice as much more , <unk> upon call ; and he was about to call when i left . "
" very well , he did call .
the boys could n't deliver .
oh , he had them  and he just settled his grip and squeezed them .
they were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at 15 and 16 and along there that was n't worth 10 .
well , when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths , they <unk> that side by shifting the laugh to the other side .
that was when they compromised with the invincible at 283 ! "
" good land ! "
" he skinned them alive , and they deserved it  anyway , the whole kingdom rejoiced .
well , among the flayed were sir <unk> and sir mordred , nephews to the king .
end of the first act .
act second , scene first , an apartment in carlisle castle , where the court had gone for a few days ' hunting .
persons present , the whole tribe of the king 's nephews .
mordred and <unk> propose to call the guileless <name> 's attention to <unk> and sir launcelot .
sir gawaine , sir gareth , and sir <unk> <name> have nothing to do with it .
a dispute ensues , with loud talk ; in the midst of it enter the king .
mordred and <unk> spring their devastating tale upon him .
<unk> .
a trap is laid for launcelot , by the king 's command , and sir launcelot walks into it .
he made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses  to wit , mordred , <unk> , and twelve knights of lesser rank , for he killed every one of them but mordred ; but of course that couldn't straighten matters between launcelot and the king , and did n't . "
" oh , dear , only one thing could result  i see that .
war , and the knights of the realm divided into a king 's party and a sir launcelot 's party . "
" yes  that was the way of it .
the king sent the <name> to the stake , proposing to purify her with fire .
launcelot and his knights rescued her , and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine  in fact , some of the best we ever had ; to wit , sir <unk> <name> <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> <name> <unk> de dieu , sir <unk> , sir <unk>  " " oh , you tear out my <unk> . "
"  wait , i 'm not done yet  sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk>  " " the very best man in my subordinate nine .
what a handy <unk> he was ! "
"  sir <unk> 's three brothers , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <name> the stranger  " " my peerless <unk> !
i 've seen him catch a <unk> in his teeth .
come , i ca n't stand this ! "
"  sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , sir <unk> , and  whom do you think ? "
" rush !
go on . "
" sir <unk> , and sir gareth  both ! "
" oh , incredible !
their love for launcelot was indestructible . "
" well , it was an accident .
they were simply onlookers ; they were unarmed , and were merely there to witness the <name> 's punishment .
sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury , and he killed these without noticing who they were .
here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle ; it's for sale on every <unk> .
there  the figures nearest the <name> are sir launcelot with his sword up , and sir gareth gasping his latest breath .
you can catch the agony in the <name> 's face through the curling smoke .
it 's a rattling <unk> . "
" indeed , it is .
we must take good care of it ; its historical value is incalculable .
go on . "
" well , the rest of the tale is just war , pure and simple .
launcelot retreated to his town and castle of joyous <unk> , and gathered there a great following of knights .
the king , with a great host , went there , and there was desperate fighting during several days , and , as a result , all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast-iron .
then the church patched up a peace between <name> and launcelot and the <name> and everybody  everybody but sir gawaine .
he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers , gareth and <unk> , and would not be appeased .
he notified launcelot to get him thence , and make swift preparation , and look to be soon attacked .
so launcelot sailed to his duchy of <unk> with his following , and gawaine soon followed with an army , and he beguiled <name> to go with him .
<name> left the kingdom in sir mordred 's hands until you should return  " " ah  a king 's customary wisdom ! "
" yes .
sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent .
he was going to marry <unk> , as a first move ; but she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london .
mordred attacked ; the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the <unk> .
the king returned ; mordred fought him at dover , at canterbury , and again at <unk> down .
then there was talk of peace and a composition .
terms , mordred to have cornwall and <name> during <name> 's life , and the whole kingdom afterward . "
" well , upon my word !
my dream of a republic to be a dream , and so remain . "
" yes .
the two armies lay near salisbury .
gawaine  gawaine 's head is at dover castle , he fell in the fight there  gawaine appeared to <name> in a dream , at least his ghost did , and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month , let the delay cost what it might .
but battle was precipitated by an accident .
<name> had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with mordred , sound the trumpet and fall on !
for he had no confidence in mordred .
mordred had given a similar order to his people .
well , by and by an <unk> bit a knight 's heel ; the knight forgot all about the order , and made a slash at the <unk> with his sword .
inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash !
they butchered away all day .
then the king  however , we have started something fresh since you left  our paper has . "
" no ?
what is that ? "
" war correspondence ! "
" why , that 's good . "
" yes , the paper was booming right along , for the <unk> made no impression , got no grip , while the war lasted .
i had war correspondents with both armies .
i <name> finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says : 'then the king looked about him , and then was he ware of all his host and of all his good knights were left no more on live but two knights , that was sir <unk> de <unk> , and his brother sir <unk> : and they were full sore wounded .
<unk> <name> , said the king , where are all my <name> knights <unk> ?
alas that ever i should see this doleful day .
for now , said <name> , i am come to mine end .
but would to god that i <unk> where were that traitor sir mordred , that hath caused all this mischief .
then was king <name> ware where sir mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men .
now give me my spear , said <name> unto sir <unk> , for yonder i have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought .
sir , let him be , said sir <unk> , for he is unhappy ; and if ye pass this unhappy day , ye shall be right well revenged upon him .
good lord , remember ye of your night 's dream , and what the spirit of sir gawaine told you this night , yet god of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto .
therefore , for god's sake , my lord , leave off by this .
for blessed be god ye have won the field : for here we be three on live , and with sir mordred is none on live .
and if ye leave off now , this wicked day of <name> is past .
tide me death , betide me life , saith the king , now i see him yonder alone , he shall never escape mine hands , for at a better avail shall i never have him .
god speed you well , said sir <unk> .
then the king <unk> his spear in both his hands , and ran toward sir mordred crying , traitor , now is thy death day come .
and when sir mordred heard sir <name> , he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand .
and then king <name> smote sir mordred under the shield , with a <unk> of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom .
and when sir mordred felt that he had his death 's wound , he thrust himself , with the might that he had , up to the butt of king <name> 's spear .
and right so he smote his father <name> with his sword holden in both his hands , on the side of the head , that the sword pierced the helmet and the <unk> , and <unk> sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth .
and the <name> <name> fell in a swoon to the earth , and there he swooned <unk>  ' " " that is a good piece of war correspondence , <name> ; you are a first-rate newspaper man .
well  is the king all right ?
did he get well ? "
" poor soul , no .
he is dead . "
i was utterly stunned ; it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him .
" and the <name> , <name> ? "
" she is a nun , in <unk> . "
" what changes !
and in such a short while .
it is inconceivable .
what next , i wonder ? "
" i can tell you what next . "
" well ? "
" stake our lives and stand by them ! "
" what do you mean by that ? "
" the church is master now .
the <unk> included you with mordred ; it is not to be removed while you remain alive .
the clans are gathering .
the church has gathered all the knights that are left alive , and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands . "
" stuff !
with our deadly scientific <unk> ; with our hosts of trained  " " save your breath  we have n't sixty faithful left ! "
" what are you saying ?
our schools , our colleges , our vast workshops , our  " " when those knights come , those establishments <name> empty themselves and go over to the enemy .
did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people ? "
" i certainly did think it . "
" well , then , you may <unk> it .
they stood every strain easily  until the <unk> .
since then , they merely put on a bold outside  at heart they are quaking .
make up your mind to it  when the armies come , the mask <name> fall . "
" it 's hard news .
we are lost .
they <name> turn our own science against us . "
" no they wo n't . "
" why ? "
" because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game .
i 'll tell you what i 've done , and what moved me to it .
smart as you are , the church was <unk> .
it was the church that sent you cruising  through her servants , the doctors . "
" <name> ! "
" it is the truth .
i know it .
every officer of your ship was the church 's picked servant , and so was every man of the crew . "
" oh , come ! "
" it is just as i tell you .
i did not find out these things at once , but i found them out finally .
did you send me verbal information , by the commander of the ship , to the effect that upon his return to you , with supplies , you were going to leave cadiz  " " cadiz !
i have n't been at cadiz at all ! "
"  going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely , for the health of your family ?
did you send me that word ? "
" of course not .
i would have written , would n't i ? "
" naturally .
i was troubled and suspicious .
when the commander sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him .
i have never heard of vessel or spy since .
i gave myself two weeks to hear from you in .
then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz .
there was a reason why i did n't . "
" what was that ? "
" our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared !
also , as suddenly and as mysteriously , the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased , the men all deserted , poles were cut down , the church laid a ban upon the electric light !
i had to be up and doing  and straight off .
your life was safe  nobody in these kingdoms but <name> would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back  i had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming .
i felt safe myself  nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours .
so this is what i did .
from our various works i selected all the men  boys i mean  whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure i could swear to , and i called them together secretly and gave them their instructions .
there are fifty-two of them ; none younger than fourteen , and none above seventeen years old . "
" why did you select boys ? "
" because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it .
it is in their blood and bones .
we imagined we had educated it out of them ; they thought so , too ; the <unk> woke them up like a <unk> !
it revealed them to themselves , and it revealed them to me , too .
with boys it was different .
such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the church 's terrors , and it was among these that i found my fifty-two .
as a next move , i paid a private visit to that old cave of <name> 's  not the small one  the big one  " " yes , the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when i was projecting a miracle . "
" just so .
and as that miracle had n't become necessary then , i thought it might be a good idea to <unk> the plant now .
i've <unk> the cave for a siege  " " a good idea , a first-rate idea . "
" i think so .
i placed four of my boys there as a guard  inside , and out of sight .
nobody was to be hurt  while outside ; but any attempt to enter  well , we said just let anybody try it !
then i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories , mills , workshops , magazines , etc. , and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave , and nobody but you and i suspects where the other end of it goes to .
we laid it under ground , of course , and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so .
we sha'n't have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization . "
" it was the right move  and the natural one ; military necessity , in the changed condition of things .
well , what changes have come !
we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other , but  however , go on . "
" next , we built a wire fence . "
" wire fence ? "
" yes .
you dropped the hint of it yourself , two or three years ago . "
" oh , i remember  the time the church tried her strength against us the first time , and presently thought it wise to wait for a <unk> season .
well , how have you arranged the fence ? "
" i start twelve immensely strong wires  naked , not insulated  from a big <unk> in the cave  <unk> with no brushes except a positive and a negative one  " " yes , that 's right . "
" the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter ; they make twelve independent fences , ten feet apart  that is to say , twelve circles within circles  and their ends come into the cave again . "
" right ; go on . "
" the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart , and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground . "
" that is good and strong . "
" yes .
the wires have no <unk> outside of the cave .
they go out from the positive brush of the <unk> ; there is a <unk> through the negative brush ; the other ends of the wire return to the cave , and each is grounded independently . "
" no , no , that wo n't do ! "
" why ? "
" it 's too expensive  uses up force for nothing .
you do n't want any <unk> except the one through the negative brush .
the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently , and without any <unk> .
now , then , observe the economy of it .
a cavalry charge <unk> itself against the fence ; you are using no power , you are spending no money , for there is only one <unk> till those horses come against the wire ; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush through the ground , and drop dead .
do n't you see ?  you are using no energy until it is needed ; your lightning is there , and ready , like the load in a gun ; but it is n't <unk> you a cent till you touch it off .
oh , yes , the single <unk>  " " of course !
i do n't know how i overlooked that .
it 's not only cheaper , but it 's more effectual than the other way , for if wires break or get tangled , no harm is done . "
" no , especially if we have a <unk> in the cave and <unk> the broken wire .
well , go on .
the <unk> ? "
" yes  that 's arranged .
in the center of the inner circle , on a spacious platform six feet high , i 've grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns , and provided plenty of ammunition . "
" that 's it .
they command every approach , and when the <unk> knights arrive , there 's going to be music .
the brow of the precipice over the cave  " " i 've got a wire fence there , and a gatling .
they wo n't drop any rocks down on us . "
" well , and the <unk> dynamite torpedoes ? "
" that 's attended to .
it 's the prettiest garden that was ever planted .
it 's a belt forty feet wide , and goes around the outer fence  distance between it and the fence one hundred yards  kind of neutral ground that space is .
there is n't a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo .
we laid them on the surface of the ground , and sprinkled a layer of sand over them .
it 's an innocent looking garden , but you let a man start in to hoe it once , and you 'll see . "
" you tested the torpedoes ? "
" well , i was going to , but  " " but what ?
why , it 's an immense oversight not to apply a  " " test ?
yes , i know ; but they 're all right ; i laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they 've been tested . "
" oh , that alters the case .
who did it ? "
" a church committee . "
" how kind ! "
" yes .
they came to command us to make submission .
you see they did n't really come to test the torpedoes ; that was merely an incident . "
" did the committee make a report ? "
" yes , they made one .
you could have heard it a mile . "
" unanimous ? "
" that was the nature of it .
after that i put up some signs , for the protection of future committees , and we have had no intruders since . "
" <name> , you 've done a world of work , and done it perfectly . "
" we had plenty of time for it ; there was n't any occasion for hurry . "
we sat silent awhile , thinking .
then my mind was made up , and i said : " yes , everything is ready ; everything is <unk> , no detail is wanting .
i know what to do now . "
" so do i ; sit down and wait . "
" no , sir !
rise up and strike ! "
" do you mean it ? "
" yes , indeed !
the <unk> is n't in my line , and the <unk> is .
that is , when i hold a fair hand  two-thirds as good a hand as the enemy .
oh , yes , we 'll rise up and strike ; that 's our game . "
" a hundred to one you are right .
when does the performance begin ? "
" now !  we 'll proclaim the republic . "
" well , that <name> precipitate things , sure enough ! "
" it <name> make them buzz , i tell you !
england <name> be a <unk> nest before noon to-morrow , if the church 's hand has n't lost its cunning  and we know it has n't .
now you write and i 'll dictate thus : " proclamation   " be it known unto all .
whereas the king having died and left no heir , it becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me , until a government shall have been created and set in motion .
the monarchy has lapsed , it no longer exists .
by consequence , all political power has reverted to its original source , the people of the nation .
with the monarchy , its several <unk> died also ; wherefore there is no longer a nobility , no longer a privileged class , no longer an established church ; all men are become exactly equal ; they are upon one common level , and religion is free .
a republic is hereby proclaimed , as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased .
it is the duty of the british people to meet together immediately , and by their votes elect representatives and deliver into their hands the government . "
i signed it " the boss , " and dated it from <name> 's cave .
<name> said  " why , that tells where we are , and invites them to call right away . "
" that is the idea .
we strike  by the proclamation  then it's their innings .
now have the thing set up and printed and posted , right off ; that is , give the order ; then , if you 've got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill , ho for <name> 's cave ! "
" i shall be ready in ten minutes .
what a cyclone there is going to be to-morrow when this piece of paper gets to work ! ...
it 's a pleasant old palace , this is ; i wonder if we shall ever again  but never mind about that . "
chapter <unk> the battle of the sand belt in <name> 's cave  <name> and i and fifty-two fresh , bright , well-educated , <unk> young british boys .
at <name> i sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance , as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines , " and no telling at what moment  therefore , vacate at once . "
these people knew me , and had confidence in my word .
they would clear out without waiting to part their hair , and i could take my own time about <unk> the explosion .
you could n't hire one of them to go back during the century , if the explosion was still impending .
we had a week of waiting .
it was not dull for me , because i was writing all the time .
during the first three days , i finished turning my old diary into this narrative form ; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date .
the rest of the week i took up in writing letters to my wife .
it was always my habit to write to <name> every day , whenever we were separate , and now i kept up the habit for love of it , and of her , though i couldn't do anything with the letters , of course , after i had written them .
but it put in the time , you see , and was almost like talking ; it was almost as if i was saying , " <name> , if you and <unk> were here in the cave , instead of only your photographs , what good times we could have ! "
and then , you know , i could imagine the baby <unk> something out in reply , with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mother 's lap on its back , and she <unk> and admiring and <unk> , and now and then tickling under the baby 's <name> to set it <unk> , and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself  and so on and so on  well , do n't you know , i could sit there in the cave with my pen , and keep it up , that way , by the hour with them .
why , it was almost like having us all together again .
i had spies out every night , of course , to get news .
every report made things look more and more impressive .
the hosts were gathering , gathering ; down all the roads and paths of england the knights were riding , and priests rode with them , to hearten these original crusaders , this being the church 's war .
all the nobilities , big and little , were on their way , and all the gentry .
this was all as was expected .
we should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and  ah , what a donkey i was !
toward the end of the week i began to get this large and <unk> fact through my head : that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day , and there an end !
the church , the nobles , and the gentry then turned one grand , <unk> frown upon them and <unk> them into sheep !
from that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold  that is to say , the camps  and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the " righteous cause . "
why , even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the " righteous cause , " and <unk> it , praying for it , <unk> <unk> over it , just like all the other <unk> .
imagine such human muck as this ; conceive of this folly !
yes , it was now " death to the republic ! "
everywhere  not a <unk> voice .
all england was marching against us !
truly , this was more than i had bargained for .
i watched my fifty-two boys narrowly ; watched their faces , their walk , their unconscious attitudes : for all these are a language  a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency , when we have secrets which we want to keep .
i knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts , all england is marching against us !  and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition , ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations , until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it , but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say , all england  all england !  is marching against you !
i knew all this would happen ; i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance ; therefore , i must be ready with an answer at that time  an answer well chosen and <unk> .
i was right .
the time came .
they had to speak .
poor lads , it was pitiful to see , they were so pale , so worn , so troubled .
at first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words ; but he presently got both .
this is what he said  and he put it in the neat modern english taught him in my schools : " we have tried to forget what we are  english boys !
we have tried to put reason before sentiment , duty before love ; our minds approve , but our hearts reproach us .
while apparently it was only the nobility , only the gentry , only the twenty-five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars , we were of one mind , and undisturbed by any troubling doubt ; each and every one of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you , said , 'they have chosen  it is their affair . '
but think !  the matter is altered  all england is marching against us !
oh , sir , consider !
 reflect !  these people are our people , they are bone of our bone , flesh of our flesh , we love them  do not ask us to destroy our nation ! "
well , it shows the value of looking ahead , and being ready for a thing when it happens .
if i had n't foreseen this thing and been fixed , that boy would have had me !  i could n't have said a word .
but i was fixed .
i said : " my boys , your hearts are in the right place , you have thought the worthy thought , you have done the worthy thing .
you are english boys , you <name> remain english boys , and you <name> keep that name <unk> .
give yourselves no further concern , let your minds be at peace .
consider this : while all england is marching against us , who is in the van ?
who , by the commonest rules of war , <name> march in the front ?
answer me . "
" the mounted host of mailed knights . "
" true .
they are thirty thousand strong .
acres deep they <name> march .
now , observe : none but they <name> ever strike the <unk> !
then there <name> be an episode !
immediately after , the civilian multitude in the rear <name> retire , to meet business engagements elsewhere .
none but nobles and gentry are knights , and none but these <name> remain to dance to our music after that episode .
it is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights .
now speak , and it shall be as you decide .
shall we avoid the battle , retire from the field ? "
" no ! ! ! "
the shout was unanimous and hearty .
" are you  are you  well , afraid of these thirty thousand knights ? "
that joke brought out a good laugh , the boys ' troubles vanished away , and they went gaily to their posts .
ah , they were a darling fifty-two !
as pretty as girls , too .
i was ready for the enemy now .
let the approaching big day come along  it would find us on deck .
the big day arrived on time .
at <name> the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon , and a faint sound which he thought to be military music .
breakfast was just ready ; we sat down and ate it .
this over , i made the boys a little speech , and then sent out a detail to man the battery , with <name> in command of it .
the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land , and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us , with the steady drift and <unk> front of a wave of the sea .
nearer and nearer it came , and more and more <unk> imposing became its aspect ; yes , all england was there , apparently .
soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering , and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all <unk> .
yes , it was a fine sight ; i had n't ever seen anything to beat it .
at last we could make out details .
all the front ranks , no telling how many acres deep , were horsemen  plumed knights in armor .
suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets ; the slow walk burst into a gallop , and then  well , it was wonderful to see !
down swept that vast horse-shoe wave  it approached the <unk>  my breath stood still ; nearer , nearer  the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow  narrower still  became a mere ribbon in front of the horses  then disappeared under their hoofs .
great <name> !
why , the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a <unk> , and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments ; and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight .
time for the second step in the plan of campaign !
i touched a button , and shook the bones of england loose from her spine !
in that explosion all our <name> <unk> went up in the air and disappeared from the earth .
it was a pity , but it was necessary .
we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us .
now ensued one of the dullest <unk> i had ever endured .
we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire , and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these .
we couldn't see over the wall of smoke , and we could n't see through it .
but at last it began to shred away lazily , and by the end of another <unk> the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself .
no living creature was in sight !
we now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses .
the dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide , all around us , and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both borders of it .
as to destruction of life , it was amazing .
moreover , it was beyond estimate .
of course , we could not count the dead , because they did not exist as individuals , but merely as homogeneous protoplasm , with <unk> of iron and buttons .
no life was in sight , but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks , who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke ; there would be sickness among the others  there always is , after an episode like that .
but there would be no reinforcements ; this was the last stand of the chivalry of england ; it was all that was left of the order , after the recent <unk> wars .
so i felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small ; that is , of knights .
i therefore issued a <unk> proclamation to my army in these words : soldiers , champions of human <name> and equality : your general <unk> you !
in the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown , an arrogant enemy came against you .
you were ready .
the conflict was brief ; on your side , glorious .
this mighty victory , having been achieved utterly without loss , stands without example in history .
so long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits , the battle of the <unk> <name> not perish out of the memories of men .
the boss .
i read it well , and the applause i got was very gratifying to me .
i then wound up with these remarks : " the war with the english nation , as a nation , is at an end .
the nation has retired from the field and the war .
before it can be persuaded to return , war <name> have ceased .
this campaign is the only one that is going to be fought .
it <name> be brief  the briefest in history .
also the most destructive to life , considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to <name> engaged .
we are done with the nation ; henceforth we deal only with the knights .
english knights can be killed , but they can not be conquered .
we know what is before us .
while one of these men remains alive , our task is not finished , the war is not ended .
we <name> kill them all . "
[ loud and long continued applause . ]
i <unk> the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion  merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again .
next , i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south , to turn a mountain <name> that was there , and bring it within our lines and under our command , arranging it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency .
the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each , and were to relieve each other every two hours .
in ten hours the work was accomplished .
it was nightfall now , and i withdrew my pickets .
the one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight , but visible with the glass only .
he also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us , and had driven some cattle across our lines , but that the knights themselves had not come very near .
that was what i had been expecting .
they were feeling us , you see ; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again .
they would grow bolder in the night , perhaps .
i believed i knew what project they would attempt , because it was plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places and as ignorant as they were .
i mentioned it to <name> .
" i think you are right , " said he ; " it is the obvious thing for them to try . "
" well , then , " i said , " if they do it they are doomed . "
" certainly . "
" they wo n't have the slightest show in the world . "
" of course they wo n't . "
" it 's dreadful , <name> .
it seems an awful pity . "
the thing disturbed me so that i could n't get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it .
so , at last , to quiet my conscience , i framed this message to the knights : to the honorable the commander of the <unk> chivalry of england : you fight in vain .
we know your strength  if one may call it by that name .
we know that at the utmost you can not bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights .
therefore , you have no chance  none whatever .
reflect : we are well equipped , well fortified , we number 54 .
fifty-four what ?
men ?
no , minds  the <unk> in the world ; a force against which mere animal might may no more <name> to prevail than may the idle waves of the sea <name> to prevail against the granite barriers of england .
be advised .
we offer you your lives ; for the sake of your families , do not reject the gift .
we offer you this chance , and it is the last : throw down your arms ; surrender unconditionally to the republic , and all <name> be forgiven .
( signed ) the boss .
i read it to <name> , and said i proposed to send it by a flag of truce .
he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with , and said : " somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are .
now let us save a little time and trouble .
consider me the commander of the knights yonder .
now , then , you are the flag of truce ; approach and deliver me your message , and i <name> give you your answer . "
i <unk> the idea .
i came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemy 's soldiers , produced my paper , and read it through .
for answer , <name> struck the paper out of my hand , pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain : " <unk> me this animal , and return him in a basket to the <unk> knave who sent him ; other answer have i none ! "
how empty is theory in presence of fact !
and this was just fact , and nothing else .
it was the thing that would have happened , there was no getting around that .
i tore up the paper and granted my <unk> <unk> a permanent rest .
then , to business .
i tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave , and made sure that they were all right ; i tested and <unk> those which commanded the fences  these were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at <name> .
i placed the <unk> under the guard and authority of three of my best boys , who would alternate in <unk> watches all night and promptly obey my signal , if i should have occasion to give it  three <unk> in quick succession .
<unk> was discarded for the night , and the corral left empty of life ; i ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave , and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer .
as soon as it was good and dark , i shut off the current from all the fences , and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch .
i crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch .
but it was too dark to see anything .
as for sounds , there were none .
the stillness was <unk> .
true , there were the usual <unk> of the country  the whir of <unk> , the buzzing of insects , the barking of distant dogs , the mellow lowing of far-off kine  but these did n't seem to break the stillness , they only intensified it , and added a <unk> melancholy to it into the bargain .
i presently gave up looking , the night shut down so black , but i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound , for i judged i had only to wait , and i should n't be disappointed .
however , i had to wait a long time .
at last i caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound .
i pricked up my ears , then , and held my breath , for this was the sort of thing i had been waiting for .
this sound thickened , and approached  from toward the north .
presently , i heard it at my own level  the <unk> of the opposite embankment , a hundred feet or more away .
then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridge  human heads ?
i could n't tell ; it might n't be anything at all ; you ca n't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus .
however , the question was soon settled .
i heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch .
it augmented fast , it spread all along , and it unmistakably furnished me this fact : an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch .
yes , these people were arranging a little surprise party for us .
we could expect entertainment about <name> , possibly earlier .
i groped my way back to the corral now ; i had seen enough .
i went to the platform and <unk> to turn the current on to the two inner fences .
then i went into the cave , and found everything satisfactory there  nobody awake but the <unk> .
i woke <name> and told him the great ditch was filling up with men , and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body .
it was my notion that as soon as <name> approached we could expect the ditch 's <unk> thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault , and be followed immediately by the rest of their army .
<name> said : " they <name> be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations .
why not take the lightning off the outer fences , and give them a chance ? "
" i 've already done it , <name> .
did you ever know me to be inhospitable ? "
" no , you are a good heart .
i want to go and  " " be a reception committee ?
i <name> go , too . "
we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences .
even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat , but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances .
we had had to feel our way before , but we could make out to see the fence posts now .
we started a whispered conversation , but suddenly <name> broke off and said : " what is that ? "
" what is what ? "
" that thing yonder . "
" what thing  where ? "
" there beyond you a little piece  dark something  a dull shape of some kind  against the second fence . "
i gazed and he gazed .
i said : " could it be a man , <name> ? "
" no , i think not .
if you notice , it looks a lit  why , it is a man !  leaning on the fence . "
" i certainly believe it is ; let us go and see . "
we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close , and then looked up .
yes , it was a man  a dim great figure in armor , standing erect , with both hands on the upper wire  and , of course , there was a smell of burning flesh .
poor fellow , dead as a <unk> , and never knew what hurt him .
he stood there like a statue  no motion about him , except that his plumes <unk> about a little in the night wind .
we rose up and looked in through the bars of his <unk> , but could n't make out whether we knew him or not  features too dim and shadowed .
we heard muffled sounds approaching , and we sank down to the ground where we were .
we made out another knight vaguely ; he was coming very stealthily , and feeling his way .
he was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand , find an upper wire , then bend and step under it and over the lower one .
now he arrived at the first knight  and started slightly when he discovered him .
he stood a moment  no doubt wondering why the other one did n't move on ; then he said , in a low voice , " why <unk> thou here , good sir mar  " then he laid his hand on the corpse 's shoulder  and just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead .
killed by a dead man , you see  killed by a dead friend , in fact .
there was something awful about it .
these early birds came scattering along after each other , about one every five minutes in our vicinity , during half an hour .
they brought no armor of offense but their swords ; as a rule , they carried the sword ready in the hand , and put it forward and found the wires with it .
we would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us ; but we knew what had happened , all the same ; poor fellow , he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been <unk> .
we had brief intervals of grim stillness , interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an <unk> ; and this sort of thing was going on , right along , and was very creepy there in the dark and <unk> .
we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences .
we elected to walk upright , for convenience 's sake ; we argued that if discerned , we should be taken for friends rather than enemies , and in any case we should be out of reach of swords , and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along .
well , it was a curious trip .
everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fence  not plainly visible , but still visible ; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues  dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire .
one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated : our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out .
pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound , and next moment we guessed what it was .
it was a surprise in force coming !
i whispered <name> to go and wake the army , and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders .
he was soon back , and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host .
one could make out but little of detail ; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence .
that swelling bulk was dead men !
our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead  a bulwark , a <unk> , of corpses , you may say .
one terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices ; there were no cheers , no war cries ; being intent upon a surprise , these men moved as noiselessly as they could ; and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready , of course they struck the fatal line and went down without <unk> .
i sent a current through the third fence now ; and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth , so quickly were the gaps filled up .
i believed the time was come now for my climax ; i believed that that whole army was in our trap .
anyway , it was high time to find out .
so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice .
land , what a sight !
we were enclosed in three walls of dead men !
all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living , who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires .
the sudden glare paralyzed this host , petrified them , you may say , with astonishment ; there was just one instant for me to <unk> their <unk> in , and i did n't lose the chance .
you see , in another instant they would have recovered their faculties , then they 'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush , and my wires would have gone down before it ; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever ; while even that slight fragment of time was still <unk> , i shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks !
there was a groan you could hear !
it voiced the <unk> of eleven thousand men .
it swelled out on the night with awful pathos .
a glance showed that the rest of the enemy  perhaps ten thousand strong  were between us and the encircling ditch , and pressing forward to the assault .
consequently we had them all !  and had them past help .
time for the last act of the tragedy .
i fired the three appointed revolver shots  which meant : " turn on the water ! "
there was a sudden rush and roar , and in a minute the mountain <name> was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep .
" stand to your guns , men !
open fire ! "
the thirteen <unk> began to <unk> death into the fated ten thousand .
they halted , they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire , then they broke , faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a <name> .
a full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment ; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over  to death by drowning .
within ten short minutes after we had opened fire , armed resistance was totally annihilated , the campaign was ended , we fifty-four were masters of england .
twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us .
but how treacherous is fortune !
in a little while  say an hour  happened a thing , by my own fault , which  but i have no heart to write that .
let the record end here .
chapter <unk> a postscript by <name> i , <name> , must write it for him .
he proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded .
i was strenuous against the project .
i said that if there were many , we could do but little for them ; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them , anyway .
but he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed ; so we shut off the electric current from the fences , took an escort along , climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights , and moved out upon the field .
the first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade .
when the boss bent over him and spoke to him , the man recognized him and stabbed him .
that knight was sir <unk> , as i found out by tearing off his helmet .
he <name> not ask for help any more .
we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound , which was not very serious , the best care we could .
in this service we had the help of <name> , though we did not know it .
he was disguised as a woman , and appeared to be a simple old peasant <unk> .
in this disguise , with <unk> face and smooth shaven , he had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook for us , saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming , and that she was starving .
the boss had been getting along very well , and had amused himself with finishing up his record .
we were glad to have this woman , for we were short handed .
we were in a trap , you see  a trap of our own making .
if we stayed where we were , our dead would kill us ; if we moved out of our defenses , we should no longer be invincible .
we had conquered ; in turn we were conquered .
the boss recognized this ; we all recognized it .
if we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy  yes , but the boss could not go , and neither could i , for i was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands .
others were taken down , and still others .
to-morrow  <unk> it is here .
and with it the end .
about midnight i awoke , and saw that <unk> making curious passes in the air about the boss 's head and face , and wondered what it meant .
everybody but the <unk> lay steeped in sleep ; there was no sound .
the woman ceased from her mysterious <unk> , and started <unk> toward the door .
i called out : " stop !
what have you been doing ? "
she halted , and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction : " ye were conquerors ; ye are conquered !
these others are perishing  you also .
ye shall all die in this place  every one  except him .
he <unk> now  and shall sleep thirteen centuries .
i am <name> ! "
then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man , and presently fetched up against one of our wires .
his mouth is spread open yet ; apparently he is still laughing .
i suppose the face <name> retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust .
the boss has never stirred  sleeps like a stone .
if he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is , and his body <name> then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none <name> ever find it to <unk> it .
as for the rest of us  well , it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place , he <name> write the fact here , and loyally hide this manuscript with the boss , our dear good chief , whose property it is , be he alive or dead .
the end of the manuscript final p.s .
by m.t .
the <name> was come when i laid the manuscript aside .
the rain had almost ceased , the world was gray and sad , the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest .
i went to the <unk> room , and listened at his door , which was slightly ajar .
i could hear his voice , and so i knocked .
there was no answer , but i still heard the voice .
i peeped in .
the man lay on his back in bed , talking brokenly but with spirit , and <unk> with his arms , which he thrashed about , restlessly , as sick people do in delirium .
i slipped in softly and bent over him .
his mutterings and ejaculations went on .
i spoke  merely a word , to call his attention .
his glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure , gratitude , gladness , welcome : " oh , <name> , you are come at last  how i have longed for you !
sit by me  do not leave me  never leave me again , <name> , never again .
where is your hand ?  give it me , dear , let me hold it  there  now all is well , all is peace , and i am happy again  we are happy again , is n't it so , <name> ?
you are so dim , so vague , you are but a mist , a cloud , but you are here , and that is <unk> sufficient ; and i have your hand ; do n't take it away  it is for only a little while , i shall not require it long ... . was that the child ? ...
<unk> ! ...
she does n't answer .
asleep , perhaps ?
bring her when she wakes , and let me touch her hands , her face , her hair , and tell her good-bye ... . <name> !
yes , you are there .
i lost myself a moment , and i thought you were gone ... . have i been sick long ?
it must be so ; it seems months to me .
and such dreams !
such strange and awful dreams , <name> !
dreams that were as real as reality  delirium , of course , but so real !
why , i thought the king was dead , i thought you were in gaul and could n't get home , i thought there was a revolution ; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams , i thought that <name> and i and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england !
but even that was not the strangest .
i seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age , centuries hence , and even that was as real as the rest !
yes , i seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours , and then forward to it again , and was set down , a stranger and forlorn in that strange england , with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you !
between me and my home and my friends !
between me and all that is dear to me , all that could make life worth the living !
it was awful  <unk> than you can ever imagine , <name> .
ah , watch by me , <name>  stay by me every moment  don't let me go out of my mind again ; death is nothing , let it come , but not with those dreams , not with the torture of those hideous dreams  i can not endure that again ... .
<name> ? ... "
he lay muttering <unk> some little time ; then for a time he lay silent , and apparently sinking away toward death .
presently his fingers began to pick busily at the <unk> , and by that sign i knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the <unk> in his throat he started up slightly , and seemed to listen : then he said : " a bugle ? ...
it is the king !
the drawbridge , there !
man the battlements !  turn out the  " he was getting up his last " effect " ; but he never finished it .
a dog 's tale by <name> twain chapter i my father was a st. <name> , my mother was a collie , but i am a presbyterian .
this is what my mother told me , i do not know these nice distinctions myself .
to me they are only fine large words meaning nothing .
my mother had a fondness for such ; she liked to say them , and see other dogs look surprised and envious , as wondering how she got so much education .
but , indeed , it was not real education ; it was only show : she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company , and by going with the children to sunday-school and listening there ; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times , and so was able to keep it until there was a <unk> gathering in the neighborhood , then she would get it off , and surprise and distress them all , from <unk> to mastiff , which rewarded her for all her trouble .
if there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious , and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant .
and she always told him .
he was never expecting this but thought he would catch her ; so when she told him , he was the one that looked ashamed , whereas he had thought it was going to be she .
the others were always waiting for this , and glad of it and proud of her , for they knew what was going to happen , because they had had experience .
when she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one ; and that was natural , because , for one thing , she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking , and for another thing , where could they find out whether it was right or not ?
for she was the only cultivated dog there was .
by and by , when i was older , she brought home the word <unk> , one time , and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings , making much unhappiness and despondency ; and it was at this time that i noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages , and flashed out a fresh definition every time , which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture , though i said nothing , of course .
she had one word which she always kept on hand , and ready , like a life-preserver , a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way  that was the word synonymous .
when she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her <unk> , if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him <unk> for a couple of minutes , then he would come to , and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack , and not expecting anything ; so when he 'd hail and ask her to cash in , i ( the only dog on the inside of her game ) could see her canvas flicker a moment  but only just a moment  then it would belly out taut and full , and she would say , as calm as a summer 's day , " it 's synonymous with <unk> , " or some godless long reptile of a word like that , and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack , perfectly comfortable , you know , and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed , and the initiated <unk> the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy <name> .
and it was the same with phrases .
she would drag home a whole phrase , if it had a grand sound , and play it six nights and two <unk> , and explain it a new way every time  which she had to , for all she cared for was the phrase ; she was n't interested in what it meant , and knew those dogs had n't wit enough to catch her , anyway .
yes , she was a <name> !
she got so she was n't afraid of anything , she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures .
she even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the <unk> laugh and shout over ; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut , where , of course , it did n't fit and had n't any point ; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way , while i could see that she was wondering to herself why it did n't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it .
but no harm was done ; the others rolled and barked too , privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point , and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there was n't any to see .
you can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character ; still , she had virtues , and enough to make up , i think .
she had a kind heart and gentle ways , and never <unk> <unk> for injuries done her , but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them ; and she taught her children her kindly way , and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger , and not to run away , but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger , and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us .
and she taught us not by words only , but by example , and that is the best way and the surest and the most lasting .
why , the brave things she did , the splendid things !
she was just a soldier ; and so modest about it  well , you could n't help admiring her , and you could n't help imitating her ; not even a king <name> spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her society .
so , as you see , there was more to her than her education .
chapter ii when i was well grown , at last , i was sold and taken away , and i never saw her again .
she was broken-hearted , and so was i , and we cried ; but she comforted me as well as she could , and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpose , and must do our duties without <unk> , take our life as we might find it , live it for the best good of others , and never mind about the results ; they were not our affair .
she said men who did like this would have a <name> and beautiful reward by and by in another world , and although we animals would not go there , to do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives a <unk> and dignity which in itself would be a reward .
she had gathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the sunday-school with the children , and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had done with those other words and phrases ; and she had studied them deeply , for her good and ours .
one may see by this that she had a wise and thoughtful head , for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it .
so we said our farewells , and looked our last upon each other through our tears ; and the last thing she said  keeping it for the last to make me remember it the better , i think  was , " in memory of me , when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself , think of your mother , and do as she would do . "
do you think i could forget that ?
no .
chapter iii it was such a charming home !  my new one ; a fine great house , with pictures , and delicate decorations , and <name> furniture , and no gloom anywhere , but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding <name> ; and the spacious grounds around it , and the great garden  oh , <unk> , and <name> trees , and flowers , no end !
and i was the same as a member of the family ; and they loved me , and petted me , and did not give me a new name , but called me by my old one that was dear to me because my mother had given it me  <name> <unk> .
she got it out of a song ; and the grays knew that song , and said it was a beautiful name .
mrs. gray was thirty , and so sweet and so lovely , you can not imagine it ; and <name> was ten , and just like her mother , just a darling slender little copy of her , with <unk> tails down her back , and short frocks ; and the baby was a year old , and plump and dimpled , and fond of me , and never could get enough of hauling on my tail , and hugging me , and laughing out its innocent happiness ; and mr. gray was thirty-eight , and tall and slender and handsome , a little bald in front , alert , quick in his movements , business-like , prompt , decided , <unk> , and with that kind of <unk> face that just seems to glint and <name> with frosty <unk> !
he was a renowned scientist .
i do not know what the word means , but my mother would know how to use it and get effects .
she would know how to depress a <unk> with it and make a <unk> look sorry he came .
but that is not the best one ; the best one was laboratory .
my mother could organize a trust on that one that would skin the <unk> off the whole herd .
the laboratory was not a book , or a picture , or a place to wash your hands in , as the college president 's dog said  no , that is the lavatory ; the laboratory is quite different , and is filled with jars , and bottles , and electrics , and wires , and strange machines ; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place , and used the machines , and discussed , and made what they called experiments and discoveries ; and often i came , too , and stood around and listened , and tried to learn , for the sake of my mother , and in loving memory of her , although it was a pain to me , as realizing what she was losing out of her life and i gaining nothing at all ; for try as i might , i was never able to make anything out of it at all .
other times i lay on the floor in the mistress 's <unk> and slept , she gently using me for a <unk> , knowing it pleased me , for it was a caress ; other times i spent an hour in the nursery , and got well <unk> and made happy ; other times i watched by the crib there , when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby 's affairs ; other times i romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with <name> till we were tired out , then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book ; other times i went visiting among the neighbor dogs  for there were some most pleasant ones not far away , and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one , a <unk> <name> setter by the name of <name> <unk> , who was a presbyterian like me , and belonged to the scotch minister .
the servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me , and so , as you see , mine was a pleasant life .
there could not be a happier dog that i was , nor a <unk> one .
i <name> say this for myself , for it is only the truth : i tried in all ways to do well and right , and honor my mother 's memory and her teachings , and earn the happiness that had come to me , as best i could .
by and by came my little puppy , and then my cup was full , my happiness was perfect .
it was the dearest little <unk> thing , and so smooth and soft and velvety , and had such cunning little awkward paws , and such affectionate eyes , and such a sweet and innocent face ; and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother adored it , and fondled it , and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did .
it did seem to me that life was just too lovely to  then came the <name> .
one day i was standing a watch in the nursery .
that is to say , i was asleep on the bed .
the baby was asleep in the crib , which was alongside the bed , on the side next the fireplace .
it was the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of <unk> stuff that you can see through .
the nurse was out , and we two sleepers were alone .
a spark from the <unk> was shot out , and it lit on the slope of the tent .
i suppose a quiet interval followed , then a scream from the baby awoke me , and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling !
before i could think , i sprang to the floor in my fright , and in a second was half-way to the door ; but in the next <unk> my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears , and i was back on the bed again .
i reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the <unk> , and tugged it along , and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke ; i snatched a new hold , and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall , and was still tugging away , all excited and happy and proud , when the master 's voice shouted : " begone you cursed beast ! "
and i jumped to save myself ; but he was furiously quick , and chased me up , striking furiously at me with his cane , i dodging this way and that , in terror , and at last a strong blow fell upon my left <unk> , which made me shriek and fall , for the moment , helpless ; the cane went up for another blow , but never descended , for the nurse 's voice rang wildly out , " the nursery 's on fire ! "
and the master rushed away in that direction , and my other bones were saved .
the pain was cruel , but , no matter , i must not lose any time ; he might come back at any moment ; so i limped on three legs to the other end of the hall , where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a <name> where old boxes and such things were kept , as i had heard say , and where people seldom went .
i managed to climb up there , then i searched my way through the dark among the piles of things , and hid in the <unk> place i could find .
it was foolish to be afraid there , yet still i was ; so afraid that i held in and hardly even whimpered , though it would have been such a comfort to whimper , because that <unk> the pain , you know .
but i could lick my leg , and that did some good .
for half an hour there was a commotion downstairs , and shoutings , and rushing footsteps , and then there was quiet again .
quiet for some minutes , and that was grateful to my spirit , for then my fears began to go down ; and fears are worse than pains  oh , much worse .
then came a sound that froze me .
they were calling me  calling me by name  hunting for me !
it was muffled by distance , but that could not take the terror out of it , and it was the most dreadful sound to me that i had ever heard .
it went all about , everywhere , down there : along the halls , through all the rooms , in both stories , and in the basement and the cellar ; then outside , and farther and farther away  then back , and all about the house again , and i thought it would never , never stop .
but at last it did , hours and hours after the vague twilight of the <name> had long ago been blotted out by black darkness .
then in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away , and i was at peace and slept .
it was a good rest i had , but i woke before the twilight had come again .
i was feeling fairly comfortable , and i could think out a plan now .
i made a very good one ; which was , to creep down , all the way down the back stairs , and hide behind the cellar door , and slip out and escape when the <unk> came at <name> , while he was inside filling the refrigerator ; then i would hide all day , and start on my journey when night came ; my journey to  well , anywhere where they would not know me and betray me to the master .
i was feeling almost cheerful now ; then suddenly i thought : why , what would life be without my puppy !
that was despair .
there was no plan for me ; i saw that ; i must stay where i was ; stay , and wait , and take what might come  it was not my affair ; that was what life is  my mother had said it .
then  well , then the calling began again !
all my sorrows came back .
i said to myself , the master <name> never forgive .
i did not know what i had done to make him so bitter and so <unk> , yet i judged it was something a dog could not understand , but which was clear to a man and dreadful .
they called and called  days and nights , it seemed to me .
so long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad , and i recognized that i was getting very weak .
when you are this way you sleep a great deal , and i did .
once i woke in an awful fright  it seemed to me that the calling was right there in the <name> !
and so it was : it was <name> 's voice , and she was crying ; my name was falling from her lips all broken , poor thing , and i could not believe my ears for the <name> of it when i heard her say : " come back to us  oh , come back to us , and forgive  it is all so sad without our  " i broke in with such a grateful little yelp , and the next moment <name> was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and shouting for the family to hear , " she 's found , she 's found ! "
the days that followed  well , they were wonderful .
the mother and <name> and the servants  why , they just seemed to worship me .
they couldn't seem to make me a bed that was fine enough ; and as for food , they could n't be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out of season ; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear about my heroism  that was the name they called it by , and it means agriculture .
i remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once , and explaining it in that way , but did n't say what agriculture was , except that it was synonymous with <unk> <unk> ; and a dozen times a day mrs. gray and <name> would tell the tale to <unk> , and say i risked my life to say the baby 's , and both of us had burns to prove it , and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me , and you could see the pride in the eyes of <name> and her mother ; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp , they looked ashamed and changed the subject , and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it , it looked to me as if they were going to cry .
and this was not all the <name> ; no , the master 's friends came , a whole twenty of the most distinguished people , and had me in the laboratory , and discussed me as if i was a kind of discovery ; and some of them said it was wonderful in a dumb beast , the finest exhibition of instinct they could call to mind ; but the master said , with vehemence , " it 's far above instinct ; it 's reason , and many a man , privileged to be saved and go with you and me to a better world by right of its possession , has less of it that this poor silly quadruped that 's <unk> to perish ; " and then he laughed , and said : " why , look at me  i 'm a sarcasm !
bless you , with all my grand intelligence , the only thing i inferred was that the dog had gone mad and was destroying the child , whereas but for the <unk> intelligence  it 's reason , i tell you !  the child would have perished ! "
they disputed and disputed , and i was the very center of subject of it all , and i wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me ; it would have made her proud .
then they discussed optics , as they called it , and whether a certain injury to the <name> would produce blindness or not , but they could not agree about it , and said they must test it by experiment by and by ; and next they discussed plants , and that interested me , because in the summer <name> and i had planted seeds  i helped her dig the holes , you know  and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there , and it was a wonder how that could happen ; but it did , and i wished i could talk  i would have told those people about it and shown then how much i knew , and been all alive with the subject ; but i did n't care for the optics ; it was dull , and when they came back to it again it bored me , and i went to sleep .
pretty soon it was spring , and <name> and pleasant and lovely , and the sweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by , and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin , and the master was n't any company for us , but we played together and had good times , and the servants were kind and friendly , so we got along quite happily and counted the days and waited for the family .
and one day those men came again , and said , now for the test , and they took the puppy to the laboratory , and i limped <unk> along , too , feeling proud , for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure to me , of course .
they discussed and experimented , and then suddenly the puppy shrieked , and they set him on the floor , and he went staggering around , with his head all bloody , and the master clapped his hands and shouted : " there , i 've won  confess it !
he 's as blind as a bat ! "
and they all said : " it 's so  you 've proved your theory , and suffering humanity owes you a great debt from henceforth , " and they crowded around him , and wrung his hand cordially and <unk> , and praised him .
but i hardly saw or heard these things , for i ran at once to my little darling , and snuggled close to it where it lay , and licked the blood , and it put its head against mine , whimpering softly , and i knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother's touch , though it could not see me .
then it dropped down , presently , and its little <name> nose rested upon the floor , and it was still , and did not move any more .
soon the master stopped discussing a moment , and rang in the footman , and said , " bury it in the far corner of the garden , " and then went on with the discussion , and i trotted after the footman , very happy and grateful , for i knew the puppy was out of its pain now , because it was asleep .
we went far down the garden to the farthest end , where the children and the nurse and the puppy and i used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm , and there the footman dug a hole , and i saw he was going to plant the puppy , and i was glad , because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog , like <name> <unk> , and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home ; so i tried to help him dig , but my lame leg was no good , being stiff , you know , and you have to have two , or it is no use .
when the footman had finished and covered little <name> up , he patted my head , and there were tears in his eyes , and he said : " poor little doggie , you saved his child ! "
i have watched two whole weeks , and he does n't come up !
this last week a fright has been stealing upon me .
i think there is something terrible about this .
i do not know what it is , but the fear makes me sick , and i can not eat , though the servants bring me the best of food ; and they pet me so , and even come in the night , and cry , and say , " poor doggie  do give it up and come home ; do n't break our hearts ! "
and all this <unk> me the more , and makes me sure something has happened .
and i am so weak ; since yesterday i can not stand on my feet <unk> .
and within this hour the servants , looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on , said things i could not understand , but they carried something cold to my heart .
" those poor creatures !
they do not suspect .
they <name> come home in the morning , and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed , and who of us <name> be strong enough to say the truth to them : 'the humble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish . ' "
a double <unk> detective story by <name> twain part i " we ought never to do wrong when people are looking . "
i the first scene is in the country , in <name> ; the time , 1880 .
there has been a wedding , between a handsome young man of slender means and a <name> young girl  a case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage ; a marriage bitterly opposed by the girl 's widowed father .
<name> fuller , the bridegroom , is twenty-six years old , is of an old but <unk> family which had by compulsion <unk> from <unk> , and for king <name> 's purse 's profit , so everybody said  some maliciously the rest merely because they believed it .
the bride is nineteen and beautiful .
she is intense , <unk> , romantic , immeasurably proud of her cavalier blood , and passionate in her love for her young husband .
for its sake she braved her father 's displeasure , endured his reproaches , listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions , and went from his house without his blessing , proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had made its home in her heart .
the morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her .
her husband put aside her proffered caresses , and said : " sit down .
i have something to say to you .
i loved you .
that was before i asked your father to give you to me .
his refusal is not my grievance  i could have endured that .
but the things he said of me to you  that is a different matter .
there  you need n't speak ; i know quite well what they were ; i got them from authentic sources .
among other things he said that my character was written in my face ; that i was treacherous , a <unk> , a coward , and a brute without sense of pity or compassion : the <unk> <unk> , ' he called it  and <unk> badge . '
any other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog .
i wanted to do it , and was minded to do it , but a better thought came to me : to put him to shame ; to break his heart ; to kill him by inches .
how to do it ?
through my treatment of you , his idol !
i would marry you ; and then  have <name> .
you <name> see . "
from that moment onward , for three months , the young wife suffered all the humiliations , all the insults , all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of the husband could contrive , save physical injuries only .
her strong pride stood by her , and she kept the secret of her troubles .
now and then the husband said , " why do n't you go to your father and tell him ? "
then he invented new tortures , applied them , and asked again .
she always answered , " he shall never know by my mouth , " and <unk> him with his origin ; said she was the lawful slave of a <unk> of slaves , and must obey , and would  up to that point , but no further ; he could kill her if he liked , but he could not break her ; it was not in the <unk> breed to do it .
at the end of the three months he said , with a dark significance in his manner , " i have tried all things but one "  and waited for her reply .
" try that , " she said , and curled her lip in mockery .
that night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes , then said to her , " get up and dress ! "
she obeyed  as always , without a word .
he led her half a mile from the house , and proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road ; and succeeded , she screaming and struggling .
he gagged her then , struck her across the face with his cowhide , and set his bloodhounds on her .
they tore the clothes off her , and she was naked .
he called the dogs off , and said : " you <name> be found  by the passing public .
they <name> be dropping along about three hours from now , and <name> spread the news  do you hear ?
good-by .
you have seen the last of me . "
he went away then .
she moaned to herself : " i shall bear a child  to him !
god <name> it may be a boy ! "
the farmers released her by-and-by  and spread the news , which was natural .
they raised the country with <unk> intentions , but the bird had flown .
the young wife shut herself up in her father 's house ; he shut himself up with her , and thenceforth would see no one .
his pride was broken , and his heart ; so he wasted away , day by day , and even his daughter rejoiced when death relieved him .
then she sold the estate and disappeared .
ii in 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded new england village , with no company but a little boy about five years old .
she did her own work , she discouraged <unk> , and had none .
the butcher , the baker , and the others that served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was stillman , and that she called the child archy .
whence she came they had not been able to find out , but they said she talked like a southerner .
the child had no playmates and no comrade , and no teacher but the mother .
she taught him diligently and intelligently , and was satisfied with the results  even a little proud of them .
one day archy said , " mamma , am i different from other children ? "
" well , i suppose not .
why ? "
" there was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and i said yes , and she said how long since i saw him and i said i had n't seen him at all , and she said how did i know he 'd been by , then , and i said because i smelt his track on the sidewalk , and she said i was a dum fool and made a mouth at me .
what did she do that for ? "
the young woman turned white , and said to herself , " it 's a <unk> !
the gift of the bloodhound is in him . "
she snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately , saying , " god has appointed the way ! "
her eyes were burning with a fierce light , and her breath came short and quick with excitement .
she said to herself : " the puzzle is solved now ; many a time it has been a mystery to me , the impossible things the child has done in the dark , but it is all clear to me now . "
she set him in his small chair , and said , " wait a little till i come , dear ; then we <name> talk about the matter . "
she went up to her room and took from her <unk> several small articles and put them out of sight : a <unk> on the floor under the bed ; a pair of <unk> under the bureau ; a small <name> <unk> under the wardrobe .
then she returned , and said , " there !
i have left some things which i ought to have brought down . "
she named them , and said , " run up and bring them , dear . "
the child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things .
" did you have any difficulty , dear ? "
" no , mamma ; i only went where you went . "
during his absence she had stepped to the bookcase , taken several books from the bottom shelf , opened each , passed her hand over a <name> , noting its number in her memory , then restored them to their places .
now she said : " i have been doing something while you have been gone , archy .
do you think you can find out what it was ? "
the boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched , and opened them at the pages which had been stroked .
the mother took him in her lap , and said , " i <name> answer your question now , dear .
i have found out that in one way you are quite different from other people .
you can see in the dark , you can smell what other people can not , you have the talents of a bloodhound .
they are good and valuable things to have , but you must keep the matter a secret .
if people found it out , they would speak of you as an odd child , a strange child , and children would be disagreeable to you , and give you nicknames .
in this world one must be like everybody else if he does n't want to provoke scorn or envy or jealousy .
it is a great and fine distinction which has been born to you , and i am glad ; but you <name> keep it a secret , for mamma 's sake , wo n't you ? "
the child promised , without understanding .
all the rest of the day the mother 's <name> was busy with excited thinkings ; with plans , projects , schemes , each and all of them uncanny , grim , and dark .
yet they lit up her face ; lit it with a fell light of their own ; lit it with vague fires of hell .
she was in a fever of unrest ; she could not sit , stand , read , sew ; there was no relief for her but in movement .
she tested her boy 's gift in twenty ways , and kept saying to herself all the time , with her mind in the past : " he broke my father 's heart , and night and day all these years i have tried , and all in vain , to think out a way to break his .
i have found it now  i have found it now . "
when night fell , the demon of unrest still possessed her .
she went on with her tests ; with a candle she traversed the house from <name> to cellar , hiding pins , needles , <unk> , <unk> , under pillows , under carpets , in cracks in the walls , under the coal in the bin ; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them ; which he did , and was happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses .
from this time forward life took on a new complexion for her .
she said , " the future is secure  i can wait , and enjoy the waiting . "
the most of her lost interests revived .
she took up music again , and languages , drawing , painting , and the other <unk> delights of her <unk> .
she was happy once more , and felt again the zest of life .
as the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy , and was contented with it .
not altogether , but nearly that .
the soft side of his heart was larger than the other side of it .
it was his only defect , in her eyes .
but she considered that his love for her and worship of her made up for it .
he was a good <unk>  that was well ; but it was a question if the materials of his <unk> were of as tough and enduring a quality as those of his friendships  and that was not so well .
the years drifted on .
archy was become a handsome , shapely , athletic youth , courteous , dignified , companionable , pleasant in his ways , and looking perhaps a trifle older than he was , which was sixteen .
one evening his mother said she had something of grave importance to say to him , adding that he was old enough to hear it now , and old enough and possessed of character enough and stability enough to <name> out a stern plan which she had been for years contriving and maturing .
then she told him her bitter story , in all its naked <unk> .
for a while the boy was paralyzed ; then he said , " i understand .
we are <unk> ; and by our custom and nature there is but one atonement .
i <name> search him out and kill him . "
" kill him ?
no !
death is release , emancipation ; death is a favor .
do i owe him favors ?
you must not hurt a hair of his head . "
the boy was lost in thought awhile ; then he said , " you are all the world to me , and your <name> is my law and my pleasure .
tell me what to do and i <name> do it . "
the mother 's eyes beamed with satisfaction , and she said , " you <name> go and find him .
i have known his hiding-place for eleven years ; it cost me five years and more of inquiry , and much money , to locate it .
he is a <unk> in colorado , and well-to-do .
he lives in <name> .
his name is <name> fuller .
there  it is the first time i have spoken it since that <unk> night .
think !
that name could have been yours if i had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one .
you <name> drive him from that place ; you <name> hunt him down and drive him again ; and yet again , and again , and again , persistently , <unk> , poisoning his life , filling it with mysterious terrors , loading it with weariness and misery , making him wish for death , and that he had a suicide 's courage ; you <name> make of him another wandering jew ; he shall know no rest any more , no peace of mind , no placid sleep ; you shall shadow him , cling to him , persecute him , till you break his heart , as he broke my father 's and mine . "
" i <name> obey , mother . "
" i believe it , my child .
the preparations are all made ; everything is ready .
here is a letter of credit ; spend freely , there is no lack of money .
at times you may need disguises .
i have provided them ; also some other conveniences . "
she took from the drawer of the <unk> several squares of paper .
they all bore these <unk> words : $ 10,000 reward it is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an eastern state is <unk> here .
in 1880 , in the night , he tied his young wife to a tree by the public road , cut her across the face with a cowhide , and made his dogs tear her clothes from her , leaving her naked .
he left her there , and fled the country .
a <unk> of hers has searched for him for seventeen years .
address ... ... ... , ... ... ... . , post-office .
the above reward <name> be paid in cash to the person who <name> furnish the seeker , in a personal interview , the criminal 's address .
" when you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent , you <name> go in the night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies , and another one upon the post-office or in some other prominent place .
it <name> be the talk of the region .
at first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at something approaching their value .
we <name> ruin him by-and-by , but gradually ; we must not <unk> him at once , for that could bring him to despair and injure his health , possibly kill him . "
she took three or four more typewritten forms from the drawer  duplicates  and read one : ... ... ... . , ... ... ... . , 18 ... to <name> fuller : you have ... ... days in which to settle your affairs .
you <name> not be disturbed during that limit , which <name> expire at .
... .. m. , on the ... ... of ... ... . you must then move on .
if you are still in the place after the named hour , i <name> placard you on all the dead walls , <unk> your crime once more , and adding the date , also the scene of it , with all names concerned , including your own .
have no fear of bodily injury  it <name> in no circumstances ever be inflicted upon you .
you brought misery upon an old man , and ruined his life and broke his heart .
what he suffered , you are to suffer .
" you <name> add no signature .
he must receive this before he learns of the <unk>  before he rises in the morning  lest he lose his head and fly the place penniless . "
" i shall not forget . "
" you <name> need to use these forms only in the beginning  once may be enough .
afterward , when you are ready for him to vanish out of a place , see that he gets a copy of this form , which merely says , move on .
you have ... ... days .
" he <name> obey .
that is sure . "
iii extracts from letters to the mother : <name> , <name> 3 , 1897 i have now been living several days in the same hotel with <name> fuller .
i have his scent ; i could track him through ten divisions of infantry and find him .
i have often been near him and heard him talk .
he owns a good mine , and has a fair income from it ; but he is not <name> .
he learned mining in a good way  by working at it for wages .
he is a cheerful creature , and his forty-three years sit lightly upon him ; he could pass for a younger man  say thirty-six or thirty-seven .
he has never married again  passes himself off for a widower .
he stands well , is liked , is popular , and has many friends .
even i feel a drawing toward him  the paternal blood in me making its claim .
how blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature  the most of them , in fact !
my task is become hard now  you realize it ?
you comprehend , and make allowances ?  and the fire of it has cooled , more than i like to confess to myself .
but i <name> <name> it out .
even with the pleasure paled , the duty remains , and i <name> not spare him .
and for my help , a sharp resentment rises in me when i reflect that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it .
the lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character , and in the change he is happy .
he , the guilty party , is <unk> from all suffering ; you , the innocent , are borne down with it .
but be comforted  he shall harvest his share .
silver gulch , may 19 i <unk> form no .
1 at midnight of <name> 3 ; an hour later i slipped form no .
2 under his chamber door , <unk> him to leave <name> at or before <unk> the night of the 14th .
some late bird of a reporter stole one of my <unk> , then hunted the town over and found the other one , and stole that .
in this manner he accomplished what the profession call a " scoop "  that is , he got a valuable item , and saw to it that no other paper got it .
and so his paper  the principal one in the town  had it in glaring type on the editorial <name> in the morning , followed by a <unk> opinion of our wretch a column long , which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper 's account !
the journals out here know how to do the <name> thing  when there 's business in it .
at breakfast i occupied my usual seat  selected because it afforded a view of papa fuller 's face , and was near enough for me to hear the talk that went on at his table .
seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room , and all discussing that item , and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence from the town  with a rail , or a bullet , or something .
when fuller came in he had the notice to leave  folded up  in one hand , and the newspaper in the other ; and it gave me more than half a pang to see him .
his cheerfulness was all gone , and he looked old and pinched and ashy .
and then  only think of the things he had to listen to !
mamma , he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and <unk> drawn from the very <unk> and <unk> of satan 's own authorized editions down below .
and more than that , he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them .
his applause tasted bitter in his mouth , though ; he could not disguise that from me ; and it was observable that his appetite was gone ; he only nibbled ; he could n't eat .
finally a man said , " it is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel .
i <name> so . "
ah , dear , it was pitiful the way fuller winced , and glanced around scared !
he could n't endure any more , and got up and left .
during several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in mexico , and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could , and give the property his personal attention .
he played his cards well ; said he would take $ 40,000  a quarter in cash , the rest in safe notes ; but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase , he would diminish his terms for cash in full , he sold out for $ <unk> .
and then , what do you think he did ?
he asked for greenbacks , and took them , saying the man in mexico was a <unk> , with a head full of <unk> , and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts .
people thought it queer , since a draft on new york could produce greenbacks quite conveniently .
there was talk of this odd thing , but only for a day ; that is as long as any topic lasts in <name> .
i was watching , all the time .
as soon as the sale was completed and the money paid  which was on the 11th  i began to stick to fuller 's track without dropping it for a moment .
that night  no , 12th , for it was a little past midnight  i tracked him to his room , which was four doors from mine in the same hall ; then i went back and put on my muddy <unk> disguise , darkened my complexion , and sat down in my room in the gloom , with a <unk> handy , with a change in it , and my door ajar .
for i suspected that the bird would take wing now .
in half an hour an old woman passed by , carrying a grip ; i caught the familiar whiff , and followed with my grip , for it was fuller .
he left the hotel by a side entrance , and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness , and got into a <unk> hack , which , of course , was waiting for him by appointment .
i took a seat ( <unk> ) on the trunk platform behind , and we drove briskly off .
we drove ten miles , and the hack stopped at a way station and was discharged .
fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under the awning , as far as he could get from the light ; i went inside , and watched the <unk> .
fuller bought no ticket ; i bought none .
presently the train came along , and he boarded a car ; i entered the same car at the other end , and came down the aisle and took the seat behind him .
when he paid the conductor and named his objective point , i dropped back several seats , while the conductor was changing a <name> , and when he came to me i paid to the same place  about a hundred miles westward .
from that time for a week on end he led me a dance .
he travelled here and there and yonder  always on a general westward trend  but he was not a woman after the first day .
he was a laborer , like myself , and wore bushy false whiskers .
his outfit was perfect , and he could do the character without thinking about it , for he had served the trade for wages .
his nearest friend could not have recognized him .
at last he located himself here , the <unk> little mountain camp in montana ; he has a shanty , and goes out prospecting daily ; is gone all day , and <unk> society .
i am living at a miner 's boarding-house , and it is an awful place : the bunks , the food , the dirt  everything .
we have been here four weeks , and in that time i have seen him but once ; but every night i go over his track and post myself .
as soon as he engaged a shanty here i went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that <name> hotel to keep my baggage till i should send for it .
i need nothing here but a change of army shirts , and i brought that with me .
silver gulch , <name> 12 .
the <name> episode has never found its way here , i think .
i know the most of the men in camp , and they have never referred to it , at least in my hearing .
fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions .
he has located a claim , two miles away , in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains ; it promises very well , and he is working it diligently .
ah , but the change in him !
he never smiles , and he keeps quite to himself , <unk> with no one  he who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago .
i have seen him passing along several times recently  drooping , forlorn , the spring gone from his step , a pathetic figure .
he calls himself <name> <name> .
i can trust him to remain here until we disturb him .
since you insist , i <name> banish him again , but i do not see how he can be <unk> than he already is .
i <name> go hack to <name> and treat myself to a little season of comfort , and <unk> food , and <unk> beds , and bodily decency ; then i <name> fetch my things , and notify poor papa <name> to move on .
<name> , <name> 19 .
they miss him here .
they all <name> he is <unk> in mexico , and they do not say it just with their mouths , but out of their hearts .
you know you can always tell .
i am loitering here <unk> , i confess it .
but if you were in my place you would have <name> for me .
yes , i know what you <name> say , and you are right : if i were in your place , and carried your scalding memories in my heart  i <name> take the night train back to-morrow .
<name> , <name> 20 .
god forgive us , mother , we are hunting the wrong man !
i have not slept any all night .
i am now awaiting , at <name> , for the morning train  and how the minutes drag , how they drag !
this <name> fuller is a cousin of the guilty one .
how stupid we have been not to reflect that the guilty one would never again wear his own name after that fiendish deed !
the <name> fuller is four years younger than the other one ; he came here a young widower in <unk> , aged twenty-one  a year before you were married ; and the documents to prove it are innumerable .
last night i talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his arrival .
i said nothing , but a few days from now i <name> land him in this town again , with the loss upon his mine made good ; and there <name> be a banquet , and a <unk> procession , and there <name> not be any expense on anybody but me .
do you call this " gush " ?
i am only a boy , as you well know ; it is my privilege .
by-and-by i shall not be a boy any more .
silver gulch , july 3 .
mother , he is gone !
gone , and left no trace .
the scent was cold when i came .
to-day i am out of bed for the first time since .
i wish i were not a boy ; then i could stand shocks better .
they all think he went west .
i start to-night , in a wagon  two or three hours of that , then i get a train .
i do n't know where i 'm going , but i must go ; to try to keep still would be torture .
of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise .
this means that i may have to search the whole globe to find him .
indeed it is what i expect .
do you see , mother ?
it is i that am the wandering jew .
the irony of it !
we arranged that for another .
think of the difficulties !
and there would be none if i only could advertise for him .
but if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him , i have not been able to think it out , and i have tried till my brains are <unk> .
" if the gentleman who lately bought a mine in mexico and sold one in <name> <name> send his address to  " ( to whom , mother ?
) , " it <name> be explained to him that it was all a mistake ; his forgiveness <name> be asked , and full <unk> made for a loss which he sustained in a certain matter . "
do you see ?
he would think it a trap .
well , any one would .
if i should say , " it is now known that he was not the man wanted , but another man  a man who once bore the same name , but discarded it for good reasons "  would that answer ?
but the <name> people would wake up then and say " oho ! "
and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks , and say , " why did he run away if he was n't the right man ?  it is too thin . "
if i failed to find him he would be ruined there  there where there is no taint upon him now .
you have a better head than mine .
help me .
i have one clue , and only one .
i know his handwriting .
if he puts his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much , it <name> be valuable to me if i ever run across it .
san <name> , <name> 28 , 1898 .
you already know how well i have searched the states from colorado to the pacific , and how nearly i came to getting him once .
well , i have had another close miss .
it was here , yesterday .
i struck his trail , hot , on the street , and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel .
that was a costly mistake ; a dog would have gone the other way .
but i am only part dog , and can get very humanly stupid when excited .
he had been stopping in that house ten days ; i almost know , now , that he stops long nowhere , the past six or eight months , but is restless and has to keep moving .
i understand that feeling !
and i know what it is to feel it .
he still uses the name he had registered when i came so near catching him nine months ago  " <name> <name> " ; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from silver gulch .
an unpretending man , and has small taste for fancy names .
i recognized the hand easily , through its slight disguise .
a square man , and not good at shams and <unk> .
they said he was just gone , on a journey ; left no address ; did n't say where he was going ; looked frightened when asked to leave his address ; had no baggage but a cheap valise ; carried it off on foot  a " stingy old person , and not much loss to the house . "
" old ! "
i suppose he is , now .
i hardly heard ; i was there but a moment .
i rushed along his trail , and it led me to a wharf .
mother , the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon !
i should have saved half an hour if i had gone in the right direction at first .
i could have taken a fast tug , and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel .
she is bound for melbourne .
<name> canyon , california , october 3 , 1900 .
you have a right to complain .
" a letter a year " is a <unk> ; i freely acknowledge it ; but how can one write when there is nothing to write about but failures ?
no one can keep it up ; it breaks the heart .
i told you  it seems ages ago , now  how i missed him at melbourne , and then chased him all over australasia for months on end .
well , then , after that i followed him to <name> ; almost saw him in bombay ; traced him all around  to <unk> , <unk> , lucknow , lahore , cawnpore , allahabad , calcutta , madras  oh , everywhere ; week after week , month after month , through the dust and <unk>  always approximately on his track , sometimes close upon him , yet never catching him .
and down to ceylon , and then to  never mind ; by-and-by i <name> write it all out .
i chased him home to california , and down to mexico , and back again to california .
since then i have been hunting him about the state from the first of last <name> down to a month ago .
i feel almost sure he is not far from <name> canyon ; i traced him to a point thirty miles from here , but there i lost the trail ; some one gave him a lift in a wagon , i suppose .
i am taking a rest , now  modified by <unk> for the lost trail .
i was tired to death , mother , and low-spirited , and sometimes coming uncomfortably near to losing <name> ; but the miners in this little camp are good fellows , and i am used to their sort this long time back ; and their breezy ways <unk> a person up and make him forget his troubles .
i have been here a month .
i am <unk> with a young fellow named " <name> " <unk> , about twenty-five , the only son of his mother  like me  and loves her dearly , and writes to her every week  part of which is like me .
he is a timid body , and in the matter of intellect  well , he can not be depended upon to set a river on fire ; but no matter , he is well liked ; he is good and fine , and it is meat and bread and rest and luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again .
i wish " <name> <name> " could have it .
he had friends ; he liked company .
that brings up that picture of him , the time that i saw him last .
the pathos of it !
it comes before me often and often .
at that very time , poor thing , i was <unk> up my conscience to make him move on again !
<unk> 's heart is better than mine , better than anybody 's in the community , i suppose , for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the camp  flint buckner  and the only man flint ever talks with or allows to talk with him .
he says he knows flint 's history , and that it is trouble that has made him what he is , and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can .
now none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a <unk> like flint buckner , from all i hear about him outside .
i think that this one detail <name> give you a better idea of <name> 's character than any <unk> description i could furnish you of him .
in one of our talks he said something about like this : " flint is a kinsman of mine , and he pours out all his troubles to me  empties his breast from time to time , or i reckon it would burst .
there could n't be any <unk> man , archy stillman ; his life had been made up of misery of mind  he is n't near as old as he looks .
he has lost the feel of <unk> and peace  oh , years and years ago !
he does n't know what good luck is  never has had any ; often says he wishes he was in the other hell , he is so tired of this one . "
iv .
" no real gentleman <name> tell the naked truth in the presence of ladies . "
it was a crisp and <unk> morning in early october .
the lilacs and <unk> , lit with the <unk> of autumn , <name> burning and flashing in the upper air , a <name> bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the tree-tops and would visit together ; the <unk> and the <unk> flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad <unk> along the slanting sweep of the woodland ; the <unk> fragrance of innumerable <unk> flowers rose upon the <unk> atmosphere ; far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing ; everywhere brooded stillness , serenity , and the peace of god .
october is the time  1900 ; <name> canyon is the place , a <unk> camp away down in the <name> region .
it is a secluded spot , high and remote ; recent as to discovery ; thought by its occupants to be <name> in metal  a year or two 's prospecting <name> decide that matter one way or the other .
for inhabitants , the camp has about two hundred miners , one white woman and child , several chinese <unk> , five squaws , and a dozen vagrant <name> indians in <unk> robes , battered plug hats , and <unk> <unk> .
there are no mills as yet ; there is no church , no newspaper .
the camp has existed but two years ; it has made no big strike ; the world is ignorant of its name and place .
on both sides of the canyon the mountains rise <unk> , three thousand feet , and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day , when he sails over at noon .
the village is a couple of miles long ; the cabins stand well apart from each other .
the tavern is the only " frame " house  the only house , one might say .
it occupies a central position , and is the evening resort of the population .
they drink there , and play <unk> and dominoes ; also billiards , for there is a table , crossed all over with torn places repaired with <unk> ; there are some <unk> , but no <unk> ; some chipped balls which clatter when they run , and do not slow up gradually , but stop suddenly and sit down ; there is part of a cube of chalk , with a projecting <unk> of flint in it ; and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar 's expense .
flint buckner 's cabin was the last one of the village , going south ; his <unk> was at the other end of the village , northward , and a little beyond the last hut in that direction .
he was a sour creature , <unk> , and had no <unk> .
people who had tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him .
his history was not known .
some believed that <name> <unk> knew it ; others said no .
if asked , <unk> said no , he was not acquainted with it .
flint had a meek english youth of sixteen or seventeen with him , whom he treated roughly , both in public and in private , and of course this lad was applied to for information , but with no success .
fetlock jones  the name of the youth  said that flint picked him up on a prospecting tramp , and as he had neither home nor friends in <name> , he had found it wise to stay and take buckner 's hard usage for the sake of the salary , which was bacon and beans .
further than this he could offer no testimony .
fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now , and under his meek exterior he was slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put upon him .
for the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts ; more bitterly , perhaps , than do the <unk> sort , who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of endurance has been reached .
good-hearted people wanted to help fetlock out of his trouble , and tried to get him to leave buckner ; but the boy showed fright at the thought , and said he " das n't . "
<name> <name> urged him , and said , " you leave the damned <unk> and come with me ; do n't you be afraid .
i'll take care of him . "
the boy thanked him with tears in his eyes , but shuddered and said he " das n't risk it " ; he said flint would catch him alone , some time , in the night , and then  " oh , it makes me sick , mr. <name> , to think of it . "
others said , " run away from him ; we 'll stake you ; skip out for the coast some night . "
but all these suggestions failed ; he said flint would hunt him down and fetch him back , just for meanness .
the people could not understand this .
the boy 's miseries went steadily on , week after week .
it is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he was employing his spare time .
he slept in an <unk> near flint 's ; and there , nights , he nursed his bruises and his humiliations , and studied and studied over a single problem  how he could murder flint buckner and not be found out .
it was the only <name> he had in life ; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness .
he thought of poison .
no  that would not serve ; the inquest would reveal where it was procured and who had procured it .
he thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place when flint would be homeward-bound at midnight  his unvarying hour for the trip .
no  somebody might be near , and catch him .
he thought of stabbing him in his sleep .
no  he might strike an inefficient blow , and flint would seize him .
he examined a hundred different ways  none of them would answer ; for in even the very <unk> and <unk> of them there was always the fatal defect of a risk , a chance , a possibility that he might be found out .
he would have none of that .
but he was patient , <unk> patient .
there was no hurry , he said to himself .
he would never leave flint till he left him a corpse ; there was no hurry  he would find the way .
it was somewhere , and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it .
yes , somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace , not even the faintest clue to the murderer  there was no hurry  he would find that way , and then  oh , then , it would just be good to be alive !
meantime he would diligently keep up his reputation for meekness ; and also , as always <unk> , he would allow no one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor .
two days before the <unk> october morning flint had bought some things , and he and fetlock had brought them home to flint 's cabin : a fresh box of candles , which they put in the corner ; a tin can of <unk> , which they placed upon the <unk> ; a keg of <unk> , which they placed under flint 's bunk ; a huge coil of fuse , which they <name> on a <name> .
fetlock reasoned that flint 's mining operations had <unk> the pick , and that blasting was about to begin now .
he had seen blasting done , and he had a notion of the process , but he had never helped in it .
his conjecture was right  <unk> had come .
in the morning the pair carried fuse , drills , and the <unk> to the shaft ; it was now eight feet deep , and to get into it and out of it a short ladder was used .
they descended , and by command fetlock held the drill  without any instructions as to the right way to hold it  and flint proceeded to strike .
the sledge came down ; the drill sprang out of fetlock 's hand , almost as a matter of course .
" you mangy son of a nigger , is that any way to hold a drill ?
pick it up !
stand it up !
there  hold fast .
d  you !
i 'll teach you ! "
at the end of an hour the drilling was finished .
" now , then , charge it . "
the boy started to pour in the powder .
" idiot ! "
a heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out .
" get up !
you ca n't lie <unk> there .
now , then , stick in the fuse first .
now put in the powder .
hold on , hold on !
are you going to fill the hole all up ?
of all the <unk> <unk> i  put in some dirt !
put in some gravel !
<unk> it down !
hold on , hold on !
oh , great <name> !
get out of the way ! "
he snatched the iron and <unk> the charge himself , meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend .
then he fired the fuse , climbed out of the shaft , and ran fifty yards away , fetlock following .
they stood waiting a few minutes , then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion ; after a little there was a shower of descending stones ; then all was serene again .
" i wish to god you 'd been in it ! "
remarked the master .
they went down the shaft , cleaned it out , drilled another hole , and put in another charge .
" look here !
how much fuse are you proposing to waste ?
do n't you know how to time a fuse ? "
" no , sir . "
" you do n't !
well , if you do n't beat anything i ever saw ! "
he climbed out of the shaft and spoke down , " well , idiot , are you going to be all day ?
cut the fuse and light it ! "
the trembling creature began , " if you please , sir , i  " " you talk back to me ?
cut it and light it ! "
the boy cut and lit .
" <unk> <name> !
a <unk> fuse !
i wish you were in  " in his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran .
the boy was aghast .
" oh , my god !
help .
help !
oh , save me ! "
he implored .
" oh , what can i do !
what can i do ! "
he backed against the wall as tightly as he could ; the sputtering fuse frightened the voice out of him ; his breath stood still ; he stood gazing and impotent ; in two seconds , three seconds , four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments .
then he had an inspiration .
he sprang at the fuse , severed the inch of it that was left above ground , and was saved .
he sank down limp and half lifeless with fright , his strength all gone ; but he muttered with a deep <name> , " he has learnt me !
i knew there was a way , if i would wait . "
after a matter of five minutes buckner stole to the shaft , looking worried and uneasy , and peered down into it .
he took in the situation ; he saw what had happened .
he lowered the ladder , and the boy dragged himself weakly up it .
he was very white .
his appearance added something to buckner 's uncomfortable state , and he said , with a show of regret and sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice : " it was an accident , you know .
do n't say anything about it to anybody ; i was excited , and did n't notice what i was doing .
you 're not looking well ; you 've worked enough for to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat what you want , and rest .
it 's just an accident , you know , on account of my being excited . "
" it scared me , " said the lad , as he started away ; " but i learnt something , so i do n't mind it . "
" damned easy to please ! "
muttered buckner , following him with his eye .
" i wonder if he 'll tell ?
might n't he ? ...
i wish it had killed him . "
the boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting ; he employed it in work , eager and feverish and happy work .
a thick growth of <unk> extended down the mountainside clear to flint 's cabin ; the most of fetlock 's labor was done in the dark intricacies of that stubborn growth ; the rest of it was done in his own shanty .
at last all was complete , and he said , " if he 's got any suspicions that i 'm going to tell on him , he wo n't keep them long , to-morrow .
he <name> see that i am the same <unk> as i always was  all day and the next .
and the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him ; nobody <name> ever guess who finished him up nor how it was done .
he dropped me the idea his own self , and that 's odd . "
v the next day came and went .
it is now almost midnight , and in five minutes the new morning <name> begin .
the scene is in the tavern billiard-room .
rough men in rough clothing , <unk> , breeches stuffed into <unk> , some with <unk> , none with coats , are grouped about the <unk> stove , which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth ; the <unk> are clacking ; there is no other sound  that is , within ; the wind is fitfully moaning without .
the men look bored ; also expectant .
a <unk> broad-shouldered miner , of middle age , with grizzled whiskers , and an unfriendly eye set in an <unk> face , rises , slips a coil of fuse upon his arm , gathers up some other personal properties , and departs without word or greeting to anybody .
it is flint buckner .
as the door closes behind him a buzz of talk breaks out .
" the <unk> man that ever was , " said <name> <name> , the blacksmith ; " you can tell when it 's twelve just by him leaving , without looking at your waterbury . "
" and it 's the only virtue he 's got , as fur as i know , " said <name> <unk> , miner .
" he 's just a blight on this society , " said <unk> 's man , ferguson .
" if i was running this shop i 'd make him say something , some time or other , or <unk> the ranch . "
this with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper , who did not choose to see it , since the man under discussion was a good customer , and went home pretty well set up , every night , with refreshments furnished from the bar .
" say , " said ham sandwich , miner , " does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you to take a drink ? "
" him ?
flint buckner ?
oh , <name> ! "
this sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or another from the crowd .
after a brief silence , <name> <name> , miner , said , " he 's the <unk> , that cuss .
and his boy 's another one .
i ca n't make them out . "
" nor anybody else , " said ham sandwich ; " and if they are <unk> how are you going to rank up that other one ?
when it comes to a 1 <unk> solid <unk> , he lays over both of them .
easy  do n't he ? "
" you bet ! "
everybody said it .
every man but one .
he was the new-comer  peterson .
he ordered the drinks all round , and asked who no .
3 might be .
all answered at once , " archy stillman ! "
" is he a mystery ? "
asked peterson .
" is he a mystery ?
is archy stillman a mystery ? "
said <unk> 's man , ferguson .
" why , the fourth <unk> 's foolishness to him . "
for ferguson was learned .
peterson wanted to hear all about him ; everybody wanted to tell him ; everybody began .
but <name> stevens , the barkeeper , called the house to order , and said one at a time was best .
he distributed the drinks , and appointed ferguson to lead .
ferguson said , " well , he 's a boy .
and that is just about all we know about him .
you can pump him till you are tired ; it ai n't any use ; you wo n't get anything .
at least about his intentions , or line of business , or where he 's from , and such things as that .
and as for getting at the nature and <unk> of his main big chief mystery , why , he 'll just change the subject , that 's all .
you can guess till you 're black in the face  it 's your privilege  but suppose you do , where do you arrive at ?
nowhere , as near as i can make out . "
" what is his big chief one ? "
" sight , maybe .
hearing , maybe .
instinct , maybe .
magic , maybe .
take your choice  <unk> , twenty-five ; children and servants , half price .
now i 'll tell you what he can do .
you can start here , and just disappear ; you can go and hide wherever you want to , i do n't care where it is , nor how far  and he 'll go straight and put his finger on you . "
" you do n't mean it ! "
" i just do , though .
weather 's nothing to him  elemental conditions is nothing to him  he do n't even take notice of them . "
" oh , come !
dark ?
rain ?
snow ?
hey ? "
" it 's all the same to him .
he do n't give a damn . "
" oh , say  including fog , per'aps ? "
" fog !
he 's got an eye 't can <unk> through it like a bullet . "
" now , boys , honor bright , what 's he giving me ? "
" it 's a fact ! "
they all shouted .
" go on , <unk> . "
" well , sir , you can leave him here , chatting with the boys , and you can slip out and go to any cabin in this camp and open a book  yes , sir , a dozen of them  and take the <name> in your memory , and he 'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open every one of them books at the right <name> , and call it off , and never make a mistake . "
" he must be the devil ! "
" more than one has thought it .
now i 'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he done .
the other night he  " there was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside , the door flew open , and an excited crowd burst in , with the camp 's one white woman in the lead and crying , " my child !
my child !
she 's lost and gone !
for the love of god help me to find archy stillman ; we 've hunted everywhere ! "
said the barkeeper : " sit down , sit down , mrs. hogan , and do n't worry .
he asked for a bed three hours ago , tuckered out tramping the trails the way he 's always doing , and went upstairs .
ham sandwich , run up and <unk> him out ; he's in no .
14 . "
the youth was soon downstairs and ready .
he asked mrs. hogan for particulars .
" bless you , dear , there ai n't any ; i wish there was .
i put her to sleep at seven in the evening , and when i went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself , she was gone .
i rushed for your cabin , dear , and you wasn't there , and i 've hunted for you ever since , at every cabin down the gulch , and now i 've come up again , and i 'm that distracted and scared and <unk> ; but , thanks to god , i 've found you at last , dear heart , and you 'll find my child .
come on !
come quick ! "
" move right along ; i 'm with you , madam .
go to your cabin first . "
the whole company streamed out to join the hunt .
all the southern half of the village was up , a hundred men strong , and waiting outside , a vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns .
the mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road , and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders .
in a few minutes the hogan cabin was reached .
" there 's the bunk , " said mrs. hogan ; " there 's where she was ; it 's where i laid her at seven o'clock ; but where she is now , god only knows . "
" hand me a lantern , " said archy .
he set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it , pretending to examine the ground closely .
" here 's her track , " he said , touching the ground here and there and yonder with his finger .
" do you see ? "
several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see .
one or two thought they discerned something like a track ; the others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover .
one said , " maybe a child 's foot could make a <name> on it , but i do n't see how . "
young stillman stepped outside , held the light to the ground , turned <unk> , and moved three steps , closely examining ; then said , " i 've got the direction  come along ; take the lantern , somebody . "
he strode off swiftly southward , the files following , swaying and bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge .
thus a mile , and the mouth of the gorge was reached ; before them stretched the <unk> plain , dim , vast , and vague .
stillman called a halt , saying , " we mustn't start wrong , now ; we must take the direction again . "
he took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards ; then said , " come on ; it 's all right , " and gave up the lantern .
in and out among the <unk> he marched , a quarter of a mile , bearing gradually to the right ; then took a new direction and made another great semicircle ; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a mile  and stopped .
" she gave it up , here , poor little chap .
hold the lantern .
you can see where she sat . "
but this was in a slick alkali flat which was <unk> like steel , and no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a cushion on a <unk> like that .
the bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot , lamenting .
" but where is she , then ? "
some one said .
" she did n't stay here .
we can see that much , anyway . "
stillman moved about in a circle around the place , with the lantern , pretending to hunt for tracks .
" well ! "
he said presently , in an annoyed tone , " i do n't understand it . "
he examined again .
" no use .
she was here  that 's certain ; she never walked away from here  and that 's certain .
it 's a puzzle ; i ca n't make it out . "
the mother lost heart then .
" oh , my god !
oh , blessed virgin !
some flying beast has got her .
i'll never see her again ! "
" ah , do n't give up , " said archy .
" we 'll find her  do n't give up . "
" god bless you for the words , archy stillman ! "
and she seized his hand and kissed it fervently .
peterson , the new-comer , whispered <unk> in ferguson 's ear : " wonderful performance to find this place , was n't it ?
hardly worth while to come so far , though ; any other <unk> place would have answered just as well  hey ? "
ferguson was not pleased with the <unk> .
he said , with some warmth , " do you mean to insinuate that the child has n't been here ?
i tell you the child has been here !
now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a little fuss as  " " all right ! "
sang out stillman .
" come , everybody , and look at this !
it was right under our noses all the time , and we did n't see it . "
there was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to have rested , and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that archy 's finger was resting upon .
there was a pause , then a <unk> sigh of disappointment .
<name> <name> and ham sandwich said , in the one breath , " what is it , archy ?
there 's nothing here . "
" nothing ?
do you call that nothing ? "
and he swiftly traced upon the ground a form with his finger .
" there  do n't you recognize it now ?
it's injun <name> 's track .
he 's got the child . "
" god be praised ! "
from the mother .
" take away the lantern .
i 've got the direction .
follow ! "
he started on a run , racing in and out among the <unk> a matter of three hundred yards , and disappeared over a <unk> ; the others struggled after him , caught him up , and found him waiting .
ten steps away was a little <unk> , a dim and formless shelter of rags and old <unk> , a dull light showing through its chinks .
" you lead , mrs. hogan , " said the lad .
" it 's your privilege to be first . "
all followed the <unk> she made for the <unk> , and saw , with her , the picture its interior afforded .
injun <name> was sitting on the ground ; the child was asleep beside him .
the mother hugged it with a wild embrace , which included archy stillman , the grateful tears running down her face , and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full richness nowhere but in the <name> heart .
" i find her <unk> it is ten o'clock , " <name> explained .
" she <unk> out yonder , <unk> tired  face wet , been cryin ' , <unk> ; fetch her home , feed her , she heap much hungry  go <unk> <unk> . "
in her limitless gratitude the happy mother <unk> rank and hugged him too , calling him " the <name> of god in disguise . "
and he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of an official .
he was dressed for the character .
at half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing , " when <name> comes marching home , " waving its lanterns , and swallowing the drinks that were brought out all along its course .
it concentrated at the tavern , and made a night of what was left of the morning .
part ii i the next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation .
a grave and dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern , and entered this formidable name upon the register : sherlock holmes .
the news <unk> from cabin to cabin , from claim to claim ; tools were dropped , and the town swarmed toward the center of interest .
a man passing out at the northern end of the village shouted it to <name> <name> , whose claim was the next one to flint buckner 's .
at that time fetlock jones seemed to turn sick .
he muttered to himself , " uncle sherlock !
the mean luck of it !  that he should come just when ... . " he dropped into a reverie , and presently said to himself : " but what 's the use of being afraid of him ?
anybody that knows him the way i do knows he ca n't detect a crime except where he plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and <unk> some fellow to commit it according to instructions ... . now there ai n't going to be any clues this time  so , what show has he got ?
none at all .
no , sir ; <unk> ready .
if i was to risk putting it off ... . no , i wo n't run any risk like that .
flint buckner goes out of this world to-night , for sure . "
then another trouble presented itself .
" uncle sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening , and how am i going to get rid of him ?
for i 've got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight o'clock . "
this was an awkward matter , and cost him much thought .
but he found a way to beat the difficulty .
" we 'll go for a walk , and i 'll leave him in the road a minute , so that he wo n't see what it is i do : the best way to throw a detective off the track , anyway , is to have him along when you are preparing the thing .
yes , that 's the safest  i 'll take him with me . "
meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man .
but he kept his room , and did not appear .
none but ferguson , <name> <name> the blacksmith , and ham sandwich had any luck .
these enthusiastic admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern 's <unk> lockup , which looked into the detective 's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide , ambushed themselves in it , and cut some <unk> in the <unk> .
mr. holmes 's blinds were down ; but by-and-by he raised them .
it gave the spies a <unk> but pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the extraordinary man who had filled the world with the fame of his more than human <unk> .
there he sat  not a myth , not a shadow , but real , alive , compact of substance , and almost within touching distance with the hand .
" look at that head ! "
said ferguson , in an awed voice .
" by gracious !
that 's a head ! "
" you bet ! "
said the blacksmith , with deep reverence .
" look at his nose !
look at his eyes !
intellect ?
just a battery of it ! "
" and that paleness , " said ham sandwich .
" comes from thought  that 's what it comes from .
hell !
<unk> like us do n't know what real thought is . "
" no more we do n't , " said ferguson .
" what we take for thinking is just <unk> . "
" right you are , <unk> .
and look at that frown  that 's deep thinking  away down , down , forty fathom into the bowels of things .
he's on the track of something . "
" well , he is , and do n't you forget it .
say  look at that awful gravity  look at that pallid <unk>  there ai n't any corpse can lay over it . "
" no , sir , not for dollars !
and it 's his'n by hereditary rights , too ; he 's been dead four times <unk> , and there 's history for it .
three times natural , once by accident .
i 've heard say he smells damp and cold , like a grave .
and he  " " <unk> !
watch him !
there  he 's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his forehead , and his forefinger on the off one .
his <unk> is just <unk> now , you bet your other shirt . "
" that 's so .
and now he 's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow , and  " " now he has rose up standing , and is putting his clues together on his left fingers with his right finger .
see ?
he touches the forefinger  now middle finger  now <unk>  " " stuck ! "
" look at him scowl !
he ca n't seem to make out that clue .
so he  " " see him smile !  like a tiger  and tally off the other fingers like nothing !
he 's got it , boys ; he 's got it sure ! "
" well , i should say !
i 'd hate to be in that man 's place that he's after . "
mr. holmes <name> a table to the window , sat down with his back to the spies , and proceeded to write .
the spies withdrew their eyes from the <unk> , lit their pipes , and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk .
ferguson said , with conviction , " boys , it 's no use talking , he 's a wonder !
he 's got the signs of it all over him . "
" you <name> n't ever said a truer word than that , <unk> , " said <name> <name> .
" say , would n't it 'a ' been nuts if he 'd <unk> here last night ? "
" oh , by <name> , but would n't it ! "
said ferguson .
" then we 'd have seen scientific work .
intellect  just pure intellect  away up on the upper levels , <unk> .
archy is all right , and it do n't become anybody to <unk> him , i can tell you .
but his gift is only just eyesight , sharp as an owl 's , as near as i can make it out just a grand natural animal talent , no more , no less , and prime as far as it goes , but no intellect in it , and for <unk> and <unk> no more to be compared to what this man does than  than  why , let me tell you what he 'd have done .
he 'd have stepped over to hogan 's and glanced  just glanced , that's all  at the premises , and that 's enough .
see everything ?
yes , sir , to the last little detail ; and he 'll know more about that place than the <unk> would know in seven years .
next , he would sit down on the bunk , just as ca 'm , and say to mrs. hogan  say , ham , consider that you are mrs. hogan .
i 'll ask the questions ; you answer them . "
" all right ; go on . "
" <unk> , if you please  attention  do not let your mind wander .
now , then  sex of the child ? '
" <unk> , your honor . '
" 'um  female .
very good , very good .
age ? '
" <unk> six , your honor . '
" 'um  young , weak  two miles .
weariness <name> overtake it then .
it <name> sink down and sleep .
we shall find it two miles away , or less .
teeth ? '
" 'five , your honor , and one a-coming . '
" 'very good , very good , very good , indeed . '
you see , boys , he knows a clue when he sees it , when it would n't mean a dern thing to anybody else .
<unk> , madam ?
shoes ? '
" 'yes , your honor  both . '
" <unk> , perhaps ?
morocco ? '
" <unk> , your honor .
and <name> . '
" 'um  <name> .
this <unk> the matter .
however , let it go  we shall manage .
religion ? '
" <unk> , your honor . '
" 'very good .
<unk> me a bit from the bed blanket , please .
ah , thanks .
part wool  foreign make .
very well .
a <unk> from some garment of the child 's , please .
thanks .
cotton .
shows wear .
an excellent clue , excellent .
pass me a pallet of the floor dirt , if you 'll be so kind .
thanks , many thanks .
ah , admirable , admirable !
now we know where we are , i think . '
you see , boys , he 's got all the clues he wants now ; he don't need anything more .
now , then , what does this extraordinary man do ?
he lays those <unk> and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his elbows , and puts them together side by side and studies them  <unk> to himself , <unk> ' ; changes them around  <unk> , <unk> years old ' ; changes them this way and that  again <unk> : 'five teeth  one a-coming  catholic  yarn  cotton  <name>  damn that <name> . '
then he straightens up and gazes toward heaven , and <unk> his hands through his hair  <unk> and <unk> , muttering , <unk> that <name> ! '
then he stands up and frowns , and begins to tally off his clues on his fingers  and gets stuck at the <unk> .
but only just a minute  then his face <unk> all up in a smile like a house afire , and he straightens up stately and majestic , and says to the crowd , 'take a lantern , a couple of you , and go down to injun <name> 's and fetch the child  the rest of you go 'long home to bed ; good-night , madam ; good-night , gents . '
and he bows like the matterhorn , and pulls out for the tavern .
that 's his style , and the only  scientific , intellectual  all over in fifteen minutes  no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a <unk> crowd for him , boys  you hear me ! "
" by <name> , it 's grand ! "
said ham sandwich .
" <unk> , you 've got him down to a <name> .
he ai n't painted up any <unk> to the life in the books .
by <name> , i can just see him  ca n't you , boys ? "
" you bet you !
it 's just a <unk> , that 's what it is . "
ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success , and grateful .
he sat silently enjoying his happiness a little while , then he murmured , with a deep awe in his voice , " i wonder if god made him ? "
there was no response for a moment ; then ham sandwich said , reverently , " not all at one time , i reckon . "
ii at eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past flint buckner 's cabin in the frosty gloom .
they were sherlock holmes and his nephew .
" stop here in the road a moment , uncle , " said fetlock , " while i run to my cabin ; i wo n't be gone a minute . "
he asked for something  the uncle furnished it  then he disappeared in the darkness , but soon returned , and the <unk> was resumed .
by nine o'clock they had wandered back to the tavern .
they worked their way through the billiard-room , where a crowd had gathered in the <name> of getting a glimpse of the extraordinary man .
a <name> cheer was raised .
mr. holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows , and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage , " uncle sherlock 's got some work to do , gentlemen , that 'll keep him till twelve or one ; but he 'll be down again then , or earlier if he can , and hopes some of you 'll be left to take a drink with him . "
" by <name> , he 's just a duke , boys !
three cheers for sherlock holmes , the greatest man that ever lived ! "
shouted ferguson .
" hip , hip , hip  " " hurrah !
hurrah !
hurrah !
tiger ! "
the uproar shook the building , so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their welcome .
upstairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently , saying , " what did you get me into that engagement for ? "
" i reckon you do n't want to be unpopular , do you , uncle ?
well , then , do n't you put on any <unk> in a <unk> , that 's all .
the boys admire you ; but if you was to leave without taking a drink with them , they 'd set you down for a <unk> .
and , besides , you said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night . "
the boy was right , and wise  the uncle acknowledged it .
the boy was wise in another detail which he did not mention  except to himself : " uncle and the others <name> come handy  in the way of <unk> an <unk> where it ca n't be <unk> . "
he and his uncle talked diligently about three hours .
then , about midnight , fetlock stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern , and waited .
five minutes later flint buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and almost brushed him as he passed .
" i 've got him ! "
muttered the boy .
he continued to himself , looking after the shadowy form : " good-by  good-by for good , flint buckner ; you called my mother a  well , never mind what ; it 's all right , now ; you 're taking your last walk , friend . "
he went musing back into the tavern .
" from now till one is an hour .
we 'll spend it with the boys ; it 's good for the <unk> . "
he brought sherlock holmes to the billiard-room , which was jammed with eager and admiring miners ; the guest called the drinks , and the fun began .
everybody was happy ; everybody was complimentary ; the ice was soon broken ; songs , anecdotes , and more drinks followed , and the pregnant minutes flew .
at six minutes to one , when the <unk> was at its highest  boom !
there was silence instantly .
the deep sound came rolling and rumbling from peak to peak up the gorge , then died down , and ceased .
the spell broke , then , and the men made a rush for the door , saying , " something 's blown up ! "
outside , a voice in the darkness said , " it 's away down the gorge ; i saw the flash . "
the crowd poured down the canyon  holmes , fetlock , archy stillman , everybody .
they made the mile in a few minutes .
by the light of a lantern they found the smooth and solid dirt floor of flint <unk> cabin ; of the cabin itself not a vestige remained , not a rag nor a splinter .
nor any sign of flint .
<unk> sought here and there and yonder , and presently a cry went up .
" here he is ! "
it was true .
fifty yards down the gulch they had found him  that is , they had found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him .
fetlock jones hurried thither with the others and looked .
the inquest was a <unk> affair .
ham sandwich , foreman of the jury , handed up the verdict , which was phrased with a certain <unk> literary <name> , and closed with this finding , to wit : that " deceased came to his death by his own act or some other person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind but his cabin which was blown away and god have <name> on his soul amen . "
then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd , for the <unk> of interest was there  sherlock holmes .
the miners stood silent and reverent in a <unk> , <unk> a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late premises .
in this considerable space the extraordinary man was moving about , attended by his nephew with a lantern .
with a tape he took measurements of the cabin site ; of the distance from the wall of <unk> to the road ; of the height of the <unk> bushes ; also various other measurements .
he gathered a rag here , a splinter there , and a pinch of earth yonder , inspected them profoundly , and preserved them .
he took the " lay " of the place with a <unk> , allowing two seconds for magnetic variation .
he took the time ( pacific ) by his watch , correcting it for local time .
he paced off the distance from the cabin site to the corpse , and corrected that for tidal differentiation .
he took the altitude with a <unk> , and the temperature with a <unk> .
finally he said , with a stately bow : " it is finished .
shall we return , gentlemen ? "
he took up the line of march for the tavern , and the crowd fell into his wake , earnestly discussing and admiring the extraordinary man , and <unk> guesses as to the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he .
" my , but it 's grand luck having him here  hey , boys ? "
said ferguson .
" it 's the biggest thing of the century , " said ham sandwich .
" it 'll go all over the world ; you <name> my words . "
" you bet ! "
said <name> <name> , the blacksmith .
" it 'll boom this camp .
ai n't it so , <unk> ? "
" well , as you want my opinion  if it 's any sign of how i think about it , i can tell you this : yesterday i was holding the straight flush claim at two dollars a foot ; i 'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen today . "
" right you are , <unk> !
it 's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck .
say , did you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things ?
what an eye !
he just ca n't overlook a clue  'tai n't in him . "
" that 's so .
and they would n't mean a thing to anybody else ; but to him , why , they 're just a book  large print at that . "
" sure 's you 're born !
them odds and ends have got their little old secret , and they think there ai n't anybody can pull it ; but , land !
when he sets his grip there they 've got to squeal , and do n't you forget it . "
" boys , i ai n't sorry , now , that he was n't here to <unk> out the child ; this is a bigger thing , by a long sight .
yes , sir , and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual . "
" i reckon we 're all of us glad it 's turned out this way .
glad ?
<unk> !
it ai n't any name for it .
<unk> , archy could 've learnt something if he 'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system .
but no ; he went poking up into the <unk> and just missed the whole thing . "
" it 's true as gospel ; i seen it myself .
well , archy 's young .
he 'll know better one of these days . "
" say , boys , who do you reckon done it ? "
that was a difficult question , and brought out a world of <unk> conjecture .
various men were mentioned as possibilities , but one by one they were discarded as not being eligible .
no one but young <unk> had been intimate with flint buckner ; no one had really had a quarrel with him ; he had <unk> every man who had tried to make up to him , although not quite <unk> enough to require bloodshed .
there was one name that was upon every tongue from the start , but it was the last to get utterance  fetlock jones 's .
it was <name> <name> that mentioned it .
" oh , well , " the boys said , " of course we 've all thought of him , because he had a million rights to kill flint buckner , and it was just his plain duty to do it .
but all the same there 's two things we ca n't get around , for one thing , he has n't got the sand ; and for another , he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened . "
" i know it , " said <name> .
" he was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened . "
" yes , and was there all the time for an hour before it happened . "
" it 's so .
and lucky for him , too .
he 'd have been suspected in a minute if it had n't been for that . "
iii the tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine table and a chair .
this table was against one end of the room ; the chair was on it ; sherlock holmes , stately , imposing , impressive , sat in the chair .
the public stood .
the room was full .
the <unk> was dense , the stillness profound .
the extraordinary man raised his hand to command additional silence ; held it in the air a few moments ; then , in brief , crisp terms he put forward question after question , and noted the answers with " <unk> , " nods of the head , and so on .
by this process he learned all about flint buckner , his character , conduct , and habits , that the people were able to tell him .
it thus transpired that the extraordinary man 's nephew was the only person in the camp who had a <unk> against flint buckner .
mr. holmes smiled <unk> upon the witness , and asked , languidly  " do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad fetlock jones was at the time of the explosion ? "
a thunderous response followed  " in the billiard-room of this house ! "
" ah .
and had he just come in ? "
" been there all of an hour ! "
" ah .
it is about  about  well , about how far might it be to the scene of the explosions . "
" all of a mile ! "
" ah .
it is n't much of an <unk> , 't is true , but  " a <unk> of laughter , mingled with shouts of " by <unk> , but he's <unk> ! "
and " ai n't you sorry you spoke , <name> ? "
shut off the rest of the sentence , and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame .
the <unk> resumed : " the lad jones 's somewhat distant connection with the case " ( laughter ) " having been disposed of , let us now call the <unk> of the tragedy , and listen to what they have to say . "
he got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee .
the house held its breath and watched .
" we have the longitude and the latitude , corrected for magnetic variation , and this gives us the exact location of the tragedy .
we have the altitude , the temperature , and the degree of <unk> prevailing  <unk> valuable , since they enable us to estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night . "
( buzz of admiration ; muttered remark , " by <name> , but he 's deep ! " )
he fingered his clues .
" and now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak to us .
" here we have an empty linen <unk> .
what is its message ?
this : that robbery was the motive , not revenge .
what is its further message ?
this : that the assassin was of inferior intelligence  shall we say <unk> , or perhaps approaching that ?
how do we know this ?
because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to <name> the man buckner , who never had much money with him .
but the assassin might have been a stranger ?
let the bag speak again .
i take from it this article .
it is a bit of <unk> quartz .
it is peculiar .
examine it , please  you  and you  and you .
now pass it back , please .
there is but one <unk> on this coast which produces just that character and color of quartz ; and that is a <unk> which crops out for nearly two miles on a stretch , and in my opinion is destined , at no distant day , to confer upon its locality a <unk> celebrity , and upon its two hundred owners riches beyond the dreams of avarice .
name that <unk> , please . "
" the consolidated <name> science and <name> <name> ! "
was the prompt response .
a wild crash of <unk> followed , and every man reached for his neighbor 's hand and wrung it , with tears in his eyes ; and <unk> ferguson shouted , " the straight flush is on the <unk> , and up she goes to a <unk> and fifty a foot  you hear me ! "
when quiet fell , mr. holmes resumed : " we perceive , then , that three facts are established , to wit : the assassin was approximately <unk> ; he was not a stranger ; his motive was robbery , not revenge .
let us proceed .
i hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse , with the recent smell of fire upon it .
what is its testimony ?
taken with the <unk> evidence of the quartz , it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner .
what does it tell us further ?
this , gentlemen : that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive .
what else does it say ?
this : that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin nearest the road  the front side  for within six feet of that spot i found it .
" i hold in my fingers a burnt swedish match  the kind one rubs on a <unk> .
i found it in the road , six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin .
what does it say ?
this : that the train was fired from that point .
what further does it tell us ?
this : that the assassin was left-handed .
how do i know this ?
i should not be able to explain to you , gentlemen , how i know it , the signs being so subtle that only long experience and deep study can enable one to detect them .
but the signs are here , and they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective narratives  that all assassins are left-handed . "
" by <name> , that 's so ! "
said ham sandwich , bringing his great hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh ; " blamed if i ever thought of it before . "
" nor i ! "
" nor i ! "
cried several .
" oh , there ca n't anything escape him  look at his eye ! "
" gentlemen , distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim , he did not wholly escape injury .
this fragment of wood which i now exhibit to you struck him .
it <name> blood .
wherever he is , he bears the <unk> <name> .
i picked it up where he stood when he fired the fatal train . "
he looked out over the house from his high perch , and his countenance began to darken ; he slowly raised his hand , and pointed  " there stands the assassin ! "
for a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement ; then twenty voices burst out with : " <name> <unk> ?
oh , hell , no !
him ?
it 's pure foolishness ! "
" take care , gentlemen  be not hasty .
observe  he has the <unk> on his brow . "
<unk> turned white with fright .
he was near to crying .
he turned this way and that , appealing to every face for help and sympathy ; and held out his supplicating hands toward holmes and began to plead , " do n't , oh , do n't !
i never did it ; i give my word i never did it .
the way i got this hurt on my forehead was  " " arrest him , constable ! "
cried holmes .
" i <name> swear out the warrant . "
the constable moved reluctantly forward  hesitated  stopped .
<unk> broke out with another appeal .
" oh , archy , do n't let them do it ; it would kill mother !
you know how i got the hurt .
tell them , and save me , archy ; save me ! "
stillman worked his way to the front , and said , " yes , i 'll save you .
do n't be afraid . "
then he said to the house , " never mind how he got the hurt ; it has n't anything to do with this case , and is n't of any consequence . "
" god bless you , archy , for a true friend ! "
" hurrah for archy !
go in , boy , and play 'em a <unk> flush to their two pair 'n ' a <name> ! "
shouted the house , pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the situation .
young stillman waited for the noise to cease ; then he said , " i <name> ask <name> <unk> to stand by that door yonder , and constable <name> to stand by the other one here , and not let anybody leave the room .
" said and done .
go on , old man ! "
" the criminal is present , i believe .
i <name> show him to you before long , in case i am right in my guess .
now i <name> tell you all about the tragedy , from start to finish .
the motive was n't robbery ; it was revenge .
the murderer was n't <unk> .
he did n't stand six hundred and twenty-two feet away .
he did n't get hit with a piece of wood .
he did n't place the explosive against the cabin .
he did n't bring a <unk> with him , and he was n't left-handed .
with the exception of these errors , the distinguished guest 's statement of the case is substantially correct . "
a comfortable laugh rippled over the house ; friend nodded to friend , as much as to say , " that 's the word , with the bark on it .
good lad , good boy .
he ai n't lowering his flag any ! "
the guest 's serenity was not disturbed .
stillman resumed : " i also have some witnesses ; and i <name> presently tell you where you can find some more . "
he held up a piece of coarse wire ; the crowd <unk> their necks to see .
" it has a smooth coating of melted tallow on it .
and here is a candle which is burned half-way down .
the remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart .
soon i <name> tell you where i found these things .
i <name> now put aside reasonings , guesses , the impressive <unk> of odds and ends of clues together , and the other showy theatricals of the detective trade , and tell you in a plain , straightforward way just how this dismal thing happened . "
he paused a moment , for effect  to allow silence and suspense to <unk> and concentrate the house 's interest ; then he went on : " the assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains .
it was a good plan , very ingenious , and showed an intelligent mind , not a feeble one .
it was a plan which was well calculated to <name> off all suspicion from its inventor .
in the first place , he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart , and lit it and timed it .
he found it took three hours to burn four inches of it .
i tried it myself for half an hour , awhile ago , up-stairs here , while the inquiry into flint buckner 's character and ways was being conducted in this room , and i arrived in that way at the rate of a candle 's consumption when sheltered from the wind .
having proved his trial candle 's rate , he blew it out  i have already shown it to you  and put his <unk> on a fresh one .
" he put the fresh one into a tin candlestick .
then at the <unk> <name> he bored a hole through the candle with a red-hot wire .
i have already shown you the wire , with a smooth coat of tallow on it  tallow that had been melted and had cooled .
" with labor  very hard labor , i should say  he struggled up through the stiff <unk> that clothes the steep hillside back of flint <unk> place , tugging an empty <unk> with him .
he placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place , and in the bottom of it he set the candlestick .
then he measured off about thirty-five feet of fuse  the barrel 's distance from the back of the cabin .
he bored a hole in the side of the barrel  here is the large <unk> he did it with .
he went on and finished his work ; and when it was done , one end of the fuse was in buckner 's cabin , and the other end , with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder , was in the hole in the candle  timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning , provided the candle was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening  which i am betting it was  and provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the fuse  which i am also betting there was , though i ca n't prove it .
boys , the barrel is there in the <unk> , the candle 's remains are in it in the tin stick ; the <unk> fuse is in the <unk> , the other end is down the hill where the late cabin stood .
i saw them all an hour or two ago , when the professor here was measuring off <unk> vacancies and collecting relics that had n't anything to do with the case . "
he paused .
the house <name> a long , deep breath , shook its strained cords and muscles free and burst into cheers .
" <unk> him ! "
said ham sandwich , " that 's why he was <unk> around in the <unk> , instead of picking up points out of the <unk> 's game .
looky here  he ai n't no fool , boys . "
" no , sir !
why , great <name>  " but stillman was resuming : " while we were out yonder an hour or two ago , the owner of the <unk> and the <unk> took them from a place where he had concealed them  it was not a good place  and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one , two hundred yards up in the pine woods , and hid them there , covering them over with pine needles .
it was there that i found them .
the <unk> exactly fits the hole in the barrel .
and now  " the extraordinary man interrupted him .
he said , sarcastically , " we have had a very pretty <name> tale , gentlemen  very pretty indeed .
now i would like to ask this young man a question or two . "
some of the boys winced , and ferguson said , " i 'm afraid archy 's going to catch it now . "
the others lost their smiles and sobered down .
mr. holmes said , " let us proceed to examine into this <unk> in a consecutive and orderly way  by geometrical progression , so to speak  linking detail to detail in a steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel <unk> of error , the dream fabric of a <unk> .
to begin with , young sir , i <name> to ask you but three questions at present  at present .
did i understand you to say it was your opinion that the <unk> candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening ? "
" yes , sir  about eight . "
" could you say exactly eight ? "
" well , no , i could n't be that exact . "
" um .
if a person had been passing along there just about that time , he would have been almost sure to encounter that assassin , do you think ? "
" yes , i should think so . "
" thank you , that is all .
for the present .
i say , all for the present . "
" dern him , he 's laying for archy , " said ferguson .
" it 's so , " said ham sandwich .
" i do n't like the look of it . "
stillman said , glancing at the guest , " i was along there myself at half past eight  no , about nine . "
" indeed ?
this is interesting  this is very interesting .
perhaps you encountered the assassin ? "
" no , i encountered no one . "
" ah .
then  if you <name> excuse the remark  i do not quite see the relevancy of the information . "
" it has none .
at present .
i say it has none  at present . "
he paused .
presently he resumed : " i did not encounter the assassin , but i am on his track , i am sure , for i believe he is in this room .
i <name> ask you all to pass one by one in front of me  here , where there is a good light  so that i can see your feet . "
a buzz of excitement swept the place , and the march began , the guest looking on with an iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success .
stillman stooped , shaded his eyes with his hand , and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed .
fifty men tramped monotonously by  with no result .
sixty .
seventy .
the thing was beginning to look absurd .
the guest remarked , with <unk> irony , " assassins appear to be scarce this evening . "
the house saw the humor if it , and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh .
ten or twelve more candidates tramped by  no , danced by , with airy and ridiculous <unk> which convulsed the spectators  then suddenly stillman put out his hand and said , " this is the assassin ! "
" fetlock jones , by the great <unk> ! "
roared the crowd ; and at once let fly a <unk> explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the situation .
at the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand , commanding peace .
the authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon the house , and it obeyed .
out of the panting calm which succeeded , the guest spoke , saying , with dignity and feeling , " this is serious .
it strikes at an innocent life .
innocent beyond suspicion !
innocent beyond peradventure !
hear me prove it ; observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie .
listen .
my friends , that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at any time ! "
it made a deep impression .
men turned their eyes upon stillman with grave inquiry in them .
his face brightened , and he said , " i knew there was another one ! "
he stepped briskly to the table and glanced at the guest 's feet , then up at his face , and said : " you were with him !
you were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle that by-and-by fired the powder ! "
( sensation . )
" and what is more , you furnished the matches yourself ! "
plainly the guest seemed hit ; it looked so to the public .
he opened his mouth to speak ; the words did not come freely .
" this  er  this is insanity  this  " stillman pressed his evident advantage home .
he held up a charred match .
" here is one of them .
i found it in the barrel  and there 's another one there . "
the guest found his voice at once .
" yes  and put them there yourself ! "
it was recognized a good shot .
stillman retorted .
" it is wax  a breed unknown to this camp .
i am ready to be searched for the box .
are you ? "
the guest was staggered this time  the dullest eye could see it .
he fumbled with his hands ; once or twice his lips moved , but the words did not come .
the house waited and watched , in tense suspense , the stillness adding effect to the situation .
presently stillman said , gently , " we are waiting for your decision . "
there was silence again during several moments ; then the guest answered , in a low voice , " i refuse to be searched . "
there was no noisy demonstration , but all about the house one voice after another muttered , " that settles it !
he 's archy 's meat . "
what to do now ?
nobody seemed to know .
it was an embarrassing situation for the moment  merely , of course , because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected turn that these <unk> minds were not prepared for it , and had come to a standstill , like a stopped clock , under the shock .
but after a little the machinery began to work again , <unk> , and by twos and threes the men put their heads together and privately <unk> over this and that and the other proposition .
one of these propositions met with much favor ; it was , to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks for removing flint buckner , and let him go .
but the cooler heads opposed it , pointing out that <unk> brains in the eastern states would pronounce it a scandal , and make no end of foolish noise about it .
finally the cool heads got the upper hand , and obtained general consent to a proposition of their own ; their leader then called the house to order and stated it  to this effect : that fetlock jones be jailed and put upon trial .
the motion was carried .
apparently there was nothing further to do now , and the people were glad , for , privately , they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the tragedy , and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not .
but no  the <unk> got a check .
the surprises were not over yet .
for a while fetlock jones had been silently sobbing , unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which had been following one another so persistently for some time ; but when his arrest and trial were decreed , he broke out despairingly , and said , " no !
it 's no use .
i do n't want any jail , i do n't want any trial ; i've had all the hard luck i want , and all the miseries .
<name> me now , and let me out !
it would all come out , anyway  there could n't anything save me .
he has told it all , just as if he 'd been with me and seen it  i don't know how he found out ; and you 'll find the barrel and things , and then i would n't have any chance any more .
i killed him ; and you 'd have done it too , if he 'd treated you like a dog , and you only a boy , and weak and poor , and not a friend to help you . "
" and served him damned well right ! "
broke in ham sandwich .
" looky here , boys  " from the constable : " order !
order , gentlemen ! "
a voice : " did your uncle know what you was up to ? "
" no , he did n't . "
" did he give you the matches , sure enough ? "
" yes , he did ; but he did n't know what i wanted them for . "
" when you was out on such a business as that , how did you venture to risk having him along  and him a detective ?
how 's that ? "
the boy hesitated , fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way , then said , shyly , " i know about detectives , on account of having them in the family ; and if you do n't want them to find out about a thing , it 's best to have them around when you do it . "
the cyclone of laughter which greeted this <unk> discharge of wisdom did not modify the poor little waif 's embarrassment in any large degree .
iv from a letter to mrs. stillman , dated merely " tuesday . "
fetlock jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin , and left there to await his trial .
constable <name> provided him with a couple of days ' rations , instructed him to keep a good guard over himself , and promised to look in on him as soon as further supplies should be due .
next morning a score of us went with <unk> , out of friendship , and helped him bury his late relative , the <unk> buckner , and i acted as first assistant <unk> , <unk> acting as chief .
just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger , carrying an old hand-bag , limped by with his head down , and i caught the scent i had chased around the globe !
it was the odor of paradise to my perishing <name> !
in a moment i was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder .
he <unk> to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks ; and as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to me , and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more , and said , " you have hunted me around the world , sherlock holmes , yet god is my witness i have never done any man harm ! "
a glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane .
that was my work , mother !
the tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery i felt in that moment , but nothing else can ever do it .
the boys lifted him up , and gathered about him , and were full of pity of him , and said the gentlest and <unk> things to him , and said cheer up and don't be troubled , he was among friends now , and they would take care of him , and protect him , and <name> any man that laid a hand on him .
they are just like so many mothers , the rough <unk> boys are , when you wake up the south side of their hearts ; yes , and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up the opposite of that muscle .
they did everything they could think of to comfort him , but nothing succeeded until <unk> ferguson , who is a clever strategist , said , " if it 's only sherlock holmes that 's troubling you , you need n't worry any more . "
" why ? "
asked the forlorn lunatic , eagerly .
" because he 's dead again . "
" dead !
dead !
oh , do n't trifle with a poor wreck like me .
is he dead ?
on honor , now  is he telling me true , boys ? "
" true as you 're standing there ! "
said ham sandwich , and they all backed up the statement in a body .
" they <name> him in san <unk> last week , " added ferguson , <unk> the matter , " whilst he was searching around after you .
mistook him for another man .
they 're sorry , but they ca n't help it now . "
" they 're <unk> him a monument , " said ham sandwich , with the air of a person who had contributed to it , and knew .
" <name> <name> " <name> a deep sigh  evidently a sigh of relief  and said nothing ; but his eyes lost something of their wildness , his countenance cleared visibly , and its drawn look relaxed a little .
we all went to our cabin , and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for , and while they were about it <unk> and i <unk> him from hat to <unk> with new clothes of ours , and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him .
" old " is the right word , and a pity , too ; old by the droop of him , and the frost upon his hair , and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face ; though he is only in his prime in the matter of years .
while he ate , we smoked and chatted ; and when he was finishing he found his voice at last , and of his own accord broke out with his personal history .
i can not furnish his exact words , but i <name> come as near it as i can .
the " wrong man 's " story it happened like this : i was in <name> .
i had been there many years ; sometimes i remember how many , sometimes i do n't  but it is n't any matter .
all of a sudden i got a notice to leave , or i would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long before  years and years before  in the east .
i knew about that crime , but i was not the criminal ; it was a cousin of mine of the same name .
what should i better do ?
my head was all disordered by fear , and i did n't know .
i was allowed very little time  only one day , i think it was .
i would be ruined if i was published , and the people would lynch me , and not believe what i said .
it is always the way with <unk> : when they find out it is a mistake they are sorry , but it is too late  the same as it was with mr. holmes , you see .
so i said i would sell out and get money to live on , and run away until it blew over and i could come back with my proofs .
then i escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains somewhere , and lived disguised and had a false name .
i got more and more troubled and worried , and my troubles made me see spirits and hear voices , and i could not think straight and clear on any subject , but got confused and involved and had to give it up , because my head hurt so .
it got to be worse and worse ; more spirits and more voices .
they were about me all the time ; at first only in the night , then in the day too .
they were always whispering around my bed and plotting against me , and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out , because i got no good rest .
and then came the worst .
one night the whispers said , " we 'll never manage , because we ca n't see him , and so ca n't point him out to the people . "
they sighed ; then one said : " we must bring sherlock holmes .
he can be here in twelve days . "
they all agreed , and whispered and <unk> with <name> .
but my heart broke ; for i had read about that man , and knew what it would be to have him upon my track , with his superhuman penetration and tireless energies .
the spirits went away to fetch him , and i got up at once in the middle of the night and fled away , carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it  thirty thousand dollars ; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet .
it was forty days before that man caught up on my track .
i just escaped .
from habit he had written his real name on a tavern register , but had scratched it out and written " <unk> barclay " in the place of it .
but fear gives you a watchful eye and keen , and i read the true name through the scratches , and fled like a deer .
he has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half  the pacific states , australasia , <name>  everywhere you can think of ; then back to mexico and up to california again , giving me hardly any rest ; but that name on the <unk> always saved me , and what is left of me is alive yet .
and i am so tired !
a cruel time he has given me , yet i give you my honor i have never harmed him nor any man .
that was the end of the story , and it stirred those boys to <unk> , be sure of it .
as for me  each word burnt a hole in me where it struck .
we voted that the old man should bunk with us , and be my guest and <unk> 's .
i shall keep my own counsel , naturally ; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished , i shall take him to <name> and <unk> his fortunes .
the boys gave the old fellow the <unk> good-fellowship handshake of the mines , and then scattered away to spread the news .
at <name> next morning <unk> ferguson and ham sandwich called us softly out , and said , privately , " that news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around , and the camps are up .
they are piling in from everywhere , and are going to lynch the <unk> .
constable <name> is in a dead funk , and has telephoned the sheriff .
come along ! "
we started on a run .
the others were privileged to feel as they chose , but in my heart 's privacy i hoped the sheriff would arrive in time ; for i had small <name> that sherlock holmes should <name> for my deeds , as you can easily believe .
i had heard a good deal about the sheriff , but for <unk> 's sake i asked , " can he stop a mob ? "
" can he stop a mob !
can <name> <unk> stop a mob !
well , i should smile !
<unk>  nineteen scalps on his string .
can he !
oh , i say ! "
as we tore up the gulch , distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the still air , and grew steadily in strength as we raced along .
roar after roar burst out , stronger and stronger , nearer and nearer ; and at last , when we closed up upon the multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern , the crash of sound was deafening .
some brutal roughs from daly 's gorge had holmes in their grip , and he was the <unk> man there ; a contemptuous smile played about his lips , and if any fear of death was in his british heart , his iron personality was master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear .
" come to a vote , men ! "
this from one of the daly gang , <unk> higgins .
" quick !
is it <name> , or shoot ? "
" neither ! "
shouted one of his comrades .
" he 'll be alive again in a week ; burning 's the only permanency for him . "
the gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a <unk> of approval , and went struggling and surging toward the prisoner , and closed around him , shouting , " fire !
fire 's the ticket ! "
they dragged him to the <unk> , backed him against it , chained him to it , and piled wood and pine cones around him <unk> .
still the strong face did not <unk> , and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips .
" a match !
fetch a match ! "
<unk> struck it , shaded it with his hand , stooped , and held it under a pine cone .
a deep silence fell upon the mob .
the cone caught , a <name> flame flickered about it a moment or two .
i seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs  it grew more distinct  still more and more distinct , more and more definite , but the absorbed crowd did not appear to notice it .
the match went out .
the man struck another , stooped , and again the flame rose ; this time it took hold and began to spread  here and there men turned away their faces .
the executioner stood with the charred match in his fingers , watching his work .
the <unk> turned a projecting crag , and now they came thundering down upon us .
almost the next moment there was a shout  " the sheriff ! "
and straightway he came tearing into the midst , stood his horse almost on his hind feet , and said , " fall back , you <unk> ! "
he was obeyed .
by all but their leader .
he stood his ground , and his hand went to his revolver .
the sheriff covered him promptly , and said , " drop your hand , you <unk> .
kick the fire away .
now <unk> the stranger . "
the <unk> obeyed .
then the sheriff made a speech ; sitting his horse at martial ease , and not warming his words with any touch of fire , but delivering them in a measured and deliberate way , and in a tone which <unk> with their character and made them impressively disrespectful .
" you 're a nice lot  now ai n't you ?
just about eligible to travel with this <unk> here  <unk> higgins  this <unk> sneak that shoots people in the back and calls himself a desperado .
if there 's anything i do particularly despise , it 's a <unk> mob ; i 've never seen one that had a man in it .
it has to tally up a hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor .
it 's made up of cowards , and so is the community that breeds it ; and ninety-nine times out of a hundred the sheriff 's another one . "
he paused  apparently to turn that last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it  then he went on : " the sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the <unk> coward there is .
by the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in <name> last year .
by the way it 's going , pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the <unk>  sheriff complaint . "
that idea pleased him  any one could see it .
" people <name> say , <unk> sick again ? '
'yes ; got the same old thing . '
and next there 'll be a new title .
people wo n't say , <unk> running for sheriff of <unk> county , ' for instance ; they 'll say , <unk> running for coward of <unk> . '
lord , the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob ! "
he turned an eye on the captive , and said , " stranger , who are you , and what have you been doing ? "
" my name is sherlock holmes , and i have not been doing anything . "
it was wonderful , the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff , notwithstanding he must have come posted .
he spoke up with feeling , and said it was a blot on the country that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their fame and their ingenuity , and whose histories of them had won every reader 's heart by the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting , should be visited under the stars and stripes by an outrage like this .
he apologized in the name of the whole nation , and made holmes a most handsome bow , and told constable <name> to see him to his quarters , and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again .
then he turned to the mob and said , " hunt your holes , you scum ! "
which they did ; then he said : " follow me , <unk> ; i 'll take care of your case myself .
no  keep your <unk> ; whenever i see the day that i 'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing , it 'll be time for me to join last year 's hundred and eighty-two " ; and he rode off in a walk , <unk> following .
when we were on our way back to our cabin , toward <unk> , we ran upon the news that fetlock jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone !
nobody is sorry .
let his uncle track him out if he likes ; it is in his line ; the camp is not interested .
v ten days later  " <name> <name> " is all right in body now , and his mind shows improvement too .
i start with him for <name> to-morrow morning .
next night .
brief note , mailed at a <unk>  as we were starting , this morning , <unk> whispered to me : " keep this news from <name> until you think it safe and not likely to disturb his mind and check his improvement : the ancient crime he spoke of was really committed  and by his cousin , as he said .
we buried the real criminal the other day  the <unk> man that has lived in a century  flint buckner .
his real name was <name> fuller ! "
there , mother , by help of me , an <unk> mourner , your husband and my father is in his grave .
let him rest .
a horse 's tale chapter i  soldier boy  privately to himself i am buffalo <name> 's horse .
i have spent my life under his saddle  with him in it , too , and he is good for two hundred pounds , without his clothes ; and there is no telling how much he does weigh when he is out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on .
he is over six feet , is young , has n't an ounce of waste flesh , is straight , graceful , <unk> in his motions , quick as a cat , and has a handsome face , and black hair dangling down on his shoulders , and is beautiful to look at ; and nobody is braver than he is , and nobody is stronger , except myself .
yes , a person that doubts that he is fine to see should see him in his <unk> <unk> , on my back and his rifle peeping above his shoulder , chasing a hostile trail , with me going like the wind and his hair streaming out behind from the shelter of his broad slouch .
yes , he is a sight to look at then  and i 'm part of it myself .
i am his favorite horse , out of dozens .
big as he is , i have carried him <unk> miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout ; and i am good for fifty , day in and day out , and all the time .
i am not large , but i am built on a business basis .
i have carried him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for the army , and there 's not a gorge , nor a pass , nor a valley , nor a fort , nor a trading post , nor a <unk> in the whole sweep of the <name> mountains and the great plains that we do n't know as well as we know the <unk> .
he is chief of scouts to the army of the frontier , and it makes us very important .
in such a position as i hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess an education much above the common to be worthy of the place .
i am the <unk> horse outside of the hippodrome , everybody says , and the <unk> .
it may be so , it is not for me to say ; modesty is the best policy , i think .
buffalo <name> taught me the most of what i know , my mother taught me much , and i taught myself the rest .
lay a row of moccasins before me  pawnee , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , <unk> , and as many other tribes as you please  and i can name the tribe every <unk> belongs to by the make of it .
name it in <unk> , and could do it in american if i had speech .
i know some of the indian signs  the signs they make with their hands , and by <unk> at night and columns of smoke by day .
buffalo <name> taught me how to drag wounded soldiers out of the line of fire with my teeth ; and i 've done it , too ; at least i 've dragged him out of the battle when he was wounded .
and not just once , but twice .
yes , i know a lot of things .
i remember forms , and <unk> , and faces ; and you ca n't disguise a person that 's done me a kindness so that i wo n't know him thereafter wherever i find him .
i know the <name> of searching for a trail , and i know the stale track from the fresh .
i can keep a trail all by myself , with buffalo <name> asleep in the saddle ; ask him  he <name> tell you so .
many a time , when he has ridden all night , he has said to me at <name> , " take the watch , boy ; if the trail <unk> , call me . "
then he goes to sleep .
he knows he can trust me , because i have a reputation .
a scout horse that has a reputation does not play with it .
my mother was all american  no <unk> about her , i can tell you ; she was of the best blood of kentucky , the <unk> <unk> aristocracy , very proud and <unk>  or maybe it is ceremonious .
i do n't know which it is .
but it is no matter ; size is the main thing about a word , and that one 's up to standard .
she spent her military life as colonel of the tenth dragoons , and saw a deal of rough service  distinguished service it was , too .
i mean , she carried the colonel ; but it 's all the same .
where would he be without his horse ?
he would n't arrive .
it takes two to make a colonel of dragoons .
she was a fine <unk> horse , but never got above that .
she was strong enough for the scout service , and had the endurance , too , but she could n't quite come up to the speed required ; a scout horse has to have steel in his muscle and lightning in his blood .
my father was a bronco .
nothing as to lineage  that is , nothing as to recent lineage  but plenty good enough when you go a good way back .
when professor marsh was out here hunting bones for the chapel of yale university he found skeletons of horses no bigger than a fox , bedded in the rocks , and he said they were ancestors of my father .
my mother heard him say it ; and he said those skeletons were two million years old , which astonished her and made her kentucky pretensions look small and pretty <unk> , not to say oblique .
let me see .
.
.
.
i used to know the meaning of those words , but .
.
.
well , it was years ago , and 't is n't as vivid now as it was when they were fresh .
that sort of words does n't keep , in the kind of climate we have out here .
professor marsh said those skeletons were fossils .
so that makes me part blue grass and part fossil ; if there is any older or better stock , you <name> have to look for it among the four hundred , i reckon .
i am satisfied with it .
and am a happy horse , too , though born out of <unk> .
and now we are back at fort paxton once more , after a <unk> scout , away up as far as the big horn .
everything quiet .
crows and <unk> <unk>  as usual  but no <unk> , and settlers feeling fairly easy .
the seventh cavalry still in garrison , here ; also the ninth dragoons , two artillery companies , and some infantry .
all glad to see me , including general <name> , commandant .
the officers ' ladies and children well , and called upon me  with sugar .
colonel drake , seventh cavalry , said some pleasant things ; mrs. drake was very complimentary ; also captain and mrs. marsh , company b , seventh cavalry ; also the chaplain , who is always kind and pleasant to me , because i kicked the lungs out of a trader once .
it was <name> drake and <name> marsh that furnished the sugar  nice children , the nicest at the post , i think .
that poor orphan child is on her way from <name>  everybody is full of the subject .
her father was general <name> 's brother ; married a beautiful young spanish <name> ten years ago , and has never been in <name> since .
they lived in spain a year or two , then went to <name> .
both died some months ago .
this little girl that is coming is the only child .
general <name> is glad to have her .
he has never seen her .
he is a very nice old bachelor , but is an old bachelor just the same and is n't more than about a year this side of retirement by age limit ; and so what does he know about taking care of a little maid nine years old ?
if i could have her it would be another matter , for i know all about children , and they adore me .
buffalo <name> <name> tell you so himself .
i have some of this news from <unk> the <unk> , the rest of it i got from potter , the general 's dog .
potter is the great <name> .
he is privileged , all over the post , like shekels , the seventh cavalry 's dog , and visits everybody 's quarters and picks up everything that is going , in the way of news .
potter has no imagination , and no great deal of culture , perhaps , but he has a historical mind and a good memory , and so he is the person i depend upon mainly to post me up when i get back from a scout .
that is , if shekels is out on <unk> and i ca n't get hold of him .
chapter ii  letter from rouen  to general <name> my dear brother-in-law ,  please let me write again in spanish , i can not trust my english , and i am aware , from what your brother used to say , that army officers educated at the military academy of the united states are taught our tongue .
it is as i told you in my other letter : both my poor sister and her husband , when they found they could not recover , expressed the wish that you should have their little <name>  as knowing that you would presently be retired from the army  rather than that she should remain with me , who am broken in health , or go to your mother in california , whose health is also frail .
you do not know the child , therefore i must tell you something about her .
you <name> not be ashamed of her looks , for she is a copy in little of her beautiful mother  and it is that <unk> beauty which is not <unk> , even in your country .
she has her mother 's charm and <name> and good heart and sense of justice , and she has her father 's vivacity and cheerfulness and pluck and spirit of enterprise , with the affectionate disposition and sincerity of both parents .
my sister pined for her spanish home all these years of exile ; she was always talking of spain to the child , and tending and nourishing the love of spain in the little thing 's heart as a precious flower ; and she died happy in the knowledge that the <unk> of her patriotic labors was as <name> as even she could <name> .
<name> is a sufficiently good little scholar , for her nine years ; her mother taught her spanish herself , and kept it always fresh upon her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with her in any other tongue ; her father was her english teacher , and talked with her in that language almost exclusively ; french has been her everyday speech for more than seven years among her playmates here ; she has a good working use of governess  <name> and italian .
it is true that there is always a faint foreign fragrance about her speech , no matter what language she is talking , but it is only just noticeable , nothing more , and is rather a charm than a mar , i think .
in the ordinary <unk> <name> is neither before nor behind the average child of nine , i should say .
but i can say this for her : in love for her friends and in <unk> and good <unk> she has not many equals , and in my opinion no superiors .
and i beg of you , let her have her way with the dumb animals  they are her worship .
it is an inheritance from her mother .
she knows but little of cruelties and oppressions  keep them from her sight if you can .
she would flare up at them and make trouble , in her small but quite decided and resolute way ; for she has a character of her own , and lacks neither promptness nor initiative .
sometimes her judgment is at fault , but i think her intentions are always right .
once when she was a little creature of three or four years she suddenly brought her <name> foot down upon the floor in an apparent outbreak of indignation , then fetched it a backward wipe , and stooped down to examine the result .
her mother said : " why , what is it , child ?
what has stirred you so ? "
" mamma , the big ant was trying to kill the little one . "
" and so you protected the little one . "
" yes , manure , because he had no friend , and i would n't let the big one kill him . "
" but you have killed them both . "
<name> was distressed , and her lip trembled .
she picked up the remains and laid them upon her palm , and said : " poor little <unk> , i 'm so sorry ; and i did n't mean to kill you , but there was n't any other way to save you , it was such a hurry . "
she is a dear and sweet little <name> , and when she goes it <name> give me a sore heart .
but she <name> be happy with you , and if your heart is old and tired , give it into her keeping ; she <name> make it young again , she <name> refresh it , she <name> make it sing .
be good to her , for all our sakes !
my exile <name> soon be over now .
as soon as i am a little stronger i shall see my spain again ; and that <name> make me young again !
<name> .
chapter iii  general <name> to his mother i am glad to know that you are all well , in san <unk> .
.
.
.
that grandchild of yours has been here  well , i do not quite know how many days it is ; nobody can keep account of days or anything else where she is !
mother , she did what the indians were never able to do .
she took the fort  took it the first day !
took me , too ; took the colonels , the captains , the women , the children , and the dumb brutes ; took buffalo <name> , and all his scouts ; took the garrison  to the last man ; and in forty-eight hours the indian encampment was hers , illustrious old <unk> and all .
do i seem to have lost my solemnity , my gravity , my poise , my dignity ?
you would lose your own , in my circumstances .
mother , you never saw such a winning little devil .
she is all energy , and spirit , and <name> , and interest in everybody and everything , and pours out her prodigal love upon every creature that <name> take it , high or low , <name> or pagan , feathered or <unk> ; and none has declined it to date , and none ever <name> , i think .
but she has a temper , and sometimes it catches fire and flames up , and is likely to burn whatever is near it ; but it is soon over , the passion goes as quickly as it comes .
of course she has an indian name already ; indians always <unk> a stranger early .
<unk> attended to her case .
he gave her the indian equivalent for <unk> , or <unk> .
he said : " <unk> , ver ' quiet , ver ' soft , like summer night , but when she mad she blaze . "
is n't it good ?
ca n't you see the flare ?
she 's beautiful , mother , beautiful as a picture ; and there is a touch of you in her face , and of her father  poor <name> !
and in her <unk> activities , and her fearless ways , and her <unk> and <unk> , she is always bringing <name> back to me .
these impulsive natures are dramatic .
<name> was dramatic , so is this <unk> , so is buffalo <name> .
when <name> first arrived  it was in the forenoon  buffalo <name> was away , carrying orders to <name> fuller , at five forks , up in the <name> hills .
at <unk> i was at my desk , trying to work , and this sprite had been making it impossible for half an hour .
at last i said : " oh , you bewitching little scamp , ca n't you be quiet just a minute or two , and let your poor old uncle attend to a part of his duties ? "
" i 'll try , uncle ; i <name> , indeed , " she said .
" well , then , that 's a good child  kiss me .
now , then , sit up in that chair , and set your eye on that clock .
there  that 's right .
if you stir  if you so much as wink  for four whole minutes , i'll bite you ! "
it was very sweet and humble and obedient she looked , sitting there , still as a mouse ; i could hardly keep from setting her free and telling her to make as much racket as she wanted to .
during as much as two minutes there was a most unnatural and heavenly quiet and repose , then buffalo <name> came thundering up to the door in all his scout finery , flung himself out of the saddle , said to his horse , " wait for me , boy , " and stepped in , and stopped dead in his tracks  gazing at the child .
she forgot orders , and was on the floor in a moment , saying : " oh , you are so beautiful !
do you like me ? "
" no , i do n't , i love you ! "
and he gathered her up with a hug , and then set her on his shoulder  apparently nine feet from the floor .
she was at home .
she played with his long hair , and admired his big hands and his clothes and his carbine , and asked question after question , as fast as he could answer , until i excused them both for half an hour , in order to have a chance to finish my work .
then i heard <name> exclaiming over soldier boy ; and he was worthy of her <unk> , for he is a wonder of a horse , and has a reputation which is as shining as his own silken hide .
chapter iv  <name> to her aunt <name> oh , it is wonderful here , aunty dear , just paradise !
oh , if you could only see it !
everything so wild and lovely ; such grand plains , stretching such miles and miles and miles , all the most delicious velvety sand and sage-brush , and rabbits as big as a dog , and such tall and <name> <unk> ears that that is what they name them by ; and such vast mountains , and so rugged and <unk> and lofty , with <unk> wrapped around their shoulders , and looking so solemn and awful and satisfied ; and the charming indians , oh , how you would <unk> on them , aunty dear , and they would on you , too , and they would let you hold their babies , the way they do me , and they are the <unk> , and <unk> , and sweetest little things , and never cry , and would n't if they had pins sticking in them , which they have n't , because they are poor and ca n't afford it ; and the horses and mules and cattle and dogs  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds , and not an animal that you ca n't do what you please with , except uncle <name> , but i do n't mind him , he's lovely ; and oh , if you could hear the bugles : too  too  <unk>  too  too , and so on  perfectly beautiful !
do you recognize that one ?
it 's the first <unk> of the <unk> ; it goes , dear me , so early in the morning !  then i and every other soldier on the whole place are up and out in a minute , except uncle <name> , who is most unaccountably lazy , i do n't know why , but i have talked to him about it , and i reckon it <name> be better , now .
he has n't any faults much , and is charming and sweet , like buffalo <name> , and <unk> , and mammy <name> , and soldier boy , and shekels , and potter , and <unk> , and  well , they 're all that , just angels , as you may say .
the very first day i came , i do n't know how long ago it was , buffalo <name> took me on soldier boy to <unk> 's camp , not the big one which is out on the plain , which is white cloud 's , he took me to that one next day , but this one is four or five miles up in the hills and crags , where there is a great <unk> meadow , full of indian lodges and dogs and squaws and everything that is interesting , and a <name> of the clearest water running through it , with white pebbles on the bottom and trees all along the banks cool and shady and good to <name> in , and as the sun goes down it is <unk> in there , but away up against the sky you see the big peaks towering up and shining bright and vivid in the sun , and sometimes an eagle sailing by them , not flapping a wing , the same as if he was asleep ; and young indians and girls romping and laughing and carrying on , around the spring and the pool , and not much clothes on except the girls , and dogs fighting , and the squaws busy at work , and the bucks busy resting , and the old men sitting in a bunch smoking , and passing the pipe not to the left but to the right , which means there 's been a row in the camp and they are settling it if they can , and children playing just the same as any other children , and little boys shooting at a <name> with bows , and i cuffed one of them because he hit a dog with a club that wasn't doing anything , and he resented it but before long he wished he had n't : but this sentence is getting too long and i <name> start another .
<unk> put on his <unk> war outfit to let me see him , and he was splendid to look at , with his face painted red and bright and intense like a <unk> and a <unk> of eagle feathers from the top of his head all down his back , and he had his tomahawk , too , and his pipe , which has a stem which is longer than my arm , and i never had such a good time in an indian camp in my life , and i learned a lot of words of the language , and next day bb took me to the camp out on the plains , four miles , and i had another good time and got acquainted with some more indians and dogs ; and the big chief , by the name of white cloud , gave me a pretty little bow and arrows and i gave him my red <unk> , and in four days i could shoot very well with it and beat any white boy of my size at the post ; and i have been to those camps plenty of times since ; and i have learned to ride , too , bb taught me , and every day he <unk> me and praises me , and every time i do better than ever he lets me have a scamper on soldier boy , and that 's the last agony of pleasure !
for he is the <unk> horse , and so beautiful and shiny and black , and has n't another color on him anywhere , except a white <name> in his forehead , not just an imitation <name> , but a real one , with four points , shaped exactly like a <name> that 's <unk> , and if you should cover him all up but his <name> you would know him anywhere , even in jerusalem or australia , by that .
and i got acquainted with a good many of the seventh cavalry , and the dragoons , and officers , and families , and horses , in the first few days , and some more in the next few and the next few and the next few , and now i know more soldiers and horses than you can think , no matter how hard you try .
i am keeping up my studies every now and then , but there is n't much time for it .
i love you so !
and i send you a hug and a kiss .
<name> .
<unk>  i belong to the seventh cavalry and ninth dragoons , i am an officer , too , and do not have to work on account of not getting any wages .
chapter v  general <name> to <name> she has been with us a good nice long time , now .
you are troubled about your sprite because this is such a wild frontier , hundreds of miles from civilization , and peopled only by wandering tribes of savages ?
you fear for her safety ?
give yourself no uneasiness about her .
dear me , she 's in a nursery !
and she 's got more than eighteen hundred nurses .
it would distress the garrison to suspect that you think they ca n't take care of her .
they think they can .
they would tell you so themselves .
you see , the seventh cavalry has never had a child of its very own before , and neither has the ninth dragoons ; and so they are like all new mothers , they think there is no other child like theirs , no other child so wonderful , none that is so worthy to be faithfully and tenderly looked after and protected .
these bronzed veterans of mine are very good mothers , i think , and wiser than some other mothers ; for they let her take lots of risks , and it is a good education for her ; and the more risks she takes and comes successfully out of , the prouder they are of her .
they adopted her , with grave and formal military ceremonies of their own invention  solemnities is the truer word ; solemnities that were so profoundly solemn and <name> , that the spectacle would have been comical if it had n't been so touching .
it was a good show , and as stately and complex as <unk> and the trooping of the colors ; and it had its own special music , composed for the occasion by the bandmaster of the seventh ; and the child was as serious as the most serious <unk> soldier of them all ; and finally when they throned her upon the shoulder of the oldest veteran , and pronounced her " well and truly adopted , " and the bands struck up and all saluted and she saluted in return , it was better and more moving than any kindred thing i have seen on the stage , because stage things are make-believe , but this was real and the players ' hearts were in it .
it happened several weeks ago , and was followed by some additional solemnities .
the men created a couple of new ranks , <unk> unknown to the army regulations , and conferred them upon <name> , with ceremonies suitable to a duke .
so now she is <unk> of the seventh cavalry , and <unk> of the ninth dragoons , with the privilege ( decreed by the men ) of writing <unk> after her name !
also , they presented her a pair of <unk>  both dark blue , the one with f. l. on it , the other with c. g. also , a sword .
she wears them .
finally , they granted her the salute .
i am witness that that ceremony is faithfully observed by both parties  and most gravely and <unk> , too .
i have never seen a soldier smile yet , while delivering it , nor <name> in returning it .
ostensibly i was not present at these proceedings , and am ignorant of them ; but i was where i could see .
i was afraid of one thing  the jealousy of the other children of the post ; but there is nothing of that , i am glad to say .
on the contrary , they are proud of their comrade and her honors .
it is a surprising thing , but it is true .
the children are devoted to <name> , for she has turned their dull frontier life into a sort of continuous festival ; also they know her for a stanch and steady friend , a friend who can always be depended upon , and does not change with the weather .
she has become a rather extraordinary rider , under the <unk> of a more than extraordinary teacher  bb , which is her pet name for buffalo <name> .
she <unk> it <unk> .
he has not only taught her seventeen ways of breaking her neck , but twenty-two ways of avoiding it .
he has infused into her the best and surest protection of a horseman  confidence .
he did it gradually , systematically , little by little , a step at a time , and each step made sure before the next was essayed .
and so he <unk> her along up through terrors that had been <unk> by training before she reached them , and therefore were not recognizable as terrors when she got to them .
well , she is a daring little rider , now , and is perfect in what she knows of horsemanship .
by-and-by she <name> know the <name> like a west point cadet , and <name> exercise it as fearlessly .
she does n't know anything about <unk> .
does that distress you ?
and she is a fine performer , without any saddle at all .
does that discomfort you ?
do not let it ; she is not in any danger , i give you my word .
you said that if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it , and you said truly .
i do not know how i got along without her , before .
i was a forlorn old tree , but now that this <unk> vine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life , it is very different .
as a <unk> of business for me and for mammy <name> she is <unk> competent , but i like my share of it and of course <name> likes hers , for <name> " raised " <name> , and <name> is <name> over again in so many ways that she brings back <name> 's youth and the joys of that <unk> time .
my father tried to set <name> free twenty years ago , when we still lived in <name> , but without success ; she considered herself a member of the family , and would n't go .
and so , a member of the family she remained , and has held that position unchallenged ever since , and holds it now ; for when my mother sent her here from san <unk> when we learned that <name> was coming , she only changed from one division of the family to the other .
she has the warm heart of her race , and its lavish affections , and when <name> arrived the pair were mother and child in five minutes , and that is what they are to date and <name> continue .
<name> really thinks she raised <name> , and that is one of her <unk> , but perhaps it was a mutual raising , for their ages were the same  thirteen years short of mine .
but they were playmates , at any rate ; as regards that , there is no room for dispute .
<name> thinks <name> is the best catholic in <name> except herself .
she could not pay any one a higher compliment than that , and <name> could not receive one that would please her better .
<name> is satisfied that there has never been a more wonderful child than <name> .
she has conceived the curious idea that <name> is twins , and that one of them is a <unk> and failed to get <unk>  got submerged , is the idea .
to argue with her that this is nonsense is a waste of breath  her mind is made up , and arguments do not affect it .
she says : " look at her ; she loves dolls , and <unk> , and everything a girl loves , and she 's gentle and sweet , and ai n't cruel to dumb brutes  now that 's the <unk> , but she loves <unk> , and drums and fifes and soldiering , and <unk> , and ai n't afraid of anybody or anything  and that 's the <unk> ; 'deed you <unk> tell me she 's only one child ; no , sir , she 's twins , and one of them got shet up out of sight .
out of sight , but that do n't make any difference , that boy is in there , and you can see him look out of her eyes when her temper is up . "
then <name> went on , in her simple and <name> way , to furnish illustrations .
" look at that <name> , marse <name> .
would anybody befriend a <name> but that child ?
of course they would n't ; it ai n't natural .
well , the injun boy had the <name> tied up , and was all the time <unk> it and starving it , and she pitied the po ' thing , and tried to buy it from the boy , and the tears was in her eyes .
that was the girl twin , you see .
she offered him her thimble , and he flung it down ; she offered him all the doughnuts she had , which was two , and he flung them down ; she offered him half a paper of pins , worth forty ravens , and he made a mouth at her and <unk> one of them in the <name> 's back .
that was the limit , you know .
it called for the other twin .
her eyes blazed up , and she jumped for him like a <unk> , and when she was done with him she was rags and he wasn't anything but an allegory .
that was most undoubtedly the other twin , you see , coming to the front .
no , sir ; do n't tell me he ai n't in there .
i 've seen him with my own eyes  and plenty of times , at that . "
" allegory ?
what is an allegory ? "
" i do n't know , marse <name> , it 's one of her words ; she loves the big ones , you know , and i pick them up from her ; they sound good and i ca n't help it . "
" what happened after she had converted the boy into an allegory ? "
" why , she untied the <name> and confiscated him by force and fetched him home , and left the doughnuts and things on the ground .
petted him , of course , like she does with every creature .
in two days she had him so stuck after her that she  well , you know how he follows her everywhere , and sets on her shoulder often when she rides her breakneck <unk>  all of which is the <unk> to the front , you see  and he does what he pleases , and is up to all kinds of <unk> , and is a perfect nuisance in the kitchen .
well , they all stand it , but they would n't if it was another person 's bird . "
here she began to chuckle comfortably , and presently she said : " well , you know , she 's a nuisance herself , miss <name> is , she is so busy , and into everything , like that bird .
it 's all just as innocent , you know , and she do n't mean any harm , and is so good and dear ; and it ai n't her fault , it 's her nature ; her interest is always <unk> and always red-hot , and she ca n't keep quiet .
well , yesterday it was 'please , miss <name> , do n't do that ' ; and , 'please , miss <name> , let that alone ' ; and , 'please , miss <name> , do n't make so much noise ' ; and so on and so on , till i reckon i had found fault fourteen times in fifteen minutes ; then she looked up at me with her big brown eyes that can plead so , and said in that odd little foreign way that goes to your heart , " 'please , mammy , make me a compliment . "
" and of course you did it , you old fool ? "
" marse <name> , i just grabbed her up to my breast and says , 'oh , you po ' dear little <unk> thing , you ai n't got a fault in the world , and you can do anything you want to , and tear the house down , and yo ' old black mammy wo n't say a word ! ' "
" why , of course , of course  i knew you 'd spoil the child . "
she brushed away her tears , and said with dignity : " spoil the child ?
spoil that child , marse <name> ?
there ca n't anybody spoil her .
she 's the king <name> of this post , and everybody pets her and is her slave , and yet , as you know , your own self , she ain't the least little bit spoiled . "
then she eased her mind with this retort : " marse <name> , she makes you do anything she wants to , and you ca n't deny it ; so if she could be spoilt , she 'd been spoilt long ago , because you are the very worst !
look at that pile of cats in your chair , and you sitting on a <unk> , just as patient ; it 's because they 're her cats . "
if <name> were a soldier , i could punish her for such large frankness as that .
i changed the subject , and made her resume her illustrations .
she had scored against me fairly , and i wasn't going to <unk> her victory by disputing it .
she proceeded to offer this incident in evidence on her twin theory : " two weeks ago when she got her finger mashed open , she turned pretty pale with the pain , but she never said a word .
i took her in my lap , and the surgeon <unk> off the blood and took a needle and thread and began to sew it up ; it had to have a lot of <unk> , and each one made her <unk> a little , but she never let go a sound .
at last the surgeon was so full of admiration that he said , 'well , you are a brave little thing ! '
and she said , just as ca 'm and simple as if she was talking about the weather , 'there is n't anybody braver but the cid ! '
you see ?
it was the <unk> that the surgeon was <unk> with .
" who is the cid ? "
" i do n't know , sir  at least only what she says .
she 's always talking about him , and says he was the bravest hero spain ever had , or any other country .
they have it up and down , the children do , she standing up for the cid , and they working <name> washington for all he is worth . "
" do they quarrel ? "
" no ; it 's only disputing , and bragging , the way children do .
they want her to be an american , but she ca n't be anything but a spaniard , she says .
you see , her mother was always longing for home , po ' thing !
and thinking about it , and so the child is just as much a spaniard as if she 'd always lived there .
she thinks she remembers how spain looked , but i reckon she do n't , because she was only a baby when they moved to <name> .
she is very proud to be a spaniard . "
does that please you , <name> ?
very well , be content ; your niece is loyal to her allegiance : her mother laid deep the foundations of her love for spain , and she <name> go back to you as good a spaniard as you are yourself .
she has made me promise to take her to you for a long visit when the war office retires me .
i attend to her studies myself ; has she told you that ?
yes , i am her <unk> , and she makes pretty good progress , i think , everything considered .
everything considered  being translated  means holidays .
but the fact is , she was not born for study , and it comes hard .
hard for me , too ; it hurts me like a physical pain to see that free spirit of the air and the <name> laboring and grieving over a book ; and sometimes when i find her gazing far away towards the plain and the blue mountains with the longing in her eyes , i have to throw open the prison doors ; i ca n't help it .
a quaint little scholar she is , and makes plenty of blunders .
once i put the question : " what does the czar govern ? "
she rested her elbow on her knee and her <name> on her hand and took that problem under deep consideration .
presently she looked up and answered , with a rising inflection implying a shade of uncertainty , " the <unk> case ? "
here are a couple of her <unk> which were delivered with tranquil confidence : " chaplain , diminutive of chap .
lass is masculine , <unk> is feminine . "
she is not a genius , you see , but just a normal child ; they all make mistakes of that sort .
there is a glad light in her eye which is pretty to see when she finds herself able to answer a question promptly and accurately , without any hesitation ; as , for instance , this morning : " <name> dear , what is a cube ? "
" why , a native of cuba . "
she still drops a foreign word into her talk now and then , and there is still a subtle foreign flavor or fragrance about even her <unk> english  and long may this abide !
for it has for me a charm that is very pleasant .
sometimes her english is daintily prim and <unk> and <unk> .
she has a child 's sweet tooth , but for her health 's sake i try to keep its inspirations under cheek .
she is obedient  as is proper for a titled and recognized military personage , which she is  but the chain presses sometimes .
for instance , we were out for a walk , and passed by some bushes that were freighted with wild <unk> .
her face brightened and she put her hands together and delivered herself of this speech , most feelingly : " oh , if i was permitted a vice it would be the <unk> ! "
could i resist that ?
no .
i gave her a gooseberry .
you ask about her languages .
they take care of themselves ; they <name> not get <name> here ; our regiments are not made up of natives alone  far from it .
and she is picking up indian tongues diligently .
chapter <name>  soldier boy and the mexican plug " when did you come ? "
" arrived at sundown . "
" where from ? "
" salt lake . "
" are you in the service ? "
" no .
trade . "
" pirate trade , i reckon . "
" what do you know about it ? "
" i saw you when you came .
i recognized your master .
he is a bad sort .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>  <name> <unk> i know him very well .
stole you , did n't he ? "
" well , it amounted to that . "
" i thought so .
where is his pard ? "
" he stopped at white cloud 's camp . "
" he is another of the same stripe , is <name> <unk> . "
( aside . )
they are laying for buffalo <name> again , i guess .
( aloud . )
" what is your name ? "
" which one ? "
" have you got more than one ? "
" i get a new one every time i 'm stolen .
i used to have an honest name , but that was early ; i 've forgotten it .
since then i 've had thirteen <unk> . "
" <unk> ?
what is alias ? "
" a false name . "
" alias .
it 's a fine large word , and is in my line ; it has quite a learned and <unk> incandescent sound .
are you educated ? "
" well , no , i ca n't claim it .
i can take down bars , i can distinguish oats from <unk> , i can <unk> a <unk> with the <unk> , and i know a few other things  not many ; i have had no chance , i have always had to work ; besides , i am of low birth and no family .
you speak my dialect like a native , but you are not a mexican plug , you are a gentleman , i can see that ; and educated , of course . "
" yes , i am of old family , and not illiterate .
i am a fossil . "
" a which ? "
" fossil .
the first horses were fossils .
they date back two million years . "
" <unk> sand and sage-brush !
do you mean it ? "
" yes , it is true .
the bones of my ancestors are held in reverence and worship , even by men .
they do not leave them exposed to the weather when they find them , but <name> them three thousand miles and <unk> them in their temples of learning , and worship them . "
" it is wonderful !
i knew you must be a person of distinction , by your fine presence and courtly address , and by the fact that you are not subjected to the indignity of <unk> , like myself and the rest .
would you tell me your name ? "
" you have probably heard of it  soldier boy . "
" what !  the renowned , the illustrious ? "
" even so . "
" it takes my breath !
little did i dream that ever i should stand face to face with the possessor of that great name .
buffalo <unk> horse !
known from the canadian border to the deserts of arizona , and from the eastern marches of the great plains to the <unk> of the <name> !
truly this is a memorable day .
you still serve the celebrated chief of scouts ? "
" i am still his property , but he has lent me , for a time , to the most <name> , the most gracious , the most excellent , her excellency <name> , <unk> seventh cavalry and <unk> ninth dragoons , <unk> ,  on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
did you say her excellency ? "
" the same .
a spanish <name> , sweet <name> of a ducal house .
and truly a wonder ; knowing everything , capable of everything ; speaking all the languages , master of all sciences , a mind without horizons , a heart of gold , the <name> of her race !
on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
it is marvellous ! "
" verily .
i knew many things , she has taught me others .
i am educated .
i <name> tell you about her . "
" i listen  i am enchanted . "
" i <name> tell a plain tale , calmly , without excitement , without eloquence .
when she had been here four or five weeks she was already <unk> in military things , and they made her an officer  a double officer .
she rode the drill every day , like any soldier ; and she could take the bugle and direct the evolutions herself .
then , on a day , there was a grand race , for prizes  none to enter but the children .
seventeen children entered , and she was the youngest .
three girls , fourteen boys  good riders all .
it was a <unk> , with four <unk> , all pretty high .
the first prize was a most cunning half-grown silver bugle , and mighty pretty , with red silk cord and tassels .
buffalo <name> was very anxious ; for he had taught her to ride , and he did most dearly want her to win that race , for the <name> of it .
so he wanted her to ride me , but she would n't ; and she reproached him , and said it was unfair and <unk> , and taking advantage ; for what horse in this post or any other could stand a chance against me ?
and she was very severe with him , and said , 'you ought to be ashamed  you are proposing to me conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman . '
so he just tossed her up in the air about thirty feet and caught her as she came down , and said he was ashamed ; and put up his handkerchief and pretended to cry , which nearly broke her heart , and she petted him , and begged him to forgive her , and said she would do anything in the world he could ask but that ; but he said he ought to go <name> himself , and he must , if he could get a rope ; it was nothing but right he should , for he never , never could forgive himself ; and then she began to cry , and they both sobbed , the way you could hear him a mile , and she clinging around his neck and pleading , till at last he was comforted a little , and gave his solemn promise he would n't <name> himself till after the race ; and would n't do it at all if she won it , which made her happy , and she said she would win it or die in the saddle ; so then everything was pleasant again and both of them content .
he ca n't help playing jokes on her , he is so fond of her and she is so innocent and unsuspecting ; and when she finds it out she cuffs him and is in a fury , but presently <unk> him because it 's him ; and maybe the very next day she 's caught with another joke ; you see she ca n't learn any better , because she has n't any deceit in her , and that kind are n't ever expecting it in another person .
" it was a grand race .
the whole post was there , and there was such another whooping and shouting when the seventeen kids came flying down the turf and sailing over the <unk>  oh , beautiful to see !
half-way down , it was kind of neck and neck , and anybody 's race and nobody 's .
then , what should happen but a cow steps out and puts her head down to <unk> grass , with her broadside to the battalion , and they a-coming like the wind ; they split apart to flank her , but she ?  why , she drove the spurs home and soared over that cow like a bird !
and on she went , and cleared the last <unk> solitary and alone , the army letting loose the grand yell , and she skipped from the horse the same as if he had been standing still , and made her bow , and everybody crowded around to congratulate , and they gave her the bugle , and she put it to her lips and blew <unk> and saddles ' to see how it would go , and bb was as proud as you can't think !
and he said , 'take soldier boy , and do n't pass him back till i ask for him ! '
and i can tell you he would n't have said that to any other person on this planet .
that was two months and more ago , and nobody has been on my back since but the <unk> seventh cavalry and <unk> of the ninth dragoons , <unk> ,  on whom be peace ! "
" amen .
i listen  tell me more . "
" she set to work and organized the sixteen , and called it the first battalion <name> mountain rangers , <unk> , and she wanted to be bugler , but they elected her lieutenant-general and bugler .
so she ranks her uncle the commandant , who is only a brigadier .
and does n't she train those little people !
ask the indians , ask the traders , ask the soldiers ; they 'll tell you .
she has been at it from the first day .
every morning they go clattering down into the plain , and there she sits on my back with her bugle at her mouth and sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions for an hour or more ; and it is too beautiful for anything to see those ponies dissolve from one formation into another , and waltz about , and break , and scatter , and form again , always moving , always graceful , now trotting , now galloping , and so on , sometimes near by , sometimes in the distance , all just like a state ball , you know , and sometimes she ca n't hold herself any longer , but sounds the <unk> , ' and turns me loose !
and you can take my word for it , if the battalion has n't too much of a start we catch up and go over the <unk> with the front line .
" yes , they are soldiers , those little people ; and healthy , too , not <unk> any more , the way they used to be sometimes .
it 's because of her drill .
she 's got a fort , now  fort <name> marsh .
<name> general <name> drake planned it out , and the seventh and dragoons built it .
<name> is the colonel 's son , and is fifteen and the oldest in the battalion ; <name> marsh is <unk> , and is next oldest  over thirteen .
she is daughter of captain marsh , company b , seventh cavalry .
lieutenant-general <name> is the youngest by considerable ; i think she is about nine and a half or three-quarters .
her military rig , as lieutenant-general , is n't for business , it 's for dress parade , because the ladies made it .
they say they got it out of the middle ages  out of a book  and it is all red and blue and white silks and <unk> and <unk> ; tights , trunks , sword , doublet with slashed sleeves , short cape , cap with just one feather in it ; i 've heard them name these things ; they got them out of the book ; she 's dressed like a <name> , of old times , they say .
it 's the daintiest outfit that ever was  you <name> say so , when you see it .
she 's lovely in it  oh , just a dream !
in some ways she is just her age , but in others she 's as old as her uncle , i think .
she is very learned .
she teaches her uncle his book .
i have seen her sitting by with the book and reciting to him what is in it , so that he can learn to do it himself .
" every saturday she <unk> little injuns to garrison her fort ; then she lays siege to it , and makes military approaches by make-believe trenches in make-believe night , and finally at make-believe <name> she draws her sword and sounds the assault and takes it by storm .
it is for practice .
and she has invented a <unk> all by herself , out of her own head , and it 's a stirring one , and the prettiest in the service .
it 's to call me  it 's never used for anything else .
she taught it to me , and told me what it says : 'it is i , soldier  come ! '
and when those thrilling notes come floating down the distance i hear them without fail , even if i am two miles away ; and then  oh , then you should see my heels get down to business !
" and she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night to her , which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake ; and also how to say good-bye ; i do that with my left foot  but only for practice , because there has n't been any but make-believe good <unk> yet , and i <name> there wo n't ever be .
it would make me cry if i ever had to put up my left foot in <name> .
she has taught me how to salute , and i can do it as well as a soldier .
i bow my head low , and lay my right hoof against my cheek .
she taught me that because i got into disgrace once , through ignorance .
i am privileged , because i am known to be honorable and trustworthy , and because i have a distinguished record in the service ; so they don't hobble me nor tie me to stakes or shut me tight in stables , but let me wander around to suit myself .
well , trooping the colors is a very solemn ceremony , and everybody must stand uncovered when the flag goes by , the commandant and all ; and once i was there , and <unk> walked across right in front of the band , which was an awful disgrace : ah , the lieutenant-general was so ashamed , and so distressed that i should have done such a thing before all the world , that she could n't keep the tears back ; and then she taught me the salute , so that if i ever did any other <unk> act through ignorance i could do my salute and she believed everybody would think it was apology enough and would not press the matter .
it is very nice and distinguished ; no other horse can do it ; often the men salute me , and i return it .
i am privileged to be present when the <name> mountain rangers troop the colors and i stand solemn , like the children , and i salute when the flag goes by .
of course when she goes to her fort her sentries sing out <unk> out the guard ! '
and then .
.
.
do you catch that refreshing early morning whiff from the <unk> and the wild flowers ?
the night is far spent ; we 'll hear the bugles before long .
<name> , the black woman , is very good and nice ; she takes care of the lieutenant-general , and is <unk> <name> 's mother , which makes her mother-in-law to the lieutenant-general .
that is what shekels says .
at least it is what i think he says , though i never can understand him quite clearly .
he  " " who is shekels ? "
" the seventh cavalry dog .
i mean , if he is a dog .
his father was a <unk> and his mother was a <unk> .
it does n't really make a dog out of him , does it ? "
" not a real dog , i should think .
only a kind of a general dog , at most , i reckon .
though this is a matter of <unk> , i suppose ; and if it is , it is out of my depth , and so my opinion is not valuable , and i do n't claim much consideration for it . "
" it is n't <unk> ; it is <unk> , which is still more difficult and tangled up .
<unk> always are . "
" <unk> is quite beyond me , quite ; so i am not competing .
but on general principles it is my opinion that a colt out of a <unk> and a <unk> is no square dog , but doubtful .
that is my hand , and i stand <name> . "
" well , it is as far as i can go myself , and be fair and conscientious .
i have always regarded him as a doubtful dog , and so has potter .
potter is the great <name> .
potter says he is no dog , and not even poultry  though i do not go quite so far as that .
" and i would n't , myself .
poultry is one of those things which no person can get to the bottom of , there is so much of it and such variety .
it is just wings , and wings , and wings , till you are weary : turkeys , and geese , and bats , and butterflies , and angels , and grasshoppers , and flying-fish , and  well , there is really no end to the tribe ; it gives me the heaves just to think of it .
but this one has n't any wings , has he ? "
" no . "
" well , then , in my belief he is more likely to be dog than poultry .
i have not heard of poultry that had n't wings .
wings is the sign of poultry ; it is what you tell poultry by .
look at the mosquito . "
" what do you reckon he is , then ?
he must be something . "
" why , he could be a reptile ; anything that has n't wings is a reptile . "
" who told you that ? "
" nobody told me , but i overheard it . "
" where did you overhear it ? "
" years ago .
i was with the philadelphia institute expedition in the bad lands under professor cope , hunting mastodon bones , and i overheard him say , his own self , that any <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that had n't wings and was uncertain was a reptile .
well , then , has this dog any wings ?
no .
is he a <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> ?
maybe so , maybe not ; but without ever having seen him , and judging only by his illegal and spectacular parentage , i <name> bet the odds of a bale of hay to a bran mash that he looks it .
finally , is he uncertain ?
that is the point  is he uncertain ?
i <name> leave it to you if you have ever heard of a more <unk> dog than what this one is ? "
" no , i never have . "
" well , then , he 's a reptile .
that 's settled . "
" why , look here , <unk> " " last alias , mongrel . "
" a good one , too .
i was going to say , you are better educated than you have been pretending to be .
i like cultured society , and i shall cultivate your acquaintance .
now as to shekels , whenever you want to know about any private thing that is going on at this post or in white cloud 's camp or <unk> 's , he can tell you ; and if you make friends with him he 'll be glad to , for he is a born gossip , and picks up all the <unk> .
being the whole seventh cavalry 's reptile , he does n't belong to anybody in particular , and has n't any military duties ; so he comes and goes as he pleases , and is popular with all the house cats and other authentic sources of private information .
he understands all the languages , and talks them all , too .
with an accent like <unk> your teeth , it is true , and with a grammar that is no improvement on blasphemy  still , with practice you get at the meat of what he says , and it serves .
.
.
hark !
that 's the <unk> .
.
.
.
[ the <unk> ] " faint and far , but is n't it clear , is n't it sweet ?
there 's no music like the bugle to stir the blood , in the still solemnity of the morning twilight , with the dim plain stretching away to nothing and the spectral mountains slumbering against the sky .
you 'll hear another note in a minute  faint and far and clear , like the other one , and sweeter still , you 'll notice .
wait .
.
.
listen .
there it goes !
it says , 'it is i , soldier  come ! '
.
.
.
[ soldier boy 's bugle call ] .
.
.
now then , watch me leave a blue streak behind ! "
chapter vii  soldier boy and shekels " did you do as i told you ?
did you look up the mexican plug ? "
" yes , i made his acquaintance before night and got his friendship . "
" i liked him .
did you ? "
" not at first .
he took me for a reptile , and it troubled me , because i did n't know whether it was a compliment or not .
i could n't ask him , because it would look ignorant .
so i did n't say anything , and soon liked him very well indeed .
was it a compliment , do you think ? "
" yes , that is what it was .
they are very rare , the reptiles ; very few left , <unk> . "
" is that so ?
what is a reptile ? "
" it is a <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that hasn't any wings and is uncertain . "
" well , it  it sounds fine , it surely does . "
" and it is fine .
you may be thankful you are one . "
" i am .
it seems wonderfully grand and elegant for a person that is so humble as i am ; but i am thankful , i am indeed , and <name> try to live up to it .
it is hard to remember .
<name> you say it again , please , and say it slow ? "
" <unk> <unk> vertebrate <unk> that has n't any wings and is uncertain . "
" it is beautiful , anybody must <name> it ; beautiful , and of a <name> sound .
i <name> it <name> not make me proud and <unk>  i should not like to be that .
it is much more distinguished and honorable to be a reptile than a dog , do n't you think , soldier ? "
" why , there 's no comparison .
it is awfully aristocratic .
often a duke is called a reptile ; it is set down so , in history . "
" is n't that grand !
potter would n't ever associate with me , but i reckon he 'll be glad to when he finds out what i am . "
" you can depend upon it . "
" i <name> thank mongrel for this .
he is a very good sort , for a mexican plug .
do n't you think he is ? "
" it is my opinion of him ; and as for his birth , he can not help that .
we can not all be reptiles , we can not all be fossils ; we have to take what comes and be thankful it is no worse .
it is the true philosophy . "
" for those others ? "
" stick to the subject , please .
did it turn out that my suspicions were right ? "
" yes , perfectly right .
mongrel has heard them planning .
they are after bb 's life , for running them out of medicine bow and taking their stolen horses away from them . "
" well , they 'll get him yet , for sure . "
" not if he keeps a sharp look-out . "
" he keep a sharp lookout !
he never does ; he despises them , and all their kind .
his life is always being threatened , and so it has come to be monotonous . "
" does he know they are here ? "
" oh yes , he knows it .
he is always the earliest to know who comes and who goes .
but he cares nothing for them and their threats ; he only laughs when people warn him .
they 'll shoot him from behind a tree the first he knows .
did mongrel tell you their plans ? "
" yes .
they have found out that he starts for fort <name> day after to-morrow , with one of his scouts ; so they <name> leave to morrow , letting on to go south , but they <name> fetch around north all in good time . "
" shekels , i do n't like the look of it . "
chapter viii  the <unk> .
bb and lieutenant-general <name> bb ( saluting ) .
" good !
handsomely done !
the seventh could n't beat it !
you do certainly handle your rangers like an expert , general .
and where are you bound ? "
" four miles on the trail to fort <name> . "
" glad am i , dear !
what 's the idea of it ? "
" guard of honor for you and <unk> . "
" bless  your  heart !
i 'd rather have it from you than from the commander-in-chief of the armies of the united states , you incomparable little soldier !  and i do n't need to take any oath to that , for you to believe it . "
" i thought you 'd like it , bb . "
" like it ?
well , i should say so !
now then  all ready  sound the advance , and away we go ! "
chapter ix  soldier boy and shekels again " well , this is the way it happened .
we did the escort duty ; then we came back and struck for the plain and put the rangers through a rousing drill  oh , for hours !
then we sent them home under <unk> <name> marsh ; then the lieutenant-general and i went off on a gallop over the plains for about three hours , and were <unk> along home in the middle of the afternoon , when we met <name> slade , the drummer-boy , and he saluted and asked the lieutenant-general if she had heard the news , and she said no , and he said : " <unk> <name> has been ambushed and badly shot this side of <name> , and <unk> the scout , too ; <name> could n't travel , but <unk> could , and he brought the news , and sergeant wilkes and six men of company b are gone , two hours ago , <unk> , to get <name> .
and they say  ' " 'go ! '
she shouts to me  and i went . "
" fast ? "
" do n't ask foolish questions .
it was an awful pace .
for four hours nothing happened , and not a word said , except that now and then she said , 'keep it up , boy , keep it up , sweetheart ; we 'll save him ! '
i kept it up .
well , when the dark shut down , in the rugged hills , that poor little chap had been tearing around in the saddle all day , and i noticed by the slack <unk> that she was tired and <unk> , and i got dreadfully afraid ; but every time i tried to slow down and let her go to sleep , so i could stop , she hurried me up again ; and so , sure enough , at last over she went !
" ah , that was a fix to be in i for she lay there and did n't stir , and what was i to do ?
i could n't leave her to fetch help , on account of the wolves .
there was nothing to do but stand by .
it was dreadful .
i was afraid she was killed , poor little thing !
but she was n't .
she came to , by-and-by , and said , <unk> me , soldier , ' and those were blessed words .
i kissed her  often ; i am used to that , and we like it .
but she did n't get up , and i was worried .
she fondled my nose with her hand , and talked to me , and called me endearing names  which is her way  but she caressed with the same hand all the time .
the other arm was broken , you see , but i didn't know it , and she did n't mention it .
she did n't want to distress me , you know .
" soon the big gray wolves came , and <name> around , and you could hear them snarl , and snap at each other , but you could n't see anything of them except their eyes , which shone in the dark like sparks and stars .
the lieutenant-general said , 'if i had the <name> mountain rangers here , we would make those creatures climb a tree . '
then she made believe that the rangers were in hearing , and put up her bugle and blew the <unk> ' ; and then , <unk> and saddles ' ; then the <unk> ' ; <unk> ' ; <unk> ! '
then she blew the <unk> , ' and said , 'that 's for you , you rebels ; the rangers do n't ever retreat ! '
" the music frightened them away , but they were hungry , and kept coming back .
and of course they got bolder and bolder , which is their way .
it went on for an hour , then the tired child went to sleep , and it was pitiful to hear her moan and nestle , and i could n't do anything for her .
all the time i was laying for the wolves .
they are in my line ; i have had experience .
at last the boldest one ventured within my lines , and i landed him among his friends with some of his skull still on him , and they did the rest .
in the next hour i got a couple more , and they went the way of the first one , down the throats of the detachment .
that satisfied the survivors , and they went away and left us in peace .
" we had n't any more adventures , though i kept awake all night and was ready .
from midnight on the child got very restless , and out of her head , and moaned , and said , <unk> , water  thirsty ' ; and now and then , <unk> me , soldier ' ; and sometimes she was in her fort and giving orders to her garrison ; and once she was in spain , and thought her mother was with her .
people say a horse ca n't cry ; but they do n't know , because we cry inside .
" it was an hour after <unk> that i heard the boys coming , and recognized the <unk> of pomp and caesar and <name> , old mates of mine ; and a <unk> sound there could n't ever be .
buffalo <name> was in a <unk> , with his leg broken by a bullet , and mongrel and <name> <unk> 's horse were doing the work .
buffalo <name> and <unk> had lolled both of those <unk> .
" when they got to us , and buffalo <name> saw the child lying there so white , he said , 'my god ! '
and the sound of his voice brought her to herself , and she gave a little cry of pleasure and struggled to get up , but could n't , and the soldiers gathered her up like the tenderest women , and their eyes were wet and they were not ashamed , when they saw her arm dangling ; and so were buffalo <name> 's , and when they laid her in his arms he said , 'my darling , how does this come ? '
and she said , 'we came to save you , but i was tired , and could n't keep awake , and fell off and hurt myself , and could n't get on again . '
'you came to save me , you dear little rat ?
it was too lovely of you ! '
'yes , and soldier stood by me , which you know he would , and protected me from the wolves ; and if he got a chance he kicked the life out of some of them  for you know he would , bb . '
the sergeant said , 'he laid out three of them , sir , and here 's the bones to show for it . '
'he 's a grand horse , ' said bb ; 'he 's the grandest horse that ever was !
and has saved your life , lieutenant general <name> , and shall protect it the rest of his life  he's yours for a kiss ! '
he got it , along with a passion of delight , and he said , 'you are feeling better now , little spaniard  do you think you could blow the advance ? '
she put up the bugle to do it , but he said wait a minute first .
then he and the sergeant set her arm and put it in <unk> , she <unk> but not whimpering ; then we took up the march for home , and that 's the end of the tale ; and i 'm her horse .
is n't she a brick , shekels ?
" brick ?
she 's more than a brick , more than a thousand bricks  she 's a reptile ! "
" it 's a compliment out of your heart , shekels .
god bless you for it ! "
chapter x  general <name> and <name> " too much company for her , marse <name> .
betwixt you , and shekels , the colonel 's wife , and the cid  " " the cid ?
oh , i remember  the <name> . "
"  and mrs. captain marsh and famine and pestilence the baby <unk> , and <unk> and her <unk> , and <unk> and her kittens  <name> these names she gives the creatures , they warp my jaw  and potter : you  all sitting around in the house , and soldier boy at the window the entire time , it 's a wonder to me she comes along as well as she does .
she  " " you want her all to yourself , you stingy old thing ! "
" marse <name> , you know better .
it 's too much company .
and then the idea of her receiving reports all the time from her officers , and acting upon them , and giving orders , the same as if she was well !
it ai n't good for her , and the surgeon do n't like it , and tried to persuade her not to and could n't ; and when he ordered her , she was that outraged and indignant , and was very severe on him , and accused him of insubordination , and said it did n't become him to give orders to an officer of her rank .
well , he saw he had excited her more and done more harm than all the rest put together , so he was vexed at himself and wished he had kept still .
doctors don't know much , and that 's a fact .
she 's too much interested in things she ought to rest more .
she 's all the time sending messages to bb , and to soldiers and injuns and <unk> , and to the animals . "
" to the animals ? "
" yes , sir . "
" who carries them ? "
" sometimes potter , but mostly it 's shekels . "
" now come !
who can find fault with such pretty make-believe as that ? "
" but it ai n't make-believe , marse <name> .
she does send them . "
" yes , i do n't doubt that part of it . "
" do you doubt they get them , sir ? "
" certainly .
do n't you ? "
" no , sir .
animals talk to one another .
i know it perfectly well , marse <name> , and i ai n't saying it by guess . "
" what a curious superstition ! "
" it ai n't a superstition , marse <name> .
look at that shekels  look at him , now .
is he listening , or ai n't he ?
now you see !
he 's turned his head away .
it 's because he was caught  caught in the act .
i 'll ask you  could a <name> look any more ashamed than what he looks now ?  lay down !
you see ?
he was going to sneak out .
don't tell me , marse <name> !
if animals do n't talk , i miss my guess .
and shekels is the worst .
he goes and tells the animals everything that happens in the officers ' quarters ; and if he 's short of facts , he <unk> them .
he has n't any more principle than a blue <name> ; and as for morals , he 's empty .
look at him now ; look at him <unk> .
he knows what i am saying , and he knows it 's the truth .
you see , yourself , that he can feel shame ; it 's the only virtue he 's got .
it 's wonderful how they find out everything that 's going on  the animals .
they  " " do you really believe they do , <name> ? "
" i do n't only just believe it , marse <name> , i know it .
day before yesterday they knew something was going to happen .
they were that excited , and whispering around together ; why , anybody could see that they  but my !
i must get back to her , and i have n't got to my errand yet . "
" what is it , <name> ? "
" well , it 's two or three things .
one is , the doctor do n't salute when he comes .
.
.
now , marse <name> , it ai n't anything to laugh at , and so  " " well , then , forgive me ; i did n't mean to laugh  i got caught unprepared . "
" you see , she do n't want to hurt the doctor 's feelings , so she do n't say anything to him about it ; but she is always polite , herself , and it hurts that kind for people to be rude to them . "
" i 'll have that doctor hanged . "
" marse <name> , she do n't want him hanged .
she  " " well , then , i 'll have him boiled in oil . "
" but she do n't want him boiled .
i  " " oh , very well , very well , i only want to please her ; i 'll have him skinned . "
" why , she do n't want him skinned ; it would break her heart .
now  " " woman , this is perfectly unreasonable .
what in the nation does she want ? "
" marse <name> , if you would only be a little patient , and not fly off the handle at the least little thing .
why , she only wants you to speak to him . "
" speak to him !
well , upon my word !
all this unseemly rage and row about such a  a  <name> , i never saw you <name> on like this before .
you have alarmed the sentry ; he thinks i am being assassinated ; he thinks there 's a mutiny , a revolt , an insurrection ; he  " " marse <name> , you are just putting on ; you know it perfectly well ; i do n't know what makes you act like that  but you always did , even when you was little , and you ca n't get over it , i reckon .
are you over it now , marse <name> ? "
" oh , well , yes ; but it would try anybody to be doing the best he could , offering every kindness he could think of , only to have it rejected with <unk> and .
.
.
oh , well , let it go ; it 's no matter  i 'll talk to the doctor .
is that satisfactory , or are you going to break out again ? "
" yes , sir , it is ; and it 's only right to talk to him , too , because it 's just as she says ; she 's trying to keep up discipline in the rangers , and this insubordination of his is a bad example for them now ai n't it so , marse <name> ? "
" well , there is reason in it , i ca n't deny it ; so i <name> speak to him , though at bottom i think hanging would be more lasting .
what is the rest of your errand , <name> ? "
" of course her room is ranger headquarters now , marse <name> , while she 's sick .
well , soldiers of the cavalry and the dragoons that are off duty come and get her sentries to let them relieve them and serve in their place .
it 's only out of affection , sir , and because they know military honors please her , and please the children too , for her sake ; and they do n't bring their muskets ; and so  " " i 've noticed them there , but did n't twig the idea .
they are standing guard , are they ? "
" yes , sir , and she is afraid you <name> <unk> them and hurt their feelings , if you see them there ; so she begs , if  if you do n't mind coming in the back way  " " bear me up , <name> ; do n't let me faint . "
" there  sit up and behave , marse <name> .
you are not going to faint ; you are only pretending  you used to act just so when you was little ; it does seem a long time for you to get grown up . "
" <name> , the way the child is progressing , i shall be out of my job before long  she 'll have the whole post in her hands .
i must make a stand , i must not go down without a struggle .
these encroachments .
.
.
.
<name> , what do you think she <name> think of next ? "
" marse <name> , she do n't mean any harm . "
" are you sure of it ? "
" yes , marse <name> . "
" you feel sure she has no ulterior designs ? "
" i do n't know what that is , marse <name> , but i know she has n't . "
" very well , then , for the present i am satisfied .
what else have you come about ? "
" i reckon i better tell you the whole thing first , marse <name> , then tell you what she wants .
there 's been an <unk> , as she calls it .
it was before she got back with bb .
the officer of the day reported it to her this morning .
it happened at her fort .
there was a fuss betwixt <unk> <name> drake and lieutenant-colonel <name> <unk> , and he snatched her doll away , which is made of white kid stuffed with sawdust , and tore every rag of its clothes off , right before them all , and is under arrest , and the charge is conduct <name>  " " yes , i know  conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman  a plain case , too , it seems to me .
this is a serious matter .
well , what is her pleasure ? "
" well , marse <name> , she has summoned a court-martial , but the doctor do n't think she is well enough to preside over it , and she says there ai n't anybody competent but her , because there 's a <name> general concerned ; and so she  she  well , she says , would you preside over it for her ?
.
.
.
marse <name> , sit up !
you ai n't any more going to faint than shekels is . "
" look here , <name> , go along back , and be <unk> .
be persuasive ; do n't fret her ; tell her it 's all right , the matter is in my hands , but it is n't good form to hurry so grave a matter as this .
explain to her that we have to go by precedents , and that i believe this one to be new .
in fact , you can say i know that nothing just like it has happened in our army , therefore i must be guided by european precedents , and must go cautiously and examine them carefully .
tell her not to be impatient , it <name> take me several days , but it <name> all come out right , and i <name> come over and report progress as i go along .
do you get the idea , <name> ? "
" i do n't know as i do , sir . "
" well , it 's this .
you see , it wo n't ever do for me , a brigadier in the regular army , to preside over that infant court-martial  there is n't any precedent for it , do n't you see .
very well .
i <name> go on examining authorities and reporting progress until she is well enough to get me out of this scrape by presiding herself .
do you get it now ? "
" oh , yes , sir , i get it , and it 's good , i 'll go and fix it with her .
lay down !
and stay where you are . "
" why , what harm is he doing ? "
" oh , it ai n't any harm , but it just <unk> me to see him act so . "
" what was he doing ? "
" ca n't you see , and him in such a sweat ?
he was starting out to spread it all over the post .
now i reckon you wo n't deny , any more , that they go and tell everything they hear , now that you've seen it with yo ' own eyes . "
" well , i do n't like to acknowledge it , <name> , but i do n't see how i can consistently stick to my doubts in the face of such overwhelming proof as this dog is furnishing . "
" there , now , you 've got in yo ' right mind at last !
i wonder you can be so stubborn , marse <name> .
but you always was , even when you was little .
i 'm going now . "
" look here ; tell her that in view of the delay , it is my judgment that she ought to enlarge the accused on his parole . "
" yes , sir , i 'll tell her .
marse <name> ? "
" well ? "
" she ca n't get to soldier boy , and he stands there all the time , down in the mouth and lonesome ; and she says <name> you shake hands with him and comfort him ?
everybody does . "
" it 's a curious kind of <unk> ; but , all right , i <name> . "
chapter xi  several months later .
<name> and <unk> " <unk> , is n't that plug you 're riding an assert of the scrap you and buffalo <name> had with the late <name> <unk> and his pal a few months back ? "
" yes , this is mongrel  and not a <unk> horse , either . "
" i 've noticed he keeps up his lick first-rate .
say  is n't it a gaudy morning ? "
" right you are ! "
" <unk> , it 's <unk> !
and when that 's said , all 's said . "
" <unk> and <unk> , <name> !
put it that way , and you have my vote .
being a native up there , i know .
you being <unk> born  " " can speak with authority for that patch of paradise ?
well , i can .
like the <name> !
like <unk> !
this is the correct <unk> <name> now  crisp , fresh , dewy , fragrant , pungent  " " 'what though the <unk> breezes blow soft o'er ceylon 's isle  '  git up , you old cow !
stumbling like that when we 've just been praising you !
out on a scout and ca n't live up to the honor any better than that ?
<name> , how long have you been out here in the plains and the rockies ? "
" more than thirteen years . "
" it 's a long time .
do n't you ever get homesick ? "
" not till now . "
" why now ?  after such a long cure . "
" these preparations of the retiring commandant 's have started it up . "
" of course .
it 's natural . "
" it keeps me thinking about spain .
i know the region where the seventh 's child 's aunt lives ; i know all the lovely country for miles around ; i 'll bet i 've seen her aunt 's villa many a time ; i'll bet i 've been in it in those pleasant old times when i was a spanish gentleman . "
" they say the child is wild to see spain . "
" it 's so ; i know it from what i hear . "
" have n't you talked with her about it ? "
" no .
i 've avoided it .
i should soon be as wild as she is .
that would not be comfortable . "
" i wish i was going , <name> .
there 's two things i 'd give a lot to see .
one 's a railroad . "
" she 'll see one when she strikes missouri . "
" the other 's a <unk> . "
" i 've seen lots of them ; i wish i could see another . "
" i do n't know anything about it , except in a mixed-up , foggy way , <name> , but i know enough to know it 's grand sport . "
" the grandest in the world !
there 's no other sport that begins with it .
i 'll tell you what i 've seen , then you can judge .
it was my first , and it 's as vivid to me now as it was when i saw it .
it was a <name> afternoon , and beautiful weather , and my uncle , the priest , took me as a reward for being a good boy and because of my own accord and without anybody asking me i had <unk> my <unk> and given the money to a mission that was <unk> the chinese and <unk> their lives and softening their hearts with the gentle teachings of our religion , and i wish you could have seen what we saw that day , <unk> .
" the amphitheatre was packed , from the <unk> to the highest row  twelve thousand people in one circling mass , one slanting , solid mass  royalties , nobles , clergy , ladies , gentlemen , state officials , generals , admirals , soldiers , sailors , lawyers , thieves , merchants , brokers , cooks , housemaids , <unk> , doubtful women , <unk> , gamblers , beggars , loafers , tramps , american ladies , gentlemen , preachers , english ladies , gentlemen , preachers , <name> ditto , french ditto , and so on and so on , all the world represented : spaniards to admire and praise , foreigners to enjoy and go home and find fault  there they were , one solid , sloping , circling sweep of rippling and flashing color under the downpour of the summer sun  just a garden , a gaudy , gorgeous flower-garden !
children munching oranges , six thousand fans fluttering and glimmering , everybody happy , everybody chatting gayly with their intimates , lovely <unk> smiling recognition and salutation to other lovely <unk> , gray old ladies and gentlemen dealing in the like exchanges with each other  ah , such a picture of cheery contentment and glad anticipation !
not a mean spirit , nor a sordid soul , nor a sad heart there  ah , <unk> , i wish i could see it again .
" suddenly , the martial note of a bugle <unk> the hum and murmur  clear the ring !
" they clear it .
the great gate is flung open , and the procession marches in , splendidly <unk> and glittering : the <unk> of the day , then the <unk> on horseback , then the <unk> on foot , each surrounded by his <unk> of <unk> .
they march to the box of the city fathers , and formally salute .
the key is thrown , the <unk> is unlocked .
another bugle blast  the gate flies open , the bull plunges in , furious , trembling , blinking in the blinding light , and stands there , a magnificent creature , centre of those multitudinous and admiring eyes , brave , ready for battle , his attitude a challenge .
he sees his enemy : horsemen sitting motionless , with long spears in rest , upon blindfolded broken-down <unk> , <name> and starved , fit only for sport and sacrifice , then the <unk> .
" the bull makes a rush , with murder in his eye , but a <unk> meets him with a <unk> in the shoulder .
he <unk> with the pain , and the <unk> skips out of danger .
a burst of applause for the <unk> , hisses for the bull .
some shout <unk> ! '
at the bull , and call him offensive names .
but he is not listening to them , he is there for business ; he is not minding the <unk> that come fluttering around to confuse him ; he <unk> this way , he <unk> that way , and hither and <name> , scattering the nimble <unk> in every direction like a spray , and receiving their maddening darts in his neck as they dodge and fly  oh , but it 's a lively spectacle , and brings down the house !
ah , you should hear the thundering roar that goes up when the game is at its wildest and brilliant things are done !
" oh , that first bull , that day , was great !
from the moment the spirit of war rose to <unk> in him and he got down to his work , he began to do wonders .
he tore his way through his <unk> , flinging one of them clear over the parapet ; he bowled a horse and his rider down , and plunged straight for the next , got home with his horns , wounding both horse and man ; on again , here and there and this way and that ; and one after another he tore the bowels out of two horses so that they gushed to the ground , and ripped a third one so badly that although they rushed him to cover and shoved his bowels back and stuffed the rents with tow and rode him against the bull again , he could n't make the trip ; he tried to gallop , under the spur , but soon reeled and tottered and fell , all in a heap .
for a while , that <unk> was the most thrilling and glorious and inspiring sight that ever was seen .
the bull absolutely cleared it , and stood there alone !
monarch of the place .
the people went mad for pride in him , and <name> and delight , and you could n't hear yourself think , for the roar and boom and crash of applause . "
" <name> , it carries me clear out of myself just to hear you tell it ; it must have been perfectly splendid .
if i live , i 'll see a <unk> yet before i die .
did they kill him ? "
" oh yes ; that is what the bull is for .
they tired him out , and got him at last .
he kept rushing the <unk> , who always slipped <unk> and gracefully aside in time , waiting for a sure chance ; and at last it came ; the bull made a deadly plunge for him  was avoided neatly , and as he sped by , the long sword glided silently into him , between left shoulder and spine  in and in , to the hilt .
he crumpled down , dying . "
" ah , <name> , it is the noblest sport that ever was .
i would give a year of my life to see it .
is the bull always killed ? "
" yes .
sometimes a bull is timid , finding himself in so strange a place , and he stands trembling , or tries to retreat .
then everybody despises him for his cowardice and wants him punished and made ridiculous ; so they hough him from behind , and it is the funniest thing in the world to see him <unk> around on his severed legs ; the whole vast house goes into <unk> of laughter over it ; i have laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks to see it .
when he has furnished all the sport he can , he is not any longer useful , and is killed . "
" well , it is perfectly grand , <name> , perfectly beautiful .
burning a nigger do n't begin . "
chapter xii  mongrel and the other horse " sage-brush , you have been listening ? "
" yes . "
" is n't it strange ? "
" well , no , mongrel , i do n't know that it is . "
" why do n't you ? "
" i 've seen a good many human beings in my time .
they are created as they are ; they can not help it .
they are only brutal because that is their make ; brutes would be brutal if it was their make . "
" to me , sage-brush , man is most strange and unaccountable .
why should he treat dumb animals that way when they are not doing any harm ? "
" man is not always like that , mongrel ; he is kind enough when he is not excited by religion . "
" is the <unk> a religious service ? "
" i think so .
i have heard so .
it is held on <name> . "
( a reflective pause , lasting some moments . )
then : " when we die , sage-brush , do we go to heaven and dwell with man ? "
" my father thought not .
he believed we do not have to go there unless we deserve it . "
part ii  in spain chapter xiii  general <name> to his mother it was a prodigious trip , but delightful , of course , through the rockies and the black hills and the mighty sweep of the great plains to civilization and the missouri border  where the railroading began and the <unk> ended .
but no one is the worse for the journey ; certainly not <name> , nor <name> , nor soldier boy ; and as for me , i am not complaining .
spain is all that <name> had pictured it  and more , she says .
she is in a fury of delight , the maddest little animal that ever was , and all for <name> .
she thinks she remembers spain , but that is not very likely , i suppose .
the two  <name> and <name>  devour each other .
it is a rapture of love , and beautiful to see .
it is spanish ; that describes it .
<name> this be a short visit ?
no .
it <name> be permanent .
<name> has elected to abide with spain and her aunt .
<name> says she ( <name> ) foresaw that this would happen ; and also says that she wanted it to happen , and says the child 's own country is the right place for her , and that she ought not to have been sent to me , i ought to have gone to her .
i thought it insane to take soldier boy to spain , but it was well that i yielded to <name> 's pleadings ; if he had been left behind , half of her heart would have remained with him , and she would not have been contented .
as it is , everything has fallen out for the best , and we are all satisfied and comfortable .
it may be that <name> and i <name> see <name> again some day ; but also it is a case of maybe not .
we left the post in the early morning .
it was an affecting time .
the women cried over <name> , so did even those stern warriors , the <name> mountain rangers ; shekels was there , and the cid , and <unk> , and potter , and mongrel , and <unk> , famine , and pestilence , and <name> kissed them all and wept ; details of the several arms of the garrison were present to represent the rest , and say good-bye and god bless you for all the soldiery ; and there was a special squad from the seventh , with the oldest veteran at its head , to speed the seventh 's child with grand honors and impressive ceremonies ; and the veteran had a touching speech by heart , and put up his hand in salute and tried to say it , but his lips trembled and his voice broke , but <name> bent down from the saddle and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat to victory , and a cheer went up .
the next act closed the ceremonies , and was a moving surprise .
it may be that you have discovered , before this , that the <unk> of military law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when a soldier or a regiment or the garrison wants to do something that <name> please <name> .
the bands conceived the idea of stirring her soldierly heart with a farewell which would remain in her memory always , beautiful and <unk> , and bring back the past and its love for her whenever she should think of it ; so they got their project placed before general <unk> , my successor , who is <unk> newest slave , and in spite of poverty of precedents they got his permission .
the bands knew the child 's favorite military airs .
by this hint you know what is coming , but <name> did n't .
she was asked to sound the " <unk> , " which she did .
[ <unk> ] with the last note the bands burst out with a crash : and woke the mountains with the " <unk> banner " in a way to make a <unk> heart swell and thump and his hair rise !
it was enough to break a person all up , to see <name> 's radiant face shining out through her gladness and tears .
by request she blew the " assembly , " now .
.
.
.
[ the assembly ] .
.
.
then the bands thundered in , with " rally round the flag , boys , rally once again ! "
next , she blew another call ( " to the standard " ) .
.
.
[ to the standard ] .
.
.
and the bands responded with " when we were marching through <name> . "
straightway she sounded " boots and saddles , " that thrilling and most <unk> call .
.
.
.
[ boots and saddles ] and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note ; then they turned their whole strength loose on " tramp , tramp , tramp , the boys are marching , " and everybody 's excitement rose to <unk> .
now an impressive pause  then the bugle sang " taps "  <unk> , this time , into " good-bye , and god keep us all ! "
for taps is the soldier 's nightly release from duty , and farewell : plaintive , sweet , pathetic , for the morning is never sure , for him ; always it is possible that he is hearing it for the last time .
.
.
.
[ taps ] .
.
.
then the bands turned their instruments towards <name> and burst in with that <unk> frenzy of a tune , " oh , we 'll all get blind drunk when <name> comes marching home  yes , we 'll all get blind drunk when <name> comes marching home ! "
and followed it instantly with " <name> , " that <unk> for melancholy , <unk> and <unk> of all military music on any side of the ocean  and that was the end .
and so  farewell !
i wish you could have been there to see it all , hear it all , and feel it : and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza that swept the place as a finish .
when we rode away , our main body had already been on the road an hour or two  i speak of our camp equipage ; but we did n't move off alone : when <name> blew the " advance " the rangers cantered out in column of fours , and gave us escort , and were joined by white cloud and <unk> in all their gaudy bravery , and by buffalo <name> and four subordinate scouts .
three miles away , in the plains , the lieutenant-general halted , sat her horse like a military statue , the bugle at her lips , and put the rangers through the evolutions for half an hour ; and finally , when she blew the " charge , " she led it herself .
" not for the last time , " she said , and got a cheer , and we said good-bye all around , and faced eastward and rode away .
postscript .
a day later .
soldier boy was stolen last night .
<name> is almost beside herself , and we can not comfort her .
<name> and i are not much alarmed about the horse , although this part of spain is in something of a turmoil , politically , at present , and there is a good deal of lawlessness .
in ordinary times the thief and the horse would soon be captured .
we shall have them before long , i think .
chapter xiv  soldier boy  to himself it is five months .
or is it six ?
my troubles have clouded my memory .
i have been all over this land , from end to end , and now i am back again since day before yesterday , to that city which we passed through , that last day of our long journey , and which is near her country home .
i am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim , but i recognized it .
if she could see me she would know me and sound my call .
i wish i could hear it once more ; it would revive me , it would bring back her face and the mountains and the free life , and i would come  if i were dying i would come !
she would not know me , looking as i do , but she would know me by my <name> .
but she <name> never see me , for they do not let me out of this shabby stable  a foul and miserable place , with most two wrecks like myself for company .
how many times have i changed hands ?
i think it is twelve times  i can not remember ; and each time it was down a step lower , and each time i got a harder master .
they have been cruel , every one ; they have worked me night and day in degraded employments , and beaten me ; they have fed me ill , and some days not at all .
and so i am but bones , now , with a rough and <unk> skin humped and cornered upon my shrunken body  that skin which was once so glossy , that skin which she loved to stroke with her hand .
i was the pride of the mountains and the great plains ; now i am a scarecrow and despised .
these piteous wrecks that are my comrades here say we have reached the bottom of the scale , the final humiliation ; they say that when a horse is no longer worth the weeds and discarded rubbish they feed to him , they sell him to the <unk> for a glass of <name> , to make sport for the people and perish for their pleasure .
to die  that does not disturb me ; we of the service never care for death .
but if i could see her once more !
if i could hear her bugle sing again and say , " it is i , soldier  come ! "
chapter xv  general <name> to mrs. drake , the colonel 's wife to return , now , to where i was , and tell you the rest .
we shall never know how she came to be there ; there is no way to account for it .
she was always watching for black and shiny and spirited horses  watching , hoping , despairing , hoping again ; always giving <name> and sounding her call , upon the <unk> chance of a response , and breaking her heart over the disappointment ; always inquiring , always interested in <unk> and horse accumulations in general .
how she got there must remain a mystery .
at the point which i had reached in a preceding paragraph of this account , the situation was as follows : two horses lay dying ; the bull had scattered his <unk> for the moment , and stood raging , panting , pawing the dust in clouds over his back , when the man that had been wounded returned to the ring on a <unk> , a poor blindfolded wreck that yet had something ironically military about his bearing  and the next moment the bull had ripped him open and his bowls were dragging upon the ground : and the bull was charging his swarm of pests again .
then came <unk> through the air a <unk> that froze my blood  " it is i , soldier  come ! "
i turned ; <name> was flying down through the massed people ; she cleared the parapet at a bound , and sped towards that <unk> horse , who staggered forward towards the remembered sound ; but his strength failed , and he fell at her feet , she <unk> kisses upon him and sobbing , the house rising with one impulse , and white with horror !
before help could reach her the bull was back again  she was never conscious again in life .
we bore her home , all mangled and drenched in blood , and knelt by her and listened to her broken and wandering words , and prayed for her passing spirit , and there was no comfort  nor ever <name> be , i think .
but she was happy , for she was far away under another sky , and <unk> again with her rangers , and her animal friends , and the soldiers .
their names fell softly and caressingly from her lips , one by one , with pauses between .
she was not in pain , but lay with closed eyes , vacantly murmuring , as one who dreams .
sometimes she smiled , saying nothing ; sometimes she smiled when she uttered a name  such as shekels , or bb , or potter .
sometimes she was at her fort , issuing commands ; sometimes she was <unk> over the plain at the head of her men ; sometimes she was training her horse ; once she said , <unk> , " you are giving me the wrong foot ; give me the left  do n't you know it is good-bye ? "
after this , she lay silent some time ; the end was near .
by-and-by she murmured , " tired .
.
.
sleepy .
.
.
take <name> , mamma . "
then , " kiss me , soldier . "
for a little time , she lay so still that we were doubtful if she breathed .
then she put out her hand and began to feel <unk> about ; then said , " i can not find it ; blow <unk> . ' "
it was the end .

after much thought , i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle .
so i determined to do it .
this was in march , 1878 .
i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent , and finally hired a mr. <name> for this service .
it was also my purpose to study <name> while in europe .
mr. <name> was in sympathy with me in this .
he was as much of an enthusiast in <name> as i was , and not less anxious to learn to paint .
i desired to learn the <name> language ; so did <name> .
toward the middle of <name> we sailed in the <unk> , captain <unk> , and had a very pleasant trip , indeed .
after a brief rest at hamburg , we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather , but at the last moment we changed the program , for private reasons , and took the <unk> .
we made a short halt at <unk> , and found it an interesting city .
i would have liked to visit the birthplace of <unk> , but it could not be done , as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept .
so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead .
the city permits this house to belong to private parties , instead of <unk> and <unk> herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it .
frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred .
charlemagne , while chasing the saxons ( as he said ) , or being chased by them ( as they said ) , arrived at the bank of the river at <name> , in a fog .
the enemy were either before him or behind him ; but in any case he wanted to get across , very badly .
he would have given anything for a guide , but none was to be had .
presently he saw a deer , followed by her young , approach the water .
he watched her , judging that she would seek a ford , and he was right .
she waded over , and the army followed .
so a great <unk> victory or defeat was gained or avoided ; and in order to commemorate the episode , charlemagne commanded a city to be built there , which he named frankfort  the ford of the <unk> .
none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it .
this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at .
frankfort has another distinction  it is the birthplace of the <name> alphabet ; or at least of the <name> word for alphabet  <unk> .
they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks  <unk>  hence the name .
i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort .
i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars .
by way of experiment , i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street , took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars , and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents .
the man gave me 43 cents change .
in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes , and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg , too , and in the villages along the road .
even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule .
the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body 's lap .
and as for the uniforms of the soldiers , they were newness and brightness carried to perfection .
one could never detect a <unk> or a grain of dust upon them .
the <unk> conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the <unk> , and their manners were as fine as their clothes .
in one of the shops i had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death .
it is entitled the legends of the rhine from basle to rotterdam , by f. j. <unk> ; translated by l. w. <unk> , b.a .
all tourists mention the rhine legends  in that sort of way which quietly pretends that the <unk> has been familiar with them all his life , and that the reader can not possibly be ignorant of them  but no tourist ever tells them .
so this little book fed me in a very hungry place ; and i , in my turn , intend to feed my reader , with one or two little <unk> from the same larder .
i shall not mar <unk> translation by meddling with its english ; for the most <unk> thing about it is its quaint fashion of building english sentences on the <name> plan  and <unk> them accordingly to no plan at all .
in the chapter devoted to " legends of frankfort , " i find the following : " the knave of <unk> " " in frankfort at the <unk> was a great <unk> , at the coronation festival , and in the illuminated saloon , the clanging music invited to dance , and splendidly appeared the <name> <unk> and charms of the ladies , and the <unk> <unk> princes and knights .
all seemed pleasure , <name> , and <unk> gaiety , only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior ; but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention , and his tall figure , as well as the <name> propriety of his movements , attracted especially the regards of the ladies .
who the knight was ?
nobody could guess , for his vizier was well closed , and nothing made him recognizable .
proud and yet modest he advanced to the empress ; bowed on one knee before her seat , and begged for the favor of a waltz with the <name> of the festival .
and she allowed his request .
with light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon , with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent <unk> .
but also by the <name> of his manner , and fine conversation he knew to win the <name> , and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged , a third , and a fourth , as well as others were not refused him .
how all regarded the happy <unk> , how many envied him the high favor ; how increased curiosity , who the masked knight could be .
" also the emperor became more and more excited with curiosity , and with great suspense one awaited the hour , when according to <unk> , each masked guest must make himself known .
this moment came , but although all other <unk> ; the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen , till at last the <name> driven by curiosity , and vexed at the obstinate refusal ; commanded him to open his vizier .
he opened it , and none of the high ladies and knights knew him .
but from the crowded spectators , 2 officials advanced , who recognized the black <unk> , and horror and terror spread in the saloon , as they said who the supposed knight was .
it was the executioner of <unk> .
but glowing with rage , the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death , who had ventured to dance , with the <name> ; so disgraced the empress , and insulted the crown .
the <unk> threw himself at the emperor , and said  " 'indeed i have heavily sinned against all <name> guests assembled here , but most heavily against you my sovereign and my <name> .
the <name> is insulted by my <unk> equal to treason , but no punishment even blood , <name> not be able to wash out the disgrace , which you have suffered by me .
therefore oh king !
allow me to propose a remedy , to efface the shame , and to render it as if not done .
draw your sword and knight me , then i <name> throw down my gauntlet , to everyone who dares to speak <unk> of my king . '
" the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal , however it appeared the wisest to him ; 'you are a knave , ' he replied after a moment's consideration , <unk> your advice is good , and displays <name> , as your offense shows adventurous courage .
well then , ' and gave him the <unk> 'so i raise you to nobility , who begged for <name> for your offense now <unk> before me , rise as knight ; <unk> you have acted , and knave of <unk> shall you be called henceforth , ' and gladly the black knight rose ; three cheers were given in honor of the emperor , and loud cries of <name> testified the approbation with which the <name> danced still once with the knave of <unk> . "
chapter ii heidelberg [ landing a monarch at heidelberg ] we stopped at a hotel by the <unk> .
next morning , as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up , we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way , in front of another hotel .
first , the personage who is called the portier ( who is not the <name> , but is a sort of <unk> of a hotel ) [ 1 .
see appendix a ] appeared at the door in a <unk> new blue cloth uniform , decorated with shining brass buttons , and with bands of gold lace around his cap and <unk> ; and he wore white gloves , too .
he shed an official glance upon the situation , and then began to give orders .
two <unk> came out with pails and <unk> and brushes , and gave the sidewalk a thorough <unk> ; meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door ; beyond these we could see some <unk> taking up the carpet of the grand staircase .
this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it ; then brought back and put down again .
the brass <unk> received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places .
now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase .
other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners ; others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there .
now came some more <unk> and <unk> the sidewalk , and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes .
now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the <unk> .
the portier cast his eye along it , and found it was not absolutely straight ; he commanded it to be straightened ; the servants made the effort  made several efforts , in fact  but the portier was not satisfied .
he finally had it taken up , and then he put it down himself and got it right .
at this stage of the proceedings , a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the <unk> , along the center of the black carpet .
this red path cost the portier more trouble than even the black one had done .
but he patiently fixed and <unk> it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet .
in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators ; but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement , some with their <unk> on their backs and their hands in their pockets , others with arms full of bundles , and all absorbed in the show .
occasionally one of them skipped <unk> over the carpet and took up a position on the other side .
this always visibly annoyed the portier .
now came a waiting interval .
the landlord , in plain clothes , and bareheaded , placed himself on the bottom marble step , abreast the portier , who stood on the other end of the same steps ; six or eight waiters , gloved , bareheaded , and wearing their whitest linen , their whitest <unk> , and their finest <unk> , grouped themselves about these chiefs , but leaving the <unk> clear .
nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited .
in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard , and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street .
two or three open carriages arrived , and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel .
presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of <unk> , a stately man in uniform , who wore the handsome <unk> , <unk> helmet of the army on his head .
last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of <unk> in a closed carriage ; these passed through the <unk> groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel , exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads , and then the show was over .
it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship .
but as to heidelberg .
the weather was growing pretty warm ,  very warm , in fact .
so we left the valley and took quarters at the <unk> hotel , on the hill , above the castle .
heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge  a gorge the shape of a shepherd 's crook ; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight , for a mile and a half , then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears .
this gorge  along whose bottom pours the swift neckar  is confined between ( or cloven through ) a couple of long , steep ridges , a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits , with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation .
these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands , with heidelberg nestling between them ; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley , and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view .
now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more , he <name> see the <unk> hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckar  a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears .
the building seems very <unk> situated .
it has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way up the wooded mountainside ; and as it is remote and isolated , and very white , it makes a strong <name> against the lofty leafy rampart at its back .
this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty , and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation .
this feature may be described as a series of <unk> parlors clinging to the outside of the house , one against each and every bed-chamber and drawing-room .
they are like long , narrow , <unk> <unk> <name> against the building .
my room was a corner room , and had two of these things , a north one and a west one .
from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge ; from the west one he looks down it .
this last affords the most extensive view , and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined , too .
out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage , a <unk> removed , rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle , [ 2 .
see appendix b ] with empty window arches , <unk> battlements , <unk> towers  the lear of inanimate nature  deserted , <unk> , beaten by the storms , but <name> still , and beautiful .
it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castle 's base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray , while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow .
behind the castle swells a great <unk> hill , <unk> , and beyond that a nobler and loftier one .
the castle looks down upon the compact <unk> town ; and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river .
now the view <unk> ; through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain , which stretches away , softly and richly tinted , grows gradually and dreamily indistinct , and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon .
i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives .
the first night we were there , we went to bed and to sleep early ; but i awoke at the end of two or three hours , and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows .
i took it to be rain , but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar , tumbling over her dikes and <unk> far below , in the gorge .
i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight .
away down on the level under the black mass of the castle , the town lay , stretched along the river , its intricate cobweb of streets <unk> with twinkling lights ; there were rows of lights on the bridges ; these flung lances of light upon the water , in the black shadows of the arches ; and away at the extremity of all this <name> spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of <unk> which seemed to cover acres of ground ; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there .
i did not know before , that a half-mile of <unk> <unk> could be made such an adornment .
one thinks heidelberg by day  with its surroundings  is the last possibility of the beautiful ; but when he sees heidelberg by night , a fallen milky way , with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border , he requires time to consider upon the verdict .
one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops .
the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country ; but <name> legends and <name> tales have given these an added charm .
they have peopled all that region with <unk> , and dwarfs , and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures .
at the time i am writing of , i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the <unk> and fairies as realities .
one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel , and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk , and <unk> , and enchanted folk , and the rest of the pleasant <unk> stuff ; and so , by stimulating my fancy , i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the <unk> aisles of the forest .
it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion .
it was a pine wood , with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that one 's footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool ; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars , and stood close together ; they were bare of branches to a point about twenty-five feet <unk> , and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a <name> of sunlight could pierce through .
the world was bright with <name> outside , but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there , and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own <unk> .
when i had stood ten minutes , thinking and imagining , and getting my spirit in tune with the place , and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural , a <name> suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head .
it made me start ; and then i was angry because i started .
i looked up , and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me , looking down at me .
i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been <unk> inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him .
i eyed the <name> , and the <name> eyed me .
nothing was said during some seconds .
then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation , lifted his wings , stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again  a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it .
if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in <name> , " well , what do you want here ? "
i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being , and reproved for it .
however , i made no reply ; i would not <unk> words with a <name> .
the adversary waited a while , with his shoulders still lifted , his head thrust down between them , and his keen bright eye fixed on me ; then he threw out two or three more insults , which i could not understand , further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church .
i still made no reply .
now the adversary raised his head and called .
there was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood  evidently a croak of inquiry .
the adversary explained with enthusiasm , and the other <name> dropped everything and came .
the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and <unk> as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug .
the thing became more and more embarrassing .
they called in another friend .
this was too much .
i saw that they had the advantage of me , and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it .
they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done .
they <unk> their necks and laughed at me ( for a <name> can laugh , just like a man ) , they <unk> insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me .
they were nothing but ravens  i knew that  what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence  and yet when even a <name> shouts after you , " what a hat ! "
" oh , pull down your vest ! "
and that sort of thing , it hurts you and <unk> you , and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments .
animals talk to each other , of course .
there can be no question about that ; but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them .
i never knew but one man who could .
i knew he could , however , because he told me so himself .
he was a middle-aged , <unk> miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california , among the woods and mountains , a good many years , and had studied the ways of his only neighbors , the beasts and the birds , until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made .
this was <name> baker .
according to <name> baker , some animals have only a limited education , and some use only simple words , and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure ; whereas , certain other animals have a large vocabulary , a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery ; consequently these latter talk a great deal ; they like it ; they are so conscious of their talent , and they enjoy " showing off . "
baker said , that after long and careful observation , he had come to the conclusion that the <unk> were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts .
said he : " there 's more to a <unk> than any other creature .
he has got more moods , and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures ; and , mind you , whatever a <unk> feels , he can put into language .
and no mere commonplace language , either , but rattling , out-and-out <unk>  and bristling with metaphor , too  just bristling !
and as for command of language  why you never see a <unk> get stuck for a word .
no man ever did .
they just boil out of him !
and another thing : i've noticed a good deal , and there 's no bird , or cow , or anything that uses as good grammar as a <unk> .
you may say a cat uses good grammar .
well , a cat does  but you let a cat get excited once ; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed , nights , and you 'll hear grammar that <name> give you the <unk> .
ignorant people think it 's the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating , but it ai n't so ; it's the sickening grammar they use .
now i 've never heard a <name> use bad grammar but very seldom ; and when they do , they are as ashamed as a human ; they shut right down and leave .
" you may call a <name> a bird .
well , so he is , in a measure  but he 's got feathers on him , and do n't belong to no church , perhaps ; but otherwise he is just as much human as you be .
and i 'll tell you for why .
a <unk> gifts , and instincts , and feelings , and interests , cover the whole ground .
a <name> has n't got any more principle than a congressman .
a <name> <name> lie , a <name> <name> steal , a <name> <name> deceive , a <name> <name> betray ; and four times out of five , a <name> <name> go back on his <unk> promise .
the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you ca n't cram into no <unk> 's head .
now , on top of all this , there 's another thing ; a <name> can <unk> any gentleman in the mines .
you think a cat can swear .
well , a cat can ; but you give a <unk> a subject that calls for his <unk> , and where is your cat ?
do n't talk to me  i know too much about this thing ; in the one little particular of scolding  just good , clean , out-and-out scolding  a <unk> can lay over anything , human or divine .
yes , sir , a <name> is everything that a man is .
a <name> can cry , a <name> can laugh , a <name> can feel shame , a <name> can reason and plan and discuss , a <name> likes gossip and scandal , a <name> has got a sense of humor , a <name> knows when he is an ass just as well as you do  maybe better .
if a <name> ai n't human , he better take in his sign , that 's all .
now i 'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some <unk> . "
chapter iii baker 's <unk> yarn [ what stumped the blue jays ] " when i first begun to understand <name> language correctly , there was a little incident happened here .
seven years ago , the last man in this region but me moved away .
there stands his house  been empty ever since ; a log house , with a plank roof  just one big room , and no more ; no ceiling  nothing between the rafters and the floor .
well , one <name> morning i was sitting out here in front of my cabin , with my cat , taking the sun , and looking at the blue hills , and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees , and thinking of the home away yonder in the states , that i had n't heard from in thirteen years , when a <unk> lit on that house , with an acorn in his mouth , and says , <unk> , i reckon i 've struck something . '
when he spoke , the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof , of course , but he did n't care ; his mind was all on the thing he had struck .
it was a <unk> in the roof .
he cocked his head to one side , shut one eye and put the other one to the hole , like a <unk> looking down a jug ; then he glanced up with his bright eyes , gave a wink or two with his wings  which signifies gratification , you understand  and says , 'it looks like a hole , it's located like a hole  blamed if i do n't believe it is a hole ! '
" then he cocked his head down and took another look ; he glances up perfectly joyful , this time ; winks his wings and his tail both , and says , 'oh , no , this ai n't no fat thing , i reckon !
if i ai n't in luck !
 why it 's a perfectly elegant hole ! '
so he flew down and got that acorn , and fetched it up and dropped it in , and was just tilting his head back , with the <unk> smile on his face , when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor , and the queerest look of surprise took its place .
then he says , 'why , i didn't hear it fall ! '
he cocked his eye at the hole again , and took a long look ; raised up and shook his head ; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side ; shook his head again .
he studied a while , then he just went into the details  walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass .
no use .
now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute , and finally says , 'well , it 's too many for me , that 's certain ; must be a mighty long hole ; however , i ai n't got no time to fool around here , i got to " tend to business " ; i reckon it 's all right  chance it , anyway . '
" so he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in , and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it , but he was too late .
he held his eye there as much as a minute ; then he raised up and sighed , and says , <unk> it , i do n't seem to understand this thing , no way ; however , i 'll tackle her again . '
he fetched another acorn , and done his level best to see what become of it , but he could n't .
he says , 'well , i never struck no such a hole as this before ; i 'm of the opinion it 's a totally new kind of a hole . '
then he begun to get mad .
he held in for a spell , walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself ; but his feelings got the upper hand of him , presently , and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face .
i never see a bird take on so about a little thing .
when he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute ; then he says , 'well , you 're a long hole , and a deep hole , and a mighty singular hole altogether  but i 've started in to fill you , and i 'm damned if i do n't fill you , if it takes a hundred years ! '
" and with that , away he went .
you never see a bird work so since you was born .
he laid into his work like a nigger , and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles i ever struck .
he never stopped to take a look <unk>  he just hove 'em in and went for more .
well , at last he could hardly flop his wings , he was so tuckered out .
he comes <unk> down , once more , sweating like an <unk> , dropped his acorn in and says , 'now i guess i 've got the bulge on you by this time ! '
so he bent down for a look .
if you 'll believe me , when his head come up again he was just pale with rage .
he says , 'i 've <unk> acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years , and if i can see a sign of one of 'em i wish i may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes ! '
" he just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and <name> his back agin the <unk> , and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind .
i see in a second that what i had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments , as you may say .
" another <name> was going by , and heard him doing his devotions , and stops to inquire what was up .
the sufferer told him the whole circumstance , and says , 'now yonder 's the hole , and if you do n't believe me , go and look for yourself . '
so this fellow went and looked , and comes back and says , 'how many did you say you put in there ? '
'not any less than two tons , ' says the sufferer .
the other <name> went and looked again .
he could n't seem to make it out , so he raised a yell , and three more jays come .
they all examined the hole , they all made the sufferer tell it over again , then they all discussed it , and got off as many <unk> opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done .
" they called in more jays ; then more and more , till pretty soon this whole region <unk> to have a blue flush about it .
there must have been five thousand of them ; and such another <unk> and disputing and ripping and cussing , you never heard .
every <name> in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more <unk> opinion about the mystery than the <name> that went there before him .
they examined the house all over , too .
the door was standing half open , and at last one old <name> happened to go and light on it and look in .
of course , that knocked the mystery <unk> in a second .
there lay the acorns , scattered all over the <unk>
he flopped his wings and raised a whoop .
'come here ! '
he says , 'come here , everybody ; <name> 'd if this fool has n't been trying to fill up a house with acorns ! '
they all came <unk> down like a blue cloud , and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance , the whole absurdity of the contract that that first <name> had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter , and the next <name> took his place and done the same .
" well , sir , they <unk> around here on the <unk> and the trees for an hour , and <unk> over that thing like human beings .
it ai n't any use to tell me a <unk> has n't got a sense of humor , because i know better .
and memory , too .
they brought jays here from all over the united states to look down that hole , every summer for three years .
other birds , too .
and they could all see the point except an owl that come from <name> scotia to visit the yo <unk> , and he took this thing in on his way back .
he said he could n't see anything funny in it .
but then he was a good deal disappointed about yo <unk> , too . "
chapter iv student life [ the laborious beer king ] the summer <unk> was in full tide ; consequently the most frequent figure in and about heidelberg was the student .
most of the students were germans , of course , but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous .
they hailed from every corner of the globe  for instruction is cheap in heidelberg , and so is living , too .
the <unk> club , composed of british and american students , had twenty-five members , and there was still much material left to draw from .
nine-tenths of the heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform ; the other tenth wore caps of various colors , and belonged to social organizations called " corps . "
there were five corps , each with a color of its own ; there were white caps , blue caps , and red , yellow , and green ones .
the famous <unk> is confined to the " corps " boys .
the " <unk> " seems to be a specialty of theirs , too .
<unk> are held , now and then , to celebrate great occasions , like the election of a beer king , for instance .
the solemnity is simple ; the five corps assemble at night , and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer , out of <unk> , as fast as possible , and each man keeps his own count  usually by laying aside a <unk> match for each mug he empties .
the election is soon decided .
when the candidates can hold no more , a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king .
i was told that the last beer king elected by the corps  or by his own <unk>  emptied his mug seventy-five times .
no stomach could hold all that quantity at one time , of course  but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum , which those who have been much at sea <name> understand .
one sees so many students abroad at all hours , that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any <unk> .
some of them have , some of them have n't .
each can choose for himself whether he <name> work or play ; for <name> university life is a very free life ; it seems to have no restraints .
the student does not live in the college buildings , but <unk> his own lodgings , in any locality he prefers , and he takes his meals when and where he pleases .
he goes to bed when it suits him , and does not get up at all unless he wants to .
he is not entered at the university for any particular length of time ; so he is likely to change about .
he passes no examinations upon entering college .
he merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars , receives a card <unk> him to the privileges of the university , and that is the end of it .
he is now ready for business  or play , as he shall prefer .
if he <unk> to work , he finds a large list of lectures to choose from .
he selects the subjects which he <name> study , and enters his name for these studies ; but he can skip attendance .
the result of this system is , that <unk> upon <unk> of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences , while those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are delivered to very large ones .
i heard of one case where , day after day , the lecturer 's audience consisted of three students  and always the same three .
but one day two of them remained away .
the lecturer began as usual  " gentlemen , "  then , without a smile , he corrected himself , saying  " sir , "  and went on with his discourse .
it is said that the vast majority of the heidelberg students are hard workers , and make the most of their opportunities ; that they have no surplus means to spend in dissipation , and no time to spare for frolicking .
one lecture follows right on the heels of another , with very little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next ; but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot .
the professors assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their little <unk> pulpits when the hours strike , and as promptly out again when the hour finishes .
i entered an empty <unk> one day just before the clock struck .
the place had simple , unpainted pine desks and benches for about two hundred persons .
about a minute before the clock struck , a hundred and fifty students swarmed in , rushed to their seats , immediately spread open their <unk> and dipped their pens in ink .
when the clock began to strike , a burly professor entered , was received with a round of applause , moved swiftly down the center aisle , said " gentlemen , " and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps ; and by the time he had arrived in his box and faced his audience , his lecture was well under way and all the pens were going .
he had no notes , he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hour  then the students began to remind him in certain <unk> ways that his time was up ; he seized his hat , still talking , proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps , got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor ; everybody rose respectfully , and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared .
an instant rush for some other <unk> followed , and in a minute i was alone with the empty benches once more .
yes , without doubt , idle students are not the rule .
out of eight hundred in the town , i knew the faces of only about fifty ; but these i saw everywhere , and daily .
they walked about the streets and the wooded hills , they drove in cabs , they <unk> on the river , they <unk> beer and coffee , afternoons , in the <unk> gardens .
a good many of them wore colored caps of the corps .
they were finely and <unk> dressed , their manners were quite superb , and they led an easy , careless , comfortable life .
if a dozen of them sat together and a <name> or a gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted , they all rose to their feet and took off their caps .
the members of a corps always received a <unk> in this way , too ; but they paid no attention to members of other corps ; they did not seem to see them .
this was not a discourtesy ; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps etiquette .
there seems to be no chilly distance existing between the <name> students and the professor ; but , on the contrary , a companionable intercourse , the opposite of <unk> and reserve .
when the professor enters a <unk> in the evening where students are gathered together , these rise up and take off their caps , and invite the old gentleman to sit with them and partake .
he accepts , and the pleasant talk and the beer flow for an hour or two , and by and by the professor , properly charged and comfortable , gives a cordial good night , while the students stand bowing and uncovered ; and then he moves on his happy way homeward with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold .
nobody finds fault or feels outraged ; no harm has been done .
it seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so , too .
i mean a corps dog  the common property of the organization , like the corps steward or head servant ; then there are other dogs , owned by individuals .
on a summer afternoon in the castle gardens , i have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds , in single file , each carrying a bright chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string .
it was a very imposing spectacle .
sometimes there would be as many dogs around the pavilion as students ; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness .
these dogs had a rather dry time of it ; for they were tied to the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except what they could get out of pawing at the <unk> , or trying to sleep and not succeeding .
however , they got a lump of sugar occasionally  they were fond of that .
it seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs ; but everybody else had them , too  old men and young ones , old women and nice young ladies .
if there is one spectacle that is <unk> than another , it is that of an elegantly dressed young <name> towing a dog by a string .
it is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love .
it seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised , which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties .
it would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going <unk> student carries an empty head .
just the contrary .
he has spent nine years in the gymnasium , under a system which allowed him no freedom , but vigorously compelled him to work like a slave .
consequently , he has left the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete , that the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its <unk> <unk> .
it is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium , he not only has a comprehensive education , but he knows what he knows  it is not <unk> with uncertainty , it is burnt into him so that it <name> stay .
for instance , he does not merely read and write greek , but speaks it ; the same with the latin .
foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium ; its rules are too severe .
they go to the university to put a mansard roof on their whole general education ; but the <name> student already has his mansard roof , so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some specialty , such as a particular branch of law , or diseases of the eye , or special study of the ancient gothic tongues .
so this <name> attends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch , and drinks his beer and <unk> his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day .
he has been in rigid bondage so long that the large <name> of the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly appreciates ; and as it can not last forever , he makes the most of it while it does last , and so lays up a good rest against the day that must see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or professional life .
chapter v at the students ' <unk> [ <unk> by wholesale ] one day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students ' <unk> .
we crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards , then turned to the left , entered a narrow alley , followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public house ; we were acquainted with its outside aspect , for it was visible from the hotel .
we went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty-five high .
it was a <unk> place .
there was no carpet .
across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables , and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students [ 1 .
see appendix c ] were sitting .
some of them were sipping wine , others were playing cards , others chess , other groups were chatting together , and many were smoking cigarettes while they waited for the coming duels .
nearly all of them wore colored caps ; there were white caps , green caps , blue caps , red caps , and <unk> ones ; so , all the five corps were present in strong force .
in the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight , <unk> swords with large protecting guards for the hand , and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone .
he understood his business ; for when a sword left his hand one could shave himself with it .
it was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke with students whose caps differed in color from their own .
this did not mean hostility , but only an armed <unk> .
it was considered that a person could strike harder in the duel , and with a more <name> interest , if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his antagonist ; therefore , comradeship between the corps was not permitted .
at intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official intercourse with each other , but nothing further .
for example , when the regular <unk> of one of the corps approaches , its president calls for volunteers from among the membership to offer battle ; three or more respond  but there must not be less than three ; the president lays their names before the other presidents , with the request that they furnish antagonists for these <unk> from among their corps .
this is promptly done .
it chanced that the present occasion was the <unk> of the red cap corps .
they were the <unk> , and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them .
the students fight duels in the room which i have described , two days in every week during seven and a half or eight months in every year .
this custom had continued in germany two hundred and fifty years .
to return to my narrative .
a student in a white cap met us and introduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps , and while we stood conversing , two <unk> figures were led in from another room .
they were students <unk> for the duel .
they were bareheaded ; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more , the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick <unk> which a sword could not cut through ; from <name> to ankle they were padded thoroughly against injury ; their arms were bandaged and <unk> , layer upon layer , until they looked like solid black logs .
these weird apparitions had been handsome youths , clad in fashionable attire , fifteen minutes before , but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in <unk> .
they strode along , with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies ; they did not hold them out themselves , but <unk> walked beside them and gave the needed support .
there was a rush for the vacant end of the room , now , and we followed and got good places .
the combatants were placed face to face , each with several members of his own corps about him to assist ; two seconds , well padded , and with swords in their hands , took their stations ; a student belonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good position to umpire the combat ; another student stood by with a watch and a <unk> to keep record of the time and the number and nature of the wounds ; a <unk> surgeon was present with his <unk> , his bandages , and his instruments .
after a moment 's pause the <unk> saluted the umpire respectfully , then one after another the several officials stepped forward , gracefully removed their caps and saluted him also , and returned to their places .
everything was ready now ; students stood crowded together in the foreground , and others stood behind them on chairs and tables .
every face was turned toward the center of attraction .
the combatants were watching each other with alert eyes ; a perfect stillness , a breathless interest reigned .
i felt that i was going to see some wary work .
but not so .
the instant the word was given , the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that i could not quite tell whether i saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air ; the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or <unk> was something wonderfully stirring , and they were struck with such terrific force that i could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault .
presently , in the midst of the <unk> , i saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim 's head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away .
the seconds cried " halt ! "
and knocked up the combatants ' swords with their own .
the <unk> sat down ; a student official stepped forward , examined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or twice ; the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound  and revealed a crimson gash two or three inches long , and proceeded to bind an oval piece of leather and a bunch of <unk> over it ; the <unk> stepped up and <unk> one for the opposition in his book .
then the <unk> took position again ; a small stream of blood was flowing down the side of the injured man 's head , and over his shoulder and down his body to the floor , but he did not seem to mind this .
the word was given , and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before ; once more the blows rained and rattled and flashed ; every few moments the <unk> seconds would notice that a sword was bent  then they called " halt ! "
struck up the contending weapons , and an assisting student straightened the bent one .
the wonderful turmoil went on  presently a bright spark sprung from a blade , and that blade broken in several pieces , sent one of its fragments flying to the ceiling .
a new sword was provided and the fight proceeded .
the exercise was tremendous , of course , and in time the fighters began to show great fatigue .
they were allowed to rest a moment , every little while ; they got other rests by wounding each other , for then they could sit down while the doctor applied the <unk> and bandages .
the law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if the men can hold out ; and as the pauses do not count , this duel was protracted to twenty or thirty minutes , i judged .
at last it was decided that the men were too much wearied to do battle longer .
they were led away drenched with crimson from head to foot .
that was a good fight , but it could not count , partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen minutes ( of actual fighting ) , and partly because neither man was disabled by his wound .
it was a drawn battle , and corps law requires that drawn battles shall be <unk> as soon as the adversaries are well of their hurts .
during the conflict , i had talked a little , now and then , with a young gentleman of the white cap corps , and he had mentioned that he was to fight next  and had also pointed out his <unk> , a young gentleman who was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and <unk> observing the duel then in progress .
my acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of giving me a kind of personal interest in it ; i naturally wished he might win , and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would not , because , although he was a notable <unk> , the <unk> was held to be his superior .
the duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked the previous one .
i stood close by , but could not tell which blows told and which did not , they fell and vanished so like flashes of light .
they all seemed to tell ; the swords always bent over the opponents ' heads , from the forehead back over the crown , and seemed to touch , all the way ; but it was not so  a protecting blade , invisible to me , was always interposed between .
at the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve or fifteen blows , and <unk> off twelve or fifteen , and no harm done ; then a sword became disabled , and a short rest followed whilst a new one was brought .
early in the next round the white corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it .
in the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head , and the former had his <unk> divided .
after that , the white corps student gave many severe wounds , but got none of the consequence in return .
at the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it ; the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any addition to them might be dangerous .
these injuries were a fearful spectacle , but are better left <unk> .
so , against expectation , my acquaintance was the <name> .
chapter <name> [ a sport that sometimes kills ] the third duel was brief and bloody .
the surgeon stopped it when he saw that one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight longer without <unk> his life .
the fourth duel was a tremendous encounter ; but at the end of five or six minutes the surgeon interfered once more : another man so severely hurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms .
i watched this engagement as i watched the others  with rapt interest and strong excitement , and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid open a cheek or a forehead ; and a conscious paling of my face when i occasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted .
my eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and <unk> wound  it was in his face and it carried away his  but no matter , i must not enter into details .
i had but a glance , and then turned quickly , but i would not have been looking at all if i had known what was coming .
no , that is probably not true ; one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming , but the interest and the excitement are so powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings ; and so , under the fierce exhilaration of the <unk> steel , he would yield and look after all .
sometimes spectators of these duels faint  and it does seem a very reasonable thing to do , too .
both parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the surgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour  a fact which is suggestive .
but this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by the assembled students .
it was past noon , therefore they ordered their landlord , downstairs , to send up hot <unk> , chickens , and such things , and these they ate , sitting comfortable at the several tables , whilst they chatted , disputed and laughed .
the door to the <unk> room stood open , meantime , but the cutting , sewing , <unk> , and <unk> going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb anyone 's appetite .
i went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile , but could not enjoy ; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended ; the stir and turmoil , and the music of the steel , were wanting here  one 's nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle , whilst the duel 's compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking .
finally the doctor finished , and the men who were to fight the closing battle of the day came forth .
a good many dinners were not completed , yet , but no matter , they could be eaten cold , after the battle ; therefore everybody crowded forth to see .
this was not a love duel , but a " satisfaction " affair .
these two students had quarreled , and were here to settle it .
they did not belong to any of the corps , but they were furnished with weapons and armor , and permitted to fight here by the five corps as a courtesy .
evidently these two young men were unfamiliar with the <unk> ceremonies , though they were not unfamiliar with the sword .
when they were placed in position they thought it was time to begin  and then did begin , too , and with a most impetuous energy , without waiting for anybody to give the word .
this vastly amused the spectators , and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter .
of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again .
at the word , the deluge of blows began , but before long the surgeon once more interfered  for the only reason which ever permits him to interfere  and the day 's war was over .
it was now two in the afternoon , and i had been present since half past nine in the morning .
the field of battle was indeed a red one by this time ; but some sawdust soon righted that .
there had been one duel before i arrived .
in it one of the men received many injuries , while the other one escaped without a scratch .
i had seen the heads and faces of ten youths <unk> in every direction by the keen <unk> blades , and yet had not seen a victim wince , nor heard a moan , or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting .
this was good fortitude , indeed .
such endurance is to be expected in savages and <unk> , for they are born and educated to it ; but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly <unk> young fellows is matter for surprise .
it was not merely under the excitement of the <unk> that this fortitude was shown ; it was shown in the surgeon 's room where an <unk> quiet reigned , and where there was no audience .
the doctor's <unk> brought out neither grimaces nor moans .
and in the fights it was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same tremendous spirit , after they were covered with streaming wounds , which they had shown in the beginning .
the world in general looks upon the college duels as very <unk> affairs : true , but considering that the college duel is fought by boys ; that the swords are real swords ; and that the head and face are exposed , it seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it .
people laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered up with armor that he can not be hurt .
but it is not so ; his eyes and ears are protected , but the rest of his face and head are bare .
he can not only be badly wounded , but his life is in danger ; and he would sometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon .
it is not intended that his life shall be <unk> .
fatal accidents are possible , however .
for instance , the student 's sword may break , and the end of it fly up behind his antagonist 's ear and cut an artery which could not be reached if the sword remained whole .
this has happened , sometimes , and death has resulted on the spot .
formerly the <unk> armpits were not protected  and at that time the swords were pointed , whereas they are blunt , now ; so an artery in the armpit was sometimes cut , and death followed .
then in the days of <unk> swords , a spectator was an occasional victim  the end of a broken sword flew five or ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart , and death ensued instantly .
the student duels in germany occasion two or three deaths every year , now , but this arises only from the carelessness of the wounded men ; they eat or drink <unk> , or commit excesses in the way of <unk> ; inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that it can not be arrested .
indeed , there is blood and pain and danger enough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of respect .
all the customs , all the laws , all the details , pertaining to the student duel are quaint and naive .
the grave , precise , and courtly ceremony with which the thing is conducted , <unk> it with a sort of antique charm .
this dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament , not the <unk> .
the laws are as curious as they are strict .
for instance , the <unk> may step forward from the line he is placed upon , if he chooses , but never back of it .
if he steps back of it , or even leans back , it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an advantage ; so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace .
it would seem natural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously , and against one 's <name> and intent  yet this unconsciousness is not allowed .
again : if under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a <unk> , he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows ; his corps are ashamed of him : they call him " hare foot , " which is the <name> equivalent for <unk> .
chapter vii [ how <unk> fought ] in addition to the corps laws , there are some corps usages which have the force of laws .
perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who is no longer an exempt  that is a freshman  has remained a sophomore some little time without <unk> to fight ; some day , the president , instead of calling for volunteers , <name> appoint this sophomore to measure swords with a student of another corps ; he is free to decline  everybody says so  there is no compulsion .
this is all true  but i have not heard of any student who did decline ; to decline and still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous , and properly so , since he knew , when he joined , that his main business , as a member , would be to fight .
no , there is no law against declining  except the law of custom , which is <unk> stronger than written law , everywhere .
the ten men whose duels i had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed , as i had supposed they would , but came back , one after another , as soon as they were free of the surgeon , and mingled with the assemblage in the <unk> .
the <unk> student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three , and talked with us during the <unk> .
he could not talk very well , because his opponent 's sword had cut his <unk> in two , and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches ; neither could he eat easily , still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome luncheon while the last duel was preparing .
the man who was the worst hurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement .
a good part of his face was covered with patches and bandages , and all the rest of his head was covered and concealed by them .
it is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other public places in this kind of array , and that this <unk> often keeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him .
newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public gardens of heidelberg .
it is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face , because the scars they leave <name> show so well there ; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible .
it does not look reasonable , but it is roundly asserted and maintained , nevertheless ; i am sure of one thing  scars are plenty enough in germany , among the young men ; and very grim ones they are , too .
they <unk> the face in angry red <unk> , and are permanent and <unk> .
some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect ; and the effect is striking when several such accent the milder ones , which form a city map on a man 's face ; they suggest the " burned district " then .
we had often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts .
it transpired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision was reached  duels in which he either whipped or was whipped  for drawn battles do not count .
[ 1 ] after a student has received his ribbon , he is " free " ; he can cease from fighting , without reproach  except some one insult him ; his president can not appoint him to fight ; he can volunteer if he wants to , or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so .
statistics show that he does not prefer to remain quiescent .
they show that the duel has a singular fascination about it somewhere , for these free men , so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge , are always <unk> .
a corps student told me it was of record that <name> <unk> fought thirty-two of these duels in a single summer term when he was in college .
so he fought twenty-nine after his badge had given him the right to retire from the field .
1 .
from my <unk>  dined in a hotel a few miles up the neckar , in a room whose walls were <name> all over with framed <unk> of the five corps ; some were recent , but many <unk> <unk> , and were pictured in <unk>  the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years ago .
nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast .
in one <unk> representing ( as each of these pictures did ) an entire corps , i took pains to count the ribbons : there were twenty-seven members , and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge .
the statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars .
two days in every week are devoted to <unk> .
the rule is rigid that there must be three duels on each of these days ; there are generally more , but there can not be fewer .
there were six the day i was present ; sometimes there are seven or eight .
it is insisted that eight duels a week  four for each of the two days  is too low an average to draw a calculation from , but i <name> reckon from that basis , preferring an <unk> to an <unk> of the case .
this requires about four hundred and eighty or five hundred <unk> a year  for in summer the college term is about three and a half months , and in <name> it is four months and sometimes longer .
of the seven hundred and fifty students in the university at the time i am writing of , only eighty belonged to the five corps , and it is only these corps that do the <unk> ; occasionally other students borrow the arms and <unk> of the five corps in order to settle a quarrel , but this does not happen every <unk> .
[ 2 ] consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred and fifty duels a year .
this average gives six fights a year to each of the eighty .
this large work could not be accomplished if the <unk> stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer .
2 .
they have to borrow the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise .
as i understand it , the public authorities , all over germany , allow the five corps to keep swords , but do not allow them to use them .
this is law is rigid ; it is only the execution of it that is lax .
of course , where there is so much fighting , the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil .
one often sees them , at the tables in the castle grounds , using their whips or canes to illustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about ; and between the duels , on the day whose history i have been writing , the swords were not always idle ; every now and then we heard a succession of the keen hissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its paces in the air , and this informed us that a student was practicing .
necessarily , this unceasing attention to the <name> develops an expert occasionally .
he becomes famous in his own university , his renown spreads to other universities .
he is invited to <unk> , to fight with a <unk> expert ; if he is victorious , he <name> be invited to other colleges , or those colleges <name> send their experts to him .
americans and englishmen often join one or another of the five corps .
a year or two ago , the principal heidelberg expert was a big <unk> ; he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory behind him all about germany ; but at last a little student in <unk> defeated him .
there was formerly a student in heidelberg who had picked up somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead of cleaving down from above .
while the trick lasted he won in sixteen successive duels in his university ; but by that time observers had discovered what his charm was , and how to break it , therefore his championship ceased .
a rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different corps is strict .
in the <unk> , in the parks , on the street , and anywhere and everywhere that the students go , caps of a color group themselves together .
if all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one , and that one had two <unk> students at it and ten vacant places , the <unk> , the <unk> , the white caps , and the green caps , seeking seats , would go by that table and not seem to see it , nor seem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds .
the student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the <unk> , wore the white cap  prussian corps .
he introduced us to many white caps , but to none of another color .
the corps etiquette extended even to us , who were strangers , and required us to group with the white corps only , and speak only with the white corps , while we were their guests , and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors .
once i wished to examine some of the swords , but an american student said , " it would not be quite polite ; these now in the windows all have red <unk> or blue ; they <name> bring in some with white <unk> presently , and those you can handle freely . "
when a sword was broken in the first duel , i wanted a piece of it ; but its hilt was the wrong color , so it was considered best and <unk> to await a <unk> season .
it was brought to me after the room was cleared , and i <name> now make a " <unk> " sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen , to show the width of the weapon .
[ figure 1 ] the length of these swords is about three feet , and they are quite heavy .
one 's disposition to cheer , during the course of the duels or at their close , was naturally strong , but corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort .
however brilliant a contest or a victory might be , no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved .
a dignified gravity and repression were maintained at all times .
when the <unk> was finished and we were ready to go , the gentlemen of the prussian corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps in the courteous <name> way , and also shook hands ; their brethren of the same order took off their caps and bowed , but without shaking hands ; the gentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated white caps  they fell apart , apparently unconsciously , and left us an unobstructed pathway , but did not seem to see us or know we were there .
if we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps , the white caps , without meaning any offense , would have observed the etiquette of their order and ignored our presence .
[ how strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life !
i had not been home a full half-hour , after witnessing those playful <unk> , when circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real one  a duel with no <unk> limitation in the matter of results , but a battle to the death .
an account of it , in the next chapter , <name> show the reader that duels between boys , for fun , and duels between men in <name> , are very different affairs . ]

since it is always fought in the open air , the combatants are nearly sure to catch cold .
m. <name> de <unk> , the most inveterate of the french <unk> , had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a confirmed invalid ; and the best physician in <name> has expressed the opinion that if he goes on <unk> for fifteen or twenty years more  unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where <unk> and draughts can not intrude  he <name> eventually endanger his life .
this ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn in maintaining that the french duel is the most <unk> of <unk> because of the <unk> exercise it affords .
and it ought also to moderate that foolish talk about french <unk> and <unk> monarchs being the only people who are immoral .
but it is time to get at my subject .
as soon as i heard of the late fiery outbreak between m. <unk> and m. <unk> in the french assembly , i knew that trouble must follow .
i knew it because a long personal friendship with m. <unk> revealed to me the desperate and implacable nature of the man .
vast as are his physical proportions , i knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest frontiers of his person .
i did not wait for him to call on me , but went at once to him .
as i had expected , i found the brave fellow steeped in a profound french calm .
i say french calm , because french calmness and english calmness have points of difference .
he was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture , now and then <unk> chance fragments of it across the room with his foot ; grinding a constant <unk> of curses through his set teeth ; and halting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the pile which he had been building of it on the table .
he threw his arms around my neck , bent me over his stomach to his breast , kissed me on both cheeks , hugged me four or five times , and then placed me in his own arm-chair .
as soon as i had got well again , we began business at once .
i said i supposed he would wish me to act as his second , and he said , " of course . "
i said i must be allowed to act under a french name , so that i might be <unk> from <unk> in my country , in case of fatal results .
he winced here , probably at the suggestion that <unk> was not regarded with respect in <name> .
however , he agreed to my requirement .
this accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports m. <unk> 's second was apparently a frenchman .
first , we <name> up my principal 's <name> .
i insisted upon this , and stuck to my point .
i said i had never heard of a man in his right mind going out to fight a duel without first making his <name> .
he said he had never heard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind .
when he had finished the <name> , he wished to proceed to a choice of his " last words . "
he wanted to know how the following words , as a dying exclamation , struck me : " i die for my god , for my country , for freedom of speech , for progress , and the universal brotherhood of man ! "
i objected that this would require too lingering a death ; it was a good speech for a <unk> , but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor .
we <unk> over a good many <unk> <unk> , but i finally got him to cut his obituary down to this , which he copied into his <unk> , purposing to get it by heart : " i die that <name> might live . "
i said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy ; but he said relevancy was a matter of no consequence in last words , what you wanted was thrill .
the next thing in order was the choice of weapons .
my principal said he was not feeling well , and would leave that and the other details of the proposed meeting to me .
therefore i wrote the following note and carried it to m. <unk> 's friend : sir : m. <unk> accepts m. <unk> 's challenge , and <unk> me to propose <unk> as the place of meeting ; tomorrow morning at daybreak as the time ; and axes as the weapons .
i am , sir , with great respect , <name> twain .
m. <unk> 's friend read this note , and shuddered .
then he turned to me , and said , with a suggestion of severity in his tone : " have you considered , sir , what would be the inevitable result of such a meeting as this ? "
" well , for instance , what would it be ? "
" bloodshed ! "
" that 's about the size of it , " i said .
" now , if it is a fair question , what was your side proposing to shed ? "
i had him there .
he saw he had made a blunder , so he hastened to explain it away .
he said he had spoken <unk> .
then he added that he and his principal would enjoy axes , and indeed prefer them , but such weapons were barred by the french code , and so i must change my proposal .
i walked the floor , turning the thing over in my mind , and finally it occurred to me that <unk> at fifteen paces would be a likely way to get a verdict on the field of honor .
so i framed this idea into a proposition .
but it was not accepted .
the code was in the way again .
i proposed rifles ; then double-barreled shotguns ; then colt 's navy revolvers .
these being all rejected , i reflected awhile , and sarcastically suggested <unk> at three-quarters of a mile .
i always hate to fool away a humorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor ; and it filled me with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last proposition to his principal .
he came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea of <unk> at three-quarters of a mile , but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them .
then i said : " well , i am at the end of my string , now .
perhaps you would be good enough to suggest a weapon ?
perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time ? "
his countenance brightened , and he said with alacrity : " oh , without doubt , monsieur ! "
so he fell to hunting in his pockets  pocket after pocket , and he had plenty of them  muttering all the while , " now , what could i have done with them ? "
at last he was successful .
he fished out of his vest pocket a couple of little things which i carried to the light and ascertained to be pistols .
they were <unk> and <unk> , and very dainty and pretty .
i was not able to speak for emotion .
i silently <name> one of them on my watch-chain , and returned the other .
my companion in crime now unrolled a <unk> containing several cartridges , and gave me one of them .
i asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were to be allowed but one shot apiece .
he replied that the french code permitted no more .
i then begged him to go and suggest a distance , for my mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been put upon it .
he named sixty-five yards .
i nearly lost my <name> .
i said : " sixty-five yards , with these instruments ?
<unk> would be <unk> at fifty .
consider , my friend , you and i are banded together to destroy life , not make it eternal . "
but with all my persuasions , all my arguments , i was only able to get him to reduce the distance to thirty-five yards ; and even this concession he made with reluctance , and said with a sigh , " i wash my hands of this slaughter ; on your head be it . "
there was nothing for me but to go home to my old <unk> and tell my humiliating story .
when i entered , m. <unk> was laying his last lock of hair upon the altar .
he sprang toward me , exclaiming : " you have made the fatal arrangements  i see it in your eye ! "
" i have . "
his face paled a trifle , and he leaned upon the table for support .
he breathed thick and heavily for a moment or two , so tumultuous were his feelings ; then he hoarsely whispered : " the weapon , the weapon !
quick !
what is the weapon ? "
" this ! "
and i displayed that <unk> thing .
he cast but one glance at it , then swooned <unk> to the floor .
when he came to , he said mournfully : " the unnatural calm to which i have subjected myself has told upon my nerves .
but away with weakness !
i <name> confront my fate like a man and a frenchman . "
he rose to his feet , and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has never been approached by man , and has seldom been surpassed by statues .
then he said , in his deep bass tones : " behold , i am calm , i am ready ; reveal to me the distance . "
" thirty-five yards . "
...
i could not lift him up , of course ; but i rolled him over , and poured water down his back .
he presently came to , and said : " thirty-five yards  without a rest ?
but why ask ?
since murder was that man 's intention , why should he <unk> with small details ?
but <name> you one thing : in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of <name> meets death . "
after a long silence he asked : " was nothing said about that man 's family standing up with him , as an offset to my bulk ?
but no matter ; i would not stoop to make such a suggestion ; if he is not <name> enough to suggest it himself , he is welcome to this advantage , which no honorable man would take . "
he now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection , which lasted some minutes ; after which he broke silence with : " the hour  what is the hour fixed for the collision ? "
" <name> , tomorrow . "
he seemed greatly surprised , and immediately said : " insanity !
i never heard of such a thing .
nobody is abroad at such an hour . "
" that is the reason i named it .
do you mean to say you want an audience ? "
" it is no time to <unk> words .
i am astonished that m. <unk> should ever have agreed to so strange an innovation .
go at once and require a later hour . "
i ran downstairs , threw open the front door , and almost plunged into the arms of m. <unk> 's second .
he said : " i have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the hour chosen , and begs you <name> consent to change it to half past nine . "
" any courtesy , sir , which it is in our power to extend is at the service of your excellent principal .
we agree to the proposed change of time . "
" i beg you to accept the thanks of my client . "
then he turned to a person behind him , and said , " you hear , m. <unk> , the hour is altered to half past nine . "
whereupon m. <unk> bowed , expressed his thanks , and went away .
my accomplice continued : " if agreeable to you , your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the field in the same carriage as is customary . "
" it is entirely agreeable to me , and i am obliged to you for mentioning the surgeons , for i am afraid i should not have thought of them .
how many shall i want ?
i supposed two or three <name> be enough ? "
" two is the customary number for each party .
i refer to <unk> surgeons ; but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients , it <name> be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting surgeons , from among the highest in the profession .
these <name> come in their own private carriages .
have you engaged a hearse ? "
" bless my stupidity , i never thought of it !
i <name> attend to it right away .
i must seem very ignorant to you ; but you must try to overlook that , because i have never had any experience of such a swell duel as this before .
i have had a good deal to do with duels on the pacific coast , but i see now that they were crude affairs .
a hearse  sho !
we used to leave the elected lying around loose , and let anybody cord them up and cart them off that wanted to .
have you anything further to suggest ? "
" nothing , except that the head <unk> shall ride together , as is usual .
the subordinates and <unk> <name> go on foot , as is also usual .
i <name> see you at eight o'clock in the morning , and we <name> then arrange the order of the procession .
i have the honor to bid you a good day . "
i returned to my client , who said , " very well ; at what hour is the engagement to begin ? "
" half past nine . "
" very good indeed .
have you sent the fact to the newspapers ? "
" sir !
if after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment deem me capable of so base a treachery  " " tut , tut !
what words are these , my dear friend ?
have i wounded you ?
ah , forgive me ; i am <unk> you with labor .
therefore go on with the other details , and drop this one from your list .
the <unk> <unk> <name> be sure to attend to it .
or i myself  yes , to make certain , i <name> drop a note to my journalistic friend , m. <unk>  " " oh , come to think of it , you may save yourself the trouble ; that other second has informed m .
<unk> . "
" h 'm !
i might have known it .
it is just like that <unk> , who always wants to make a display . "
at half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of <unk> in the following order : first came our carriage  nobody in it but m. <unk> and myself ; then a carriage containing m. <unk> and his second ; then a carriage containing two <unk> who did not believe in god , and these had ms. funeral orations projecting from their breast pockets ; then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their cases of instruments ; then eight private carriages containing consulting surgeons ; then a hack containing a coroner ; then the two <unk> ; then a carriage containing the head <unk> ; then a train of assistants and <unk> on foot ; and after these came plodding through the fog a long procession of camp followers , police , and citizens generally .
it was a <name> turnout , and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner weather .
there was no conversation .
i spoke several times to my principal , but i judge he was not aware of it , for he always referred to his note-book and muttered absently , " i die that <name> might live . "
arrived on the field , my <unk> and i paced off the thirty-five yards , and then <name> lots for choice of position .
this latter was but an ornamental ceremony , for all the <unk> were alike in such weather .
these preliminaries being ended , i went to my principal and asked him if he was ready .
