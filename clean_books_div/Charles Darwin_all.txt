my duty , in acknowledging the great obligations under which i lie to many naturalists , affords me most sincere pleasure .
i had originally intended to have described only a single abnormal cirripede , from the shores of south <name> , and was led , for the sake of comparison , to examine the internal parts of as many genera as i could procure .
under these circumstances , mr. j. e. gray , in the most disinterested manner , suggested to me making a monograph on the entire class , although he himself had already collected materials for this same object .
furthermore , mr. gray most kindly gave me his strong support , when i applied to the trustees of the british museum for the use of the public collection ; and i here most respectfully beg to offer my grateful <unk> to the trustees , for their most liberal and unfettered permission of examining , and when necessary , <unk> the specimens in the magnificent collection of cirripedes , commenced by dr. leach , and steadily added to , during many years , by mr. gray .
considering the difficulty in determining the species in this class , had it not been for this most liberal permission by the trustees , the public collection would have been of no use to me , or to any other naturalist , in systematically classifying the cirripedes .
previously to mr. gray suggesting to me the present monograph , mr. stutchbury , of bristol , had offered to intrust to me his truly beautiful collection , the fruit of many years ' labour .
at that time i refused this most generous offer , intending to confine myself to anatomical observations ; but i have since accepted it , and still have the entire splendid collection for my free use .
mr. stutchbury , with unwearied kindness , further supplied me with fresh specimens for dissection , and with much valuable information .
at about the same period , mr. cuming strongly urged me to take up the subject , and his advice had more weight with me than that of almost any other person .
he placed his whole magnificent collection at my disposal , and urged me to treat it as if it were my own : whenever i told him that i thought it necessary , he permitted me to open unique specimens of great value , and <unk> the included animal .
i shall always feel deeply honoured by the confidence reposed in me by mr. cuming and mr. stutchbury .
i lie under obligations to so many naturalists , that i am , in truth , at a loss how to express my gratitude .
mr. peach , over and over again , sent me fresh specimens of several species , and more especially of scalpellum vulgare , which were of invaluable assistance to me in making out the singular sexual relations in that species .
mr. peach , furthermore , made for me observations on several living individuals .
mr. w. thompson , the distinguished natural historian of ireland , has sent me the finest collection of british species , and their varieties , which i have seen , together with many very valuable ms. observations , and the results of experiments .
prof. <name> procured for me the <name> of some very interesting specimens in the college of surgeons , and has always given me his invaluable advice and opinion , when consulted by me .
professor e. forbes has been , as usual , most kind in obtaining for me specimens and information of all kinds .
to the rev .
r. t. lowe i am indebted for his particularly interesting collection of cirripedes from the island of madeira  a collection offering a singular proof what treasures skill and industry can discover in the most confined locality .
the well-known <unk> , mr. j. g. <unk> , has sent for my examination a very fine collection of british specimens , together with a copious ms. list of <unk> , with the authorities quoted .
to the kindness of messrs. <unk> <name> , <unk> reeve , g. <unk> , g. b. sowerby , <unk> , d. sharpe , <unk> , hancock , <name> white , dr. <unk> , sir <name> richardson , and several other gentlemen , i am greatly indebted for specimens and information : to mr. hancock i am further indebted for several long and interesting letters on the burrowing of cirripedes .
nor are my obligations confined to british naturalists .
dr. aug. gould , of boston , has most kindly transmitted to me some very interesting specimens ; as has prof. agassiz other specimens collected by himself in the southern states .
to mr. j. d. <name> , i am much indebted for several long letters , containing original and valuable information on points connected with the anatomy of the cirripedia .
to mr. <name> i am likewise indebted for information and assistance .
both the celebrated professors , milne edwards and müller , have lent me , from the great public collections under their charge , specimens which i should not otherwise have seen .
to professor w. <unk> , of <unk> , i am indebted for the examination of his whole collection .
i have , in a former publication , expressed my thanks to professor steenstrup , but i must be permitted here to repeat them , for a truly valuable present of a specimen of the anelasma <unk> of this work .
i <name> conclude my thanks to all the above british and foreign naturalists , by stating my firm conviction , that if a person wants to ascertain how much true kindness exists amongst the disciples of natural history , he should undertake , as i have done , a monograph on some tribe of animals , and let his wish for assistance be generally known .
had it not been for the <name> society , i know not how the present volume could have been published ; and therefore i beg to return my most sincere thanks to the council of this distinguished institution .
to mr. g. b. sowerby , <unk> , i am under obligations for the great care he has taken in making preparatory drawings , and in subsequently engraving them .
i believe naturalists <name> find that the ten plates here given are faithful <unk> of nature .
in <unk> , it is the usual and excellent custom to give a history of the subject , but this has been so fully done by <unk> , in his <unk> zur <unk> der <unk> , ' and by m. g. <name> st. <unk> , in his <unk> sur <unk> des <unk> , ' that it would be superfluous here to repeat the same list of authors .
i <name> only add , that since the date , 1834 , of the above works , the only important papers with which i am acquainted , are , 1st .
dr. <unk> 'on the structure of the shell in sessile cirripedes , ' in the <unk> of anatomy and physiology ; ' 2d .

mr. c. spence bate 's valuable paper on the same subject , lately published , ( oct. 1851 , ) in the 'annals of natural history ; ' and lastly , m. <unk> has described , in the <unk> journal of natural history , jan. 1851 , ' the lithotrya nicobarica , and has discussed its powers of burrowing into rocks .
i have given the specific or <unk> characters , deduced from the external parts alone , in both latin and english .
as i found , during the progress of this work , that a similarly <unk> character of the softer internal parts , was very useful in discriminating the species , i have inserted it after the ordinary specific character .
in those cases in which a genus includes only a single species , i have followed the practice of some botanists , and given only the generic character , believing it to be impossible , before a second species is discovered , to know which characters <name> prove of specific , in <unk> to generic , value .
in accordance with the rules of the british association , i have faithfully endeavoured to give to each species the first name attached to it , subsequently to the introduction of the <unk> system , in <unk> , in the tenth edition [ 1 ] of the <unk> <unk> . '
in accordance with the rules , i have rejected all names before this date , and all ms. names .
in one single instance , for reasons fully assigned in the proper place , i have broken through the great law of priority .
i have given much fewer <unk> than is usual in <unk> works ; this partly arises from my conviction that giving references to works , in which there is not any original matter , or in which the plates are not of a high order of excellence , is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history , and partly , from the impossibility of feeling certain to which species the short descriptions given in most works are applicable ;  thus , to take the commonest species , the lepas anatifera , i have not found a single description ( with the exception of the anatomical description by m. <name> st. <unk> ) by which this species can be certainly <unk> from the almost equally common lepas <unk> .
i have , however , been fortunate in having been permitted to examine a considerable number of <unk> named specimens , ( to which i have attached the sign ( ! )
used by botanists , ) so that several of my <unk> are certainly correct .
[ 1 ] in the rules published by the british association , the 12th edition , ( <unk> , ) is specified , but i am informed by mr. strickland that this is an error , and that the <unk> method was followed in the 10th edition .
the lepadidæ , or pedunculated cirripedes , have been neglected under a systematic point of view , to a degree which i can not quite understand : no doubt they are subject to considerable variation , and as long as the internal surfaces of the valves and all the organs of the animal 's body , are passed over as unimportant , there <name> occasionally be some difficulty in the identification of the several forms , and still more in settling the limits of the variability of the species .
but i suspect the pedunculated cirripedes have , in fact , been neglected owing to their close affinity , and the consequent necessity of their being included in the same work with the sessile cirripedes ; for these latter <name> ever present , i am fully convinced , insuperable difficulties in their identification by external characters alone .
i <name> here only further remark , that in the introduction i have given my reasons for assigning distinct names to the several valves , and to some parts of the included animal 's body ; and that in the introductory remarks , under the general description of the lepadidæ , i have given an abstract of my anatomical observations .

monograph on the cirripedia .
introduction .
i should have been enabled to have made this volume more complete , had i deferred its publication until i had finished my examination of all the other known cirripedes ; but my work would thus have been rendered <unk> large .
until this examination is completed , it <name> be more prudent not to discuss , in detail , the position of the lepadidæ amongst the cirripedia , or of these latter in the great class of crustacea , to which they now , by almost universal consent , have been assigned .
i may , however , remark that i believe the cirripedia do not approach , by a single character , any animal beyond the confines of the crustacea : where such an approach has been imagined , it has been founded on erroneous observations ; for instance , the closed tube within the stomach , described by m. <name> st. <unk> ( to whose excellent paper i am greatly indebted ) , as indicating an affinity to the <unk> , is , i am convinced , nothing but a strong <unk> lining , which i have often seen ejected with the excrement .
again , a most distinguished author has stated that the cirripedia differ from the crustacea :  1st .
in having " a calcareous shell and true mantle ; " but there is no essential difference , as shown by <unk> , in the shells in these two classes ; and cirripedes certainly have no more claim to a mantle than have the <unk> <unk> .
2d .
" in the sexes joined in one individual ; " but this , as we shall see , is not constant , nor of very much weight , even if constant .
3d .
" in the body not being ringed ; " but if the outer integument of the thorax of any cirripede be well cleaned , it <name> be seen , ( as was long ago shown by <name> st. <unk> ) , to be most distinctly articulated .
4th .
" in having <unk> glands ; " but these glands are , in truth , the ovaria .
5th .
" in the liver being formed on the <unk> type ; " i do not think this is the case , but i do not quite understand the point in question .
6th .
" in not having a head or organs of sense ; " this is singularly erroneous : professor <unk> has shown the existence of eyes in the mature cirripede ; the antennæ , though preserved , certainly become functionless soon after the last metamorphosis ; but there exist other organs of sense , which i believe serve for smelling and hearing : and lastly , so far from there being no head , the whole of the cirripede externally visible , consists exclusively of the three anterior segments of the head .
the <unk> , cirripedia , can be divided into three orders ; the first of which , mainly characterised by having six pair of thoracic cirri , includes all common cirripedes : these latter may be divided into three families ,  the lepadidæ , or pedunculated cirripedes , the subject of the present memoir ; the <unk> containing the single genus <unk> or <unk> ; and , lastly , the <unk> , which consist of two very distinct sub-families , the <unk> and <unk> .
of the other two orders above alluded to , one <name> , i believe , contain the remarkable burrowing genus <unk> , lately described by mr. hancock , and a second burrowing genus , or rather family , obtained by me on the coast of south <name> .
the third order is highly singular , and differs as much from all other cirripedes as does a <unk> from other crustaceans ; it has a <unk> mouth , but is destitute of an anus ; it has not any limbs , and is as plainly articulated as the larva of a fly ; it is entirely naked , without valves , carapace , or capitulum , and is attached to the cirripede , in the sack of which it is parasitic , by two distinct threads , terminating in the usual larval , prehensile antennæ .
i intend to call this cirripede , proteolepas .
i mention it here for the sake of calling attention to any parasite at all answering to this description .
nomenclature of the valves .
[ illustration : figure i .
capitulum . ]
[ illustration : figure ii .
scutum of lepas . ]
[ illustration : figure iii .
tergum of lepas . ]
although the present volume is strictly systematic , i <name> , under the general description of the lepadidæ , give a very brief abstract of some of the most interesting points in their internal anatomy , and in the metamorphoses of the whole class , which i <name> hereafter to treat , with the necessary illustrations , in detail .
i enter on the subject of the metamorphoses the more readily , as by this means alone can the homologies of the different parts be clearly understood .
on the names given to the different parts of <unk> i have unwillingly found it indispensable to give names to several valves , and to some few of the softer parts of cirripedes .
the accompanying figure of an imaginary scalpellum includes every valve ; the two most important valves of lepas are also given , in which the direction of the lines of growth and general shape differ from those of scalpellum as much as they do in any genus .
the names which i have imposed <name> , i <name> , be thus acquired without much difficulty .
whoever <name> refer to the published descriptions of recent and fossil cirripedia , <name> find the utmost confusion in the existing nomenclature : thus , the valve named in the woodcut the scutum , has been designated by various well-known naturalists as the " ventral , " the " anterior , " the " inferior , " the " <unk> , " and the " <unk> " valve ; the first two of these titles have , moreover , been applied to the rostrum or rostral valve of sessile cirripedes .
the tergum has been called the " dorsal , " the " posterior , " the " superior , " the " central , " the " terminal , " the " <unk> , " and the " <unk> " valve .
the <name> has received the first two of these identical epithets , viz .
the " dorsal " and the " posterior ; " and likewise has been called the " <unk> . "
the confusion , however , becomes far worse , when any individual valve is described , for the very same margin which is anterior or inferior in the eyes of one author , is the posterior or superior in those of another ; it has often happened to me that i have been quite unable even to conjecture to which margin or part of a valve an author was referring .
moreover , the length of these double titles is inconvenient .
hence , as i have to describe all the recent and fossil species , i trust i may be thought justified in giving short names to each of the more important valves , these being common to the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes .
the part supported by the peduncle , and which is generally , though not always , protected by valves , i have designated the capitulum .
the title of peduncle , which is either naked or <unk> , requires no explanation ; the scales on it , and the lower valves of the capitulum , are arranged in whorls , which , in the latin specific descriptions , i have called by the botanical term of <unk> .
i have applied the term scutum to the most important and persistent of the valves , and which can generally be recognised by the hollow giving attachment to the adductor scutorum muscle , from the resemblance which the two valves taken together bear to a shield , and from their office of protecting the front side of the body .
from the protection afforded by the two terga to the <unk> surface of the animal , these valves have been thus called .
the term <name> [ 2 ] is a mere translation of the name already used by some authors , of <unk> .
[ 2 ] in the <name> of fossil species of scalpellum , i have found it necessary to distinguish different parts , viz. , a , the <unk> , of which half is seen ; b , the <unk> ; and c , the <unk> .
the rostrum has been so called from its relative position to the <name> or keel .
there is often a sub-carina and a sub-rostrum .
the remaining valves , when present , have been called latera ; there is always one large upper one inserted between the lower halves of the scuta and terga , and this i have named the upper latus or latera ; the other latera in pollicipes are numerous , and require no special names ; in scalpellum , where there are at most only three pair beneath the upper latera , it is convenient to speak of them ( <unk> woodcut , i , ) as the carinal , infra-median , and rostral latera .
as each valve often requires ( especially amongst the fossil species ) a distinct description , i have found it indispensable to give names to each margin .
these have mostly been taken from the name of the adjoining valve , ( see fig .
i . )
in lepas , pollicipes , & c. , the margin of the scutum adjoining the tergum and upper latus , is not divided ( fig .
ii ) into two distinct lines , as it is in scalpellum , and is therefore called the <unk> margin .
in scalpellum ( fig .
i ) these two margins are separately named tergal and lateral .
the <name> formed by the meeting of the basal and lateral or <unk> margins , i call the <unk> <name> ; that formed by the basal and occludent margins , i call , from its <unk> to the rostrum , the rostral <name> .
in pollicipes the carinal margin of the tergum can be divided into an upper and lower carinal margin ; of this there is only a trace ( fig .
i ) in scalpellum .
that margin in the scuta and terga which opens and shuts for the <unk> and retraction of the cirri , i have called the occludent margin .
in the terga of lepas ( fig .
iii ) and some other genera , the occludent margin is highly protuberant and arched , or even formed of two distinct sides .
occasionally , i have referred to what i have called the primordial valves : these are not calcified ; they are formed at the first exuviation , when the larval integuments are shed : in mature cirripedes they are always seated , when not worn away , on the umbones of the valves .
the membrane connecting the valves , and forming the peduncle , and sometimes in a harder condition replacing the valves , i have often found it convenient to designate by its proper chemical name of chitine , instead of by horny , or other such equivalents .
when this membrane at any articulation sends in rigid projections or crests , for the attachment of muscles or any other purpose , i call them , after <unk> , <unk> .
for the underlying true skin , i use the term corium .
the animal 's body is included within the capitulum , within what i call the sack ( see pl .
iv , figs .
2 and <unk> a , and pl .
ix , fig .
4 ) .
the body consists of the thorax supporting the cirri , and of an especial enlargement , or downward prolongation of the thorax , which includes the stomach , and which i have called the prosoma .
( pl .
ix , fig .
4 n ) .
the cirri are composed of two arms or rami , supported on a common segment or support , which i call the pedicel .
the caudal appendages are two little projections , either <unk> <unk> ( pl .
iv , fig .
<unk> a ) , on each side of the anus , and just above the long <unk> penis .
on the thorax and prosoma , or on the pedicels of the cirri , there are in several genera , long , thin , tapering filaments , which have generally been supposed to serve as branchiæ ; these i call simply filaments , or filamentary appendages ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 <unk> ) .
the mouth ( fig .
4 b ) is prominent , and consists of palpi soldered to the labrum ; mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , these latter serve as an under lip ; to these several organs i sometimes apply the title used by entomologists , of " trophi . "
beneath the outer maxillæ , there are either two simple orifices or tubular projections ; these , i believe , serve as organs of smell , and have hence called them the olfactory orifices .
within the sack , there are often two sheets of ova ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 b ) , these i call ( after steenstrup , and other authors ) the ovigerous lamellæ ; they are united to two little folds of skin ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) , which i call the ovigerous fræna .
from the peculiar curved position which the animal 's body occupies within the capitulum , i have found it far more convenient ( not to mention the confusion of nomenclature already existing ) to apply the term rostral instead of ventral , and carinal instead of dorsal , to almost all the external and internal parts of the animal .
cirripedes have generally been figured with their surfaces of attachment downwards , hence i speak of the lower or basal margins and angles , and of those pointing in an opposite direction as the upper ; strictly speaking , as we shall presently see , the exact centre of the usually broad and flat surface of attachment is the anterior end of the animal , and the upper tips of the terga , the posterior end of that part of the animal which is externally visible ; but in some cases , for instance in <unk> , where the base is deeply concave , and where the width of the shell far exceeds the depth , it seemed almost ridiculous to call this , the anterior extremity ; as likewise does it in balanus to call the united tips of the terga , lying deeply within the shell , the most posterior point of the animal , as seen externally .
i have followed the example of botanists , and added the <unk> [ ! ]
to <unk> , when i have seen an authentic specimen bearing the name in question .
every locality , under each species , is given from specimens <unk> in a manner and under circumstances appearing to me worthy of full confidence ,  the specific determination being in each case made by myself .

<unk>  i <name> here briefly describe the metamorphoses , as far as known , common to all cirripedia , but more especially in relation to the present family .
i may premise , that since vaughan thompson 's capital discovery of the larvæ in the last stage of development in balanus , much has been done on this subject : this same author subsequently published [ 4 ] in the 'philosophical transactions , ' an account of the larvæ of lepas and conchoderma ( <unk> ) in the first stage ; and seeing how totally distinct they were from the larva of the latter stage in balanus , he erroneously attributed the difference to the difference in the two families , instead of to the stage of development .
<unk> [ 5 ] first showed , and the discovery is an important one , that in lepas the larvæ pass through two totally different stages .
this has subsequently been proved by implication to be the case in balanus , by <unk> , [ 6 ] who has given excellent drawings of the larva in the first stage ; and quite lately , mr. c. spence bate , of <unk> , has made other detailed observations and drawings of the larvæ of five species in this same early stage , and has most kindly permitted me to quote from his unpublished paper [ 7 ] .
i am enabled to confirm and <unk> these observations , in all the cirripedes in the order containing the <unk> and lepadidæ .

[ 7 ] this <name> appear in the october number ( 1851 ) of the 'annals of natural history . '
the ova , and consequently the larvæ of the lepadidæ , in the first stage , whilst within the sack of the parent , vary in length from .007 to <unk> in lepas , to <unk> of an inch in scalpellum : my chief examination of these larvæ has been confined to those of scalpellum vulgare ; but i saw them in all the other genera .
the larva is somewhat depressed , but nearly globular ; the carapace <unk> is truncated , with lateral horns ; the sternal surface is flat and broad , and formed of thinner membrane than the dorsal .
the horns just alluded to are long in lepas and short in scalpellum ; their ends are either rounded and excessively transparent , or , as in ibla , furnished with an abrupt , minute , sharp point : within these horns , i distinctly saw a long <unk> organ , bearing excessively fine hairs in lines , so exactly like the long plumose spines on the prehensile antennæ of the larvæ in the last stage ; that i have not the least doubt , that these horns are the cases in which antennæ are in process of formation .
<unk> to them , on the sternal surface , near each other , there are two other minute , doubly curved , pointed horns , about <unk> in length , directed <unk> ; and within these i again saw a most delicate articulated <unk> organ on a thicker pedicel : in an excellent drawing , by mr. c. s. bate , of the larva of a chthamalus ( balanus <unk> of british authors ) , after having kept alive and moulted once , these organs are distinctly shown as articulated antennæ ( without a case ) , directed forwards : hence , before the first moult in scalpellum , we have two pair of antennæ in process of formation .
<unk> to the bases of these smaller antennæ is seated the <unk> eye , ( as i believe it to be , ) <unk> in diameter , with apparently a single lens , surrounded , except at the apex , by <unk> <unk> .
in some cases , as in some species of lepas , the larvæ , when first excluded from the egg , have not an eye , or a very imperfect one .
there are three pairs of limbs , seated close together in a longitudinal line , but some way apart in a transverse direction : the first pair always consists of a single spinose ramus , it is not articulated in scalpellum , but is <unk> in some genera ; it is directed forwards .
the other two pair have each two rami , supported on a common <unk> or pedicel : in both pair , the longer ramus is <unk> , and the shorter ramus is without articulations , or with only traces of them : the longer spines borne on these limbs ( at least , in scalpellum and chthamalus , ) are finely plumose .
the abdomen terminates , a little beyond the posterior end of the carapace , in a slightly upturned horny point ; a short distance <unk> to this point , a strong , spinose , forked projection depends from the abdominal surface .
messrs. v. thompson , <unk> , and bate , have kept alive for several days the larvæ of lepas , conchoderma , balanus , <unk> , and chthamalus , and have described the changes which <unk> between the first and third <unk> .
the most conspicuous new character is the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace into an almost <unk> , spinose point in lepas , conchoderma , chthamalus , and balanus , but not according to <unk> , in one of the species of the latter genus .
the posterior point , also , of the abdomen becomes developed in balanus ( <unk> ) into two very long , <unk> processes , serrated on their outer sides ; in lepas and conchoderma , according to thompson , into a single , tapering spinose projection ; and in chthamalus , as figured by mr. bate , the posterior bifid point , as well as the depending ventral fork , increase much in size .
another important change , which has been particularly attended to by mr. bate , is the appearance of spinose projections and spines ( some of which are thick , curved , and strongly plumose , or , almost pectinated along their inner sides ) on the pedicels and lower segments of the shorter rami of the two posterior pairs of limbs .
the mouth in its earliest condition alone remains to be described ; in s .
vulgare , it is seated on a very slight prominence , in a most remarkable situation , namely , in a central point between the bases of the three pairs of legs .
i traced by dissection the oesophagus for some little way , until lost in the cellular and oily matter filling the whole animal , and it was directed <unk> , which is the direction that might have been expected , from the course followed by the oesophagus in the larva in the last stage , and in mature cirripedes .
mr. a. hancock has called my attention to a probosciformed projection on the under side of the larva of lepas fascicularis , when just escaped from the egg .
mr. bate has described this same proboscis in balanus and chthamalus , and states the important fact , that it is capable of being moved by the animal ; and , lastly , i have seen it in an australian chthamalus , and in ibla , of remarkable size .
this proboscis , which is always directed <unk> , ( like the mouth in the mature animal , ) certainly answers to the mouth as made out by dissection in scalpellum ; and i believe i saw , as has mr. bate , a terminal orifice : it certainly does not possess any trophi .
in ibla ( in which the larva is large enough for dissection ) , the base of the proboscis arises <unk> to the first pair of legs , and the orifice at the other end reaches beyond or <unk> to the point , where the mouth in scalpellum opens , namely between the middle pair of legs .
the mouth being either so largely probosciformed or seated only on a slight eminence , in two genera so closely allied as ibla and scalpellum , and ( judging from mr. thompson 's figures , and from what i have seen myself , ) in the species of the same genus lepas , is a singular difference : in the cases in which , at first , the proboscis is absent , it would probably soon be developed .
i can not but suppose that the inwardly directed spines on the bases of the two posterior legs , which are so rapidly developed , serve some important end , namely , as organs of prehension for the larvæ , like the mandibles and maxillæ of mature cirripedes , for seizing their prey , and conveying it to their <unk> mouths , conveniently seated for this purpose .
the first pair of legs answers , as i believe from reasons hereafter to be assigned , to the outer pair of <unk> in the higher crustacea ; and the other four legs to the first two pair of thoracic limbs in these same crustacea ; this being the case , the highly remarkable position of the mouth in the larva , either between the bases of the two posterior pair of legs , or at least <unk> to the first pair , together with the probable functions of the <unk> points springing from the basal segments of the two hinder pair of true thoracic limbs , forcibly bring to mind the anomalous structure of the mouth being situated in the middle of the under side of the thorax , in <unk> ,  that most ancient of crustaceans , and therefore one likely to exhibit a structure now embryonic in other orders .
i <name> only further remark , that i suspect that the <unk> of the anterior end of the carapace , has been effected by the segments having been driven inwards , and consequently , that the larger antennæ within the lateral horns , though standing more in front than the little approximate pair , are normally the posterior of the two pair .
according to milne edwards , the posterior pair are normally seated outside the anterior pair , and this is the case with those within the lateral horns .
larva in the second <unk>  notwithstanding the considerable changes , already briefly given , which the larva undergoes during the first two or three <unk> after leaving the egg , all these forms may be conveniently classed under the first stage .
the larva in the second stage is known only from a single specimen described , figured , and found by <unk> , [ 8 ] adhering to sea-weed in the midst of other larvæ of lepas in the last stage .
in its general shape and compressed form , it seems to come nearer to the last than to the first stage .
it has only three pair of legs , situated much more <unk> on the body than in the first stage , and all directed <unk> ; they are much shorter than heretofore , and resemble rather closely those of the last stage , with the important exception that the first pair has only one ramus .
it is this circumstance which leaves no doubt on my mind , that we here have the three pair of limbs , of the first stage , metamorphosed .
the body is prolonged some way behind these limbs , and ends in a blunt , rounded point , in which , probably , are developed the three posterior pair of legs and the abdomen of the larva in the last stage .
the mouth is now seated some way <unk> to the limbs , is large and probosciformed , and is , i presume , still destitute of trophi .
there are now two closely approximate eyes , but as yet both are simple .
the smaller pair of antennæ has disappeared .
the whole animal was attached to the sea-weed by a ( i presume , pair of , ) " <unk> <unk> , " which <unk> considers as the prehensile antennæ , to be presently described , in an early state of development .
i have little doubt that this is correct , for in an abnormal cirripede of another order , in which the larva appears in the first stage with prehensile antennæ , the eggs have two great projecting horns including these organs , and attached by their tips , through some unknown means , to the sack of the parent , apparently in the same manner as <unk> 's larva was attached to the sea-weed .
i <name> only further remark on the larva of this second stage , that its chief development since the first stage , has been towards its anterior end .
the next great development , to be immediately described , is towards the posterior end of the animal .

larva , last <unk>  my chief examination has been directed , at this stage of development , to the larvæ of lepas australis , which are of unusual size , namely , from <unk> to even almost <unk> of an inch in length ; i examined , however , the larvæ of several other species of lepas , of ibla and of balanus , with less care , but sufficiently to show that in all essential points of organisation they were identical ; this , indeed , might have been inferred from the similarity of the larval prehensile antennæ , preserved in the bases of all mature cirripedes , and which i have carefully inspected in almost every genus .
the larvæ in this final stage , in most of the genera , have increased many times in size since their exclusion from the egg ; for instance , in lepas australis , from .007 to <unk> , or even to <unk> of an inch .
they are now much compressed , nearly of the shape of a <unk> or <unk> , with the anterior end the thickest , the sternal surface nearly or quite straight , and the dorsal arched .
almost the whole of what is externally visible consists of the carapace ; for the thorax and limbs are hidden and enclosed by its backward prolongation ; and even at the anterior end of the animal , the narrow sternal surface can be drawn up , so as to be likewise enclosed .
as in several <unk> crustaceans , the part of the head bearing the antennæ and organs of sense , in front of the mouth , equals , or even exceeds in length , and more than exceeds in bulk , the posterior part of the body , consisting of the enclosed thorax and abdomen .
i <name> now briefly describe , in the following order , the carapace , the organs of sense , mouth , thorax and limbs , abdomen , and internal viscera .
the form of the carapace has been sufficiently described ; it consists of thick chitine membrane , marked with lines , and sometimes with stars and other patterns ; it is obscurely divided into two halves by a line or suture along part of the dorsal margin ; these halves or two valves are drawn together by an adductor muscle , in the same relative position as in the mature cirripede .
the part overhanging and enclosing the thorax is lined by an excessively delicate membrane , obviously homologous with the lining of the sack in the mature animal , and is nothing but a <unk> of the carapace , rendered very thin from being on the under or protected side : a layer of true skin or corium , probably double , separates these two folds .
acoustic <unk>  on the borders of the carapace , at the anterior end , on the sternal surface , there are two minute orifices , in l .
australis <unk> in diameter , sometimes having a distinct border round them ; the membrane of the carapace on the inside is prolonged upwards and inwards in two short <unk> tubes , lodged in closed sacks of the corium : within these sacks on each side a delicate bag is suspended , and hangs in the mouth of the above funnel ; at the upper end a large nerve could be distinctly seen to enter the bag : i can not doubt that this is a <unk> ; from its position and from the animal not feeding ( as we shall presently see ) , i conclude that it is an acoustic organ .
<unk>  these are large and conspicuous ; they are attached very obliquely on the sternal surface , a little way from the anterior end of the carapace , beyond which , when exserted , they extend ; [ 9 ] they can ( at least in ibla ) be retracted within the carapace .
they consist of three segments : the first or basal one is much larger than the others , and apparently always has a single spine on the outer distal margin .
the second segment consists either of a large , thin , circular , sucking disc , or is hoof-like ( tab .
v , figs .
5 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) ; in all cases it is furnished with one or more spines , ( seven very long ones in lepas , ) on the <unk> margin .
the third and ultimate segment is small ; it is articulated on the upper surface of the disc , and is directed rectangularly outwards ; it is sometimes notched , and even shows traces of being bifid ; it bears about seven spines at the end ; some of these spines are hooked , others simple , and in lepas and conchoderma , two or three are very long , highly flexible , and plumose , a double row of excessively fine hairs being articulated on them .
i can hardly doubt that these latter spines , ( within which the purple corium could be seen to enter a little way , ) floating laterally outwards , serve as <unk> .
the antennæ , at first , are well furnished with muscles .
they serve , in lepas , according to mr. king , and in balanus , according to mr. bate , and as i saw myself in another unnamed order , for the purpose of walking , one limb being stretched out before the other ; but their main function is to attach the larva for its final metamorphosis into a cirripede .
the disc can adhere even to so smooth a surface as a glass tumbler .
[ 10 ] the attachment is at first manifestly voluntary , but soon becomes involuntary and permanent , being effected by special and most remarkable means , which <name> be most conveniently described in a later part of this introduction .
i <name> here only state that i traced with ease the two cement-ducts running from two large glandular bodies , to within the antennæ up to the discs .
[ 9 ] mr. j. d. <name> , who has examined these organs in the larvæ of lepas , informs me in a letter , that in his opinion they " correspond with the inferior antennæ , the superior being wanting , as in most <unk> . "
he continues  " i know of no case in which the inferior are obsolete when the superior are developed ; but the reverse is often true . "
in position these antennæ certainly correspond to the inferior and central pair of the larva in the first stage , which belong , as it would appear , to the first segment of the body ; but judging from the drawing by <unk> of the larva in the second stage , i am , in some respects , more inclined to consider that they correspond to the larger pair seen within the lateral horns of the carapace in the first stage .

<unk>  close behind the basal articulations of the antennæ , the sternal surface consists of two approximate , elongated , narrow , flat pieces , or segments .
these <unk> considers as the basal segments of the antennæ : as they are not cylindrical , i do not see the grounds for this conclusion : their posterior ends are rounded , and the membrane forming them is reflected inwards , in the form of two , forked , horny <unk> , together resembling two letters , <unk> , close together ; these project up , inside the animal , for at least one third of its thickness from the sternal to the dorsal surface .
the two great , almost spherical eyes in l .
australis , each <unk> of an inch in diameter , are attached to the outer arms , thus , <unk> , in the position of the two full stops .
hence the eyes are included within the carapace .
each eye consists of eight or ten lenses , varying in diameter in the same individual from <unk> to <unk> of an inch , enclosed in a common membranous bag or <unk> , and thus attached to the outer <unk> .
the lenses are surrounded half way up by a layer of dark <unk> .
the nerve does not enter the <unk> basal end of the common eye , but on one side of the <unk> .
the structure here described is exactly that found , according to milne edwards , in certain crustacea .
in specimens just attached , in which no absorption has taken place , two long muscles with transverse striæ may be found attached to the <unk> tips of the two middle arms of the two <unk> , and running up to the <unk> surface of the carapace , where they are attached ; other muscles ( without transverse striæ ) are attached round the bases , on both sides of both forks .
the action of these muscles would inevitably move the eyes , but i suspect that their function may be to draw up the narrow , deeply folded , sternal surface , and thus cause the retraction of the great prehensile antennæ within the carapace .
mouth.  this is seated in exactly the same position as in the mature cirripede , on a slight prominence , fronting the thoracic limbs , and so far within the carapace , that it was obviously quite <unk> for the seizure of prey ; and it was equally obvious , that the limbs were natatory , and incapable of carrying food to the mouth .
this enigma was at once explained by an examination of the mouth , which was found to be in a rudimentary condition and absolutely closed , so that there would be no use in prey being seized .
underneath this slightly prominent and closed mouth , i found all the <unk> organs of a cirripede , in an immature condition .
the state of the mouth <name> be at once understood , if we suppose very fluid matter to be poured over the protuberant mouth of a cirripede , so as to run a little way down , in the shape of internal crests , between the different parts , and in the shape of a short , shrivelled , certainly closed tube , a little way ( <unk> of an inch in l .
australis ) down the oesophagus .
hence , the larva in this , its last stage , can not eat ; it may be called a locomotive <unk> ; [ 11 ] its whole organisation is apparently adapted for the one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final metamorphosis .
[ 11 ] m. <unk> has lately ( 'comptes rendus , ' feb. 5 , 1850 , as cited in 'annals of nat .
history , ' vol .
v , p. 318 , ) discovered that the " <unk> are <unk> with eight feet , without either mouth or intestine , and which , being deprived of all means of <unk> , fix themselves at <name> , so as to undergo a final metamorphosis , and they become <unk> or <unk> . "
here , then , we have an almost exactly analogous case .
m. <unk> asks  " ought , therefore , the <unk> to be called larvæ , when , under that denomination , have hitherto been comprised animals capable of nourishing themselves ? "
thorax and <unk>  the thorax is much compressed , and consists of six segments , corresponding with the six pair of natatory legs ; the anterior segments are much plainer ( even the first being distinctly separated by a fold from the mouth ) , than the posterior segments , which is exactly the reverse of what takes place in the mature cirripede ; in the latter , the first segment is confounded with the part bearing the mouth .
the <unk> elements of the thorax are distinguishable ; the sternal surface is very narrow , and is covered with complicated folds and ridges .
the six pair of legs are all close , one behind the other , and all are alike in having a <unk> or pedicel of two segments , directed forwards , bearing two arms or rami , each composed of two segments , the outer ramus being a little longer than the inner one .
on the lower segments in both rami of all the limbs , there is a single spine .
in all the limbs , the obliquely truncated summit of the terminal segment of the inner ramus bears three very long , beautifully plumose spines : in the first pair , the summit of the outer ramus bears four , and in the five succeeding pair , six similar spines .
this difference , small as it is , is interesting , as recalling the much greater difference between the first and succeeding pairs , in the first and second stage of development .
the terminal segments of all the rami , bearing the long plumose spines , are directed backwards .
the limbs and thorax are well furnished with <unk> muscles .
the animal , according to mr. king , swims with great rapidity , back downwards .
the limbs can be withdrawn within the carapace .
abdomen and caudal appendages.  the abdomen is small , and its structure might easily be overlooked without careful dissection of the different parts : it consists of three segments ; the first can be seen to be distinct from the last thoracic segment , bearing the sixth pair of limbs , only from the fold of the <unk> element , and from its difference in shape ; the second segment is very short , but quite distinct ; the third is four or five times as long as the second , and bears at the end two little appendages , each consisting of two segments , the lower one with a single spine , and the upper one with three , very long , plumose spines , like those on the rami of the thoracic limbs .
the abdomen contains only the <unk> and two delicate muscles running into the two appendages , between the bases of which the anus is seated .
internal <unk>  within the body , in front of the mouth , it was easy to find the stomach ( with two pear-shaped cæca at the upper end ) , running first <unk> , and then curving back and reaching the anus by a long <unk> , difficult to be followed : it appeared , however , to me , that this stomach had more relation to the young cirripede , of which every part could now generally be traced , than to the larva , with its closed and rudimentary mouth : the fact , however , of its being prolonged to the anus , which is in a different position in the larva and mature state , shows that the stomach serves , at least , as an <unk> channel .
besides the stomach , the several muscles already alluded to , and much pulpy and oily matter , the only other internal organs consist of two long , rather thick , <unk> masses , into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts running from the prehensile antennæ could be traced .
these masses are formed of irregular orange balls , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , made up of rather large cells , so to have a <unk> appearance , held together by a transparent pale yellowish substance , but apparently not enclosed in a membrane : these masses lie rather obliquely , and approach each other at their anterior ends ; they extend from above the compound eyes , to the cæca of the stomach to which they cohere , but in young specimens , they extend some way beyond the cæca , between the folds of the carapace .
the two cement-ducts , at the points where they enter these bodies , expand and are lost ; at this point , also , the little orange-coloured masses of cells have the appearance of being broken down into a finer substance .
within the cement-ducts i saw a distinct chord of rather opaque cellular matter .
we shall presently see , that these <unk> masses are the incipient ovaria .
the young cirripede within the <unk>  several times i succeeded in <unk> off the integuments of the <unk> larva , and in displaying the young lepas australis entire .
the following description applies to the cirripede in this state ; but for convenience sake , i shall occasionally refer to its condition when a little more advanced .
i may premise , and the fact in itself is curious , that the <unk> shell of the larva , together with the compound eyes , is first moulted , and some time afterwards , the inner lining of the sack , together with the integuments of the thorax and of the natatory legs : hence , i often found specimens , which externally seemed to have perfected their metamorphoses , but which , within their sacks , retained all the characters of the natatory larva .
according to mr. king , the larva of lepas throws off its external shell five days after becoming attached .
whilst the young lepas is closely packed within the larva , the capitulum , as known by the five valves , about equals in length the peduncle .
the peduncle occupies the anterior half of the larva ; when fully stretched , it becomes narrower and slightly longer than the capitulum ; the separation between the capitulum and peduncle is almost arbitrary in the mature animal , and corresponds with no particular line in the larva .
even at this early period , the muscles of the peduncle are quite distinct .
no vestige is preserved in the outer integument , of the sternal and dorsal <unk> of the larval carapace ; but in the corium of the peduncle , three coloured marks which occur near the eyes , and two little curled marks which occur near the acoustic orifices of the larva , are all preserved for some time after maturity .
the compound eyes , as we have seen , are attached to <unk> , springing from the sternal surface of the larval carapace , and are consequently cast off with it : whilst the young cirripede is packed within the larva , the outer integument of its peduncle necessarily forms a deep transverse fold passing over the eyes and <unk> , and this , as we shall presently see , plays an important part in the future position of the animal .
the antennæ are not moulted with the carapace , but left cemented to the surface of attachment ; their muscles are converted into <unk> fibres , the corium after a short period is absorbed , and they are then preserved in a functionless condition .
no trace of the two acoustic sacks can be perceived in the corium of the young cirripede , excepting the coloured marks above alluded to .
in the young capitulum , the five valves stand some way apart from each other ; they are elegant objects under the microscope ; they are not calcified , but consist exclusively of chitine ; they are rather thick , composed of an outer membrane lined by hexagonal prisms , quite unlike any other membrane in the animal .
these valves , which i have called primordial valves , resemble pretty closely in shape the valves of the mature animal ; the fork of the <name> , however , is indicated only by a slight <unk> above the lower end .
after the exuviation of the larval integuments , and when <unk> commences , the first layer of shell is deposited under , and then round these primordial valves .
the latter , in well preserved old specimens , may often be detected on the umbones of the scuta , terga , and <name> , but not on the umbones of any other valves .
the mouth seems one of the earliest parts developed : in the youngest larva dissected , i could make out at least points corresponding with each organ ; and , at the period when the young cirripede could be dissected out of its larval envelopes , their general details were quite plain .
the labrum , however , had not become bullate .
the mouth , as we have seen , is formed under the rudimentary mouth of the larva , and at the same relative spot occupied by the probosciformed mouth of the larva in the second stage .
thus far , in the young cirripede and larva , there has been no great change in the relative positions of the parts : the rudimentary eyes , however , of the former are developed <unk> to ( or above , as applied to a cirripede , ) the cast-off compound eyes of the larva ; but the position of the mouth , of the antennæ , and of the several coloured marks in the corium , prove to demonstration , the correspondence in both of part to part .
the case is rather different with what follows .
the cirri are developed at first of considerable length , so that the young animal may soon provide itself with food ; in lepas australis they are of great length , the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments .
the extreme tips of the twenty-four rami of the six pair of cirri , are formed within the twenty-four , corresponding , little , <unk> rami of the six pair of natatory legs ; but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs , they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva ; no part whatever of the thorax of the cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva , but ( together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri ) within the <unk> cavity .
as a consequence of this , the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva ; and the cirripede , from this transverse position of its thorax , comes to be , as it were , internally , almost cut in twain , and the sack thus produced .
as soon as the young cirripede is free and can move itself , the cirri are curled up , and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum , its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body , which it had in the larval condition .
the reader <name> , perhaps , understand what i mean , if he <name> look at the mature cirripede , figured in pl .
ix , fig .
4 .
in this , he <name> see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth ; on the other hand , if he imagines the whole bottom of the body ( as high up as the letter h ) united and blended into the peduncle , he <name> see the state in which these parts exist in the larva .
now , let him greatly shorten the cirri , so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva , and then imagine a young cirripede , with cirri of full length , formed within the old one , he <name> see that the new thorax supporting the cirri <name> have to be developed in an almost transverse position ,  the animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain .
of the internal organs , whilst the cirripede is still within the larva , i have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca : from the retracted position of the thorax and rudimentary abdomen , and consequently of the anus , compared with these parts in the larva , the alimentary canal is not above half its former length .
there is , as yet , no trace of the filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ , at the base of the first pair of cirri .
nor could i perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales : the penis is represented by a minute , apparently <unk> projection .
i have already briefly described the pair of large , <unk> bodies in the larva , into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts ran , and evidently derived their slightly opaque , cellular contents .
at a very early age , before the young cirripede can be distinctly made out , the posterior ends of these <unk> bodies are absorbed , so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach .
when the young cirripede is plainly developed within the larva , these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca , and at the opposite or anterior end ( i .
e. lower , in the position in which cirripedes are usually figured ) , they have branched out into a sheet of delicate <unk> tubes ; these could be traced by every stage , until , in the young perfected cirripede , they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes .
in the larva , the two <unk> bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end , but in the mature cirripede , the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small , glandular , <unk> masses , near the <unk> , are connected only by a delicate tube ; this i failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description .
the larva fixes itself with its sternal surface parallel and close to the surface of attachment , and the antennæ become cemented to it : if the cirripede , after its metamorphosis had remained in this position , the cirri could not have been exserted , or only against the surface of attachment ; but there is a special provision , that the young cirripede shall immediately assume its proper position at right angles to the position which it held whilst within the larva , namely with its posterior end upwards .
this is effected in a singular manner by the exuviation of the great compound eyes , which we have seen are fastened to the outer arms of the double <unk> , sternal <unk> : these together with the eyes stretch transversely across , and internally far up into , the body of the larva ; and , as the whole has to be rejected or moulted , the membrane of the peduncle of the young cirripede has necessarily to be formed with a wide and deep inward fold , extending transversely across it ; this when stretched open , after the exuviation of the larval carapace and <unk> , necessarily causes the sternal side of the peduncle to be longer than the dorsal , and , as a consequence , gives to the young cirripede its normal position , at right angles to that of the larva when first attached .
* * * * * i may here state , that i have examined the larvæ in this the final or perfect stage in four species of lepas , in <unk> , ibla quadrivalvis , and , though rather less minutely , in balanus <unk> , and i find all essential points of organisation similar .
with the exception of diversities in the proportional sizes of the different parts , and in the patterns on the carapace , the differences , even in the arrangement of the spines on the limbs and antennæ , are less than i should have anticipated .
i have in this abstract treated the metamorphoses at greater length than i should otherwise have done , on account of the great importance of arriving at a correct homological interpretation of the different parts of the mature animal .
in crustacea , according to the ordinary view , there are twenty-one segments ; of these i can recognise in the cirripede , on evidence as good as can generally be obtained , all with the exception of the four terminal abdominal segments ; these do not occur in any species known to me , in any stage of its development .
if that part of the larva in front of the mouth , bearing the eyes , the prehensile antennæ , and in an earlier stage two pair of antennæ , be formed , as is admitted in all other crustacea , of three segments , then beyond a doubt , from the absolute correspondence of every part , and even every coloured <name> , the peduncle of the lepadidæ is likewise thus formed .
the peduncle being filled by the branching ovarian tubes is no objection to this view , for i am informed on the high authority of mr. j. d. <name> , [ 12 ] that this is the case with the <unk> in some true crustaceans , for instance , in <unk> .
to proceed , the mouth , formed of mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , correspond with the fourth , fifth , and sixth segments of the <unk> crustacean .
<unk> to the mouth , we come , in the larva , to a rather wide interspace without any apparent articulation or organ , and then to the thorax , formed of six segments , bearing the six pair of limbs , of which the first pair differs slightly from the others .
the thorax is succeeded by three small segments , differently shaped , with the posterior one alone bearing appendages ; these segments , i can not doubt , from their appearance alone , and from their apparent function of steering the body , are abdominal segments .
if this latter view be correct , the thoracic segments are the six posterior ones of the normal seven segments , and there must be two segments missing between the outer maxillæ and first thoracic pair of legs , which latter on this view springs from the ninth segment .
now , in a very singular cirripede , already alluded to under the name of proteolepas , the two missing segments are present , the mouth being actually succeeded by eight segments , and these by the three usual abdominal segments ,  every segment in the body being as distinct as in an <unk> : hence in proteolepas , adding the three segments for the mouth and three for the carapace , we have altogether seventeen segments , which , as i stated , is the full number ever observed in any cirripede , the four missing ones being abdominal , and , i presume , the four terminal segments .
that the cavity in which the thorax is lodged , in the larva and therefore in the mature cirripede , is simply formed by the backward production of the carapace , does not require any discussion .
the valves have no homological signification .
[ 12 ] this distinguished naturalist has given his opinion in the 'american journal of science , ' march , 1846 , that " the pedicel of anatifa corresponds to a pair of antennæ in the young ; " although the peduncle or pedicel is undoubtedly thus terminated , even in mature individuals , i think it has been shown that it is the whole of the anterior part of the larva in front of the mouth , which is directly converted into the peduncle .
professor e. forbes , in his lectures , and professor steenstrup , in his <unk> <unk> das <unk> des <unk> in der natur , ' ch .
v , have considered the peduncle as a pair of fused legs .
<unk> has taken , judging from a single sentence , the same view of the homologies of the external parts as i have done ; in his description of alepas <unk> , ( <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , & c. , <unk> , 1844 , pp .
<unk> ) , he uses the following words : " <unk> <unk> <unk> , ut in <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> et <unk> , " & c. ; his <unk> is the same as the capitulum of this work .
as we have just seen that the first pair of natatory legs is borne on the ninth segment of the body , so it must be with the first pair of cirri , which consequently correspond to the outer <unk> ( the two inner pair of <unk> or <unk> being here aborted ) of the higher crustacea , and hence their difference from the five posterior pair , which correspond with the five , ordinary pair of <unk> legs in these same crustacea .
the part of the body , which i have called the prosoma , that is the protuberant , <unk> , lower part of the thorax ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 n ) , is a special development , either of the ninth segment , bearing the first pair of cirri , or of the segments corresponding with the organs of the mouth .
the three abdominal segments of the larva are represented in the mature cirripede , in the order containing the lepadidæ , only by a minute , triangular <unk> , let in between the <unk> tergal arches of the last thoracic segment : in this <unk> , small as it is , is seated the anus , and on each side the caudal appendages , often rudimentary and sometimes absent .
in another order , i may remark , ( including , probably , the <unk> of mr. hancock , ) the cirri , of which there are only three pair , are abdominal .
i feel much confidence , that the homologies here given are correct .
the cause of their having been generally overlooked arises , i believe , from the peculiar manner , already described , in which the animal , during its last metamorphosis , is internally almost intersected : even for some little time after discovering that the larval antennæ were always embedded in the centre of the surface of attachment , i did not perceive , that this was the anterior end of the whole animal .
the accompanying woodcut gives at a glance , a view of the homologies of the external parts : the upper figure ( from milne edwards ) is a <unk> crustacean , <unk> of vaughan thompson , and the abdomen , which we know becomes in cirripedes , after the metamorphosis , rudimentary , and therefore does not fairly enter into the comparison , is given only in faint lines : the lower figure is a mature lepas , with the antennæ and eyes , which are actually present in the larva , retained and supposed to have gone on growing .
all that we externally see of a cirripede , whether pedunculated or sessile , is the three anterior segments of the head of a crustacean , with its anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment , and with its posterior end projecting vertically from it .
[ illustration : [ m.  mouth . ] ]
capitulum .
i <name> now proceed to a general description of the different parts and organs in the lepadidæ .
the capitulum is usually much flattened , but sometimes broadly oval in section .
it is generally formed of five or more valves , connected together by very narrow or broad strips of membrane ; sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent , when the whole consists of membrane .
when the valves are numerous , and they occasionally exceed a hundred in number , they are arranged in whorls , with each valve generally so placed as to cover the interval between the two valves above .
of all the valves , the scuta are the most persistent ; then come the terga , and then the <name> ; the rostrum and latera occur only in scalpellum and pollicipes , and in a rudimentary condition in lithotrya , and , perhaps , in the fossil genus <unk> .
the valves are formed sometimes of chitine ( as in ibla and alepas ) , but usually of shell , which varies from transparency to entire <unk> .
the shell is generally white , occasionally reddish or purple ; exteriorly , the valves are covered by more or less persistent , generally yellow , strong membrane .
the scuta and terga are always considerably larger than the other valves : in the different genera the valves differ so much in shape that little can be <unk> of them in common ; even the direction of their lines of growth differs ,  thus , in lepas and some allied genera , the chief growth of the scuta and of the <name> is upwards , whereas in pollicipes and lithotrya , it is entirely downwards ; in <unk> , and some species of scalpellum , it is both upwards and downwards .
even in the same species , there is often very considerable variation in the exact shape of the valves , more especially of the terga .
the adductor muscle is always attached to a point not far from the middle of the scuta , and it generally has a pit for its attachment .
in several genera , namely , pæcilasma , dichelaspis , conchoderma , and alepas , the scuta show a tendency to be <unk> or <unk> .
the valves are placed either at some distance from each other , or close together ; but their growing margins very rarely overlap each other , though this is sometimes the case with their upper , free , <unk> apices ; in a few species the scuta and terga are articulated together , or united by a fold .
the membrane connecting the valves , where they do not touch each other , is like that forming the peduncle , and is sometimes brilliantly coloured <unk> ; generally , it appears <unk> , from the corium being seen through .
small pointed spines , connected with the underlying corium by tubuli , are not unfrequently articulated on this membrane : the tubuli , however , are often present where there are no spines .
to allow of the growth of the capitulum , the membrane between the valves splits at each period of exuviation , when a new strip of membrane is formed beneath , connected on each side with a fresh layer of shell ,  the old and outer slips of membrane <unk> and disappearing : when there are many valves , the line of splitting is singularly complicated .
this membrane consists of chitine , [ 13 ] and is composed of numerous fine laminæ .
after the valves have been placed in acid , a residue , very different in bulk in different genera , is left , also composed of successive laminæ of chitine .
it appears to me that each single lamina of calcified chitine , composing the shell , must once have been continuous with a <unk> lamina in the membrane connecting the several valves : at the line where this change in <unk> <unk> , the chitine generally assumes some colour , and becomes much harder and more persistent ; and as the whole valve is formed of component laminæ thus edged ( the once continuous laminæ of <unk> chitine connecting the valves , having disintegrated and disappeared ) the surfaces of the valves are generally left covered by a persistent membrane , constituted of these <unk> : this membrane has been called the <unk> .
in some genera , as in lepas , this so-called <unk> is seldom preserved , excepting on the last zone of growth : in scalpellum and pollicipes it usually covers the whole valves .
it appears to me that the laminæ of chitine , and of calcified chitine composing the valves , are both formed not by secretion , but by the metamorphosis of an outer layer of corium into these substances .
[ 13 ] chitine is confined to the articulata .
it was dr. c. schmidt ( contributions , & c. , being a <unk> investigation : in <name> 's <unk> memoirs , ' vol .
v ) , who discovered that the membrane connecting the valves and forming the peduncle , and the tissues of the internal animal , were composed of this substance .
but dr. schmidt says that the valves in lepas are composed of <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> residue ; i can not but think that the existence of the <unk> is an error caused by dr. schmidt 's belief that the cirripedia were intermediate between crustacea and mollusca , in the shells of which latter , the animal basis consists of <unk> .
for after placing the valves of lepas and pollicipes in cold acid , i found that the membrane left could not be dissolved in boiling caustic potash , but could , though slowly , ( and without change of colour , ) in boiling muriatic acid ; and these are the main <unk> characters of chitine , compared with albuminous substances .
i may add , that schmidt was also induced to consider the shells of cirripedia as having the same nature with those of mollusca , from finding that in the above <unk> of <unk> matter , <unk> consisted of carbonate and only <unk> of phosphate of lime ; but dr. schmidt 's own <unk> prove how extremely variable the proportions of these salts are in the crustacea , as the following instance shows :  <unk> <unk> phosphate of lime <unk> <unk> carbonate of lime <unk> <unk> and , therefore , it is not very surprising that cirripedia should have still less phosphate of lime in their shells , than has a lobster compared with a <unk> .
within the capitulum is the sack , which , together with the upper internal part of the peduncle , <unk> the animal 's body .
the sack is lined by a most delicate membrane of chitine , under which there is a double layer of corium ; this double layer is united together by short , strong , transverse bundles of fibres , branched at both ends : [ 14 ] in some genera , the ovarian tubes extend between these two layers .
we have seen , under the head of the metamorphoses , that the delicate tunic lining the sack is simply a <unk> of the thick membrane and valves forming the capitulum , the whole being the posterior portion of the carapace of the larva slightly modified .
[ 14 ] i am much indebted to mr. <unk> of liverpool for having kindly sent me excellent specimens illustrating this structure .
<unk>  its length varies greatly in different species , and even in the same species , according to the situation occupied by the individual ; its lower end is sometimes pointed , but generally only a little narrower than the upper end .
in outline , the peduncle is usually flattened , but sometimes quite cylindrical .
it is composed of very strong , generally thick , transparent membrane , rarely coloured reddish , and often penetrated by numerous tubuli .
the underlying corium is sometimes coloured in longitudinal bands .
at each period of growth a new and larger integument is formed under the old one , which gradually <unk> and disappears ; the extreme lower point is often deserted by the corium , and ceases to grow , whilst the whole upper part still continues increasing in diameter : in length the chief addition is made ( as is clearly seen in those genera having calcified scales ) , round the upper margin , at the base of the capitulum .
the surface of the membrane is either naked or <unk> clothed with minute , pointed , articulated spines , or it is penetrated by calcified scales or styles , ( in ibla alone formed of chitine , ) which pass through it to the corium , and are added to at their bases , like the valves , at each period of growth .
in lithotrya alone the scales of the peduncle are moulted together with the connecting membrane .
these scales on the peduncle are generally placed symmetrically in whorls , with each scale corresponding with the <unk> of two scales , both above and below .
except in scalpellum ornatum and the fossil <unk> <unk> , they are very small compared with the valves of the capitulum .
when the scales are symmetrical , new ones are first formed only round the summit of the peduncle , and only those in the few uppermost whorls continue to grow or to be added to at their bases ; afterwards membrane is deposited under them .
the <name> matter of the scales resembles that of the valves , and the manner of growth is the same ; tubuli generally run to and through them from the corium .
from the continued enlargement of the membrane of the peduncle , the scales come to stand , in the lower portion , some way apart .
in ibla , new horny styles are formed indifferently in all parts of the peduncle .
in some species of pollicipes , the calcareous styles are not symmetrical or symmetrically arranged ; and besides those first formed round the top of the peduncle , there are other and larger ones formed near its base .
lastly , in lithotrya we have a row of calcareous discs or an irregular , basal cup , formed in the same manner as the valves of the capitulum : in this genus alone ( as already stated , ) the calcified scales are moulted , and here alone their edges are serrated .
the peduncle is lined within by three layers of muscles , longitudinal , transverse , and oblique , all destitute of the transverse striæ , characteristic of voluntary muscles ; they run from the bottom of the peduncle to the base of the capitulum , as in lepas , or half way up it , as in conchoderma ; in alepas alone they surround the whole capitulum up to its summit .
in lithotrya there are two little , <unk> , transverse muscles ( involuntary ) , extending from the basal points of the terga to a central line on the under side of the <name> .
the gentle swaying to and fro movements , and the great power of longitudinal contraction ,  movements apparently common , as i infer from facts communicated to me by mr. peach , to all the <unk> ,  are produced by these muscles .
the interior of the peduncle is filled up with a great mass of branching ovarian tubes ; but in ibla and lithotrya , the upper part of the peduncle is occupied by the animal 's body .
means of <unk>  if the peduncle be very carefully removed ( tab .
ix , fig .
7 and tab .
i , fig .
6 b ) , from the surface of attachment , quite close to the end , but not at the actual apex , the larval prehensile antennæ can always be found : these have been sufficiently described for our present purpose under the head of the metamorphoses ; but i may add , that the <unk> differences between them in the several genera are briefly given , for a special purpose , in a discussion on the sexes of scalpellum at the end of that genus .
we have seen in the larva , that the cement-ducts , with their opaque cellular contents , can be traced from within the discs of the antennæ to the anterior or lower ends of the two <unk> bodies , which it can be demonstrated are the incipient ovaria .
in mature cirripedes these ducts can be followed , in a slightly sinuous course , along the muscles on each side within the peduncle , till they expand into two small organs , which i have called <unk> .
these glands are found with great difficulty , except in conchoderma aurita , where they are placed on each side under the inner layer of corium , at the bottom of the sack , so as to be just above the top of the peduncle ; they resemble in shape a retort , ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 . ) .
in pollicipes mitella and polymerus they lie half way down the peduncle , close together , and apparently enclosed within a common membrane ; in these two species the broad end of the gland is bent towards the neck of the retort .
in scalpellum the position is the same , but the shape is more globular .
in ibla the structure is more simple , namely , a tube slightly enlarged , running downwards , bent a little upwards , and then resuming its former downward course , the lower portion forming the <unk> .
the gland contains a strongly coherent , pulpy , opaque , cellular mass , like that in the cement-ducts ; but in some instances , presently to be mentioned , this cellular mass becomes converted within either the ducts or gland , or within both , into transparent , yellow , tough cement .
generally in conchoderma , pollicipes , and scalpellum , two ovarian tubes , but in one specimen of conchoderma aurita , three tubes , and in ibla one tube could be seen running into or forming the gland ; of the nature of the tubes there could not be the least doubt , for at a little distance from the glands they gave out branches ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 ) , containing ova in every state of development .
in some specimens as in that figured of conchoderma aurita , the ovarian tube on one side of the gland is larger than on the other , and has rather the appearance of being deeply embedded in the gland than of forming it ; but , in other specimens , the two ovarian tubes first formed a little pouch , into which their cellular contents could be clearly seen to enter ; and then this pouch expanded into the gland ; thus quite removing a doubt which i had sometimes felt , whether the ovarian tube was not simply attached to or embedded in the gland , without any further connection .
by dissection the multiple external coats of the gland and ovarian tubes could be seen to be continuous .
the cellular contents of the tubes passed into the more opaque cellular contents of the gland , by a layer of transparent , pulpy , pale , yellowish substance .
there appeared in several instances to be a relation , between the state of fulness and condition of the contents of the gland , and of the immediately adjoining portions of the ovarian tubes .
in one specimen of pollicipes mitella it was clear that the altered , tough , yellow , transparent , <unk> contents of the two glands and ducts , had actually invaded for some little distance , the two ovarian tubes which ran into them , thus showing the continuity of the whole .
from these facts i conclude , without hesitation , that the gland itself is a part of an ovarian tube specially modified ; and further , that the cellular matter , which in the ovarian tubes serves for the development of the ova , is , by the special action of the walls of the gland , changed into the <unk> cellular matter in the ducts , and this again subsequently into that tissue or substance , which <unk> the cirripede to its surface of attachment .
as the individuals grow and increase in size , so do the glands and cement-ducts ; but it seems often to happen , that when a specimen is <unk> attached , the <unk> apparatus ceases to act , and the cellular contents of the <unk> become converted into a thread of transparent tough cement ; the investing membrane , also , of the ducts , in conchoderma sometimes becomes hard and <unk> .
i have already alluded to the case of a pollicipes , in which both glands and ducts , and even a small portion of the two adjoining ovarian tubes , had become thus filled up .
as in sessile cirripedes , at every fresh period of growth a new cement gland is formed , it has occurred to me , that possibly in pollicipes something similar may take place .
in sessile cirripedes , the old <unk> are all preserved in a functionless condition , adhering to the membranous or calcareous basis , each new larger one attached to that last formed , and each giving out cement-ducts , which , <unk> in the most complicated manner , pass outside the shell and thus attach it to some foreign body .
the cement , removed from the outside of a cirripede , consists of a thin layer of very tough , <unk> , transparent , laminated substance , exhibiting no structure under the highest powers , or at most a very fine dotted appearance , like a <unk> drawing .
it is of the nature of chitine ; but boiling caustic potash has rather more effect on it than on true chitine ; and i think boiling nitric acid rather less effect .
in one single instance , namely , in <unk> , the cement comes out of the four orifices of the two <unk> ducts , in the shape of distinct cells , which , between the whale 's skin and the basal membrane , arrange themselves so as to make a circular , continuous slip of cement ; then the cells blend together , and are converted into transparent , <unk> cement .
<unk> tissue or membrane would , perhaps , have been a more correct title than cement ; but , in ordinary cases , its appearance is so little like that of an organised tissue , that i have for this reason , and for <unk> , preferred the simple term of cement .
in the larva the cement always escapes through the prehensile antennæ ; and it thus continues to do throughout life in most or all of the species of lepas , conchoderma , dichelaspis and ibla .
in the first two of these genera , the cement escapes from the borders of the lower side of the disc or penultimate segment of the antennæ , and can be there seen radiating out like spokes , which at their ends divide into finer and finer branches , till a uniform sheet of cement is formed , fastening the antennæ and the adjoining part of the peduncle down to the surface of attachment .
in dichelaspis <unk> and scalpellum peronii , the cement , or part at least , comes out of the ultimate segment of the antennæ , in the shape of one tube , within another tube of considerable diameter and length .
in scalpellum vulgare , and probably in some of the other species , which live attached to corallines , the cement soon ceases to <unk> from the antennæ , but instead , bursts through a row of orifices on the rostral margin of the peduncle ( pl .
ix , fig .
7 ) , by which means this margin is symmetrically fastened down to the delicate , horny branches of the <unk> .
in pollicipes , the two cement-ducts , either together or separately ( pl .
ix , fig .
2 , 2 a´ ) , wind about the bottom of the peduncle in the most tortuous course , at each bend pouring out cement through a hole in the membrane of the peduncle .
in ibla the lower part of the peduncle is internally filled by cement , and thus rendered rigid .
in lepas fascicularis a vesicular ball of cement surrounding the peduncle is thus formed ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , and serves as a float !
all these curious , special adaptations are described under the respective genera .
how the cement forces its way through the antennæ , and often through apertures in the thick membrane of the peduncle , i do not understand .
i do not believe , though some appearances favoured the notion , that the <unk> itself <unk> and divides , at least this is not the case in <unk> , but only that the internal chord of cellular matter thus acts and spreads itself out ; nor do i understand how , when the antennæ and immediately adjoining parts are once cemented down , any more cement can escape ; yet this must take place , as may be inferred from the breadth of the cemented , terminal portion of the peduncle in lepas and conchoderma ; and from the often active condition in old individuals of the <unk> organs .
i have entered on this subject at some length , ( and i wish i had space for more illustrations , ) from its offering , perhaps , the most curious point in the natural history of the cirripedia .
it is the one chief character of the <unk> .
i am well aware how extremely improbable it must appear , that part of an ovarian tube should be converted into a gland , in which cellular matter is modified , so that instead of aiding in the development of new beings , it forms itself into a tissue or substance , which leaves the body [ 15 ] in order to fasten it to a foreign support .
but on no other view can the structure , clearly seen by me both in the mature cirripede and in the larva , be explained , and i feel no hesitation in advancing it .
i may here venture to quote the substance of a remark made by professor <name> , when i communicated to him the foregoing facts , namely , that there was a new problem to solve ,  new work to perform ,  to attach permanently a crustacean to a foreign body ; and that hence no one could , a priori , tell by what singular and novel means this would be effected .
[ 15 ] the protrusion of the <unk> pouches in <unk> and its kindred genera , outside the body , offers a feeble analogy with what takes place in cirripedes .
professor <unk> ( 'annals of natural history , ' vol .
xx , p. 7 , ) who has attended to the subject , says that the external <unk> pouches are " a portion of the membrane of the true ovaries : " if the membrane of these pouches had been specially made adhesive , the analogy would have been closer .
filamentary appendages.  these have generally been considered to act as branchiæ ; they occur at the bases of the first pair of cirri in lepas , alepas , conchoderma , and in three species of pollicipes : in conchoderma there are similar appendages attached to the pedicels of the cirri ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 , <unk> ) ; and in the above three species of pollicipes there is a double row of them on the prosoma : their <name> differ in different species ( in some there being none ) of the same genus , and even in different individuals of the same species ; they are entirely absent in the majority of the genera .
these facts would indicate that they are not of high functional importance ; and they seem so generally occupied by testes ( pl .
iv , fig .
5 ) , that i suspect their function is quite as much to give room for the development of these glands , as to serve for respiratory purposes .
with the exception of the four above-named genera , the mere surface of the body and of the sack must be sufficient for respiration : in conchoderma aurita the two great <unk> of surface , afforded by the folded , tubular , <unk> projections , aid , as i believe , towards this end .
the shape of the body varies , owing to the greater or less development of the lower part of the prosoma , the greater or less distance of the first from the second pair of cirri , and of the mouth from the adductor scutorum muscle , ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 , and pl .
iv , 8 a´ ) .
in all the genera , the body is much flattened .
i may here mention a few particulars about the muscular system .
one of the largest muscular masses is formed by the adductor scutorum , and by the muscles which surround in a double layer ( the <unk> being oblique to each other ) the whole of the upper part of the prosoma .
from under the adductor , a pair of delicate muscles runs to the basal edge of the labrum , so as to retract the whole mouth , and two other pair to the integument between the mouth and the adductor , so as to fold it : again , there are other delicate muscles in some ( for instance in lepas <unk> ) if not in all the lepadidæ , crossing each other in the most singular loops , and serving apparently to fold the membrane between the occludent edges of the scuta .
within the prosoma there is a strong adductor muscle , running straight from side to side , for the purpose , as it appears , of <unk> the body .
the thorax , on the dorsal and ventral surfaces , is well furnished with straight and oblique muscles ( without striæ ) , which straighten and curl up this part of the body .
the muscles running into the pedicels of the cirri , cross each other on the ventral surface of the thorax ; the muscles within the rami are attached to the upper segments of the pedicels .
finally , i may remark that the whole of the body and the cirri are capable of many diversified movements .
mouth.  this is prominent , and almost probosciformed ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 b ) , and in the abnormal anelasma ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 d ) , quite probosciformed ,  such , also , was its character in the larval condition .
in outline , it is either sub-triangular , or oval with the longer axis transverse ; the whole is capable , as well as the separate organs , of considerable movement , as i have seen in living sessile cirripedes .
it is composed ( tab .
v , fig .
2 ) of a labrum , swollen or bullate , often to such an extent as to equal in its longitudinal axis the rest of the mouth ; of palpi soldered to the labrum ; of mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , the latter serving as a lower lip .
these organs have only their upper segments free , but there are traces , clearly seen in the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
1 , a , b ) , of their being formed of three segments .
the two lower segments are laterally united , and open into each other , the prominence of the mouth being thus caused : this condition appears to me curious , and is , to a certain limited extent , intermediate between those articulated animals which have their trophi soldered into a proboscis , and those furnished with entirely free <unk> or prehensile organs .
the palpi adhere to the corners of the labrum ; and i call them palpi only from seeing that they spring laterally from above the upper articulation of the mandibles .
the prominence of the mouth , measured from the basal fold by which the whole is separated from the body , is much greater on the half formed by the labrum and mandibles , than on the other half facing the cirri .
the trophi surround a cavity  the supra-oesophageal cavity  in the middle of which , between the mandibles is seated the orifice of the oesophagus .
the oesophagus is surrounded by long , fine , muscular <unk> , radiating in all directions , opposing the <unk> muscles , and is capable of violent swallowing movements ,  <unk> after <unk> being seen to run down its whole course : there are also some fine muscles attached to the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal cavity .
the trophi serve merely for the prehension of prey , and not for <unk> .
the labrum , as stated , is always bullate or swollen ; and sometimes the upper exterior part forms , as in ibla ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a , c ) , and dichelaspis , an overhanging blunt point .
the object , i suspect , of this bullate form is to give , in the upper part , attachment to longer muscles running to the lateral surfaces of the mandibles , and lower down to the oesophagus .
the crest close over the supra-oesophageal cavity , is generally furnished with small , often bead-like teeth .
the palpi are small , their apices never actually touching each other ; they are more or less blunt , not differing much in shape in the different genera ( pl .
x , figs .
6 to 8 ) , and clothed with spines .
they are not capable of movement ; their function seems to be to prevent prey , brought by the cirri , escaping over the labrum ; i infer this from finding in anelasma and in the male of ibla , which have the cirri functionless , that the palpi are rudimentary .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , figs .
<unk> ) have from two to ten strong teeth in a single row ; where the number exceeds five , several of the teeth are small ; the inferior <name> is generally pectinated with fine spines ; in lithotrya ( fig .
2 ) , the interspaces between the teeth are also pectinated .
in the same individual there is not unfrequently one tooth , more or less , on opposite sides of the mouth .
internally , the mandibles are furnished on their outer and inner sides with several <unk> <unk> , in lithotrya roughened with points ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , for the attachment of the muscles ; of these ( fig .
1 ) , there is a chief <unk> and elevator , attached at their lower ends to near the basal fold of the mouth , and a lateral muscle , attached to the broad basal end of the palpi , and serving , apparently , to oppose the edge of mandible to mandible .
the maxillæ in the different genera ( pl .
x , figs .
9 to 15 ) differ considerably in outline ; they are generally about half the size of the mandibles ; at the upper corner , there are always two or three spines larger than the others , and often separated from them by a notch ; the rest of the spinose edge is straight , or irregular , or step-formed , or with the lowest part projecting , or with one or two narrow prominences bearing fine spines .
all these spines , quite differently from the teeth of the mandibles , are articulated on the edge of the organ , and stand in a double row .
at a point corresponding with the upper articulation of the mandibles , a long , thin , narrow , rigid <unk> , projects inwards ( fig .
10 ) , and running down nearly parallel to the thin , outer , flexible membrane of the mouth , is attached to the corium , and thus serves as a support to the whole organ .
this <unk> is embedded in muscles ( pl .
x , fig .
10 ) ; there are other large muscles attached to the inner side of the organ , and again others running laterally towards the mandibles .
the <unk> , of course , is moulted with the integuments of the mouth .
the outer maxillæ ( pl .
x , figs .
16 , 17 ) serve as a lower lip ; they are thicker than the other trophi ; they have their inner surfaces clothed with spines , sometimes divided into an upper and lower group , and occasionally separated by a deep notch : there are often long bristles outside .
they are furnished with at least two muscles ; in sessile cirripedes i have seen that they are capable of a rapid to and fro movement , and i have no doubt that their function is to brush any small creature , caught by the cirri , towards the maxillæ , which are well adapted to aid in securing the prey , and to hand it over to the mandibles , by them to be forced down the oesophagus .
on the exterior face of the outer maxillæ , above a trace of an upper articulation , either two small orifices or two large tubular projections can always be discovered ; and these , as <name> presently be mentioned , i believe to be olfactory organs .
cirri.  the five posterior pair are seated close to each other and equidistant ; the first pair is generally seated at a little distance , and sometimes at a considerable distance from the second pair .
the first pair is the shortest ; the others , proceeding backwards , increase gradually in length .
the rami of each pair are either equal in length or slightly unequal : those of the first pair are oftenest unequal .
the number of segments in the posterior cirri is sometimes very great ; in one species of alepas , there were above sixty segments in one ramus , the other ramus being in this unique case ( pl .
x , fig .
28 ) small and rudimentary .
the pedicels consist of two segments , a lower , longer , and upper short one ( fig .
18 , c , d . )
in the usual arrangement of the spines on the segments of the three posterior pair of cirri , there are ( figs .
26 , 27 ) from three to six pair of long spines on the anterior face , with generally some minute spines ( occasionally forming a tuft ) intermediate between them : on the dorsal surface , in the uppermost part of each segment , there is a tuft of short spines generally mingled with some longer , finer ones : on the inner side of each segment , on the upper rim , there are generally a few extremely minute and short spines .
from the increase of these latter and of the intermediate spines , the <unk> faces of the segments of the first cirrus , and of the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus ( pl .
x , fig .
25 ) , are almost always thickly paved with <unk> masses of spines .
the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the third cirrus is generally , though not always , thus paved : these paved segments are much broader than the others .
the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are often in some slight degree paved , though in other cases they resemble the three posterior pair of cirri .
the two segments of the pedicels have bristles on their anterior faces , essentially arranged on the same plan as on the segments of the rami : the bristles are generally not so symmetrically arranged on the pedicels of the second and third cirri , as on the three posterior pair .
there are some exceptions to the foregoing general rules : in the posterior cirri of alepas cornuta , there is only one pair of long spines to each segment ( fig .
28 ) ; in dichelaspis <unk> , there are eight pair ; in lepas fascicularis , in old specimens , the segments are paved with a triangular brush of spines ; the upper segments in pæcilasma eburnea support small oblong brushes ; and , lastly , in pæcilasma fissa ( fig .
29 ) , and crassa , the spines form a single circle round each segment , interrupted on the two sides .
these spines are often doubly serrated or plumose : many of them on the protuberant segments of the first three pair of cirri , are sometimes coarsely and doubly pectinated .
caudal appendages.  these are present ( pl .
x , figs .
18 to 24 ) seated on each side of the anus , in all the genera , except in conchoderma , anelasma , and scalpellum villosum ; they consist of a very small single segment , destitute of spines in lepas , and spinose in pæcilasma , dichelaspis , <unk> , scalpellum , and some species of pollicipes ; they consist of several segments in alepas , ibla , lithotrya , and in some species of pollicipes .
in the latter genus , some species have their caudal appendages <unk> , though so obscurely articulated , that the passage ( fig .
22 ) from several to one segment is seen to be easily effected .
when the appendage consists of many articulations , it is generally about as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus ; but in ibla quadrivalvis , it is four times as long .
the segments are narrow , slightly flattened , much tapering ; each ( fig .
24 ) is surmounted by a ring of short spines , which are generally longest on the apex of the terminal segment .
i could never trace muscles into these appendages .
alimentary <unk>  the oesophagus is of considerable length : it is formed of strong , transparent , much folded membrane , continuous with the outer integuments , and moulted with them : it is surrounded by corium , and as already stated , by numerous muscles : at its lower end it expands into a <name> , with the edges reflexed , and sometimes sinuous : this <name> lies within the stomach , and keeps the upper broad end expanded .
according to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle , the oesophagus runs in a more or less parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri , and enters the stomach more or less obliquely .
in ibla alone , it passes exteriorly to , and over the adductor scutorum muscle .
the stomach lies in a much curved , almost doubled course ; it is often a little constricted where most bent ; it is broadest at the upper end , and here , in lepas and conchoderma , there are some deep branching cæca ; in the latter of these two genera , the whole surface is , in addition , pitted in transverse lines .
the stomach is coated by small , opaque , pulpy , slightly <unk> glands , believed to be <unk> ; these are arranged in longitudinal lines , in all the genera , except in alepas , in which they are transverse and <unk> : the whole stomach is thus coated .
there is , also , a coating of excessively delicate , longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ .
the <unk> varies in length , extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri : it is narrow , and formed of much folded transparent membrane , resembling the oesophagus , continuous with the outer integuments , with which it is periodically moulted .
the anus is a small longitudinal slit , in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen , let in between the last thoracic tergal arches , as already mentioned under the head of the metamorphoses ; it lies almost between the caudal appendages , and opens on the dorsal surface .
within the stomach , there can generally be plainly seen , in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken , a thin , yet strong , perfectly transparent <unk> membrane , not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure : it enters the branching cæca , and extends from the edge of the <name> of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed <unk> , and consequently terminates in a point : it consists of chitine , like the outer integuments of the animal , and by placing the whole body in caustic potash , i have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach , and seen the bag open at its upper end , perfectly preserved , floating in the middle of the body , and full of the debris of the food .
in most of the specimens which i have examined , preserved in spirits of wine , this <unk> lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach ; and hence was thought by m. <name> st. <unk> to be a distinct organ , like the closed tube in certain <unk> .
occasionally , i have seen one imperfect <unk> bag or tube within another and <unk> one .
digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach ; if there be any difference , the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part .
the prey , consisting generally of crustacea , infusoria , minute spiral <unk> , and often of the larvæ of cirripedes , is not triturated : when the nutritious <unk> have been absorbed , the <unk> are cast out through the anus , all kept together in the <unk> bag , which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach , with the exception of that part coated by the <name> of the oesophagus .
i have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong , for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire , so as not to <unk> the sack .
i believe lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus ; at least , i found in one case , many <unk> small crustaceans in the sack , and others of the same kind in the stomach .
<unk> system.  i can add hardly anything to what little has been given by m. <name> st. <unk> : like others , i have failed , as yet , in discovering a heart .
the whole body is <unk> by channels , which have not any proper coat : there is one main channel along the ventral surface of the thorax , dividing and surrounding the mouth , and giving out branches which enter the inner of the two channels in each cirrus : as <unk> has shown , there are also two channels in the penis .
there are two <unk> channels in the prosoma , which are in direct connection with the great main channel , running down the rostral ( i .
e. , ventral ) side of the peduncle .
this latter main channel branches out in the lower part , and transmits the fluid through the ovarian tubes , whence , i believe , it flows upwards and round the sack , <unk> the body near the sides of the adductor scutorum muscle .
the main rostral channel ( or artery ? )
in the uppermost part of the peduncle , has a depending curtain , which , i think , must act as a valve , so as to prevent the circulating fluid <unk> into the animal 's body during the <unk> of the peduncle .
nervous system and organs of <unk>  in most of the genera , there are six main ganglia , namely , the supra-oesophageal , and five thoracic ganglia ; but in pollicipes mitella there are only four thoracic ganglia .
of these , the first thoracic or <unk> ganglion is considerably the largest and most massive ; it is <unk> , or oval , or <unk> ; it presents no trace of being formed by the union of two lateral ganglia .
two great nerves spring from its under side ( a ) , represented in the woodcut on <name> 49 , by dotted lines , and run straight down amongst the viscera in the prosoma : these nerves are about as large as those forming the collar and those running to the second ganglion ; hence , six great nerves meet here , two in front , two behind , and two on the under side .
at the anterior end , over the junction with the collar chord , three <unk> nerves rise on each side , with a fourth , smaller one , outside ; these go to the trophi and to the two olfactory sacks .
at the posterior end , on each side , a pair of nerves branch out rectangularly , one of which ( a , ) goes to the first cirrus , and there divides into two branches ; of these , the upper runs up the cirrus , and the lower one downwards .
the other nerve ( b ) , proceeding on each side from this first thoracic ganglion , runs to the muscles beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus .
the collar surrounding the oesophagus is generally very long , sometimes equalling the whole thoracic chord ; at a middle point , a small branch is sent off , and at the anterior end ( e , e ) , close to the supra-oesophageal ganglia , double or treble fine branches run to the true ovaria , lying close to the upper end of the stomach .
the four ( or only three ) other thoracic ganglia , when viewed as transparent bodies , are seen to be solid ; but in some of the genera , as in conchoderma , the outline plainly shows , that each consists of a lateral pair fused together .
the second thoracic ganglion ( b ) is rather small ; it is either close to the first , as in pollicipes mitella and lepas fascicularis , or far distant , as in ibla .
the third ( c ) and fourth are of about the same size with the second : these three ganglia send large branches to the second , third , and fourth pair of cirri : other minute branches spring from their under sides , and from the intermediate double chords .
the fifth ganglion is larger and longer than the three preceding ones , and gives off nerves to the fifth and sixth pair of cirri ; it is clearly formed by the union of the fifth , with what ought to have formed a sixth ganglion .
the two nerves going to the sixth cirrus give off on their inner sides , each a great branch to the penis .
in pollicipes mitella , in which there are only four instead of five thoracic ganglia , it is evident from the outline and position of the nerves going to the fourth pair of cirri , that the fourth ganglion is fused into the fifth , itself , as we have just seen , normally composed of two consecutive ganglia .
in this pollicipes there is other evidence of concentration in the nervous system , for none of the ganglia show signs of being formed of lateral pairs ; the second is close to the first ; and the abdominal double chord is in part separated by a mere cleft ; lastly , as we shall immediately see , the same remark is applicable to the supra-oesophageal ganglia .
the latter ( d ) alone remain to be described ; they present far more diversity in shape than do the thoracic ganglia ; they are almost always seen in outline to be laterally distinct , and usually resemble two pears with their tapering ends cut off and united ; in a transverse line they are as long as the <unk> ganglion , but are much less massive .
in lepas fascicularis ( d ) , they are pear-shaped ; in pollicipes mitella they are globular , and separated by a third globular ganglion , which i believe is the ophthalmic ganglion , presently to be described ; in pollicipes spinosus , however , the ophthalmic ganglion is , as usual , placed in advance of the supra-oesophageal ganglion , which latter , in this one species , shows no sign of being formed of a lateral pair fused together .
in alepas cornuta the supra-oesophageal ganglion consists of two quite distinct ganglia , elongated in the longitudinal axis of the body , and separated from each other by the whole width of the mouth ; the chord which unites them is of the same thickness as the rest of the collar .
in all the genera , from the front of each of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia , a pair of nerves , ( f , f , ) united and together as large as the collar nerve , rises , and can be traced running <unk> , in a nearly straight line , for a length equalling the whole rest of the nervous chord , so as to supply the peduncle and the inside of the capitulum or sack .
at the inner ends of these two same ganglia , from a central point where they are united , a little central branch runs in front to the adductor scutorum and other adjoining muscles ; and still smaller <unk> run behind to the <unk> muscles .

ophthalmic ganglia and <unk>  owing to professor <unk> 's [ 16 ] discovery of eyes in a balanus , i was led to look for them in the lepadidæ .
extending from the front of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia , two chords may be seen in lepas fascicularis ( of which a rude diagram is here given ) , to run into two small , perfectly distinct oval ganglia ( e ) , which are not united by any transverse <unk> .
from the opposite ends of these two ganglia smaller nerves run , and , bending inwards at right angles , enter , beyond the middle , an elongated ( f ) , almost black , eye , composed of two eyes united together .
although in outline the eye appears single , two lenses can be distinctly seen at the end , directed upwards and towards the ganglia ; two <unk> can also be distinguished ; these are deep and <unk> , and of a dark <unk> .

in conchoderma aurita the ophthalmic ganglia are much smaller , and nearer to the supra-oesophageal ganglion , than in l .
fascicularis .
in alepas cornuta the ophthalmic chords run towards each other from the two distant and separate supra-oesophageal ganglia ; and the ophthalmic ganglia , ( instead of being quite separate , as in l .
fascicularis , ) are united by their front ends , and the two eyes instead of standing some way in front , with nerves running to them , are embedded on the double ophthalmic ganglion ; the <unk> here , also , have the shape of mere saucers , and are joined back to back , with the two lenses projecting far out of them .
in neither sex of ibla could i perceive that the eye was double .
in pollicipes spinosus the ophthalmic ganglion stands in front of the single supra-oesophageal ganglion , and shows no signs of being formed of a lateral pair ; the eyes themselves , however , differently from , in all the foregoing cases , are , though approximate , quite distinct .
in pollicipes mitella i did not see the eyes ; but the ophthalmic ganglion consists , as i believe , of a single globular one , placed exactly between the two globular , supra-oesophageal ganglia , all three being of nearly equal size .
professor <unk> does not mention the ophthalmic ganglia ; hence i infer that in balanus , which is a more highly organised cirripede , they are fused into the supra-oesophageal ganglion .
in all the genera , the double eye is seated deep within the body ; it is attached by fibrous tissue to the radiating muscles of the lowest part of the oesophagus , and lies actually on the upper part of the stomach ; consequently , a <name> of light , to reach the eye , has to pass through the exterior membrane and underlying corium connecting the two scuta , and to penetrate deeply into the body .
in living sessile cirripedes , vision seems confined to the perception of the shadow of an object passing between them and the light ; they instantly perceived a hand passed quickly at the distance of several feet between a candle and the basin in which they were placed .
as the <unk> ganglion sends nerves to the trophi and to the first pair of cirri , it must correspond to the segments , from the fourth to the ninth inclusive , of the <unk> crustacean .
the state of the supra-oesophageal and ophthalmic ganglia appears to me very interesting : i do not believe that in any mature ordinary crustacean , the first or ophthalmic ganglion can be shown to be distinct from the two succeeding ganglia , or to be itself composed of a pair laterally distinct .
the ganglia , corresponding with the second and third segments of the body , which should normally support two pair of antennæ , are in the lepadidæ united together ; but laterally they are generally distinct in outline , and are actually separate in alepas : the supra-oesophageal ganglion shows also its double nature , by giving rise to a pair of large double nerves , evidently corresponding with the two pair of <unk> nerves in ordinary crustaceans .
the embryonic condition of the whole supra-oesophageal portion of the nervous system in the lepadidæ , corresponds with the rudimentary state of the only organ of sense supplied by it , namely , the eye , which in size and general appearance has <unk> to the state in which it was in , during the first stage of development of the larva ;  i have used the term embryonic , because , in the embryos of ordinary crustacea , all the ganglia are at first longitudinally distinct , and laterally quite separate .
the conclusion at which we before arrived from studying the metamorphoses , namely , that the whole peduncle and capitulum consisted of the first three segments of the head , is beautifully supported by the structure of the nervous system , in which these parts are seen to be supplied with nerves exclusively from the supra-oesophageal ganglion : now in ordinary crustacea the supra-oesophageal ganglion sends nerves to the eyes and the two pair of antennæ corresponding , as is known by embryological <unk> , to the first three segments of the body .
moreover , it is asserted that the carapace which covers the thorax in crustacea , is not formed by the development of the first segment ; and this , likewise , may be inferred to be the case with the peduncle and capitulum in the lepadidæ , as the nerves of the ophthalmic ganglia go exclusively to the eyes .
finally , i may remark that in pollicipes , looking to the whole nervous system , the state of concentration nearly equals that in certain <unk> <unk> crustaceans , for instance the <unk> <unk> , of which a figure is given by milne edwards .
olfactory <unk>  in the outer maxillæ , at their bases where united together , but above the basal fold separating the mouth from the body , there are , in all the genera , a pair of orifices ( pl .
x , fig .
16 ) ; these are sometimes seated on a slight prominence , as in lithotrya , or on the summit of flattened tubes ( pl .
x , fig .
17 ) , projecting upwards and towards each other , as in ibla , scalpellum , and pollicipes .
in ibla these tubular projections rise from almost between the outer and inner maxillæ .
it is impossible to behold these organs , and doubt that they are of high functional importance to the animal .
the orifice leads into a deep sack lined by pulpy corium , and closed at the bottom .
the outer integument is inflected inwards , ( hence periodically moulted , ) and becoming of excessive tenuity , runs to near the bottom of the sack , where it ends in an open tube : so excessively thin is this inflected membrane , that , until examining anelasma , i was not quite certain that i was right in believing that the outer integument did not extend over the whole bottom .
i several times saw a nerve of considerable size entering and blending into a pulpy layer at the bottom of the sack of corium ; but i failed in tracing to which of the three pair of nerves , springing from the front end of the <unk> ganglion , it joined .
i can hardly avoid concluding , that this closed sack , with its naked bottom , is an organ of sense ; and , considering that the outer maxillæ serve to <name> the prey entangled by the cirri towards the maxillæ and mandibles , the position seems so admirably adapted for an olfactory organ , whereby the animal could at once perceive the nature of any floating object thus caught , that i have ventured provisionally to designate the two orifices and sacks as olfactory .
acoustic ( ? )
<unk>  a little way beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 d , and pl .
iv , fig .
2 e ) , on each side , there may be seen a slight swelling , and on the under side of this , a transverse <unk> orifice , <unk> of an inch in length in conchoderma , but often only half that size .
in ibla this orifice is seated lower down ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , e ) , between the bases of the first and second cirri , which are here far apart : in alepas cornuta it is placed rather nearer to the adductor scutorum muscle , namely , beneath the mandibles .
the orifice leads into a rather deep and wide meatus ; the external integument is turned in for a short distance , widening a little , and then ends abruptly .
the meatus , enlarging upwards , is lined by thick pulpy corium , and is closed at the upper end ; from its summit is suspended a flattened sack of singular and different shapes in the different genera .
this , the so-called acoustic sack of conchoderma virgata , is figured pl .
ix , fig .
6 .
the deep and wide notch faces towards the posterior end of the animal ; the inferior lobe , thus almost cut off , is flattened in a different plane from the upper part ; the lobe is lodged in a little pouch of corresponding form , leading from the open meatus in which the upper part is included .
in conchoderma aurita , the top of the acoustic sack is narrower and more constricted , the whole more rounded , and the lobe more turned down .
in lepas fascicularis the notch is not so deep or wide , and the lobe larger .
in ibla cumingii the sack is of the shape of a vase , with one corner folded over .
in scalpellum vulgare it is small , oval , with the lower end much pushed in , and furnished with a little crest .
lastly , in pollicipes mitella it is simply oval .
in all cases the sack is empty , or contains only a little pulpy matter : it consists of brownish , thick , and remarkably elastic tissue , formed , apparently , of transverse little pillars , becoming fibrous on the outside , and with their inner ends appearing like <unk> points .
the mouth of the acoustic sack ( removed in the drawing ) is closed by a tender diaphragm , through which i saw what i believe was a <unk> nerve enter ; i have not yet succeeded in tracing this nerve .
the first pair of cirri seem , to a certain extent , to serve as antennæ , and therefore the position of an acoustic organ at their bases , is analogous to what takes place in crustacea ; but there are not here any <unk> , or the siliceous particles and hairs , as described by dr. <unk> , in that class .
nevertheless , the sack is so highly elastic , and its suspension in a meatus freely open to the water , seems so well adapted for an acoustic organ , that i have provisionally thus called it .
in the larva , as i have shown , a pouch , certainly serving for some sense , i believe for hearing , is seated in quite a different position at the anterior end of the carapace .
i may mention that i found sessile cirripedes very sensitive of vibrations in objects adjoining them , though not , apparently , of noises in the air or water .
in a group of specimens , i could not touch one even most delicately with a needle , without all the adjoining ones instantly withdrawing their cirri ; it made no difference if the one touched had its <unk> already closed and motionless .
reproductive system ,  male <unk>  all the cirripedia which i have hitherto examined , with the exception of certain species of ibla and scalpellum , are hermaphrodite or <unk> .
[ 17 ] i shall so fully describe the sexual relations of the several species of these two genera , under their respective headings , and at the end of the genus of scalpellum , that i <name> not here give even an abstract of the grounds on which my firm belief is based , that the masculine power of certain hermaphrodite species of ibla and scalpellum , is rendered more efficient by certain parasitic males , which , from their not pairing , as in all hitherto known cases , with females , but with hermaphrodites , i have designated complemental males .
[ 17 ] i am compelled to differ greatly from the account given by prof. steenstrup of the reproductive system in the cirripedia , in his <unk> <unk> das <unk> des <unk> , ch .
v , 1846 ;  a translation of which i have seen , owing to the great kindness of mr. <unk> .
mr. <unk> has described ( <unk> .
new <name> .
journal , ' july 1843 , ) what he considers the male of balanus ; but i have seen this same parasitic creature charged with ova , including larvæ !
from the resemblance of the larvæ to the little crustacean described by mr. <unk> , in the same paper , as a distinct parasite , i believe the latter to be the male of his so-called male balanus , and that all belong to the same species , allied to <unk> .
this genus , as is well known , is parasitic on other crustacea ; and it is a rather interesting fact thus to find , that this new parasite which is allied to <unk> , in structure , is likewise allied to it in habits , living attached to cirripedia , a <unk> of the crustacea .
the male organs have been well described by m. <name> st. <unk> , whose observations have since been confirmed by r .
wagner .
[ 18 ] the testes are small , often <unk> , either pear or <unk> , or branched like <unk> ,  these several forms sometimes occurring in the same individual ; they coat the stomach , enter the pedicels , and even the basal segments of the rami of the cirri , and in some genera occupy certain <unk> on the thorax and prosoma , and in others the filamentary appendages : the testes seen in the apex in one of these appendages in conchoderma , is represented in pl .
ix , fig .
5 .
the two vesiculæ seminales are very large ; they lie along the abdominal surface of the thorax , and generally ( but not in some species of scalpellum ) enter the prosoma , where their broad ends are often reflexed ; here the branched vessels leading from the testes enter .
the membrane of the vesiculæ seminales is formed of circular fibres ; and is , i presume , <unk> , for i have seen the spermatozoa expelled with force from the cut end of a living specimen .
the two canals leading from the vesiculæ generally unite in a single <unk> at the base of the penis ; but in conchoderma aurita , half-way up it .
the probosciformed penis , except in certain species of scalpellum , is very long ; it is capable of the most varied movements ; it is generally hairy , especially at the end ; it is supported on a straight <unk> basis , which in ibla quadrivalvis alone ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) , is of considerable length ; in this species , the upper part is seen to be as plainly articulated as one of the cirri ; in alepas , the articulations are somewhat less plain , and in the other genera , the organ can be said only to be finely ringed , but these rings no doubt are in fact obscure articulations .
in the females of ibla cumingii and scalpellum ornatum , there is , of course , no penis .
[ 18 ] in <unk> 's <unk> , ' 1834 , p. 467 .
i have already several times referred to m. <name> st. <unk> 's excellent memoir , read before the academy of sciences , and subsequently , in 1835 , published separately .
female <unk>  m. <name> st. <unk> has described how the peduncle [ 19 ] is gorged with an inextricable mass of branching ovarian tubes , filled with granular matter and immature ova .
in conchoderma and alepas , the ovarian tubes run up in a single plane ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 , ) between the two folds of corium round the sack .
here the development of the ova can be well followed : a minute point first branches out from one of the tubes ; its head then enlarges , like the <name> of a <unk> on a footstalk ; becomes globular ; shows traces of dividing , and at last splits into three , four , or five <unk> balls , which finally separate as perfect ova .
within the peduncle , the ovarian tubes branch out in all directions , and within the footstalks of the branches ( differently from what takes place round the sack ) , ova are developed , as well as at their ends .
close together , along the rostral ( i .
e. , ventral ) edge of the peduncle , two nearly straight , main ovarian tubes or ducts may be detected , which do not give out any branches till about half way down the peduncle , where they <unk> into branches , which <unk> together , and give rise to the mass filling the peduncle , and sometimes , as we have just seen , sending up branches round the sack .
these two main <unk> ovarian ducts , followed up the peduncle , are seen to enter the body of the cirripede ( close along side the great double <unk> nerves ) , and then separating , they sweep in a large curve along each flank of the prosoma , under the superficial muscles , towards the bases of the first pair of cirri ; and then rising up , they run into two glandular masses .
these latter rest on the upper edge of the stomach , and touch the cæca where such exist ; they were thought by cuvier to be <unk> glands .
they are of an orange colour , and form two , parallel , <unk> masses , having , in conchoderma , a great flexure , and generally dividing at the end near the mouth into a few blunt branches .
i was not able to ascertain whether the two main ducts , coming from the peduncle , expanded to envelope them , or what the precise connection was .
the state of these two masses varied much ; sometimes they were hollow , with only their walls spotted with a few cellular little masses ; at other times they contained or rather were formed of , more or less globular or <unk> <unk> of pulpy matter ; and lastly , the whole consisted of separate pointed little balls , each with a large inner cell , and this again with two or three included granules .
these so closely resembled , in general appearance and size , the <unk> with their <unk> vesicles and spots , which i have often seen at the first commencement of the formation of the ova in the ovarian tubes in the peduncle , that i can not doubt that such is their nature .
hence i conclude , that these two <unk> masses are the true ovaria .
i may add , that several times i have seen in the two long , <unk> ducts , connecting the true ovaria and the ovarian tubes in the peduncle , pellets of orange-coloured cellular matter ( i .
e. , <unk> ) forming at short intervals little <unk> in the ducts , and apparently travelling into the peduncle .
[ 19 ] i may here mention , that in all sessile cirripedes , the ovarian branching tubes lie between the calcareous or membranous basis and the inner basal lining of the sack , and to a certain height upwards round the sack : the true ovaria and the two ducts occupy the same position as in the lepadidæ .
the structure here described is quite conformable with that which we have seen in the larva ; in the latter , two <unk> masses of equal thickness extended from the cæca of the stomach to within the future peduncle , where the cement-ducts entered them , and where , after a short period , they were seen to expand into a mass of ovarian tubes .
in the mature cirripede , the cement-ducts can still be found united to the ovarian tubes in the middle of peduncle ; and the cause of the wide separation of the true ovaria and ovarian tubes , can be simply accounted for by the internal , almost complete intersection of the animal , which takes place during the last metamorphosis .
the ova , when excluded , remain in the sack of the animal until the larvæ are hatched ; they are very numerous , and generally form two concave , nearly circular , leaves , which i have called after steenstrup and other authors , the ovigerous lamellæ ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 b ) .
these lamellæ lie low down on each side of the sack : in conchoderma virgata , however , there is often only a single <unk> , forming a deeply concave cup : in c .
aurita there are generally on each side four lamellæ , one under the other .
the ova lie in a layer from two to four deep ; and all are held together by a most delicate transparent membrane , which separately <unk> each <unk> : this membrane is often thicker and stronger round the margins of the lamellæ , where they are united , in a peculiar manner , presently to be described , to a fold of skin , on each side of the sack : these two folds , i have called the ovigerous fræna ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) .
m. <name> st. <unk> , describes an orifice under the <name> , by which he supposes the ova to enter the sack ; this , after repeated and most careful examinations , i venture to affirm does not exist ; on the contrary , i have every reason to believe that the ova enter the sack in the following curious manner .
immediately before one of the periods of exuviation , the ova burst forth from the the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and round the sack , and , carried along the open <unk> channels , are collected ( by means unknown to me ) beneath the <unk> of the sack , in the corium , which is at this period remarkably spongy and full of cavities .
the corium then forms or rather ( as i believe ) resolves itself into the very delicate membrane separately enveloping each <unk> , and uniting them together into two lamellæ ; the corium having thus far retreated , then forms under the lamellæ the <unk> of the sack , which <name> of course be of larger size than the <unk> one , now immediately to be moulted with the other integuments of the body .
as soon as this exuviation is effected , the tender ova , united into two lamellæ , and adhering , as yet , to the bottom of the sack , are exposed : as the membranes <unk> , the lamellæ become detached from the bottom of the sack , and are attached to the ovigerous fræna .
to demonstrate this view , an individual should have been found , with both the old and new chitine tunic of the sack , and with the lamellæ lying between them ; this , i believe , i have seen , but it was before i understood the full importance of the fact : a great number of specimens would have to be examined in order to succeed again , for the changes connected with exuviation <unk> very quickly .
i have , however , several times found the ova so loose under the sack , as to be detached with a touch from the ovarian tubes ; and i have twice carefully examined specimens , which had just moulted , as shown by even the mandibles being flexible , in which the lamellæ had not become united to the fræna , but still adhered to the <unk> chitine tunic of the sack ; in these , the ova were so tender , that they broke into pieces rather than be separated from the membrane of the <unk> , itself hardly perfectly developed , for pulpy cellular matter adhered outside some of the ova .
these and other facts are quite inexplicable on any other view than that advanced .
as the lamellæ are formed without organic union with the parent , they would be liable to be washed out of the widely open sack of the lepadidæ , if they had not been specially attached to the fræna .
these fræna consist of a pair of more or less semicircular folds of skin , depending inside the sack , on each side of the point of attachment of the body .
the fræna are often of considerable size , but in ibla , they are very minute ; they are formed of chitine tunic with underlying corium , like the rest of the sack ; on their crests , there is a row , or a set of circular groups , or a broad surface , covered , either with minute , pointed , bead-like bodies mounted on long <unk> footstalks , or with <unk> bodies on very short footstalks .
i measured some of the bead-like bodies , in lepas anserifera , and they were <unk> of an inch in diameter , and the footstalks three or four times as long as the elongated heads .
these heads , of whatever shape they may be , have an opaque , and , i believe , glandular centre ; i could not make out with certainty an aperture at their ends , but , i believe , such exists , and they seem to secrete a substance , which <unk> into a strong membrane , serving to unite the crest of the <unk> to the edges of the lamellæ .
in one case , this bit of membrane seemed formed of a woven mass of threads .
these little glandular bodies , with the membrane formed by them , are cast off at each exuviation , and new glands formed on the crest of the <unk> underneath .
in some species of pollicipes , ( viz. , p .
cornucopia and elegans , ) the fræna , though present and large , are functionless and destitute of the glands : i believe , they exist in this same functionless condition , and in rather a different position in the sessile cirripedes , and that in this family they serve as branchiæ .
the above-described method by which cirripedia lay their eggs , namely , united together in a common membrane , placed between their old outer and new inner integuments , and the manner in which the lamellæ , when thus formed , are retained for a time fastened to the fræna , and are then cast off , appears to me very curious .
in some of the lower crustacea , it is known , that the ova escape by <unk> the <unk> formed by the protruded ovarian tubes , and this is the nearest analogy with which i am acquainted .
the ova are impregnated ( as i infer from the state of the vesiculæ seminales ) , when first brought into the sack , and whilst the membrane of the lamellæ is very tender : the long probosciformed penis seems well adapted for this end .
in the male of ibla cumingii , which has not a probosciformed penis , the whole flexible body , probably , performs the function of the penis : in scalpellum ornatum , however , the spermatozoa must be brought in by the action of the cirri , or of the currents produced by them .
that cross impregnation may and sometimes does take place , i infer from the singular case of an individual , in a group of <unk> , in which the penis had been cut off , and had healed without any perforation ; notwithstanding which fact , larvæ were included in the ova .
exuviation ; rate of growth ; size.  i have had occasion repeatedly to allude to the exuviation of the lepadidæ : with the exception of the genus lithotrya , [ 20 ] in which the calcareous scales on the peduncle , together with the membrane connecting them , is cast off , neither the valves nor the membrane uniting them , nor that forming the peduncle with its scales and styles , are moulted ; but the surface gradually <unk> and is removed , perhaps sometimes in flakes , whilst new and larger layers are formed beneath .
in scalpellum , i ascertained that the new membrane , connecting together the <unk> calcified rims under the valves of the capitulum , was formed as a fold , with the articulated spines which it bears , all <unk> in certain definite directions .
this fold of new membrane , when the old membrane splits and yields , of course expands , and thus the size of the capitulum is increased .
in the peduncle , lines of splitting can seldom be perceived , except , indeed , in the <unk> , embedded , <unk> peduncle of anelasma , as described under that genus .
i do not understand what determines the complicated lines of splitting of the old membrane between the several valves of the capitulum ,  without it be simply , that along these lines alone , the old membrane is not strengthened by the new membrane being closely applied under it , the new being formed , as we have just said , in a fold , in order to allow of increase in size .
although , as i believe , there is strictly no exuviation in the outer membranes of mature lepadidæ , it seems that narrow strips of membrane are cast off from between the valves , for the few first moults , after the final metamorphosis of the larva .
i may here remark that , in most sessile cirripedes , the outside membrane connecting the <unk> and shell , is regularly moulted .
[ 20 ] the external integuments being moulted in crustacea , but not in the cirripedia , may appear , at first , an important difference : but we here see that <unk> is not universal amongst the lepadidæ , and , on the other hand , according to m. <unk> , ( 'annales des sciences <unk> , ' 2d series , zoolog .
) , there is one true crustacean , the <name> <unk> , which has a persistent <unk> shell .
the delicate tunic lining the sack , ( a mere <unk> of that thick one , forming the outside of the capitulum , and generally transformed into valves , ) and the integuments of the whole body , are regularly moulted .
with these integuments , the membrane lining the oesophagus , the <unk> , and the deep olfactory pouches , and the horny <unk> of the maxillæ , are all cast together .
i have seen a specimen of lepas , in which , from some morbid adhesion , the old membrane lining one of the olfactory pouches had not been moulted , but remained projecting from the orifice as a brown shrivelled scroll .
the new spines on the cirri ( and on the maxillæ ) are formed within the old ones ; but as they have to be a little longer than the latter , and as they can not enter these up to their very points , their basal portions are not thus included , but are formed , running obliquely across the segments of the cirri ; and what is curious , these same basal portions are turned inside out , like the fingers of a glove when hastily drawn off .
after the exuviation of the old spines , the new spines have their inverted basal portions drawn out from within the segments , and turned outside in , so as to assume their proper positions .
all cirripedia grow rapidly : the yawl of h. m. s. beagle was lowered into the water , at the galapagos archipelago , on the 15th of <name> , and , after an interval of exactly thirty-three days , was hauled in : i found on her bottom , a specimen of conchoderma virgata with the capitulum and peduncle , each half an inch in length , and the former <unk> in width : this is half the size of the largest specimen i have seen of this species : several other individuals , not half the size of the above , contained numerous ova in their lamellæ , ready to burst forth .
supposing the larva of the largest specimen became attached the first day the boat was put into the water , we have the metamorphosis , an increase of length from about <unk> , the size of the larva , to an whole inch , and the laying of probably several sets of eggs , all effected in thirty-three days .
from this rapid growth , repeated <unk> must be requisite .
mr. w. thompson , of belfast , kept twenty specimens of balanus <unk> , a form of much slower growth , alive , and on the twelfth day he found the <unk> integument , showing that all had moulted once , and one individual twice within this period .
i may here add , that the pedunculated cirripedes never attain so large a bulk as the sessile ; lepas anatifera is sometimes sixteen inches in length , but of this , the far greater portion consists of the peduncle .
pollicipes mitella is the most massive kind ; i have seen a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch in width .
affinities.  considering the close affinity between the several genera , there are , i conceive , no grounds for dividing the lepadidæ into sub-families , as has been proposed by some authors , who have trusted exclusively to external characters .
in establishing the eleven genera in the lepadidæ , no one part or set of organs affords sufficient <unk> characters : the number of the valves is the most obvious , and one of the most useful characters , but it fails when the valves are nearly rudimentary , and when they are numerous : the direction of their lines of growth is more important , and fails to be characteristic only in scalpellum : with the same exception , the presence or <unk> of calcified or horny scales on the peduncle is a good generic character .
for this same end , the shape of the scuta and <name> , but not of the other valves , comes into play .
in three genera , the presence of filamentary appendages on the animal 's body is generic ; in pollicipes , however , they are found only on three out of the six species .
the number of teeth in the mandibles , and the shape of the maxillæ , often prove serviceable for this end ; as does more generally the presence of caudal appendages , and whether they be naked or spinose , <unk> or <unk> ; in pollicipes alone this part is variable , being <unk> <unk> ; and in one species of scalpellum they are absent , though present in all the others .
the shape of the body , the absence or presence of teeth on the labrum , the inner edge of the outer maxillæ being notched or straight , the prominence of the olfactory orifices , the arrangement of the spines on the cirri , and the number and form of their segments , are only of specific value .
comparing the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes , it is , i think , impossible to assign them a higher rank than that of families .
the chief difference between them consists , in the lepadidæ , in the presence of three layers of <unk> muscles , longitudinal , transverse and oblique , continuously surrounding the peduncle , but not specially attached to the scuta and terga ; and on the other hand , in the <unk> , of five longitudinal bundles of voluntary muscles , with transverse striæ , fixed to the scuta and terga , and giving them powers of independent movement .
in the lepadidæ , the lower valves , or when such are absent , the membranous walls of the capitulum , move with the scuta and terga when opened or shut ; and the lower part of the capitulum is separated by a <unk> peduncle from the surface of attachment ; in the sessile cirripedes , the lower valves are firmly united together into an immovable ring , fixed <unk> on the surface of attachment .
i <name> not compare the softer parts , such as the cirri and trophi , of the lepadidæ with those of the <unk> , as my examination of this latter family is not fully completed : i <name> only remark , that there is a very close general resemblance , more especially with the <unk> <unk> .
geographical range ; <unk>  the pedunculated cirripedes extend over the whole world ; and most of the individual species have large ranges , more especially , as might have been expected , those attached to floating objects ; excepting these latter , the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate , and tropical seas .
of those attached to fixed objects , or to littoral animals , it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality .
on the shores of europe i know of only three , viz. , a scalpellum , pollicipes , and alepas .
at madeira ( owing to the admirable researches of the rev .
r. t. lowe ) , two <unk> , a dichelaspis , and an <unk> are known .
in new zealand , there are two pollicipes and an alepas , and , perhaps , a fourth form .
from the philippine archipelago , in the great collection made by mr. cuming , there are a pæcilasma , an ibla , a scalpellum , pollicipes , and lithotrya .
of all the lepadidæ , nearly half are attached to floating objects , or to animals which are able to change their positions ; the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies , and more frequently to the former than to the latter .
most of the species of scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water ; on the other hand , most of pollicipes , [ 21 ] of ibla , and lithotrya are littoral forms .
the species of lithotrya have the power of <unk> burrows in calcareous rocks , shells , and corals ; and the singular manner in which this is effected , is described under that genus .
anelasma has its <unk> peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of northern sharks ; and i have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of conchoderma aurita , being sunk into the skin of <unk> ; in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of ibla , is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female .
i believe in all these cases , the <unk> substance affects and <unk> the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic , whilst the surrounding parts , being not injured , continue to grow upwards , thus causing the partial <unk> of the cirripede .
in the case of anelasma , we have growth at the end of the peduncle , and consequently downward pressure , and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on .
[ 21 ] i am informed by mr. l. reeve that pollicipes mitella is eaten on the coast of <name> ; and <name> states ( <unk> .
<unk> , ' <unk> ) that this is the case with p .
cornucopia on the shores of <name> .
it is well known that the gigantic balanus <unk> on the chilian coast , is sought after as a delicacy ; and i am assured , by mr. cuming , that it deserves its reputation .
geological <unk>  having treated this subject at length , in the volume of the <unk> society for 1851 , i <name> not here enter on it : i <name> only remark , that the lepadidæ or pedunculated cirripedes are much more ancient , according to our present state of knowledge , than the <unk> .
the former seem to have been at their <unk> point during the cretaceous period , when many species of scalpellum and pollicipes , and a singular new genus , <unk> , existed ; pollicipes is the oldest genus , having been found in the lower <unk> , and , perhaps , even in the <unk> .
the fossil species do not appear to have differed widely from existing forms .

[ 22 ] linnæus , as is well known , included under this genus both the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes .
according to the rules of the british association , the name lepas must be retained for part of the genus ; and as the sessile division was named balanus , by <unk> and hill , even before the invention of the <unk> system , and subsequently , in <unk> , by da <unk> , and again , in <unk> , by <unk> , there can be no question that lepas must be applied to the pedunculated section of the genus .
in this instance it is particularly desirable to recur to the linnean name , as no other name has been generally adopted .
had not <unk> and sir j. hill published before the <unk> system , their names of anatifera and <unk> would have had prior claims to lepas .
[ 23 ] the date of this publication is almost universally given as <unk> , apparently caused by an error in the title-page of the first part , which has consequently been <unk> .
the first part contains anatifa and balanus , and was published in <unk> .
the second part was published in <unk> , and has a corrected title-page for the whole volume .
<unk> 5 , <unk> : <name> <unk> inter terga <unk> , <unk> aut <unk> <unk> aut <unk> <unk> <unk> : scuta <unk> , <unk> ad <unk> <unk> <unk> valves 5 , approximate : <name> extending up between the terga , terminating downwards in an embedded fork , or in an external disc : scuta sub-triangular , with their umbones at the rostral <name> .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulation of the first cirri ; mandibles with five teeth ; maxillæ step-formed ; caudal appendages <unk> , smooth .
<unk>  mundane ; attached to floating objects .
<unk>  capitulum flattened , sub-triangular , composed of five approximate valves .
the valves are either moderately thick and translucent , or very thin and transparent ; and hence , though themselves colourless , they are often coloured by the underlying corium .
their surfaces are either smooth and polished , or <unk> , or furrowed , and sometimes pectinated .
they are not subject to disintegration ; they are generally naked , except on the borders , where they are coated , and held together by membrane ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the valves are covered with thin membrane , bearing very minute spines .
the manner of growth of the valves <name> be best described under each .
all the valves , even in the same species , are subject to considerable variation in shape , more especially the terga .
<unk>  these valves are sub-triangular in outline , with the basal margin straight and rather short ; and with occludent and <unk> margins more or less protuberant ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the basal ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , and occludent margins are slightly reflexed and prominent .
a ridge , generally runs from the umbo to the upper point .
internally , there is no conspicuous pit for the adductor muscle ; under the umbones , there is generally either on both valves , or only on the right-hand side ( pl .
i , fig .
1 c ) , a small calcareous projection or tooth , of variable size and shape , even in the same species ; it is generally largest on the right-hand valve ; these teeth at first sight appear to form a hinge , uniting the opposite scuta at their umbones , but this is not really the case , and their use appears to be only to give attachment to the membrane uniting the valves together , and to the peduncle .
the basal margin is internally strengthened by a calcified rim , more or less developed .
the umbones ( and primordial valves when distinguishable , ) are seated at the rostral angles ; during growth the basal margin is not added to , and the occludent margin only to small extent ; hence the main growth of the valve is at the upper end , and along the <unk> margin .
in l .
fascicularis , however , the basal reflexed margin is slightly added to beneath the umbo .
terga ,  flat , small compared with the scuta , usually of an irregular quadrilateral figure , with the two upper or occludent margins very short , in proportion to the two ( carinal and scutal ) lower margins ; all the margins are nearly straight .
the two occludent margins , generally meet each other at about right angles , forming a small triangular projection ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the occludent margin is formed by a single , slightly curved line .
the umbones ( and primordial valves when distinguishable ) are not seated at the uppermost point , but at the <name> where the carinal margin unites to the upper of the two occludent margins : during growth the terga are added to , both on the occludent and on the scutal margins , and slightly along the carinal margin ; hence their growth is unequally <unk> , except at one <name> of the irregular quadrilateral figure .
<unk>  this is always very narrow and curved , concave within , often <unk> and barbed exteriorly ; it extends upwards between the terga for one half or two thirds of their length : at the lower extremity it ends ( with the exception of l .
fascicularis ) , in a small fork ( pl .
i , fig .
1 , a , b ) rectangularly inflected and embedded in the membrane , beneath the basal margin of the scuta .
from comparing this lower part of the <name> in l .
australis ( fig .
5 a ) , with the same part in some of the species of the allied genus pæcilasma , it would appear that the fork is formed by an oblong disc , more and more notched at the end , and with the rim between the two points more or less folded backwards : conformably with this view , in very young specimens of l .
australis , instead of a large and sharp fork , there is a small disc .
the only use of the fork appears to be to give firm attachment to the membrane uniting the valves and peduncle .
in l .
fascicularis , instead of a fork , there is a broad , oblong disc ( figs .
6 , 6 a ) , rectangularly inflected ; it is much longer than the fork , in proportion to the upper part of the <name> ; the disc is not more deeply embedded than the upper part .
the umbo ( and primordial valve when distinguishable , ) of the <name> is seated just above the embedded fork ( or disc in l .
fascicularis ) , at the point where the inflection takes place ; hence the main growth of the <name> is upwards ,  the fork , however , being of course , likewise added to at its point : in l .
fascicularis , the growth is both upwards and downwards .
peduncle and <unk>  the peduncle is generally quite smooth : though with a high power its surface may be seen to be studded with minute beads , or larger discs , of yellowish and hard chitine ; in the young of l .
australis , and i suspect of some other species , it is covered with very minute spines .
the peduncle in this genus attains its greatest development .
the <unk> <unk> , i believe , only through the functionless larval antennæ , except in one species , l .
fascicularis , in which a ball of this substance is formed in a most peculiar manner round the peduncle ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , apparently for the purpose of serving as a float , as <name> be presently described .
size and <unk>  the species of this genus are the largest of the <unk> , with the exception of some pollicipes : even in the smallest species ( l .
<unk> ) , the capitulum sometimes attains a length of about half an inch .
the peduncle varies much in length in the same species : in l .
anatifera , it is occasionally above a foot long .
the colours of l .
anatifera , l .
<unk> , and l .
anserifera , are very bright and striking ; the membrane bordering the valves and that round the top of peduncle in two of the species , is of the brightest <unk> ; the valves , owing to the underlying corium , are pale <unk> , and the interspaces between them dark <unk> .
the cirri and trophi are generally dark purple or <unk> .
filamentary appendages.  these are attached to beneath the basal articulation of first pair of cirri ; they vary in the several species , from one to five or six on each side , the lowest being always the longest .
several of them are occupied by testes .
in l .
<unk> , generally , not even one is developed .
they are subject to great variation in their proportional lengths , and in number , in the same species .
these organs have generally been considered to serve as branchiæ ; i see no reason to believe that they are more especially designed for this end , than is the general surface of the body .
mouth.  the labrum is moderately bullate , the longitudinal diameter of this part equalling about one third , or half of that of the rest of the mouth .
the palpi are moderately developed .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
5 ) have five teeth with the inferior point either broad , or very narrow and <unk> .
the maxillæ are step-formed ( pl .
x , fig .
9 ) ; the first step is sometimes indistinct and curved ; and in l .
<unk> , all the steps vary much , and are more or less blended together .
the outer maxillæ ( like those at pl .
x , fig .
16 ) , are internally clothed continuously with spines .
the olfactory orifices are not at all prominent .
cirri.  the first pair is placed near the second pair , and is of considerable length ; the second has the anterior ramus thicker than the posterior ramus , and the segments <unk> ; the segments ( pl .
x , fig .
26 ) of the four posterior cirri bear from four to six pair of long spines , with a row of small intermediate spines : in the posterior cirri of l .
australis the lateral rim spines are much developed ; and in those of l .
fascicularis , the usual pairs of large spines are lost in a broad triangular brush , formed by the increase of the lateral marginal , and intermediate spines .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
18 b ) , very small , either blunt or pointed , and quite destitute of spines .
the prosoma is well developed .
the stomach is surrounded in the upper part by a circle of large branching cæca .
the generative system is highly developed ; the testes coating the whole of the stomach , entering the filamentary appendages and the pedicels of the cirri ; the two ovigerous lamellæ contain a vast number of ova ; they are united to rather large fræna , of which the sinuous margin supports either a continuous row or separate tufts of glands .
<unk>  the species abound over the arctic , temperate and tropical parts of the atlantic , indian and pacific oceans , and are always , or nearly always , attached to floating objects , dead or alive .
the same species have enormous ranges ; in proof of which i may mention that of the six known species , five are found nearly all over the world , including the british coast ; and the one not found on our shores , the l .
australis , apparently inhabits the whole circumference of the southern ocean .
general remarks and affinities.  the first five species form a most natural genus ; they are often sufficiently difficult to be distinguished , owing to their great variability .
the sixth species ( l .
fascicularis ) differs to a slight extent in many respects from the other species , and has considerable claims to be <unk> separated , as has been proposed by mr. gray , under the name of <unk> ; but as it is identical in structure in all the more essential parts , i have not thought fit to separate it .
as far as external characters go , some of the species of pæcilasma have not stronger claims , than has l .
fascicularis , to be <unk> separated ; and i at first retained them altogether , but in drawing up this generic description , i found scarcely a single observation applicable to both halves of the genus ; hence i was led to separate lepas and pæcilasma .
if i had retained these two genera together , i should have had , also , to include the species of dichelaspis and <unk> ; and even scalpellum would have been <unk> only by the number of its valves ; this would obviously have been highly inconvenient .
although some of the species of pæcilasma so closely resemble externally the species of lepas , yet if we consider their entire structure , we shall find that they are sufficiently distinct ; as indirect evidence of this , i may remark that conchoderma ( as defined in this volume ) , includes two genera of most authors , and yet certainly comes , if judged by its whole organisation , nearer to lepas than does pæcilasma .

[ 24 ] as this , though the commonest species , has never been defined , i give only a few <unk> and references , it being quite impossible to distinguish , in any published description , this species from a .
<unk> of leach ; this latter species i recognise under this name only from having authentic specimens from the british museum , as leach overlooked every one of the real <unk> characters .
[ 25 ] i have used , in conformity with botanists , the <name> of <unk> , to show that i have seen an authentic specimen .

general appearance.  valves white , more or less translucent and thick , with a tinge of <unk> , from the underlying corium ; sometimes brownish cream-coloured , rarely with a tint of purple .
surfaces smooth , with traces of very fine lines radiating from the umbones , sometimes rather plain on the basal part of the scuta .
length in proportion to the breadth of the capitulum variable , owing to the varying degree to which the scuta and terga have their apices produced .
scuta with the occludent margin either considerably curved or nearly straight .
the internal tooth of the right-hand scutum , close to the umbo , varies in size and form , being either pointed , square , or obliquely truncated on either side , or it has a notch on the summit ; internal basal rim of the scuta either plainly developed or nearly absent .
in many specimens ( pl .
i , fig .
1 ) , on the scuta , or on the scuta and terga , ( and sometimes more on one side of the individual than on the other , ) a nearly straight line , running diagonally across the capitulum , of slight , quadrilateral depressions , of a dirty greenish colour , with the edges blending away , is either conspicuously developed , or can only just be discerned .
these marks increase in size from the umbones to the margins of the valves .
there are sometimes two or even three rows on the scuta .
they are formed by the retention of a portion of the chitine membrane , which is cast off the rest of the surface ; the margins of the valves are occasionally notched slightly on the line of marks ; there is no difference along this line in the underlying corium .
specimens both with and without a barbed <name> are thus characterised .
<name> ; the interspace between the <name> and the scuta and terga is not wide .
the <name> exteriorly , is either convex and smooth , or furnished with knobs or with extremely sharp , long teeth ( pl .

peduncle smooth , wrinkled , length in proportion to that of the capitulum varying , from barely equalling it , to six or seven times as long .
i have noticed a specimen including mature ova , with a capitulum under half an inch long .
[ 26 ] mr. w. thompson found that 15 specimens , out of about 200 , attached to a vessel which came from new orleans into belfast , had their <unk> barbed .
filamentary appendages ;  never more than two on each side , with sometimes only one developed ; of variable length ; one seated on the flank of the prosoma , under the first cirrus ; the second close under the basal articulation of this cirrus , on the posterior face of a slight swelling : these appendages correspond with g and h in fig .

edges of the orifice bright <name> orange ; basal edges of the scuta , and sometimes of all the valves , with a torn border of orange membrane .
interspaces between the valves dull <unk> .
peduncle <unk> <unk> , with the lower part sometimes pale ; chitine membrane itself tinted orange ; in young specimens , peduncle pale , the colour first appearing in the uppermost part , close under the capitulum ; this upper part is often darker than the other parts , and never orange-coloured , as in l .
<unk> and l .
anserifera .
sack internally dark purplish <unk> , sometimes with a tinge of orange , darkest under the growing edges of the valves ; body of animal pale purplish <unk> .
the four posterior cirri blackish purple ; the second , and often the third cirrus , appear as if the colour had been laterally abraded off ; these latter cirri have sometimes a tinge of orange .
in very young specimens , the cirri are only barred with purple .
the ova and the contents of the ovarian tubes are of a beautiful azure blue , becoming yellow in spirits .
in museums a vast amount of difference is seen in the colours of this species , caused by the method of preparation : if dried without having been in spirits , and subsequently kept dry , the orange tint round the orifice is preserved ; if kept long in spirits , this is quite lost ; but sometimes in specimens in spirits the colour of the membrane of peduncle is preserved and rendered <unk> .
the colours of the sack and animal are either quite discharged or rendered extremely dark .
the valves themselves also often become more opaque .
in some specimens well preserved in spirits , the sack and cirri were <unk> or <unk> , tinted with dirty green , or orange , or bright yellow , or brick-red .
general remarks.  from the foregoing description it <name> be seen how extremely variable almost every part of this species is .
i find , in the british museum , ten distinct specific names given by dr. leach to different varieties , or rather to different specimens , for some of them are undistinguishable .
a specimen from the sandwich islands , sent by mr. <name> to mr. cuming , is marked a .
<unk> .
in looking over a large collection of specimens in a museum , the most distinctive characters appear at first to be the colours , the <unk> or barbed condition of the <name> , the row of square marks on the scuta and terga , and the more or less produced form of the whole capitulum : all these characters are absolutely worthless as distinctive characters , and blend into each other .
in a fresh condition , the colours of this species , and of l .
anserifera and l .
<unk> are surprisingly alike , though in l .
anatifera alone , the uppermost part of the peduncle is dark .
as far as i have seen , the smoothness of the valves , together with the presence of a tooth beneath the umbo , on the right-hand scutum , and its entire absence on the left side , ( in other species it is smaller on this , than on the right-hand side , ) is an unfailing <unk> <name> .
i believe this species is always attached to floating objects , though there are some very young specimens in the british museum , collected by sir g. grey , adhering to sandstone , but this may have been buoyed up by some large sea-weed .
mr. peach has given me the particulars of two instances , in which , after gales of wind , this species , of nearly full size , adhering to apparently freshly <unk> <unk> , has been cast upon the coast of england and scotland .

general appearance.  capitulum laterally flat ; length varies in proportion to the breadth ; valves white , somewhat translucent , moderately thick , very smooth , but with faint traces of radiating lines ; in some varieties , surface rather irregular along the zones of growth .
scuta without any internal teeth , and with scarcely any trace of the internal basal rim ; upper <name> little acuminated ; the occludent margins of the two scuta stand rather separate from each other , showing a wide space of corium between them : these margins are arched and protuberant , but with the lower part a little hollowed out ; basal margin a little curved .
in one specimen alone , i saw a trace of a diagonal line of square coloured marks , like those common in l .
anatifera .
terga rather broad , with the basal <name> not much acuminated .
the degree of prominence and outline of the double occludent margin varies very much .
<name> , separated by a rather wide space from the scuta and terga ; of very varying shape , the upper part not much acuminated , generally very flat , sometimes exteriorly marked by a central depressed line ; never barbed ; occasionally , ( in a specimen from australia , ) middle part so wide as almost to become <unk> ; on the other hand occasionally of nearly the same width throughout ; somewhat constricted above the fork .
fork deeply embedded as usual ; situated , in fresh specimens , a little way beneath the basal margins of the scuta , instead of touching them , as in the other species ; forks of varying width , not so abruptly inflected as in many species ; sometimes much narrower than the upper widest part of the valve , sometimes nearly twice as wide ; prongs of fork not very sharp , diverging at about a right <name> , with the rim between them reflexed .
the apex of the <name> extends up between the terga for barely half their length , instead of up fully three fourths of their length , as in l .
anatifera .
the chitine membrane at the base of the capitulum , especially at the anterior and posterior ends , is covered with beautiful , little , embedded , yellowish beads , about <unk> of an inch in diameter ; above this , on each side of the <name> , there is a space with similar but smaller little spheres , and still higher up still <unk> ones ; others occur on different parts of the capitulum ; these spaces are seen to be distinctly separated from each other , and present a beautiful appearance under a high power .
peduncle , as long as , or rather longer than , the capitulum : in one set of specimens , however , it was thrice or four times as long as the capitulum .
the peduncle , in some specimens , was conspicuously covered with transverse plates of yellowish hard chitine .
filamentary appendages.  three on each side ; one on the flank of the prosoma , with a pair beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; relative lengths various , but the posterior filament of the pair under the cirrus , is the shortest .
mouth ; palpi not much acuminated ; maxillæ step-formed , but with the upper or first step in some specimens indistinct , or forming a curve .
cirri ; the segments of the first cirrus and of the posterior arm of the second cirrus are highly protuberant , the protuberances sometimes equalling half the thickness of the segments themselves .
caudal appendages smooth , rounded .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , in the collection of mr. cuming , had a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and <unk> wide ; therefore not quite equalling in size the largest specimens of l .
anatifera .
<unk>  when fresh , valves <unk> from the underlying corium , edges of all the valves and round the orifice , and round the top of the peduncle , bright <unk> , passing into the finest <name> , and varying slightly in tint in different specimens .
space between the <name> and the other valves , and between the occludent margins of the scuta , <name> <unk> ; peduncle either pale or <unk> , or only clouded on the sides with the same .
in young specimens , peduncle nearly colourless ; and in those under a quarter of an inch long in the capitulum , the top of the peduncle has not acquired its orange tint .
sack pale , <unk> , body the same , but paler and more reddish ; cirri ( but only the tips of first pair ) tinted with fine golden orange .
immature ova in peduncle beautiful blue .
after being long kept in spirits , the colours are changed , weakened , or discharged , as in l .
anatifera and l .
anserifera , and the valves become opaque .
in some <unk> specimens the corium everywhere had become pale brown ; more usually it assumes a dirty purplish <unk> .
monstrous <unk>  amongst a set of ordinary specimens from a ship from genoa , sent me by mr. stutchbury , there were three , one full-grown and two very young , with the whole capitulum , ( and likewise with the scuta and terga taken separately , ) not above half the usual length in proportion to the breadth .
neither the colours nor animal in this variety presented any difference .
general remarks.  this species is almost universally confounded with l .
anatifera .
quoy and gaimard , however , appear to have distinguished it , under the name of a .
tricolor , from its colours .
leach named it accidentally , for he specifies not one distinctive character , and besides his two published names , he has appended two other names to specimens in the british museum .
a specimen , from the sandwich islands , sent by mr. <name> to mr. cuming , is marked a .
<unk> .
in a dry state , from the shrinking of the membranes , and consequent approach of the <name> to the other valves , and of the fork to the basal margin of the scuta , it is most difficult to distinguish this species , though so decidedly distinct , from l .
anatifera ; the absence , however , of a tooth on the under side of the right-hand scutum is at once characteristic .
even in specimens kept in spirits , in which there has been no shrinking , but in which the colours have changed , and taking into account the variation in the <name> and upper part of the terga , this species is not always readily distinguished from l .
anatifera , without opening the valves and looking for the right-hand tooth of the latter .
in fresh specimens , the orange ring at the top of the peduncle , and the broad purplish interspace between the <name> and other valves , are characteristic .
in all states , the filamentary appendages offer a good character .

[ 27 ] professor macgillivray does not consider the species , which he has described under l .
<unk> , and which i can not doubt is the same with the present species , as the l .
anserifera of linnæus ; but i find it so named in all old collections , and it seems to agree very well with linnæus 's description .
there has been much groundless confusion about this species ; i have no hesitation in giving a .
<unk> , of <unk> , as a <unk> , though i have received from <name> the lepas <unk> of this volume , named as the a .
<unk> ; and on the other hand , <unk> has <unk> called a common variety of l .

general appearance.  capitulum more or less elongated relatively to its breadth ; in two specimens , with scuta of equal width , one was longer than the other by the whole of the occludent margin of the terga .
valves white , thick , ( in young specimens sometimes <unk> and thin , ) closely approximate to each other ; surfaces furrowed to a very variable amount .
terga generally more plainly furrowed than the scuta , of which the basal portion is generally less furrowed than the upper part ; ridges , often rough , generally much narrower than the furrows : in half-grown specimens ( <unk> , <unk> of leach , ) the ridges are frequently <unk> , and there is even sometimes a row of bead-like teeth along the basal margins of the scuta .
the ridges vary much , sometimes alternately wide and narrow ; in two specimens of equal size , there were , in one , thirty-two ridges , and in the other only eighteen , on the scutum .
scuta , with the occludent margin rounded and protuberant to a variable degree , but always leaving a rather wide space between the margin , and the ridge which runs from the umbo to the apex ; apex pointed .
right-hand internal tooth considerably larger than that on the left , which is often reduced to a mere ridge ; internal basal rim thick , sometimes furrowed along its upper edge , but of variable thickness , sometimes not extending as far as the <unk> <name> .
terga , sometimes equalling , sometimes only two-thirds of , the length of the scuta ; in young specimens , the two occludent margins form a <unk> with each other ; in older specimens they form less than a <unk> , and hence the portion of valve thus bounded is unusually protuberant .
<name> , within deeply concave ; exterior sides finely furrowed longitudinally , generally <unk> ; valve only slightly narrowed in above the fork , of which the prongs diverge at an <name> of <unk> , or rather more , and are wider than the widest upper part of the valve ; rim between the prongs reflexed ; the heel or external <name> , just above the fork , sometimes considerably prominent .
i have seen only a single large specimen with its <name> barbed .
in half-grown specimens , ( var .
<unk> , leach , ) the <name> is often strongly barbed , with the upper point much acuminated , the fork about twice as wide as the widest upper part , and the prongs diverging at rather more than a <unk> .
in some specimens , especially very young ones , there are at the base of the <name> , above the fork , some strong , <unk> , <unk> , calcareous teeth ; such occur also in some specimens along the basal margins of the scuta , two of these hooked teeth under the umbones of the scuta being larger than the rest : specimens conspicuously thus characterised came from the navigator islands ; in these , i may add , the acutely triangular primordial valves were quite plain .
peduncle , generally about as long as the capitulum ; in young specimens generally short .
filamentary appendages , generally five , sometimes six , on each side ; one is seated on the side of the prosoma , and the four others placed in pairs beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; the lowest posterior filament of the four generally is the largest .
in young specimens , having a capitulum only half an inch long , the upper pair of the four often is not developed , or is represented by mere knobs .
the mouth presents no distinctive characters .
cirri , with the longer ramus of the first pair almost equal to the shorter arms of the second pair ; <unk> surfaces only slightly protuberant .
caudal appendages smooth , curved , pointed .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , had a capitulum one inch and a half in length .
<unk>  the white valves are edged with bright orange membrane ; and are so close to each other that no interspaces , coloured from the underlying corium , are left .
peduncle , dark <unk> , with the uppermost part under the capitulum bright orange all round ; the chitine membrane itself being thus coloured .
sack , internally , dark purplish <unk> .
body and cirri , either nearly white or pale <unk> colour , with the arms of the second , third , and fourth cirri , and pedicels of the fifth and sixth , more or less tinted with orange .
a specimen preserved during fourteen months in good spirits had only a tinge of orange left round the orifice and round the upper part of peduncle , and on the cirri .
in some other specimens , badly preserved , the chitine membrane was quite colourless , and sack and cirri dirty <unk> .
fresh ova , <unk> ; immature ova , in ovarian tubes , pale pink .
monstrous <unk>  in mr. stutchbury 's collection , there was a specimen , with the scuta , broad , smooth , thin , and fragile , without any ridge running from the umbo to the apex , and with the occludent margin reflexed .
this seemed caused by the shell having been attacked by some boring animal , and from having supported <unk> .
in the same specimen the first cirrus on one side was <unk> thick and curled ; the second cirrus had its posterior ramus in a rudimentary condition .
in mr. cuming 's collection , there are small specimens with the zones of growth overlapping each other , with thick irregular margins , and with the <name> distorted .
this species has cost me much trouble : i have examined vast <name> of specimens , from a tenth to half an inch in length , attached to light floating objects , such as <unk> and <unk> from the tropical oceans , which all resembled each other , and slightly differed from the common appearance of l .
anserifera : this variety is the <unk> <unk> of leach ; and for a long time i considered it as a distinct species .
it differs from l .
anserifera , in the less thickness of the valves , in their being more finely and yet plainly furrowed ; in the greater width of the scuta ; and more especially , of that part of the valve lying between the occludent margin , and the ridge running from the umbo to the apex ; in the less elongation of the area in the terga , bounded by the two occludent margins ; and , lastly , in the less size of the whole individual .
the trophi and cirri are absolutely identical .
lately , however , in carefully going over a great suite of specimens , all the above few distinctive characters broke down and insensibly graduated away ; and i am convinced that this form is only a variety of l .
anserifera ; its different aspect being caused partly by youth , but chiefly , i suspect , from being attached to light objects floating close to the surface of the sea .
the lepas anserifera can be distinguished by the slight furrows on its valves from all the other species , excepting l .
<unk> : this latter species can be readily known , by the close proximity in the scuta of the occludent margin , and the ridge extending from the umbo to the apex ; by its <name> being very narrow above the fork ; by the prongs of the fork diverging at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ; by the thinness of its valves ; by the coarseness of the furrows on them ; and lastly , by there being at most in l .
<unk> only one filamentary appendage beneath the first cirrus .

general appearance.  the capitulum varies considerably in length compared to its breadth , caused chiefly by the greater or less production of the occludent portion of the terga ; valves thin , brittle ; the furrowed surface varies much in character , narrow and broad ridges often alternating ; frequently each ridge ( but more especially the ridge running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum , and sometimes that alone , ) is covered with prominent , curled , flat , calcareous spines , giving the shell an appearance like that of many mollusca .
other specimens show no trace of these calcified projections .
from the thinness of the valves and the depth of the furrows , the margins of the valves are sinuous .
scuta :  the ridge running from the umbo to the apex is unusually prominent and curved ; it runs very close to the occludent margin , so that , differently from in all the other species , only a very narrow space is left between this margin and the ridge .
internal teeth , under the umbones , either sharp and prominent , or mere knobs ; sometimes that on the right side is much larger than that on the left ; sometimes they are nearly equal ; sometimes that on the left is scarcely distinguishable .
internal basal rim absent , or barely developed .
terga :  these valves have a conspicuous notch to receive the apex of the scuta ; the two occludent margins either meet each other at a <unk> , or at a much smaller <name> , causing the portion thus bounded to vary much in outline , area , and degree of prominence .
this at first led me to think that the p .
<unk> of leach , in which the point is very sharp and prominent , was a distinct species ; but there are so many intermediate forms , that the idea must be given up .
i may remark , that in all the species of lepas , the upper part of the tergum seems particularly variable .
the degree of <unk> of the basal portion of the tergum also varies ; the internal surface sometimes has small crests radiating from the umbo .
<name> , broad , within deeply concave ; edges sinuous , externally sometimes strongly barbed ; narrow above the fork , which latter is wider than the widest upper part of the valve ; prongs sharp , thin , diverging at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ; the rim connecting the prongs not , or only slightly , reflexed .
peduncle , narrow , shorter than the capitulum .
filamentary appendages , none , or only one , short , obtuse projection on each side , on the posterior face of the swelling under the first cirrus .
mouth.  mandibles , with the inferior point produced into a single pectinated tooth , rarely into two pectinated teeth ; on one side of one specimen , there were only four instead of five teeth .
palpi very narrow .
maxillæ highly variable ; they may be described as formed of five steps , of which the two lower ones are generally united into a single one , divided by a mere trace of a notch ; or with the three lower steps blended into an irregular , projecting surface , and with even the fourth step indistinct .
i have seen these two extreme forms on opposite sides of the mouth of the same individual ,  on one side the maxillæ being regularly <unk> , on the other the whole inferior part forming an almost straight edge , standing high up above the first notch or step which bears the two upper great spines .
cirri.  first pair rather far removed from the second pair , with the longer ramus about three-fourths of the length of shorter ramus of second cirrus ; <unk> surfaces , hardly at all protuberant ; lateral marginal spines on the posterior cirri rather long ; caudal appendages smooth , rounded , extremely minute : penis very spinose .
size.  capitulum in the largest specimen , <unk> of an inch long ; only a few arrive at this size .
colours , after having been kept in spirits ,  sack and cirri , especially first cirrus , clouded with pale purple ; peduncle brownish ; valves appear <unk> in specimens not long preserved , but in specimens kept longer they become perfectly and delicately white .
general remarks.  under the head of l .
anserifera , i have made some remarks on the <unk> characters of this species .
in the thinness of the valves ,  form of the <name> , with the rim connecting the prongs being not , or scarcely , reflexed ,  and in the shortness and narrowness of the peduncle , there is some approach to l .
australis , and thence to l .
fascicularis .
in the form of the maxillæ ,  in one specimen having the mandible on one side bearing only four teeth ,  and in the frequent absence of filamentary appendages , there is some approach to the genus pæcilasma ; but there is no such approach in the characters derived from the capitulum .
we have seen that , as in so many other species of this genus , most of the parts are variable , and this is the case to a most unusual extent in the form of the maxillæ .
dr. leach has attached eight specific names to the specimens preserved in the british museum .

general appearance.  capitulum rather obtuse and thick ; valves thin , brittle , approximate , either white and transparent , or <unk> and opaque ; or sometimes tinted internally with purple ( perhaps the effects of being preserved in spirits ) ; surface plainly marked by lines of growth , rarely marked with traces of lines radiating from the umbones .
scuta with teeth on both sides , nearly equal ; internal basal rim rather wide , sometimes furrowed ; basal margin considerably curved inwards .
terga rather wide ; basal <name> blunt ; <name> formed by the two occludent margins blunt and rounded .
<name> ( fig .
5 a ) with the apex blunt , flat ; the middle part generally very broad ; much constricted above the fork , where it is internally deeply concave , and externally <unk> ; fork twice as broad as the broadest upper part of the valve ; with the prongs flat , broad , thin , pointed , diverging at about an <name> of <unk> , with the intermediate rim not at all reflexed ; the fork generally not deeply imbedded in the chitine membrane of the peduncle , so as to be quite easily visible externally ; sometimes there is an internal , transverse , depressed line on the fork .
in young specimens , with the capitulum about a quarter of an inch long , the fork of the <name> is not developed , the lower slightly inflected portion consisting simply of an oval plate , twice as wide as the upper part .
until i had carefully examined a perfect series , showing the gradual changes in this part , i did not doubt that the young specimens formed a distinct species , and named it accordingly : the shortness of the penis first made me perceive that the specimens were immature .
at this early age , i may add , the filamentary appendages were not developed .
peduncle either quite short , or as long as the capitulum , close under which it is considerably constricted all round .
filamentary appendages.  two on each side ; one long , tapering , placed on the prosoma ( in one specimen represented by a mere knob ) , and the second shorter , situated on the posterior margin of the swelling beneath the first cirrus .
mouth.  maxillæ , with three large spines at the upper <name> , and with the first step distinct , but narrow ; mandibles with five teeth ; in young specimens the inferior point ends in a single spine ; sides of the <unk> cavity very hairy ; the membrane , forming the inner fold of the labrum , yellow and thickened in the form of a spoon .
cirri.  in the posterior cirri there are , at the upper lateral edges of the segments on both sides , small spines ; the segments in the first cirrus , and in the broad anterior ramus of the second cirrus , are <unk> and considerably protuberant .
caudal appendages smooth .
size.  the largest specimen had a capitulum one inch long .
the colours ( after having been long in spirit ) of the valves have already been given ; sack and peduncle dirty yellowish-brown , with the parts corresponding to the margins of the valves much darker brown , or almost black ; segments of the cirri clouded with dark brown ; body and pedicels of the cirri dirty yellowish .
i have reason to believe that the colours are totally different in living specimens .
monstrous <unk>  most of the specimens from lat .
<unk> s. , on the coast of patagonia , were more or less deformed , with the successive zones of growth overlapping each other , and forming coarse concentric ridges .
the <name> in several specimens was laterally distorted .
i have already remarked that this species has some affinity to l .
<unk> ; but it is much more closely related to l .
fascicularis , the affinity being clearly shown by the thinness and <unk> of the valves , their <unk> , by the width and little <unk> of the upper part of the <name> , by the width of the fork , and by its not being deeply imbedded .
in young specimens , moreover , before the fork is fully developed , there is a remarkable similarity between the two species , in the form of this lower part of the <name> .
again , the narrowness and inflection of the peduncle under the capitulum in l .
australis , and lastly , the lateral marginal spines on both sides of the segments of the posterior cirri , all clearly indicate this same affinity to l .
fascicularis .
i believe this species is confined to the southern ocean ; and perhaps there represents l .
fascicularis of the northern and tropical seas .
it must , judging from the number of specimens brought home by captain sir j. <name> , and from those previously in the british museum , and from those collected by myself , be a very common species .

general appearance.  capitulum highly variable in all its characters ; thick and broad in proportion to its length , but the breadth is variable ,  in some specimens , the capitulum being longer by one-fifth of its total length than broad ; in others , one-fifth broader than long .
valves generally approximate ; in some varieties , however , from the narrowness of the <name> and terga , the valves stand far apart , there being an interval between the <name> and scuta of nearly half the breadth of the latter .
valves excessively thin , brittle , transparent , colourless , smooth , but generally sinuous along the zones of growth , which are conspicuous : valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane , which is thickly clothed , especially in the interspaces between the valves , with minute spines , barely visible to the naked eye .
scuta with the lower part of the <unk> margin extremely protuberant ; occludent margin , more or less , but slightly reflexed , with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex ; basal margin much reflexed , but to a variable extent and at a varying <name> , even up to a right <name> ,  an external rim or collar being thus formed .
there are no distinct internal teeth , but the basal margin under the umbones , is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection , which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed as the rest of the basal margin : there is no distinct internal basal rim .
the primordial valves are generally visible , but they do not lie , as in all other species , close to the basal margin , but a little above it ,  the lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed .
terga flat , with the occludent margin slightly arched , and not , as in the foregoing species , formed of two sides ; apex bent towards the <name> ; width of the lower half highly variable , owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out ; in some specimens , the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout ; in other specimens this lower part is <unk> .
the widest part of the tergum either equals in width , or is only two-thirds of the width of the widest part of the <name> beneath its umbo .
<name> ( pl .
i , fig .
6 a ) highly variable in shape , with the part above the umbo either <unk> and slightly concave within , or nearly flat and furnished with a central external ridge ; or the upper part ( fig .
6 c ) is of equal and extreme narrowness throughout , and deeply concave within , appearing as if only the central ridge had been developed .
the part below the umbo , ( answering to the fork in the foregoing species , ) is about one-third of the length of the whole valve , and generally twice as wide as the upper part , but in the variety with the upper part of the <name> equally narrow throughout , the lower part is thrice as wide as the upper ; the disc , or lower part , is generally slightly concave within , exteriorly either with or without a central ridge ; basal margin rounded ; lateral margin more or less curved , according to the form of the upper part .
the disc is not more deeply imbedded in membrane than is the upper part of the valve .
the heel or umbo is either angular and prominent , or rounded .
in very young specimens the <name> is simply bowed , instead of being rectangularly bent .
peduncle ,  short , narrow , being abruptly inflected all round under the basal edges of the capitulum ; lower part of very variable shape , being often suddenly contracted into a mere thread ( fig .
6 b ) , which sometimes widens again at the extreme end .
the external membrane is very thin , and is penetrated by the usual fine tubuli leading to the corium ; its surface is wrinkled and destitute of spines , or with extremely few .
the peduncle is often completely surrounded by a yellowish ball , ( of which i have seen specimens from the coast of england , and from off borneo , ) sometimes half as wide as the capitulum , composed of very tender , vesicular , <unk> membrane , and of a pulpy substance : perhaps the yellow colour may be owing to long immersion in spirits .
some authors have supposed that the ball was the <unk> of the animal ; and for the first few minutes , deceived by the numerous included <unk> of , as i believe , <unk> , i thought that this was the case ; others have supposed that it consisted of some <unk> <unk> or other foreign organism ; but it is , in reality , a most singular development of the <unk> , which ordinarily serves to attach cirripedes by their bases to some extraneous object , but here surrounding that object and the peduncle , gives buoyancy , by its vesicular structure , to the whole .
the membrane of the ball falls to pieces in caustic potash , differently from the chitine membrane of the enclosed peduncle , and this shows that there is some difference in composition from ordinary cement .
the ball , when cut in two , exhibits an obscure concentric structure .
the whole is excreted by the two cement-ducts , through two rows of orifices , one on each side of the surrounded portion of the peduncle ; and i actually traced , in one case , the yellow pulpy substance coming out of the cement-ducts .
the upper apertures are in gradation larger than those below them , and they stand a little further apart from each other ; these are figured as seen from the outside , much magnified , at pl .
i , fig .
6 d .
i did not succeed in finding the <unk> , but i followed the ducts , of rather large size , running for a considerable distance as usual along and within the longitudinal muscles of the peduncle .
nearly opposite the uppermost aperture , on each side , the <unk> passes out through the corium , and becomes laterally attached to the outer membrane of the peduncle , at which point an aperture is formed ( as in other cases , by some unknown process ) , thus giving exit to the contents of the <unk> .
beneath this upper aperture the <unk> runs down the peduncle , between the corium and the outer membrane , till it comes to the next aperture , to which it is also attached , and so on to all the lower ones ; but i believe no cement tissue continues to pass out through these lower apertures .
beneath the lowest aperture the two ducts run into the two prehensile antennæ of the larva , which , as usual , terminate the peduncle .
the antennæ are attached to some small foreign body in the centre of the vesicular ball , by the usual tough , light brown , transparent cement .
the two upper apertures are nearly on a level with the outside surface of the ball ; and it was evident that as the animal grows , new apertures are formed higher and higher up on the sides of the peduncle , and that out of these , fresh vesicular membrane proceeds , and grows over the old ball in a continuous layer .
it appears that the growth of the vesicular ball is not regular ,  that it is not always formed ,  and that when formed the whole , or the lower part , sometimes <unk> and is washed away .
as that portion of the peduncle which is enclosed ceases to grow , and has its muscles absorbed , retaining only the underlying corium , whereas the upper <unk> portion , and likewise , ( as it appears ) lower portions once enclosed but since denuded , continue to increase in diameter , the peduncle , when the vesicular ball is removed , often has the most irregular outline , contracting suddenly into a mere thread , and then occasionally expanding again at the basal point .
frequently two or three specimens have their peduncles imbedded in one common ball , of which there is a fine specimen in the college of surgeons ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , the ball being about one inch and a quarter in diameter , with a slice cut off .
in this specimen , it is seen that the vesicular membrane proceeding from several individuals , unites to form one more or less symmetrical whole , and that the original common object of attachment is entirely hidden .
dr. <unk> [ 29 ] gives a curious account of the infinite number of specimens , through which he sailed during several days , in the southern atlantic ocean : the balls appeared like bird 's eggs , and were mistaken for some <unk> , which was supposed to have encrusted the scales of the <unk> , to which the cirripede had originally become attached .
several individuals had their peduncles imbedded in the same ball , " which floated like a cork on the water . "
as this species grows into an unusually bulky animal , we here see a beautiful and unique contrivance , in the cement forming a vesicular membranous mass , serving as a buoy to float the individuals , which , when young and light , were supported on the small objects to which they originally had been cemented in the usual manner .

filamentary appendages.  five on each side , of which four lie in pairs at the base of the first cirrus ( of these , only three are sometimes developed ) , and one on the flank of the prosoma .
mouth.  palpi much acuminated .
mandibles with five teeth ; the first not far remote from the second ; inferior point rather broad and finely pectinated .
maxillæ with two large , unequal , upper spines , and four regular steps .
cirri.  posterior cirri , with the upper parts of the segments slightly protuberant ; in young specimens , the spines can be seen to consist of five pairs , placed in two converging lines in the upper half of each segment , with numerous minute , <unk> , and intermediate little bristles : in large specimens , all these latter have so increased in number , that the normal five pair can not be distinguished , and the front of each segment is covered by a triangular thick brush of bristles , all pointing in the same direction , thus giving a very unusual character to the posterior cirri : the dorsal tuft on each segment consists of six or seven large spines , with from one to three dozen fine ones .
first cirrus and anterior ramus of second cirrus with broad brushes of bristles .
the pedicels of all the cirri are thickly covered with bristles .
caudal appendages smooth , with rounded summits .
penis very hairy : vesiculæ seminales purple , much convoluted , lying within the prosoma ; testes <unk> , scarcely enlarged at their terminal points , purplish ; ovigerous fræna large with sinuous margins , the glandular beads being arranged in groups .
size.  the largest specimen ( from the coast of devonshire ) had a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and <unk> broad , and of unusual thickness .
colours , after having been in spirits : front surfaces of the segments of the cirri and of the pedicels purple .
in some specimens from off borneo , parts of the sack and the interspaces between the two scuta , were of a fine purple .
montagu states , that the whole shell and body of animal , when fresh , are pale blue , with the cirri spotted with brown .
general remarks.  the extreme variability of this species is remarkable .
in the college of surgeons , there is a group of specimens collected by mr. <name> , i believe , in the atlantic , in which the extreme narrowness of the <name> and of the terga ( pl .
i , fig .
6 , b , c ) ( with consequent wide spaces of membrane left between these valves ) , led me , at first , to entertain no doubt , that it was quite a distinct species , which was strengthened by finding that the whole surface of the cirri were <unk> , with very minute spines ; hence i called this variety , <unk> .
on the closest examination , however , i could detect no other differences , and the narrowness of the <name> and terga varied very considerably : moreover , in one of the specimens , which was about intermediate in the form of its valves between this variety and the common form , the surfaces of the cirri were not in the least degree <unk> .
again , in some other specimens , the terga were as narrow as in mr. <name> 's , whilst the <name> had its usual outline .
in a var .
( called by leach , p .
<unk> , ) from the atlantic , under the equator , the <name> is remarkable from the extreme flatness of the upper part , and from the presence of an exterior , narrow , central ridge .
in one specimen from jersey , in the british museum , the <name> made an extremely near approach to this same form .
affinities.  this species is certainly much the most distinct of any in the genus , and mr. gray has proposed to separate it under the name of <unk> ; but considering the close similarity of the whole organisation of the internal parts , together with the transitional characters afforded by l .
australis , i think the grounds for this separation are not quite sufficient .
i have remarked , under l .
australis , on the affinity between that and the present species .
in the <name> terminating in a disc ( though here not imbedded ) , there is some slight affinity to pæcilasma eburnea and crassa , and <unk> so in the arrangement of the bristles on the posterior cirri .
in the valves being covered with <unk> membrane , and to a certain extent in the form of the <name> and of the occludent margin of the terga , and especially in the two rows of <unk> in the peduncle , there is some affinity to scalpellum .

i have not been able to adopt mr. <unk> ' name for this genus , as it would be too <unk> incorrect to call a <unk> species , a <unk> .
<unk> , 3 , 5 , aut 7 , <unk> : <name> <unk> ad <unk> apices <unk> <unk> , <unk> basali aut <unk> aut in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : scuta <unk> <unk> , <unk> ad <unk> <unk> <unk> valves , 3 , 5 , or 7 , approximate : <name> extending only to the basal points of the terga ; with its lower end either truncated or produced into a deeply imbedded disc .
scuta nearly oval , with their umbones at the rostral <name> .
mandibles with four teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part of edge prominent ; anterior ramus of the second cirrus not thicker than the posterior ramus ; caudal appendages <unk> , spinose .
generally attached to crustacea .
i have already given my reasons for <unk> and separating this genus from lepas ; as far as the capitulum is concerned , the differences between these genera certainly appear trivial ; they consist in the <name> not extending up between the terga , and in the lower end being either truncated , or produced into an imbedded disc : the terga have a single occludent margin .
the included animal 's body differs in more important respects ; for both mandibles and maxillæ are very distinct ; the cirri of some of the species also differ ; and the caudal appendages are here always spinose : there are no filamentary appendages : and lastly , the habits are different .
the genus may be divided into two sections , firstly , p .
<unk> and p .
<unk> , which have their carinæ <unk> truncated , the basal angles of their terga cut off , and the anterior rami of their second cirri shorter than the posterior rami ; and , secondly , p .
crassa , p .
fissa , and p .
eburnea , which in these several respects are otherwise characterised .
the p .
eburnea , however , differs rather more from p .
crassa and p .
fissa , than these two do from each other ; but certainly not enough to allow of the retention of mr. <unk> ' genus of <unk> .
p .
crassa , in an especial degree , connects together all the forms .
general appearance.  capitulum oval , more or less produced , flat or <unk> ; formed of three , five , or seven approximate valves ; the lesser number arising from the abortion of the terga , and the greater number from the scuta being divided into two segments .
valves moderately thick , either white or reddish , smooth or <unk> , and sometimes partly covered by membrane , bearing minute spines .
scuta oval , of varying proportions ; the basal margin is generally narrow , and blends into the <unk> margin ; the internal basal rim generally is well developed , sometimes with , and sometimes without internal teeth beneath the umbones .
in p .
eburnea , and sometimes in p .
crassa , there is a line of apparent fissure , and in p .
fissa of actual disseverment , running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum , nearly in the line in which a ridge extends in lepas : the primordial valves of the scuta in these three species , are seated at the basal angles of the lateral and larger segments .
the positions of the primordial valves , and the direction of growth in the calcified valves , are , in all the species , the same as in lepas .
in several of the species attached to crustacea , the two scuta are unequally convex , which is caused , as was pointed out to me by mr. gray , by that valve which lies close and nearly parallel to the body of the crab , being least developed .
the terga are either quite absent , or rudimentary as in p .
crassa , or pretty well developed as in the other species : the occludent margin is single , and not double as generally in lepas ; the basal <name> is either pointed or truncated .
the <name> varies considerably in shape , but never extends up between the terga , nor ends downwards in a fork ; in the first two species it is truncated ; in the others , it terminates in a <unk> oblong disc , which in p .
eburnea seems almost entirely ( but of course not quite ) to separate the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle ; a similar separation is effected in p .
fissa , where the imbedded disc is small , by two large teeth on the internal basal rims of the two scuta .
the <name> is always narrow , and either solid internally or very slightly concave .
peduncle , is very short and narrow ; the membrane is generally ringed with thicker , <unk> portions , and often bears very minute spines .
size.  all the species are small , with a capitulum not exceeding half an inch in length .
filamentary appendages.  none .
mouth.  labrum generally considerably bullate in the upper part , with a row of teeth on the crest .
the mandibles have four teeth , with the inferior point narrow and <unk> , or rudimentary and absent .
the maxillæ have , under the two or three upper great spines , a deep notch itself bearing spines ; beneath this , the lower part is straight and considerably prominent , pl .
x , fig .
15 .
outer maxillæ are covered on their inner sides continuously with spines .
cirri.  the first pair is sometimes seated very distant from the second .
the arrangement of the spines on the posterior cirri varies , to an unusual degree within the limits of the same genus .
we have either the ordinary structure of anterior pairs , with single fine intermediate spines ( as in p .
<unk> and <unk> ) , or we have the pairs increased by one or two additional longitudinal lateral rows , as in p .
eburnea ; or we have the front spines forming a single transverse row , as in p .
crassa and p .
fissa , pl .
x , fig .
29 , a .
the segments in none of the species are protuberant ; the anterior ramus of the second cirrus does not seem to be thicker than the posterior ramus , as is usually the case .
the rami of the second , and of most of the other cirri , are unequal in length ,  the anterior ramus , contrary to the ordinary rule , being longer in p .
eburnea , p .
fissa , and p .
crassa , than the posterior ramus by several segments ; i have hitherto observed this inequality only in the sessile genus chthamalus .
the caudal appendages are small , <unk> , and always furnished with bristles .
<unk>  four out of the five species live attached to crustacea in the european and eastern warmer temperate and tropical oceans ; the fifth species was found attached to the dead spines of an <unk> , off new guinea .
it is probable that several more species <name> be hereafter discovered .

general appearance.  capitulum rather compressed , narrow , and produced .
valves white , tinged with orange , smooth , moderately thin , occasionally with faint traces of striæ radiating from the umbones .
scuta , apex pointed , with a very slight ridge running to the umbo ; basal margin equalling two thirds of the length of the terga , with an internal basal rim ; on the under side of each valve , beneath the umbo , there is a strong tooth .
out of the numerous specimens , all excepting one had their scuta unequally convex , with their occludent margins unequally curved , that of the more convex valve at the umbo , curling beyond the medial line .
the basal end of the <name> is , likewise , slightly curved laterally , and always turns towards the more convex valve .
this inequality , as mr. gray pointed out to me , depends on the position of the specimens ; the flatter side lying close to the carapace of the crab .
terga , flat , oblong , nearly rectangular ; occludent margin straight ; basal <name> , truncated , almost parallel to the occludent margin ; in width , three or four times as wide as the <name> .
<name> , ( fig .
1 , a ) short , narrow , slightly curved , upper part broadest , with the apex rounded , only just passing up between the basal broad ends of the terga ; externally <unk> , internally very slightly concave ; basal end abruptly truncated , crested , not deeply imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle .
peduncle , barely as long as the capitulum , apparently ( for specimens dry and much shrunk ) narrow , surrounded by rings or folds of thicker yellowish membrane , of which the upper ones retain moderately long spines ; low down these rings become confluent ; whole surface finely dotted , dots largest on the rings .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate in the upper part , with a row of teeth on the crest ; mandibles with four teeth , the fourth close to the inferior apex , which is very little developed , sometimes making the fourth tooth appear simply bifid .
maxillæ with two large spines on the upper <name> , beneath which there is a large depression , bearing one rather long and thick , and four short and thick , spines ; inferior upraised part with a double row of longer and thinner spines .
cirri.  posterior cirri with segments bearing five pairs of spines , of which the lowest pair is very minute ; intermediate spines minute ; spines of the dorsal tuft thin , of nearly equal size ; segments not at all protuberant , elongated .
first cirrus , standing far separated from the second ( as in scalpellum ) , with its nearly equal rami rather above half as long as those of the second cirrus .
second cirrus with anterior ramus not thicker , and scarcely more thickly clothed with spines , than the posterior ramus , but shorter than it by three or four segments ; the spines not forming a very thick brush on the anterior ramus .
both rami of third cirrus with a longitudinal row of minute spines , parallel to the main pairs .
between the bases of the pedicels of the first pair of cirri , there are two closely approximate , conical flattened protuberances , like the single one to be described in ibla .
caudal appendages , about one third of the length of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , with some moderately long and strong spines at the end , and down the whole outer sides .

general appearance.  this species so closely resembles p .
<unk> , that it is superfluous to describe it in detail ; and i <name> indicate only the points of difference .
when the valves have been well preserved , they are of fine pale orange colour , and hence the name above given , which was proposed by the rev .
r. t. lowe .
scuta , with the internal <unk> teeth small ; basal internal marginal rim very prominent , furrowed within ; basal margin short , ( only equalling half the length of terga ) , owing to the great curvature of the lower part of the <unk> margin ; hence , the outline of the scuta is almost pointed oval .
i saw no appearance of inequality in the two sides .
terga , rather smaller in proportion to the scuta , than in p .
<unk> , with the basal end very obliquely truncated , so as to appear at first simply pointed , not parallel to the occludent margin ; apex considerably more pointed and produced than in the foregoing species .
<name> , almost of equal narrowness throughout , barely concave within ; lower end triangular , abruptly truncated , and not crested .
primordial valves very plain , with the usual hexagonal structure : those of the terga , rounded at both ends , instead of being square , as in the mature calcified valves .
peduncle short , narrow , not half as long as the capitulum ; paved with minute equal beads , as in the genus dichelaspis .
mouth.  mandibles with the fourth tooth very small ; inferior <name> rudimentary .
maxillæ , with three great upper spines , beneath which there is a deep notch bearing some delicate spines ; inferior upraised part , as in p .
<unk> .
cirri.  rami of first cirrus hardly more than one third as long as the rami of the second cirrus , which latter rami are unequal in length by only two segments ; the posterior ramus being the longer one .
caudal appendages , with only two or three lateral bristles , besides those on the summit .
size.  capitulum , three to four <unk> of an inch long .
general remarks.  this species has the closest general resemblance to p .
<unk> , and is evidently a representative of it .
on close examination , however , almost every part differs slightly ; the chief points being the narrowness of the basal margin of the scuta ; the <unk> of the truncated basal end of the terga and the sharpness of the upper end ; the rudimentary state of the inferior <name> of the mandibles ; the character of the spines on the maxillæ ; the proportional lengths of the cirri , and the <unk> of the spines on the outer sides of the caudal appendages .
the fact of madeira having this pæcilasma , a representative both in structure and habits of a japan species , is interesting , inasmuch , as i am informed by mr. lowe , that some of the madeira fishes are <unk> of those of japan .

[ 31 ] general appearance.  capitulum highly bullate , or thick .
valves rather thick , opaque , either pale or dark <unk> , smooth , yet rather plainly <unk> from the umbones .
there are a few very minute spines on the membranous borders of the valves .
scuta highly convex , broadly oval , apex broad rounded ; basal margin narrow , much curved ; no internal , <unk> teeth ; basal internal rim strong , running up part of the occludent margin .
a slightly prominent ridge , either rounded or angular , but in one specimen a narrow depressed <unk> line , runs parallel to the occludent margin and ends near the apex in a slight notch ; this fact is of interest in relation to the structure of the scuta in p .
eburnea and p .
fissa .
the scuta are either equally or very unequally convex ; in the latter case , the occludent margin of one valve is curled , so that its umbo is not quite medial .
[ 31 ] it is stated , in <unk> .
<unk> , ' ( 1848 , p. 44 , ) that this species was attached to a <unk> , from madeira ; i can not but suspect that there has been some confusion with the <unk> <unk> from madeira , which is thus attached .
terga , minute , almost rudimentary , scarcely broader than the <name> , and half as long as the chord of its arc ; carinal margin slightly curved ; scutal margin straight , with a slight prominence fitting into a notch in the scuta ; basal end bluntly pointed .
<name> , ( fig .
3 , a ) rather shorter than the scuta , extending up only to the basal ends of the terga ; moderately curved ; apex moderately sharp ; middle part broadest , externally <unk> ; internally not concave , with the inner lamina of shell , at the basal end , produced into a very small oblong disc or tooth , which is only as wide as the narrowest upper part of the valve .
the exterior keel does not extend on to this disc , which is slightly constricted at its origin .
peduncle very short , narrow , ringed , and apparently without spines .
size.  capitulum four <unk> of an inch long .
the following parts of the animal are described from some small and not well preserved specimens from madeira , which i owe to the kindness of mr. lowe .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate in the upper part , with large , inwardly pointed , unequal teeth .
mandibles , with four large , pointed , <unk> teeth , with the inferior <name> very narrow , acuminated like a single spine .
maxillæ , with three ( ? )
large upper spines , of which the middle one is extremely strong and long , beneath which , there is a deep notch with a single strong spine , and with the whole inferior part square and much upraised , so as to stand on a level almost with the tips of the great upper spines .
cirri in a miserable state of preservation ; first cirrus short , second cirrus with rami unequal , and i suspect the anterior one the longest ; some of the other cirri also have unequal rami .
the segments of the posterior cirri are not protuberant , they have on their anterior faces a single transverse row of bristles : in the upper segments , some of the spines in each dorsal tuft ( which is much spread out ) , are much thicker , though rather shorter than those on the anterior face .
this peculiar structure is common to all five posterior cirri .
caudal appendages.  i can only say that they are spinose on their summits .
affinities.  this species is allied to p .
eburnea in the rudimentary condition of its terga ; in the <unk> basal end of its <name> ; and in the presence in some specimens , of a <unk> line on the scuta parallel to their occludent margins .
its affinity , however , is closer to p .
fissa , as is more especially shown by the remarkable arrangement of the spines on the five posterior cirri .

spines on the segments of the posterior cirri arranged in single transverse rows .
philippine archipelago ; island of <unk> ; parasitic on a spinose crab , found under a stone at low water ; single specimen , in <unk> , cuming .
general appearance.  capitulum <unk> , broadly oval , nearly a quarter of an inch long .
valves white , smooth , moderately thick , marked by the lines of growth .
the occludent segments of the scuta , and nearly the whole of the terga , and the whole of the <name> , enveloped in <unk> membrane , tinged with orange , but the specimen had long been kept dry .
scuta formed of two , apparently always separate , segments , closely united , so that externally their separation is hardly visible , and does not allow of movement ; the fissure thus formed runs almost in the line connecting the umbo and apex , ( where in most species a ridge extends , ) but a little on the carinal side of it .
the occludent segment is narrowly <unk> , pointed at both ends , with the upper end projecting slightly beyond the apex of the lateral segment , and with the occludent margin regularly curved from end to end .
the lateral segment is large , of an oval shape , with a narrow strip cut off on one side .
primordial valves very plain at the umbones of the lateral segments , but none are visible on the occludent segments ; and this makes me believe that these two pieces are normally parts of a single valve ; having only one specimen of p .
fissa , i was not able to make out quite certainly whether the two segments are continuously united at their umbones by a <unk> portion of valve , as is certainly the case with dichelaspis .
the basal margin of the lateral segment is narrow , inflected , and blends with the <unk> margin ; it has an internal , prominent , basal rim , and towards the occludent margin a large , prominent , internal tooth .
this internal basal rim is not parallel to the outer basal margin , but rises to a point a little way up the occludent margin , in the same manner as in p .
eburnea , but in a lesser degree ; in this latter species the peduncle is internally almost cut off by the large disc of its <name> ; here , on the other hand , it is internally almost cut off by these rims and the two large teeth of the lateral segments of the scuta .
terga sub-triangular , short , nearly half as broad as long ; three or four times as wide as the <name> , and rather wider than the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin single , arched ; carinal margin slightly arched ; basal <name> bluntly pointed .
<name> very narrow , much arched , running up just between the basal ends of the terga ; exterior ridge enveloped in membrane ; heel blunt , prominent ; internally , not concave , even slightly convex , produced at the lower end into a very narrow , short , imbedded disc , ( or rather tooth , ) which is itself a little curved downwards and blunt at the end .
peduncle very narrow , about half as long as the capitulum ; yellow , finely <unk> , plainly ringed , without spines .
mouth.  labrum , with a row of minute teeth ; palpi narrow .
mandibles with all the lower part narrow ; of the four teeth , the second and third are narrow , the fourth is pectinated and placed very close to the inferior <name> , which is produced into a long thin tooth .
maxillæ unknown .
cirri.  first pair lost .
the arrangement of the spines on all is most abnormal , pl .
x , fig .
29 : dorsal tuft long , arranged in a transverse line and seated in a deep notch ; in the sixth cirrus , the spines on the lower segments are fine , those on the upper segments are thick and <unk> , mingled with some fine spines ; in the four anterior cirri the spines of the dorsal tufts are even thicker and more <unk> .
on the anterior faces , also , of all the segments the spines form a single row ; they are shorter than those composing the dorsal tuft ; hence the spines on each segment are arranged in a circle , interrupted widely on the two sides : this arrangement is common to all five posterior cirri .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus one third longer and thinner than the posterior ramus ( this is the reverse of the usual arrangement ) ; this longer ramus equals in length the sixth cirrus .
third cirrus , with the anterior ramus considerably longer than the posterior ramus ; in the three posterior pair of cirri , also , the anterior rami are a little longer than the posterior : except in length , there is little difference of any kind between the five posterior pair of cirri .
pedicels of the cirri long ; rami rather short ; segments elongated , not protuberant .
caudal appendages nearly as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , thickly clothed with very fine bristles , like a <unk> pencil brush .
affinities.  in the structure of the <name> , and more especially of the scuta , there is a strong affinity between the present and following species ; for we shall immediately see that in p .
eburnea there is evidence of the scuta being composed of two segments fused together ; and the larger segment is furnished with an internal oblique , strong , basal rim .
to this same species there is an evident affinity in the form of the mandibles and of the caudal appendages , and in the anterior rami of the cirri being longer than the posterior rami .
notwithstanding these points of affinity , i consider that p .
fissa is more closely related in its whole organisation , as more particularly shown in the arrangement of the spines on the cirri and in the presence of terga , to p .
crassa than to p .
eburnea .
although in dichelaspis , the scuta are invariably composed of two almost separate segments , yet p .
fissa shows no special affinity to this genus .

general appearance.  capitulum flat , pear-shaped , placed almost transversely to the peduncle .
valves white , smooth , moderately thick .
scuta :  the basal margin , as seen externally , is narrow , and can hardly be separated from the carinal margin ; but an internal basal rim , ( fig .
5 , b ) ( along which the imbedded disc of the <name> runs , ) shows where , in the other species , the basal and carinal margins are separated .
this basal internal rim is not parallel to the external basal margin , but runs upwards to the occludent margin , leaving beneath it a large triangular space , to which the membrane of the peduncle is attached ; and this makes it appear as if the rostral umbones of these valves had grown downwards ; but , judging from the allied species , p .
fissa , i have no doubt that the primordial valves really lie on the umbones , and that the growth has been in the usual direction , that is , exclusively upwards .
the occludent margin is curved , and blends by a regular sweep into the carinal margin , so that there is no acute upper <name> .
a distinct line can be seen , as if two calcareous valves had been united , running from the umbo to the upper end of the valve , thus in appearance separating a slip of the occludent margin ; internally this appearance is more conspicuous ; this structure is important in relation to that of p .
fissa .
the pointed umbones are divergent , and internally under each , there is a large tooth .
the two valves are equally convex .
terga , entirely absent .
the <name> ( tab .
ii , fig .
5 , a , c ) , including the disc , is three fourths as long as the scuta ; it is placed almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle ; it is narrow and internally convex ; the imbedded disc is very large , forming a continuous curve with the upper part of the <name> ; this disc runs along the internal basal rim of the scuta , and hence almost separates , internally , the peduncle from the capitulum ; it equals one fourth of the total length of the valve , and is thrice as wide as the upper part ; it is oval , externally marked by a central line , and with a slight notch at the end , giving a divided appearance to the whole , and indicating how easily a fork might be formed from it .
the <name> is thick , measured from the inner convex to the exterior surface , which is <unk> ; heel prominent .
peduncle , narrow , very short , not nearly so long as the capitulum .
mouth.  labrum considerably bullate , with the lower part much produced towards the adductor muscle ; crest with small bead-like teeth ; palpi small , pointed ; mandibles , with the first tooth standing rather distant from the second ; inferior <name> <unk> and bifid ; maxillæ ( pl .

15 ) , with two considerable spines ( only one is shown in the plate ) beneath the upper large pair ; the inferior upraised part bears seven or eight pair of spines , and its edge is not quite straight ; close to the main notch , lying under the four upper spines , there are two minute notches , with the interspace bearing a tuft of fine spines and a pair of larger ones .
cirri.  the rami in all are rather unequal in length , the anterior rami being rather the longest ; the anterior rami of the second and third cirri are not thicker than the posterior rami .
the segments in the three posterior cirri are not protuberant ; the upper segments bear three or four pair of spines , with some minute intermediate ones , and with the lateral marginal spines unusually large and long , so as to form , with the ordinary pairs , a third or fourth longitudinal row ; hence a small brush is formed on each segment .
the dorsal tuft is large and wide , so as to contain even fourteen spines , of which some are as long as those in front .
in the lower segments of these same posterior cirri , the lateral marginal spines are not so much developed ( nor is the dorsal tuft ) , and hence the segments can hardly be said to be <unk> .
the first cirrus is placed rather distant from the second pair .
the second and third cirri differ from the three posterior pair , only in the bristles being slightly more numerous , and in the dorsal tufts being more spread out .
caudal appendages about half the length of the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; truncated and rounded at their ends ; thickly clothed with long excessively fine bristles , so as to resemble <unk> pencils .
the stomach , i believe , is destitute of cæca ; in it was a small crustacean .
general remarks.  i was at first unwilling to sacrifice mr. <unk> genus , <unk> , which is so neatly characterised by its three valves ; moreover , the present species does differ , in some slight respects , from the other species of pæcilasma ; but under the head of p .
fissa i have shown how that species , p .
crassa and p .
eburnea are tied together .
the absence of terga , which are rudimentary in p .
crassa , ( and we shall hereafter see , in conchoderma , how worthless a character their entire absence is , ) and the arrangement of the spines in the upper segments of the posterior cirri , are the only characters which could be used for a generic separation .

the name <unk> was given by mr. gray under the belief that there were eight valves .
leach ( as stated in the 'annals of philosophy , ' ) had proposed , in ms. , the name <unk> , and this is now used in the british museum by mr. gray , and thus appears in agassiz 's <unk> <unk> . '
although , strictly , there are only five valves , i continued to use , in my ms. , the term <unk> , until i examined the d .
<unk> , where it was so apparent to the naked eye that there were only five valves , the scuta in this species being less deeply bifid , that i was compelled to give up a name so manifestly conveying a wrong impression , and hence adopted the one here used .
valves 5 , generally appearing like 7 , from each scutum being divided into two distinct segments , united at the rostral <name> ; <name> generally extending up between the terga terminating downwards in an imbedded disc , or fork , or cup .
mandibles , with three or four teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part of edge generally not prominent ; anterior ramus of the second cirrus not thicker than the posterior ramus , not very thickly clothed with spines ; caudal appendages <unk> , spinose .
<unk>  eastern and western warmer oceans in the northern hemisphere , attached to crustacea , <unk> , & c. <unk>  the capitulum appears to contain seven valves ; but , on examination , it is found that two of the valves on each side , are merely segments of the scutum ; these are united at the umbo , in three of the species , by a narrow , <unk> portion of valve , where the primordial valve is situated ; in d .
<unk> , however , the junction of the two segments is perfectly calcified , and of the same width as the whole of the basal segment .
the capitulum is much compressed , broad at the base , and extends a little beneath the basal segments of the scuta .
the valves are very thin , often imperfectly calcified , and generally covered with membrane .
they are not placed very close together , and in all the species a considerable interspace is left between the <name> and the two other valves : in the d .
<unk> the valves are so narrow that they form merely a calcified border round the capitulum .
the membrane between the valves and over them , is very thin , and is thickly studded , in some of the species , with minute blunt conical points , apparently representing spines .
the valves in the same species present considerable variations in shape ; in their manner or direction of growth , and in the position of their primordial valves , they agree with lepas and pæcilasma .
<unk>  in three of the species the two segments , named the occludent and basal , appear like separate valves , but these , by dissection , can be most distinctly seen to be united at the rostral <name> .
the primordial valve , formed of the usual hexagonal tissue , is elliptic , elongated , and placed in the direction of the occludent segment ; <unk> commences at its upper point , so as to form the occludent segment , and afterwards at its lower point , but rectangularly outwards , to form the basal segment ; in the minute space between these two points of the primordial valve , there is , in four of the species , no <unk> ; so that the two segments are united by what may be called a flexible hinge ; in d .
<unk> the two calcareous segments are absolutely continuous .
the occludent segment is longer than the basal segment ; it either runs close along the orifice , or in the upper part bends inwards ; both segments are narrow , except in d .
<unk> , in which the basal segment is moderately broad ; the two segments are placed at an <name> , varying from <unk> to <unk> , to each other .
the capitulum generally extends for a little space beneath the basal segments of the scuta , where it contracts to form the peduncle .
the terga present singular differences in shape , and are described under the head of each species ; scarcely any point can be <unk> of them in common , except that they are flat and thin .
the <name> is much bowed , narrow , and internally either slightly concave or convex and solid ; the upper end extends far up between the terga ; the lower end is formed by a rectangularly inflected , imbedded , triangular or oblong disc , deeply notched at the end , or as in h .
<unk> , of a fork , the base , however , of which is wider than the rest of the <name> , so as to present some traces of the <unk> structure of the other two species ; or lastly , as in d .
<unk> , it terminates in a <unk> cup .
<unk>  this is narrow , compressed , and about as long , or twice as long , as the capitulum ; in d .
<unk> it is studded with minute beads of yellowish chitine .
size.  small , with a capitulum scarcely exceeding a quarter of a inch in length .
filamentary appendages.  none .
there are two small ovigerous fræna , which , in d .
<unk> , had the glands collected in seven or eight little groups on their margins .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate , with small teeth on the crest ; palpi small , not thickly covered with spines .
mandibles narrow , with three or four teeth .
maxillæ small , with a notch beneath the two or three great upper spines ; lower part bearing only a few pair of spines , generally not projecting , but in d .
<unk> largely projecting .
outer maxillæ , with their inner edges continuously covered with bristles .
cirri.  first pair short , situated rather far from the second pair ; second pair with the anterior ramus not thicker than the posterior ramus , and hardly more thickly clothed with spines than it , excepting sometimes the few basal segments .
all the five posterior pair of cirri resemble each other more closely than is usual .
in d .
<unk> , the segments of the posterior cirri bear the unusual number of eight pair of main spines .
caudal appendages.  <unk> , spinose ; in d. <unk> they are twice as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , but i could not perceive in them any distinct articulations .
<unk>  attached to crabs at madeira , and off borneo ; to <unk> in the indian ocean .
the individuals of all the species appear to be rare .
general remarks.  four of the five species , forming this genus , though certainly distinct , are closely allied .
i have already shown , that although the characters separating lepas , pæcilasma , and dichelaspis are not very important , yet if they be neglected these three natural little groups must be confounded together .
dichelaspis is much more closely united to pæcilasma than to lepas , and , as far as the more important characters of the animal 's body are concerned , there is no important difference between them .
consequently , i at first united pæcilasma and dichelaspis , but the latter forms so natural a genus , and is so easily distinguished externally , that i have thought it a pity to sacrifice it .
the <name> , ( which seems to afford better characters than the other valves in dichelaspis , ) from generally running up between the terga and in ending downwards , in three of the species , in a deeply notched disc or fork , more resembles that in lepas than in pæcilasma ; in the manner , however , in which the imbedded disc , in d .
<unk> and d .
<unk> , nearly cuts off the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle , there is a resemblance to pæcilasma eburnea .
in the extent to which the valves are separated from each other , in the <unk> form of the scuta , ( the two segments in dichelaspis , perhaps , answering to the upper and lateral projections in the scuta of conchoderma virgata , ) and in the basal half of the scuta not descending to the base of the capitulum , there is a considerable resemblance to conchoderma ; in both genera the adductor muscle is attached under the umbones of the scuta ; but the structure of the mouth and cirri and caudal appendages shows that the affinity is not stronger to conchoderma than to lepas .
it appears at first probable , that dichelaspis would present a much closer affinity to pæcilasma fissa , in which , owing to the scuta being formed of two segments , there are seven valves , than to any other species of that genus ; but in p .
fissa the primordial valve is triangular and is situated on the basal segment , whereas , in dichelaspis , it is elliptic and is seated between the two segments , and is more in connection with the occludent than with the basal segment ; and this i can not but think is an important difference : in other respects , p .
fissa shows no more affinity to dichelaspis than do the other species of the genus .
finally , i may add that dichelaspis bears nearly the same relation to pæcilasma , as conchoderma does to lepas .

general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , elongated , with the valves not very close together , the <name> being separated by a rather wide space from the scuta and terga .

ii , fig .
6 b ) , the carinal margin of the basal segment is protuberant , and the occludent margin hollowed out ; in old specimens the occludent margin of the basal segment is straight , and the carinal margin much hollowed out .
in very young specimens the basal segment is very small compared to the occludent .
terga , variable in shape ; flat , lower part wider than the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin double , forming a considerable rectangular projection , as in the terga of lepas ; scutal margin deeply <unk> at a point corresponding with the apex of the scuta , a flat tooth or projection being thus formed ; there is sometimes a second tooth ( fig .
6 b ) a little above the basal point .
the terga , in the first variety , somewhat resemble in shape the scuta of conchoderma aurita .
<name> , much bowed , narrow , slightly concave within , ( in the borneo specimen , rather wider and more concave , ) extending up between the terga for half their length , terminating downwards in a rectangularly inflected , deeply imbedded , oblong , rather wide , flat disc , at its extremity more or less deeply notched .
this disc is externally smooth ; internally it sometimes has two divergent ridges on it ; it extends across about two-thirds of the base of the capitulum ( fig .
6 a , as seen from beneath , when the peduncle is cut off ) , to under the middle of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle , narrow , flattened ; united to the capitulum some little way below the scuta ; about as long as the capitulum ; the membrane of which it is composed is thin , externally studded with bluntly conical beads of yellowish chitine , of which the largest were <unk> of an inch in diameter ; on their internal surfaces these are furnished with a small central , circular depression , apparently for a <unk> ; the arrangement of the beads varied in concentric zones .
similar conical points on the capitulum have an internal concave surface about <unk> in diameter , with a central circle <unk> in diameter , for the insertion , as i believe , of a <unk> .
size.  the largest specimen had a capitulum a quarter of an inch long .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate ; crest with not very minute , blunt teeth , which towards the middle lie closer and closer to each other , so as to touch .
palpi rather small , with a few very long bristles at the apex .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with four teeth , and the inferior <name> <unk> and acuminated ; in one specimen , on one side of the mouth , the mandible had only three teeth .
maxillæ , small ; at the upper <name> there are two large spines and a single small one , beneath which there is a deep notch , and beneath this a straight but projecting edge , bearing a few moderately large and some smaller spines .
outer maxillæ sparingly covered with bristles along the inner margin .
cirri.  first pair far removed from the second pair , and not above half their length ; segments rather broad , with transverse rows of bristles not very thickly crowded together ; terminal segments very obtuse , and furnished with thick spines .
the segments of the three posterior pair have each three or four pair of spines , with a few minute spines scattered in an exterior , parallel , longitudinal row ; dorsal tufts , with four or five long spines .
the second cirrus has its anterior ramus not thicker , but rather shorter than the posterior ramus ; the former is only a little more thickly clothed with spines , owing to those in the longitudinal lateral row being longer and more numerous , than is the sixth pair of cirri .
bristles not serrated .
caudal appendages , narrow , thin , slightly curved , about half as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; in young specimens , the appendage bore seven or eight pair of long bristles rectangularly projecting ; in some older specimens , there was a tuft of bristles on the summit , and two other tufts on the sides .
i at first thought that the borneo specimen was a distinct species , but after careful comparison of the external and internal parts , the only difference which i can detect is , that the terga are slightly larger , and that the <name> , to a more evident degree , is wider , more especially in the middle and lower portions .

general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , elongated , formed of very thin membrane , with the valves forming round it a mere border .
valves thin , imperfectly calcified , covered with membrane .
scuta formed of two narrow plates at very nearly <unk> to each other , one extending along the occludent , and the other along the basal margin ; both become very narrow at the point of junction , and are there not calcified , but are evidently continuous and form part of the same valve ; the basal segment is about half as long and narrower than the occludent segment , flat and bluntly pointed at the end ; occludent segment slightly curled , and therefore the whole does not lie quite in the same plane ; narrow close to the umbo , with a very minute tooth on the under side ; apex rounded .
in the upper part , the occludent segments leave the membranous margin of the orifice , and run in near to the terga , bending towards them at an <name> of <unk> with their lower part .
i was unable to distinguish the primordial valves .
<unk>  these valves are of the most singular shape , resembling a battle-axe , with a flat and rather broad handle ; the upper part consists of an axe , with a broad cutting <unk> edge , behind which is a short blunt spike .
the spike and cutting edge together answer to the double occludent margin of the tergum in lepas .
the whole valve is flat , thin , and lies in the same plane ; the carinal margin is nearly straight ; the scutal margin <unk> out a little , and at a short distance above the blunt basal point is suddenly narrowed in , making the <unk> portion very narrow ; the widest part of the handle of the battle-axe , is narrower than the occludent segment of the scuta .
the two spikes behind the cutting and <unk> edges of the two terga , are blunt and almost touch each other ; above their point of juncture , the membrane of the orifice forms a slight central protuberance .
<name> , very narrow throughout , concave within , much bowed ; upper point broken and lost , but it must have run up between the terga for more than half their length ; basal portion inflected at nearly right angles , and running in between , and close below , the linear basal segments of the scuta , so as almost entirely to cut off internally the peduncle and capitulum .
this lower inflected and imbedded portion , or disc , gradually widens towards its further end , which is , at least , four times as wide as the upper part of the <name> , and is deeply <unk> , but to what exact extent i can not state , as the specimen was much broken .
on each side of this elongated triangular disc , there is a slight shoulder corresponding to the ends of the basal segments of the scuta ; and on the upper surface of each shoulder , there is a small tooth or projection .
the middle part of the disc is barely calcified , and is transparent .

this species comes very close to the d .
<unk> , which likewise was attached to a snake ; but i can not persuade myself , without seeing a graduated series , that the differences immediately to be pointed out can be due to ordinary variation .
i am much indebted for specimens to the kindness of mr. <unk> .
general appearance.  the membrane of the capitulum and peduncle is surprisingly thin and <unk> , so that the ovarian tubes within the peduncle can be traced with the greatest ease .
the valves are small , the apices only just crossing each other , and are composed of yellow chitine , with mere traces of <unk> .
the capitulum is pointed , oval , <unk> of an inch long ; the peduncle is narrow , and fully twice as long as the capitulum .
<unk>  the two segments stand at <unk> to each other ; the basal segment is linear and pointed , fully half as long , but only one third as wide , as the occludent segment .
the point of junction of the two segments is wider than the rest of the basal segment .
this latter segment lies some little way above the top of the peduncle .
the occludent segment is bluntly pointed ; it is directed a little inwards from the edge of the orifice towards the terga ; the apex reaches up just above the slightly reflexed lower point of the terga .
the adductor muscle is fixed under the point of junction of the two segments .
the terga are battle <unk> , with the blade part very prominent , <unk> ; behind the blade there is a short <unk> prominence .
the lower point of the handle of the axe , is bent towards the <name> .
the tergum , measured in a straight line , equals in length two thirds of the occludent segment of the scutum , the handle being rather narrower than this same segment .
the <name> is extremely narrow and much bowed ; the apex reaches up only to just above the lower bent points of the terga .
the basal end is rectangularly inflected , and stretches internally nearly across the peduncle ; it consists ( fig .
7 a ) of a triangular disc of yellow thin membrane , four or five times as wide as the upper part of the valve ; the end of this disc is hollowed out ; its edges are thickened and calcified , and hence , at first , instead of a disc , this lower part of the <name> appears like a wide fork ; the tips of the prongs stretch just under the tips of the basal segments of the scuta .
<unk>  its narrowness and transparency are its only two remarkable characters .
mouth.  all the parts closely resemble those of d .
<unk> , but being in a better state of preservation i <name> describe them .
the labrum is highly bullate , with a row of minute teeth on the crest , placed very close together in the middle .
palpi small , thinly clothed with spines ; mandibles extremely narrow , hairy , with four teeth , but the lower tooth is so close to the inferior <name> , as only to make the latter look double .
maxillæ , with a very deep broad notch , dividing the whole into two almost equal halves ; in the upper part there are three main spines .
cirri.  the first pair are placed at a considerable distance from the second pair ; they are short with equal rami , and rather broad segments furnished with a few transverse rows of bristles .
the five posterior cirri have singularly few , but much elongated segments , bearing four pair of spines : the two rami of the second pair are alike , and differ only from the posterior cirri in a few of the basal segments having a few more spines .
the caudal appendages are twice as long as the pedicels , and nearly half as long as the whole of the sixth cirrus ; they have a small tuft of long thin spines at their ends , and a few in pairs , or single , along their whole length ; at first i thought that they were <unk> , but after careful examination i can perceive no distinct articulations ; i have seen no other instance of so long an appendage without articulations .
<unk>  this species differs from d .
<unk> in all the valves being shorter , so that their points only just cross each other ; but this , i conceive , is an unimportant character .
in the scuta , the basal segment is here narrower , but the point of junction of the two segments wider than in that species ; in the terga , the edge of the axe is smooth instead of being <unk> , and the handle and the point behind are of a rather different shape ; in the <name> the imbedded basal disc has not shoulders and small teeth , as in d .
<unk> .
notwithstanding these differences , i should not be much surprised if the present form were to turn out to be a mere variety .

very rare .
general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , sub-triangular , formed of very thin membrane ; valves imperfectly calcified , and thin .
scuta formed of two narrow plates placed at about an <name> of <unk> to each other , and united at the umbo by a <unk> flexible portion .
the primordial valve is situated at this point , but chiefly on the occludent segment .
the occludent segment is about twice as wide and about one fifth longer than the basal segment , which latter is rather sharply pointed at its end .
the occludent segment is slightly arched , a little narrowed in on the occludent margin close to the umbo ; its upper end is broad and blunt ; it runs throughout close to the edge of the orifice of the sack , and its longer axis is in the same line with that of the terga .
close to the umbones , on the under side of the basal segment , there is , on each valve , a longitudinal calcified fold , serving as a tooth .
terga broad , with a deep notch corresponding to the apex of the occludent segment of the scuta ; the part beneath the notch is of nearly the same width throughout , and is twice as broad as the occludent segment of the scuta ; it has its basal <name> very broad and blunt .
the entire length of the terga equals two thirds of that of the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin simply and slightly curved .
the <name> is of nearly the same width throughout , with the upper part rather the widest , and the apex blunt ; within convex ; it extends up between three fourths of the length of the terga , terminating downwards in a fork with very sharp prongs , standing at <unk> to each other ( fig .
8 a . )
the fork , measured from point to point , is thrice as wide as , and measured across at the bottom of the prongs it is wider than , the widest upper part of the valve ,  a resemblance being thus shown with the triangular notched disc in d .
<unk> .
the points of the <unk> extend under about one fourth of the length of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle rather longer than the capitulum , which , in the largest specimen , was <unk> of an inch in length ; peduncle narrow , close under the capitulum ; membrane thin and <unk> .
the larger specimen had almost mature ova in the lamellæ .
mouth.  labrum with a few bead-like teeth on the crest , distant from each other even in the central part ; palpi rather small , moderately clothed with bristles .
mandibles , with four teeth ; the inferior <name> blunt and broad , showing , apparently , a rudiment of a fifth tooth ; the first tooth is as far from the second , as is this from the inferior <name> ; second , third , and fourth teeth very blunt , whole inferior part of mandible not much narrowed .
maxillæ small , with a small notch under the three upper spines , which are followed by five or six pair , nearly as large as the upper spines .
cirri.  first pair remote from the second ; their rami nearly equal , and about one third of the length of the rami of the second cirrus ; thickly clothed with bristles : rami of the second cirrus of equal thickness , but little shorter than those of the sixth cirrus ; the three or four basal segments of the anterior ramus are thickly clothed with spines ; the other segments , and all the segments on the third pair , resemble the segments of the three posterior pair .
these latter are elongated , not protuberant , and support eight pairs of spines with very minute intermediate spines ; those in the dorsal tufts are numerous and long .
caudal appendages nearly as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; oval , moderately pointed , with their sides , for one fourth of their length , thickly clothed with long very thin spines .

the specimens are in a bad condition , not one with all the valves in their proper positions , and most of them broken ; animal 's body much decayed and fragile .
general appearance.  capitulum apparently much flattened ; valves naked , coloured reddish , separated from each other by thin <unk> membrane .
the scuta consist of two bars placed at <unk> to each other , with the point of junction fully as wide as any part of the basal segment , and perfectly calcified ; the primordial valve lies at the bottom of the occludent segment .
the basal segment is equally narrow throughout , and very slightly concave within ; the occludent segment widens a little above the junction or umbo , and then keeps of the same width to the apex , which is obliquely truncated ; internally this segment is concave ; externally it has a central ridge running along it ; the occludent segment is twice as long and twice as broad as the basal segment .
both segments are a little bowed from their junction to their apices .
<unk>  these are of a singular shape ; they are about three-fourths as long as the occludent segment of the scuta , and in their widest part , of greater width than it .
they consist of four prominent ridges proceeding from the umbo , and united together for part only of their length , and , therefore , ending in four prominences ; one of these , the longest , has the same width throughout , and forms the basal point ; a second , very small one , is seated high up on the carinal margin just above the apex of the <name> ; the third and fourth , are nearly equal in length , and project one above the other on the scutal margin .
there are two occludent margins , meeting each other at right angles , and forming a prominence , as in lepas ; and this gives to the margin of the valve the five prominences .
the whole valve internally is flat ; externally , it is <unk> as described .
<name> ( fig .
10 , a , b ) , much bowed , narrow , long ; externally , the central ridge is quite flattened ; internally , slightly concave , but scarcely so towards the lower part , which is narrow ; the upper part widens gradually , and the apex is rounded .
the basal embedded portion is as wide as the uppermost part , and forms a cup , unlike anything else known : the outline of this cup is <unk> and <unk> ; it is moderately deep ; it is formed by the external lamina of the <name> bending rectangularly downwards and a little outwards , whereas the inner lamina of the lower part ( which is slightly concave ) , is continued with the same curve as just above , and forms the concave chord to the <unk> rim of the cup .
this cup , i believe , lies under the points of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle unknown , probably short .
length of capitulum , above <unk> of an inch .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , and produced into a large overhanging projection ; crest with a row of rather large bead-like teeth ; palpi small , their two sides parallel , very sparingly covered with long bristles .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with four teeth , and the inferior <name> produced into a single strong spine : the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth almost equals that between the tip of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> .
maxillæ with three large upper unequal spines , beneath which , there is a deep and wide notch ( bearing one spine ) , and the inferior part projects highly , bearing three or four pairs of spines , and is , itself , obscurely divided into two steps .
outer maxillæ , very sparingly covered with bristles ; outline , hemispherical .
cirri.  the rami of the five posterior pair are extremely long , as are the pedicels ; the segments are much elongated , with their anterior faces not at all protuberant ; each bears five pair of very long and thin spines , with an excessively minute one between each pair ; the dorsal tuft consists of very fine and thin spines .
the second cirrus has its anterior ramus not at all thicker than the posterior ramus ; but has an exterior third longitudinal row of small bristles .
first cirrus , separated by a wide interval from the second pair ; very short with the two rami slightly unequal in length ; the segments are broad , and are paved moderately thickly with spines ; the terminal spines not particularly thick .
caudal appendages consist of very small and narrow plates , about half the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with a few long spines at their ends .
this well-marked species , i think , has not more affinity to one than to another of the previous species : it differs from all , in the junction between the two segments of the scuta being perfectly calcified ; in the peculiar cup , forming the base of the <name> ; and lastly , in the inferior part of the maxillæ projecting .

i have most unwillingly instituted this genus ; but it <name> be seen by the following description , that the one known species could not have been introduced into lepas or pæcilasma , without destroying these genera , although it has a close general resemblance with both .
as far as the valves are concerned , it is more nearly related to lepas than to pæcilasma ; but taking the entire animal , its relation is much closer to the latter genus than to lepas : it differs from both these genera in the manner of growth of the scuta , which is both upwards and downwards , the primordial valve being situated in nearly the middle of the occludent margin .
in this respect , and in the shape of the <name> and terga , there is an almost absolute identity with scalpellum ; i may , however , remark that in scalpellum , the scuta first grow downwards , and afterwards in most of the species upwards , whereas here from the beginning , the growth is both upwards and downwards .
in the mouth and cirri , there is rather more resemblance to scalpellum than to pæcilasma and lepas : in habits , also , this genus agrees with scalpellum , and if it had possessed a lower whorl of valves , it would have quite naturally entered that genus .
it is unfortunate , that so insignificant and poorly characterised a form should require a generic appellation .
in natural position , it appears to lead from scalpellum through pæcilasma to lepas .

general appearance.  the capitulum is rather thin , and broad in proportion to its length ; it seems always entirely covered by the horny <unk> bark of the <unk> , and hence externally is coloured <name> brown and covered with little horny spines .
the membrane over the valves is very thin , and is with difficulty separated from the <unk> ; it has , i believe , no spines of its own .
the corium lining the peduncle is a fine purple .
all the individuals are attached to the coralline , with their <unk> upwards in the direction of the branches , and in this respect fig .
1. is erroneous .
the valves , when cleared of the bark , are white , or are strongly tinged with <unk> .
the upper parts of the scuta and terga are plainly furrowed in lines radiating from their umbones ; hence their margins are serrated with blunt teeth ; their surfaces , moreover , are sparingly studded with small calcareous points .
scuta ( fig .
1 , a ) , sub-triangular , with the lower part rounded and protuberant , the upper produced and pointed .
the umbo is situated in the middle of the occludent margin , instead of at the rostral <name> , as in the foregoing genera .
the occludent margin is straight , and is bordered by a narrow step or ledge , formed of transverse <unk> , and therefore has its edge serrated : the rostral <name> is often slightly produced into a small projection .
the basal margin is short , and forms an <name> above a <unk> with the occludent margin : the tergal margin is straight ; the carinal margin is rounded , protuberant , and of unusual length compared to the basal margin .
the surface of the valve is convex near the umbo ; and beneath there is a large deep hollow for the adductor muscle .
terga ( fig .
1 , b ) large , flat , triangular , as long as the scuta or the <name> , all three valves being nearly equal in length ; occludent margin straight , or slightly arched , basal <name> broad , not very sharp .
<name> short ( fig .
1 , c , drawn rather too long ) , deeply concave , rectangularly bent , with the lower part not quite as long as the upper , and a little wider : the basal margin is truncated , rounded , and slightly sinuous .
the umbo is situated at the <name> , and therefore nearly central .
the umbo of the terga , i may add , is in the same place , as in lepas .
the peduncle is very short and narrow , and is , i believe , without spines ; it is enveloped by the bark of the <unk> .
the capitulum in the largest specimens was <unk> of an inch in length .
filamentary appendages , apparently none .
mouth , with the orifice rather inclined <unk> .
labrum , with the upper part extremely protuberant , forming a projecting horn ; no teeth on the crest .
palpi rather small , with only a few bristles at the end .
mandibles , with four teeth and the inferior <name> pointed : first tooth as far from the second , as is the latter from the inferior <name> ; in one specimen , on one side , there were five teeth .
maxillæ with three great spines at the upper <name> , beneath which a deep notch , and with the inferior part much upraised ; this lower part rather rounded at both corners , with the upper spines longer than the lower .
outer maxillæ , with the bristles continuous in front ; externally , slightly protuberant , with a tuft of bristles longer than those on the front side .
olfactory orifices apparently not protuberant ; but all the specimens were in a bad state .
cirri.  prosoma very little developed .
first cirrus very far removed from the second .
the three posterior cirri are straight and long ; the segments are elongated and bear four or five pairs of very long spines , with a single minute intermediate spine between each pair ; dorsal tufts , with long spines .
first cirrus , rami unequal by two or three segments , and thickly covered with spines ; the first cirrus is short compared to the second , owing to the length of the pedicel of the latter , though the longer ramus of the first , nearly equals the shorter ramus of the second pair .
second cirrus , with its anterior ramus shorter by two or three segments than the posterior ramus , and thicker than it , with the segments covered like brushes with bristles ; posterior ramus , and both rami of the third cirrus , a little more thickly clothed with bristles than are the three posterior cirri .
caudal appendages , minute , broadly oval , with six or seven long bristles on their summits .

[ 35 ] [ 34 ] the general title to the volume , containing four quarterly parts , is dated 1818 ; but as in the 'journal de physique , ' for july , 1817 , the editor refers to conchoderma , the quarterly part containing this genus must have appeared before 1818 : lamarck gives the year 1814 as the date of the paper in question , and i have accordingly followed him .
from a similar reference by the editor , it appears that <unk> 's volume appeared before the number of the 'journal de physique ' containing leach 's paper .
[ 35 ] under these nine generic names , the two common species of conchoderma have received thirty-three different specific denominations , caused partly by changes of nomenclature , and partly from varieties having ranked as species .
<unk> 2 ad 5 , <unk> , inter se <unk> : scuta <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : <name> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> valves 2 to 5 , minute , remote from each other : scuta with two or three lobes , with their umbones in the middle of the occludent margin : <name> arched , upper and lower ends nearly alike .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulations of the first pair of cirri , and on the pedicels of four or five anterior pairs ; mandibles , with five teeth , finely pectinated ; maxillæ step-formed ; caudal appendages , none .
<unk>  mundane , throughout the equatorial , temperate , and cold seas ; attached to floating objects , living or inorganic .
the capitulum is formed of smooth membrane , including five small valves , of which the terga and <name> are often quite rudimentary or absent .
valves minute , thin , generally more or less linear , placed far distant from each other ; sometimes imperfectly calcified and covered by chitine membrane , or imbedded in it .
the umbones of the valves ( together with the primordial valves ) are nearly central , so that they are added to at their upper and lower ends ; hence their manner of growth is considerably different from that of the valves in lepas .
the adductor muscle is attached to a slight concavity on the under side of each scutum , at the point whence the lobes diverge .
the terga are placed almost transversely to the scuta ; at their lower ends , there is either a very slight prominence in the capitulum , or there is a large tubular , folded appendage , opening into the sack , and apparently serving for respiratory purposes .
peduncle , smooth , moderately long ; attachment effected by the <unk> being poured out exclusively , as it appears , from the larval antennæ .
these antennæ in c .
aurita and c .
virgata , resemble , in the form of the disc and in the long feathered spines on the ultimate segment , those in lepas .
the filamentary appendages are highly developed ; there are six or seven on each side ; two are attached beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ( as is usual in lepas ) , and near them there are one or two small <unk> projections of apparently similar nature ; the rest of the filaments are attached to the posterior edges low down , on the lower segments of the pedicels of the cirri .
i believe , in all cases , these appendages are occupied by testes .
prosoma , moderately developed .
mouth , situated not far from the adductor muscle ; labrum considerably bullate , with the crest hairy and pectinated with inwardly pointing , approximate , flattened teeth : inner fold of the supra-oesophageal cavity slightly thickened and yellowish , <unk> on the sides .
palpi of the usual shape , not meeting , moderately broad .
mandibles , with five teeth , graduated in size , nearly equidistant , finely pectinated either on one or both sides towards their bases ; inferior <name> narrow , either produced into a fine tooth , or almost rudimentary .
maxillæ , about <unk> of the size of the mandibles , step-formed , with five steps generally distinct ; at the upper <name> there are two large unequal spines , of which the lower one is the largest , with a third long thin one on the first step ; lower spines doubly serrated .
<unk> directed inwards and backwards .
outer maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
16 ) simply arched ; the membrane of the supra-oesophageal cavity under these maxillæ is highly bullate and <unk> .
olfactory orifices not prominent .
cirri.  first pair not seated far distant from the second pair .
the three posterior pair have the anterior faces of their segments considerably protuberant , supporting four or five pairs of long bristles ; between which , there is a row of minute , fine , <unk> pointing bristles : on the lateral upper margins of each segment , there are a few very minute spines ; dorsal tuft short , with thick and thin spines intermingled .
in the first cirrus ( of which the rami are nearly equal in length ) , and in the anterior ramus of the second cirrus , the faces of the segments are highly protuberant , and clothed with thick transverse rows of finely and doubly serrated spines : the anterior ramus of the second cirrus is considerably thicker than the posterior ramus , which latter , together with both rami of the third cirrus , differ from the three posterior cirri only in the intermediate and in the lateral marginal spines being slightly more developed .
caudal appendages , absent .
alimentary <unk>  the upper part of the stomach has four large cæca , of which the posterior one is the largest ; the whole surface , also , is covered with minute pits , arranged in transverse rows .
generative system , developed to an extraordinary degree .
the testes run into all the filamentary appendages , as well as more or less , into the pedicels of the cirri : the two vesiculæ seminales unite within the penis , either just beyond its basal <unk> , or up one third of its length .
penis short , hairy .
the ovarian tubes not only fill the peduncle , but extend in a thin sheet between the two folds of corium all round the sack , close up to the terga .
the two ovigerous fræna are present in the usual position ; the ovigerous lamellæ either form several layers , in pairs , one under the other , or are united in a single large <unk> sheet enclosing the whole animal .
<unk>  the prevailing tint is a dark <unk> , which forms , or tends to form , broad longitudinal bands on the peduncle and capitulum .
general remarks.  this genus is intimately related , as has been remarked by professor macgillivray , [ 36 ] to lepas : if we look to the body of the animal , which from being less exposed to external influences must , in the cirripedia , offer the most trustworthy characters , we find that in conchoderma there are additional filamentary appendages attached to the cirri , that there are no caudal appendages , that the teeth of the mandibles are finely pectinated , and that the ovarian tubes run higher up round the sack ; in every other respect , there is the closest similarity , even to the arrangement of the bristles on the cirri .
in the capitulum , the difference consists chiefly , though not exclusively , in the less development of the valves , and their consequent wide separation : the scuta , however , in conchoderma , are added to beneath their umbones , or original centres of growth , which is never the case , or only to a very slight degree , in lepas .
conchoderma has no very close affinity to any other genus .
as the majority of authors have ranked the two common species under two distinct genera ( <unk> and <unk> ) , i may observe , that there is no good ground for this separation ; in the above few specified points in which conchoderma differs from the genus most closely allied to it , the two species essentially agree together .
if we take the nearest varieties of c .
virgata and c .
aurita , there is but a very slight difference even in the form of their valves , and these hold the same relative positions to each other ; the <name> , however , is always less developed in c .
aurita ; even the colouring in both tends to follow the same arrangement .
the only obvious distinction between the two species , are the <unk> appendages of c .
aurita , which , however , are not developed in its early age , are subject to considerable variation , are of no high functional signification , and are indicated in c .
virgata by two prominences on the same exact spots .
on these grounds i conclude , that the generic separation of the two species is quite <unk> .

general appearance.  the capitulum ( seen from above in pl .
iii , fig .
4 a ) is slightly compressed , almost globular , composed of thick membrane , with two large , <unk> , flexible , tubular , folded appendages , at the upper end , opening into the sack .
these appendages are seated behind the rudimentary terga when such are present , or behind the spots which they would have held if not aborted .
in a young condition they are tubular , but not folded ; and often , according to prof. macgillivray , either one or both are at first <unk> .
they are formed externally of the outer membrane of the capitulum ( rendered thin where folded ) , and internally of a prolongation of the inner tunic of the sack ; between the two , there is , as around the whole sack , a double layer of corium .
a section across both appendages , near their bases , is given in pl .
iii , fig .
4 b , showing how they are folded ,  the chief fold being directed from below upwards , with a smaller fold , not always present , from between the two , outwards .
the folds sometimes do not exactly correspond on opposite sides of the same individual ; they are almost confined to the lower part , the orifice itself being often simply tubular .
these appendages are sometimes very nearly as long as the whole capitulum : a section near their bases is sub-triangular .
i shall presently make some remarks on their functions and manner of formation .
the scuta , as well as the other valves , are imperfectly calcified : shape , variable .
they usually consist of two lobes or plates , placed at above a right <name> to each other , and rarely ( fig .
4 c ) almost in a straight line ; the lower lobe is more pointed and narrower than the upper ; the two correspond to the lower and middle lobes in the scuta of c .
virgata , the upper one being here absent .
the terga are developed in an extremely variable degree ; they are often entirely cast off and absent .
in very young specimens , they are of the same length with the <name> , but after the <name> has ceased to grow , the terga always increase a little , and sometimes to such a degree as to be even thirty or forty times as long as <name> .
when most developed ( fig .
4 a ) they are not above one third as long as the scuta , to which they lie at nearly right angles ; they consist of imperfectly calcified plates , square at both ends , slightly broader and thinner at the end towards the <name> , where they are a little curled inwards , than at the opposite end ; they are not quite flat in any one plane ; internally they are slightly concave ; finally , i may add , they nearly resemble in miniature the terga of c .
virgata .
in full grown specimens , the terga almost invariably drop out and are lost ; but even in this case , a long brownish cleft in the membrane of the capitulum , marks their former position .
the orifice of the capitulum is usually notched between the terga , or between the <unk> left by them ; on each side of the notch there is a slight prominence .
in some few cases , however , there is no trace of this notch .
behind the terga or the <unk> , the great <unk> appendages , as we have seen , are situated .
<name> , rudimentary ( fig .
4 ) and often absent ; it is <unk> , and is rarely above the <unk> of an inch long .
after arriving at this full size , calcareous matter is added to the under surface over a less and less area , so that it becomes internally pointed , and finally , in place of calcareous matter , continuous sheets of chitine are spread out beneath it ; hence , during the disintegration of the outer surface , the <name> comes to project more and more , and at last drops out ; subsequently , even the little hole in which it was imbedded , <unk> and disappears .
peduncle , cylindrical , distinctly separated from the capitulum , and generally twice or thrice as long as it : the thickness of the outer membrane generally great , but variable : surface of attachment variable , either pointed , or widely expanded , or formed into divergent projections .
filamentary appendages , seven on each side , highly developed , long and tapering ; there are two beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , and one on the posterior margin of the pedicel of each cirrus , excepting the sixth pair ; the filaments on the pedicels are nearly twice as long as the cirri themselves .
mouth ,  mandibles , with the five teeth nearly equidistant , and towards their bases finely pectinated on both sides ; inferior <name> rudimentary , often represented by a single minute spine : in one specimen , there were only four teeth on one side .
maxillæ , with five steps , not very distinct from each other , with the first step much curved .
the larger of the two upper great unequal spines is pectinated , like the teeth of the mandibles ; there is a third long finer spine beneath the upper large pair .
cirri rather short , broad , with the anterior faces of the segments protuberant , especially those of the first cirrus and of the anterior ramus of the second pair : spines on the anterior cirri doubly serrated .
posterior cirri , with the intermediate spines between the pairs , long ; dorsal tufts , minute .
on the lower segment of the pedicels of the four posterior cirri , there are two separate tufts of bristles .
colours extremely variable ; sometimes five longitudinal bands of dark purple can be distinctly seen ( as in c .
virgata ) on the peduncle , these bands becoming more or less confluent on the capitulum ; at other times , the capitulum is more or less spotted , or often nearly uniformly purple : the sack , cirri and trophi are , also , purple .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen was , including the peduncle and ears , five inches in length , the capitulum itself being rather above one inch in length , and <unk> of an inch in breadth .
general remarks.  i have come to the same conclusion with prof. macgillivray , concerning the variability of this form , and i believe there is only one true species .
with respect to dr. <unk> 's species , viz. , <unk> <unk> and o .
<unk> , though i have not seen specimens , i can hardly doubt , from the insufficient characters given , that they are mere varieties .
with respect to the <unk> appendages , we shall presently see in c .
virgata , that at corresponding points on the capitulum ( tab .
iii , fig .
2 b ) , there are two slight , closed prominences .
according to professor macgillivray , in c .
aurita , every gradation can be followed by which the appendages , at first closed , become tubular and open .
the opening would ensue , if the corium became absorbed at the bottom of the appendages whilst still <unk> , for then the inner tunic would be cast off at the next moult and would not be <unk> , whilst the outer membrane would gradually disintegrate together with the other external parts of the capitulum , and not being <unk> at this point , an aperture would at last be left .
these appendages have no relation to the generative system : the ovarian tubes , which surround the sack do not extend into them ; nor do the ovigerous lamellæ .
i believe , that their function is respiratory : the corium lining them is traversed by <unk> <unk> channels , and their <unk> , tubular and open structure must freely expose a large surface to the <unk> water .
why this species should require larger respiratory organs than any other , i know not .
in this species , moreover , the filamentary appendages are developed to a greater extent than in any other cirripede ; in most genera , the surface of the body and of the sack suffices for respiration .

membrane , thin .
valves , thin , small , sometimes imperfectly calcified , very variable in shape and in proportional length , and therefore , situated at variable distances from each other , but always remote and imbedded in membrane .
scuta , <unk> , consisting of an upper and lower lobe ( the latter generally the broadest ) , united into a straight flat disc , with a third lobe standing out from the middle of the exterior margin , generally at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ( rarely at right angles ) to the upper part , and generally ( but not always ) bending a little inwards .
the shape of the lateral lobe varies from rounded oblong to an <unk> triangle ; as it approaches this latter form , it becomes much wider than the upper or lower lobes .
in one specimen , and only on one side , the scutum ( fig .
2 d ) presented five points or projections .
in some specimens , the scuta are very imperfectly calcified , and consist of several quite separate beads of calcareous matter of irregular shape , held together by tough brown membrane .
terga , extremely variable in shape , placed at nearly right angles to the scuta : beyond their carinal ends ( fig .
2 b ) , the capitulum presents two small prominences , which are important as indicating the position of the homologous , <unk> appendages in c .
aurita .
[ 39 ] the upper ends of the terga are imbedded in membrane , and project freely like little horns for about one third of their length : this free portion exactly answers to the projecting portion , bounded by the two occludent margins , in the terga of lepas .
the freely projecting portion is generally curled inwards , and the carinal portion more or less outwards ,  the form of the letter <unk> being thus approached ; but the <unk> are not exactly in the same plane .
the whole valve is generally of nearly equal width throughout , the carinal part being a very little ( but in some specimens considerably ) wider ; internally , it is deeply concave ; both points generally are blunt and rounded .
in some rare varieties ( <unk> <unk> of leach , fig .
2 c ) , the terga are much smaller and flat , with both points sharp , the whole upper portion being much and abruptly attenuated , and internally , without a trace of a concavity .
generally , the terga are about two thirds of the length of the scuta , rarely only half their length ; generally , they are separated from the apices of the scuta by about their own length , rarely by twice their own length .
generally , the terga are shorter than the <name> , but sometimes a very little longer than it : generally they are distant by one third or one fourth of their own length from the apex of the <name> , rarely by their entire length .
[ 39 ] these have also been observed by dr. <unk> ; see 'journal of acad .

<name> ( fig .

length , variable , generally rather longer ( sometimes by even one third of its own length ) than the scuta , but sometimes equalling only three fourths of the length of the scuta ; generally longer than the terga .
upper and lower points rounded ; in rare varieties , both ends are sharply acuminated .
the <name> and terga are generally most acuminated where they are smallest and least perfectly calcified ; and consequently , in this same state , the valves stand furthest apart .
peduncle , flattened , gradually widening as it joins the capitulum , to which it is generally about equal in length , or a little longer .
filamentary appendages.  six on each side ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 ) , of which one ( h ) is seated on the posterior margin of a swelling , beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , and this is the longest ; the second ( g ) is short and thick , and is seated a little lower on the side of the prosoma , ( near to this , there are also two little <unk> <unk> ; ) the third ( i ) is seated on the posterior margin of the pedicel of the first cirrus , above the basal articulation ; the fourth , fifth , and sixth ( j , k , l ) in similar positions on the pedicels of the third , fourth , and fifth cirri .
these three latter filaments are shorter and smaller than the first three .
at the base of the second cirrus , which has no proper filament , there is a swelling as if one had been united to it .
mouth.  mandibles , with the basal edges of the five teeth pectinated by minute , short , strong spines on one side ; inferior <name> extremely short .
in one specimen , there was a minute pectinated tooth between the first and second ; in another , the second tooth was bifid on its summit ; in another , the fourth was rudimentary .
maxillæ , with five steps : sometimes each step commences with a spine rather larger than the others ; at the upper <name> , there are two large unequal spines ( neither pectinated , ) with a third longer and thinner , seated a little below .
outer maxillæ ( pl .

16 ) , simple .
cirri , with twice as many segments in the sixth cirrus as in first ; spines on the first and second cirri doubly serrated .
colours ( when alive ) .  capitulum and peduncle grey , with a tinge of blue , with six black bands , tinged with purplish brown .
the two bands near the <name> become confluent on the peduncle , and sometimes disappear ; the <name> is edged , and the interspace between the two scuta , coloured with the same dark tint .
the whole body and the pedicels of the cirri are dark <unk> , with the segments of the cirri almost black : in some specimens , the colour seems laterally abraded from the cirri .
ova white , becoming in spirits pinkish , and then yellow .
the dark bands on the capitulum and peduncle become in spirits purple ; but are sometimes discharged ; the general grey tint disappears .
professor macgillivray states that many individuals are <unk> or <unk> , with irregular brown streaks , or crowded dots : he states that in very young specimens the colours are paler , and the valves <unk> .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , had a capitulum rather above one inch long and three fourths of an inch wide : growth very rapid .
monstrous <unk>  in the british museum , there is a dried and somewhat injured specimen of a monstrous variety , the <unk> <unk> of j. e. gray : it differs from the common form only in having a tubular projection , just behind the notch separating the upper points of the terga ; this tube springs from over the terga , and is , therefore , in a different position from the <unk> appendages in conchoderma aurita .
it does not open into the sack : the membrane composing it appears to have been double in the upper part , and to have been lined with corium : in short , this tube seems to have been an <unk> or <unk> , of a cup or tubular form .
general remarks.  it <name> have been seen how much subject to variation the valves of this species are .
when i first examined the <unk> <unk> of leach , from <unk> n .
<unk> , atlantic ocean , and found in many specimens , both old and young , that the terga were very small , flat , acuminated at both ends , with a projecting shoulder on the carinal margin , and situated at about their own length from the apex of the <name> , and at twice their own length from the scuta ; and when i found the <name> acuminated at both ends , and the scuta very imperfectly calcified , with the lateral lobe broad , flat , and standing out at right angles ; and lastly , when i found the whole capitulum bluntly pointed , instead of being square on the summit , i had not the least doubt , that it was a quite distinct species .
afterwards , i found in the <unk> <unk> of leach , from the south atlantic , the same form of terga ; but within slightly more concave or furrowed , and not nearly so small , and therefore not placed at above half so great a distance from the other valves ; and here , the <name> had its usual outline , as had nearly the scutum on one side , whereas , on the other side , it presented a new and peculiar form , having five ridges or points , and was imperfectly calcified ; seeing this , it was impossible to place much weight in the precise form or size ( and therefore , relative separation , ) of the calcified valves ; and on close examination , i found every part of the mouth and cirri identical in leach 's <unk> <unk> and c .
<unk> , and in the common form .
therefore , i conclude , that c .
<unk> , and still more c .
<unk> , are only varieties ; the terga presenting the greatest , yet variable , amount of difference , namely , in their <unk> and flatness .
we know , also , that in the species of the closely allied genus of lepas , the terga are very variable in shape , and this is the case , even in a still more marked degree , in conchoderma aurita .
professor macgillivray , i may add , has come to a similar conclusion regarding the extreme variability of the valves of this species .
as the varieties here mentioned are very remarkable , and may perhaps turn out to be true species , i think they are worth describing in some detail : i <name> only further add , that we must either make several new species , or consider , as i have done , several forms as mere varieties .

again , i possess a group of remarkably fine specimens given me by mr. l. reeve , from the southern ocean , ( as i infer from a young lepas australis adhering to them , ) in which all the individuals , young and old , are characterised as follows :  scuta , with the lateral lobe generally broad , but to a very varying extent , with the upper and lower lobes extremely sharp .
terga separated from the scuta , by one and a fourth of their own length , and by their own length from the <name> ; somewhat acuminated at both ends , nearly straight , with a very slight shoulder near the umbo .
<name> equalling the terga in length , and about three fourths of the length of the scuta ; neither the upper nor lower point much acuminated .
all the valves most imperfectly calcified : in one specimen , the scutum on one side was simply horny , without a particle of calcareous matter .
the summit of the capitulum nearly intermediate in outline between the common square , and <unk> form of var .
<unk> .
i compared the cirri and trophi with those of a common variety , and could detect not the smallest difference .
this variety differs from var .
<unk> , in the less development of its <name> , and from <unk> , in the greater development of its <name> , and especially of its terga .
it would appear as if the great variability of the valves was connected with the absence of calcareous matter .

[ 40 ] [ 40 ] i owe to the kindness of professor <name> , an examination of these specimens , and information regarding them .
capitulum , with the membrane very thin ; summit <unk> pointed .
valves linear and thin .
scuta , elongated , flat , with the upper projecting lobe rather more acuminated than the lower , and equalling it in length ; lateral lobe not wider than the lower , and about as long as it , forming an <name> of about <unk> with the upper one .
terga , of somewhat variable length , generally about half as long as the <name> , narrow , and of nearly equal width throughout ; lower point sharp ; externally convex ; internally solid , with a trace of a central depressed line ; the upper fourth part generally a little bowed out of the plane of the lower part , and abruptly bent at rather above a right <name> along the occludent margin of the orifice .
these valves are situated at about half their own length from the upper points of the scuta .
<name> considerably arched , extending to the lower points of the terga , or running up between them for even half their length ; equally narrow throughout ; scarcely broader than the terga ; both points rounded ; internally concave ; the lower point does not extend as far down as that of the lower lobe of the scuta .
peduncle , narrow , shorter than the capitulum , which , in the largest specimen was <unk> of an inch long .
longitudinal purple bands appear to have originally existed on the peduncle .
filamentary appendages , trophi and cirri all similar to the same parts in c .
virgata ; but perhaps the anterior faces of the segments in the posterior cirri are rather less protuberant ; perhaps also the first cirrus is rather shorter in proportion to the sixth cirrus .
variety ( monstrous ) .  amongst the specimens , i found one very young one , in which the scuta had not upper lobes , so that in outline they exactly resembled the scuta in the quite distinct c .
aurita : there was not even a rudiment of a <name> : the tergum , on one side , was externally bordered by a projecting , semicircular , calcified disc ; and the upper points of both terga showed only traces of the rectangular projection , which is the chief characteristic of c .
<unk> .
from these traces alone , and from the specimen being mingled with the others , do i here include this variety .
general remarks.  i have very great doubts whether i have acted rightly in considering this as a species ; but as there were many specimens , old and young , all differing remarkably from the common species , this form anyhow deserves description .
the points by which it can be distinguished from c .
virgata , are  the almost rectangular manner in which the upper portion of the tergum is bent outwards and along the orifice of the sack  the narrowness of all the valves , and especially of the lateral lobes of the scuta ,  and lastly , the greater curvature of the <name> , which in some specimens runs up far between the terga ; had this last character been constant , it would have been an important one , but such is far from being the case .
great as are these differences in the valves , and though common to many specimens , they are not sufficient to convince me that it is a true species , and i should not be at all surprised at varieties , intermediate between it and the common form , being hereafter found ;  had a name not been already attached to it , i should not have given one .
in the monstrous variety described , we see to what an extent the valves may vary .
the c .
<unk> approaches nearest to the var .
of c .
virgata , called by leach <unk> <unk> , for in both , the top of the capitulum is bluntly pointed and the terga are solid within ; in the var .
<unk> , the terga and <name> are minute , whereas here , though very narrow , they are much elongated .
certainly c .
<unk> has almost as strong a claim to rank as a species as c .
<unk> ; but , in the former , by the aid of other varieties , the differences were almost reduced to the peculiarities in the terga  the valves , the most subject to variation .
in c .
<unk> we have other differences , and the form of the terga is even still more peculiar .
i have , therefore , provisionally attached to it the specific name by which it is designated in the museum of the college of surgeons .
from having been long kept in spirits , all aid from colour is lost .

[ 41 ] any one not attending to the characters derived from the softer parts of the <unk> and lepadidæ , might easily confound with alepas the genus <unk> ( genus nov. ) , which , undoubtedly , though having the external appearance of a pedunculated cirripede , belongs to the <unk> , and is closely related to <unk> .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulations of the first pair of cirri ; mandibles , with two or three teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part irregular , projecting ; caudal appendages <unk> .
attached to various living objects , fixed or floating .
capitulum either entirely destitute of valves , or with transparent horny scuta , not containing any calcareous matter , and almost hidden in membrane .
these scuta are formed of a lower and a lateral lobe , placed at above right angles to each other ; they are added to by successive layers , and closely resemble in shape the scuta of the conchoderma aurita .
the orifice in a .
<unk> projects so much as to be almost tubular .
in a .
<unk> and a .
<unk> it does not project , and is either moderately large , or very small in proportion to the length of the capitulum ; from contraction it is much wrinkled .
the membrane forming the capitulum is smooth and very transparent ; it contains very few tubuli , except under certain irregular projections in a .
cornuta .
the peduncle is rather short and narrow ; it blends into the capitulum , and is not , in some of the species , separated from it by any distinct line ; the surface of attachment is rather wide .
within the peduncle we have the three usual layers of <unk> muscles ; namely , the innermost and longitudinal , which run lower down than the others ; the middle and transverse ; and , lastly , the exterior , oblique muscles , which cross each other ( becoming transparent ) on the rostral central line .
these several muscles run up from the peduncle and surround the capitulum ; from the transparency of the membranes they can be seen from the outside : they are particularly conspicuous round the orifice , which they probably serve to close .
there is , in all cases , the usual adductor scutorum muscle ( with transverse striæ ) , which is attached under the horny scuta , where such exist .
the fact of the <unk> muscles of the peduncle surrounding the whole capitulum , has been observed only in one other genus , namely anelasma .
in consequence of this structure , the capitulum must possess considerable powers of contraction .
the antennæ of the larva in the alepas cornuta and a .
<unk> have the sucking disc nearly circular , with the spines unusually plain on the distal as well as <unk> margin .
basal segment broad , much constricted where united to the disc .
the ultimate segment has on the middle of the outer margin , in a .
cornuta , two minute spines , which i have not observed in any other cirripede : on the summit there are the usual spines .
size.  three of the species are small .
filamentary appendages.  these are rather small ; there is only one on each side , situated on the posterior margin of a slight swelling , beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; and therefore in the position in which the filaments are most constant in lepas , and where they likewise occur in conchoderma .
<unk>  the prosoma is either pretty well developed or is small , according as the first cirrus is placed near to , or far from the second cirrus .
mouth.  labrum moderately bullate , with the lower part more or less produced ; crest with blunt , bead-like teeth , and short hairs .
palpi ( pl .
x , fig .
8 ) , acuminated and narrow to an unusual degree .
mandibles , with two or three teeth , and the inferior <name> acuminated ; the lateral bristles unusually strong , so as to give the main teeth the appearance of being pectinated .
maxillæ , widely notched , with three great upper spines ; the part beneath the notch projecting , and either straight or irregular .
outer maxillæ , with the inner bristles either continuous or divided into two groups : exteriorly there is a smaller or larger prominence , with long bristles .
the olfactory orifices are either slightly , or not at all protuberant .
cirri.  in the three posterior pair , the segments have their bristles arranged in a transverse row , either in the form of a narrow brush , or consisting only of a single pair with two or three minute , intermediate , and lateral marginal spines .
the anterior ramus of the second cirrus is thicker , and more thickly clothed with spines than is the posterior ramus : this latter ramus , however , and both rami of the third cirrus , are rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior pair .
the unique case in a .

caudal appendages , thin , tapering , <unk> , about as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
<unk>  the oesophagus runs in a somewhat sinuous course , and enters the top of the stomach obliquely .
there are no cæca .
the <unk> envelope presents a <unk> structure , instead of the usual longitudinal folds .
generative system.  the penis is hairy , not very long , and ringed or articulated in an unusually plain manner ; the space between each ring being about one fourth of the diameter of the penis : the <unk> basal portion or support is here remarkably long .
the vesiculæ seminales are long , tortuous , and enter the prosoma .
the ovarian tubes are of wide diameter : in a .
cornuta they surround the whole capitulum .
the ovigerous fræna are small , constricted at the base , and square on the free margin , which is studded with minute glandular beads , borne on the finest footstalks .

a .

[ 42 ] [ 42 ] it appears that <unk> ( <unk> des .
<unk> , vol .
i , p. 34 ) observed a species of this genus adhering to a <unk> on the coast of brazil .
mr. cocks informs me that an alepas , apparently a .
<unk> , has been cast on shore near <unk> , attached to a <unk> ; and that two other specimens adhered to the bottom of a vessel arriving at that port from <name> .
affinities.  this genus differs from all , except anelasma , in the manner in which the <unk> muscles of the peduncle run up and surround the capitulum , and likewise in the <unk> character of the <unk> envelope of the stomach .
to conchoderma , especially to c .
aurita , there is manifest affinity in the form of the horny scuta : there is also some affinity to this same genus in the presence of filamentary appendages though here little developed , and in the circular form of the disc of the larval antennæ , and , lastly , in the ovarian tubes in a .
cornuta surrounding the capitulum .
there is quite as close , if not closer affinity to ibla , in the following peculiarities ,  in the curved oesophagus ,  in the general character of the cirri and trophi , with the olfactory orifices in one species in some degree prominent ,  in the <unk> caudal appendages ,  and in the <unk> penis , with its elongated <unk> support , though both these characters are exaggerated in ibla .
lastly , the scuta in ibla , though not at all resembling in shape those of a .
cornuta , are formed without calcareous matter ; and again , in ibla , the muscles of the peduncle run up to the bases of the valves , and so almost surround the space in which the animal 's body is lodged .
the four species of alepas appear to form two little groups ; viz .
a .

capitulum oval , blending insensibly into the peduncle ; moderately flattened ; composed of thin <unk> membrane , with the exception of two horny , almost quite hidden scuta .
orifice situated near the summit , and in a line , which is oblique to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle ; much wrinkled ; barely one third of the length of the whole capitulum .
the scuta , consist of yellowish , transparent , horny , laminated chitine , without any calcareous matter ; externally covered by the common integument of the capitulum ; these valves are placed very near to each other , close under the orifice , and therefore high up on the capitulum ; the membrane between them is smooth and <unk> ; they are formed of two rather acuminated lobes , joining each other at above a right <name> ; one lobe ( the longer one ) stretching nearly transversely across the capitulum , the other running down parallel to its rostral margin : in shape and position they resemble the scuta of conchoderma aurita ; and if another lobe had been developed it would have run along the orifice , and then these valves would have resembled the scuta of conchoderma virgata .
in a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , the scuta from point to point were <unk> of an inch in length .
peduncle , much wrinkled , about one third in diameter of the capitulum , and shorter than it ; at the base it is generally expanded into two or three <unk> projections .
length of the largest specimen , about one fourth of an inch .
colour , according to a. <unk> in the work above cited , " <unk> <unk> ; " but after spirits the whole becomes uniformly yellowish .
filamentary appendages , situated beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , on the posterior edge of the usual enlargement ; acuminated , about two thirds of the length of the shorter ramus of the first cirrus .
prosoma well developed .
mouth.  on each side there are two slight prominences ; one under the mandibles , the other transverse nearer to the adductor muscle .
labrum , placed near the adductor muscle , with the upper part not more bullate than the lower part ; crest with a row of blunt teeth , and many fine bristles growing chiefly outside the teeth ; there are many fine bristles on the inner or supra-oesophageal fold of the labrum .
palpi not nearly touching each other , pointing towards the adductor : much hollowed out on their inner sides , hence narrow and acuminated , with doubly serrated bristles .
mandibles , with three teeth and the inferior <name> ending in a single sharp spine ; whole inferior portion narrow ; first tooth as far from the second , as the latter from the inferior <name> ; owing to the presence of short thick spines projecting from the sides of the jaw , the lower edges of the second and third teeth appear pectinated .
maxillæ , nearly two thirds of the width of the mandibles ; beneath the three larger upper spines there is a considerable notch , and the whole lower part is very slightly upraised ; edge irregular , with obscure traces of either two projections , or perhaps of four steps .
outer maxillæ , with bristles in front continuous ; exteriorly there is a slight prominence near each olfactory orifice , with a tuft of long bristles .
cirri not much elongated ; first pair placed not quite close to the second ; five posterior cirri nearly equal in length ; pedicels long , with irregularly scattered spines ,  those on the pedicel of the first cirrus beautifully and conspicuously feathered .
the segments of the three posterior pair are not very short or broad ; very slightly protuberant , each with a long transverse , <unk> , narrow brush of bristles , which stand two or three deep in the middle , but on the sides are single : dorsal tufts long , and in the upper segments the spines are thick and <unk> .
this structure is common to all the cirri .
first cirrus with the rami unequal in length by two segments ; from the shortness of the pedicel , this cirrus is much shorter than the second , but its rami are about two thirds of the length of those of the second cirrus .
second cirrus ( and in a less degree the third cirrus ) , with the anterior ramus a shade broader than the posterior ramus , and rather more thickly covered with spines than are the three posterior cirri .
fifteen segments in the sixth cirrus ; nine in the longer ramus of the first cirrus .
caudal appendages , rather longer than the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , composed of seven cylindrical , tapering segments , each with a circle of very fine bristles on its summit .
the acoustic ( ? )
sacks are situated some way below the basal articulations of the first cirrus .

[ 44 ] m. <unk> rang rejects the specific name " <unk> , " as <unk> a generic character , and he has been followed in this by mm .
quoy and gaimard themselves .
this , according to the rules of the british association , would hardly have been a sufficient reason , but it appears that a .
<unk> , like a .
<unk> , has a pair of horny scuta or valves ; and , therefore , the name <unk> is too obviously false to be retained .
with respect to the generic name triton , i fully believe that it was applied by linnæus to the cast-off <unk> of sessile cirripedes .

parasitic on <unk> , mediterranean and atlantic oceans : south shore of england ( ?
) [ 45 ] i have not seen this species , and have drawn up the above specific character from the plates and brief descriptions in the voyages of the <unk> and <unk> .
m. lesson thinks that his species differs from that of mm .
quoy and gaimard ; but as the peculiar yellow colour of the capitulum , general shape , short cirri , habits and range , are all common to both , i believe that they are identical .
there is , however , one singular difference , namely , that the cirri are coloured bright blue in the plate in the voyage of the <unk> , and yellowish in that in the voyage of the <unk> : this possibly may have resulted from the drawing in the latter case having been made from a specimen long kept in spirits .
m. lesson says that there are seven pair of cirri , from which i infer that this species has a pair of long , articulated , caudal appendages : he asserts that each cirrus has ten segments ; the cirri are short and little curled .
m. lesson remarks , that " deux <unk> <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> de <unk> <unk> : " i can hardly doubt but that these are horny scuta of nearly the same shape as in a .

capitulum globular , slightly flattened , smooth , translucent , entirely destitute of valves ; orifice slightly projecting or tubular , parallel to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle , with the edges sinuous ; it appears more tubular than it really is , from the <unk> of the part of the capitulum immediately beneath the orifice .
three small , flexible , horny , irregular prominences project from the carinal margin ; one at the bottom of the capitulum ; a second about half-way up it ; and a third generally close to the orifice ; but their positions vary a little , and the prominences vary still more in shape and size , being either rounded and very small , or much flattened and considerably prominent ; they are <unk> ; in the membrane under them a few tubuli may be seen , which are not elsewhere visible ; their summits are roughened with very minute points and beads of chitine ; others , still <unk> , are scattered over the whole capitulum .
peduncle short , narrower than the capitulum , into which it insensibly blends ; strongly wrinkled ; surface of attachment wide ; position with respect to the branches of the coralline , various .
size and <unk>  the largest specimen , including the peduncle , was half an inch in length , and <unk> of an inch across the capitulum ; colour , after having been long in spirits , <unk> .
filamentary appendages , one on each side , short , tapering and pointed ; seated on the posterior margin of a slight swelling beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; they are about equal in length to the pedicels of this cirrus .
the mouth is directed <unk> ; labrum much produced downwards , so as to be far separated from the adductor muscle ; moderately bullate , forming about one third of the longitudinal axis of the entire mouth ; upper part forming a slightly overhanging prominence ; crest with a row of blunt , bead-like teeth , and externally to them there are numerous curved short bristles .

mandibles , with either two or three teeth ; inferior <name> narrow and <unk> ; both sides covered with strong bristles or spines , projecting beyond the toothed edge .
maxillæ , with two large upper spines , and a third rather distant from them ; beneath these , there is a wide notch or hollow ; inferior part square , projecting , bearing six pair of moderately long spines , ( of which the central one is the longest , ) mingled with finer ones .
outer maxillæ , with a semicircular outline ; the serrated bristles in front are divided into two groups ; externally there is a rounded and very considerable projection covered with long bristles .
olfactory orifices slightly prominent , approximate , seated within and just beneath the rounded projections at the base of the maxillæ .
<unk>  prosoma little developed ; thorax small .
cirri , extremely long , but slightly curled , capable of being protruded so as almost to touch the base of the peduncle or the surface of attachment ; segments short , extraordinarily numerous .
in the three posterior cirri ( excepting the rudimentary rami ) , each segment supports two long , slightly serrated spines , with two or three minute intermediate ones , and with one or two very short , thick spines on the inner and upper lateral margins : dorsal tufts with only two or three long , fine , unequal spines .
all the segments are extremely flat , broad , short , with their anterior faces not protuberant ; the greater number of the segments , especially the lower ones , have very obscure articulations , to be seen only with a high power , and these can be capable of little or no movement .
first cirrus placed far from the second , with the top of its pedicel on a level with the top of the lower segment of the pedicel of the second cirrus ; rami short , barely half the length of those of the second cirrus ; unequal , the anterior ramus being only two thirds of the length of the posterior one ; the shorter ramus contains thirteen <unk> segments , with one side rather protuberant ; the longer ramus contains twenty-three thinner segments ; the segments on both rami are clothed with bristles , arranged in two or three rows , forming narrow transverse brushes .
second cirrus , with its pedicel long , and its rami nearly equalling in length those of the sixth pair ; the two rami of nearly equal length ; the anterior one rather thicker than the posterior one ; this posterior ramus has fifty-five segments !
the bristles on the second and third cirri are arranged on the same principle as on the three posterior pair ; but from an increase in size and number of the little intermediate bristles between the main pairs , and of those on the lateral rims , the segments , especially the basal ones , of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus , are clothed with thin brushes of bristles ; these same bristles , on the posterior ramus of the second , and on both rami of the third cirrus , can hardly be said to form brushes , though longer and more numerous than those on the three posterior pair of cirri .
fifth and sixth cirri.  these resemble each other , and have their inner or posterior rami in an almost rudimentary condition .
in the sixth cirrus ( pl .
x , fig .
28 ) the outer ramus ( a ) has actually sixty-three segments , whereas the rudimentary ramus ( k ) has only eleven , nearly cylindrical segments .
these are furnished with extremely minute spines , of which those on the dorsal face are longer than those on the anterior face ; the spines on the summit of the terminal segment are the longest ; the segments are not half as thick as the normal ones in the outer ramus .
the rudimentary ramus is only one seventh part longer than the pedicel which supports both it and the normal ramus .
in the fifth cirrus , the rudimentary ramus is rather longer , and has thirteen segments , resembling those in the rudimentary ramus of the sixth .
in the fourth cirrus there is no trace of this peculiar structure , the rami being equal in length and strength .
the two rudimentary rami on each side are nearly straight , and seem incapable of movement ; they project out behind the normal rami , and closely resemble in general appearance , the two caudal appendages ; hence this cirripede , at first sight , appears to be <unk> .
pedicels of cirri.  the pedicel of the first pair is very short ; that of the second is the longest ; those of the posterior cirri decreasing in length .
upper segments short ; lower segments in the second , third and fourth cirri , irregularly and rather thickly clothed with bristles , but in the fifth and sixth cirri , there is a regular double row of main spines , with some minute intermediate ones : hence there is a difference , both in the rami and in the pedicels , between the fourth cirrus and the fifth and sixth , and this is a unique case .
on the dorsal surface of the pedicel of the second cirrus , there is a tuft of much feathered fine spines .
caudal appendages.  each consists of eight much tapering , very thin segments , furnished with a few short simple spines round their upper margins , and with a longer tuft on the terminal short segment ; basal segments twice as thick as the middle ones .
in length , these caudal appendages equal the pedicels of the sixth pair of cirri , and are a very little shorter than the rudimentary rami of these same cirri .
general remarks.  having examined this species first in the genus , i fully anticipated that the very remarkable character of the inner rami of the fifth and sixth cirri being rudimentary , and serving the same function ( if any ) with the caudal appendages , would have been generic ; but this is not the case , for alepas cornuta can not be separated from a .
<unk> without violating a clear natural affinity .

* * * * * i owe to the great kindness of professor steenstrup , an examination of this very curious cirripede , well described and figured by <unk> , who considered it an alepas .
it lives parasitic , with its peduncle imbedded in the skin of sharks , in the north sea .
according to the principles of classification which i have followed , this cirripede can not possibly remain in alepas , and must form a new genus ; for some time , indeed , i thought that a new family or <unk> ought to have been instituted for its reception ; but when i considered that its highly peculiar characters are all negative , as the <unk> , <unk> structure of the cirri , and that no new or greatly modified functional organ is present , i concluded that it might properly remain amongst the lepadidæ .
we shall , moreover , hereafter see that the male of ibla , which , of course , must remain in the same family with the female , is , in some analogous respects , even more abnormal than anelasma .

capitulum , destitute of valves ; oval , much flattened ; the double membrane composing it , thin , highly flexible , coloured externally and internally , by the underlying corium , of a blackish purple ; aperture , extremely large , extending from the upper end of the capitulum , to close above the peduncle , gaping , and not protecting ( in the dead condition ) the cirri and mouth .
the peduncle is about half as long as the capitulum , but , according to <unk> , this part varies in length ; it is a little narrower than the capitulum ; colourless , from being imbedded in the shark 's skin ; <unk> ; basal end almost hemispherical .
total length of animal <unk> ; diameter of peduncle <unk> of an inch .
the external membrane of the capitulum is not nearly so thick as is usual in other cirripedes , and is , therefore , unusually flexible .
the internal membrane , on the other hand , is very much thicker than is usual , being only a little thinner than the outside coat ; this circumstance , as well as the similarity in colour on both sides , is evidently due to the remarkable <unk> of the sack , and consequent exposure of its inside .
the inner membrane , when viewed under a high power , is seen to be covered with the minutest spines ; the external membrane is <unk> , except that there are a few rows of very minute beads of hard chitine , like those which occur on the capitulum of conchoderma aurita .
<unk> , however , states that there are imbedded in the outer membrane , scattered , minute , <unk> , calcareous particles .
of these , i could see no trace .
there is a very thin muscular layer between the two coats , all round the capitulum , and this layer becomes rather thicker round the base , near the peduncle .
the adductor muscle , occupying its usual place close below the mouth , is thinner than in any other cirripede of the same size seen by me ; nor does it end so abruptly at each extremity , as is usual : where attached to the outer coat , no impression is left .
it is a singular fact , that in this cirripede alone , the fibres of the adductor , and of the muscles of the cirri , and of the trophi of the mouth , are destitute of transverse striæ ; but it is not singular , that the muscles surrounding the capitulum should , also , be destitute of striæ , for this is the case with the muscles which , running up from the peduncle , surround the capitulum in alepas , and partly surround it in conchoderma .
it must not be inferred from the absence of transverse striæ in the muscular fibres of the adductor and of the cirri and trophi , that they are involuntary , but only that they are in an embryonic condition , for i find in the natatory larva , that all the muscles , with the exception of some connected with the eyes , are similarly destitute , and yet perform voluntary movements .
[ 46 ] [ 46 ] dr. c. schmidt in his contribution to the comparative anatomy of the <unk> animals , & c. , ( translated in <unk> scientific memoirs , vol .
v , p. 1 , ) says that in young crustacea , " we find plain primitive fibres , which subsequently acquire the transversely <unk> aspect . "
although in the dead state , the aperture of the capitulum seems to be always gaping , yet i have little doubt , that the living animal can fold the flexible membrane , like a mantle , round its thorax and cirri , and thus protect , though feebly compared with most cirripedes , these organs .
i suspect that the mouth is always exposed .
<unk>  the membrane of the peduncle is thin ; the whole surface is sparingly and quite irregularly studded with minute , <unk> filaments ( pl .
iv , fig .
3 , highly magnified ) ; these are occasionally as much as <unk> of an inch in length ; the degree of branching varies much , but is generally highly complex ; the ordinary diameter of the branches is about <unk> of an inch ; their tips are rounded , and even a little enlarged , and frequently torn off , as if they had been attached to or buried in the flesh of the shark , in which the whole peduncle is imbedded .
these filaments are formed of , and are continuous with the external transparent membrane of the peduncle , and they contain , up to the tips of every <unk> , a hollow thread of corium , prolonged from the layer internally coating the whole peduncle .
in all other lepadidæ , the peduncle increases in length , chiefly at the summit where joined to the capitulum , and in diameter , throughout nearly its whole length , except close to the base ; but , owing to the constant disintegration of the outer surface , the old outside coat does not split in defined lines , like the membrane of the capitulum .
in anelasma , however , owing to the imbedded position of the peduncle , the old outer coats are preserved , the lines in which they have split during continued growth being thus exhibited : those in the uppermost part almost symmetrically surround the peduncle , showing that here , as in other lepadidæ , has been one regular line of growth ; but in the lower part the lines are extremely irregular ; and what is almost unique , it appears that the blunt basal end is constantly increasing in length and breadth , and , apparently , at a greater rate than any other part .
i judge of this latter fact , from the whole bottom of the peduncle being covered with numerous curved , or nearly circular , lines of natural splitting , the nature of which can be best understood by examining the <unk> drawing ( pl .
iv , fig .
3 ) of a small portion ( taken by chance ) of the membrane of the base , seen from the outside , and bearing some of the simplest branched filaments : other branches , as may be seen , have been cut off .
this manner of growth explains the broad , blunt basal termination of the peduncle , so unlike that in other lepadidæ .
new membrane is formed , not continuously as in other cases , under the whole surface of the old membrane , but in irregular patches ; thus the portion marked ( a ) runs under ( b ) , but not under the little circles ( c , c ) , for these are the <unk> portions and <unk> the membrane ( a ) and ( b ) .
i do not understand how the splitting of the old membrane is effected ; but no doubt it is by the same process by which the membrane of the capitulum in other genera , as in scalpellum , splits symmetrically between the several valves .
in the branched filaments it is particularly difficult to understand their growth , for it is not possible , after examining them , to doubt that they continue to increase , and send off <unk> , which it would appear probable , penetrate the shark 's flesh like roots .
i may remark that one , or more commonly two or three branched filaments stand nearly in the centre of each circular line of exuviation or splitting .
the branched filaments first commence as mere little <unk> , and these appear to be most numerous at the bottom of the peduncle .
the final cause of the downward growth of the bottom of the peduncle , is obviously to allow of the animal burying itself in the shark 's body , in the same way as <unk> and <unk> become imbedded by the downward growth of their <unk> in the skin of <unk> .
the only other genus of lepadidæ , in which the growth of the peduncle is at all analogous , is lithotrya , in this genus , however , the animal burrows mechanically into soft rock or shells .
i looked in vain for cement , or for the <unk> , ( but the specimen was in an extremely unfavorable state for finding the latter ) or for the prehensile antennæ of the larva .
no doubt this cirripede at first becomes attached in the same way as others , but after early life , i suspect it is retained in its place , by being so deeply imbedded in the shark 's body , and perhaps by the <unk> branched filaments .
the irregular growth and splitting of the membrane at the base of the peduncle , where the prehensile antennæ of the larva must originally have been situated , would account for not finding them .
the inside of the peduncle ( fig .
2 g ) was gorged , in the specimen examined by me , with immature ova .
the innermost muscular layer consists of longitudinal bundles of unusual size , but placed rather far apart from each other ; these do not extend to the very base of the peduncle , and at the upper end they curve inwards , almost to the middle of the under side of the diaphragm , separating the peduncle and capitulum .
outside these longitudinal muscles , there are delicate transverse ones , but apparently there are no oblique muscles in the upper part of the peduncle , as in other lepadidæ ; near the bottom , the transverse muscles form a thicker layer with many of the bundles running in oblique lines .
mouth.  <unk> has not described this part quite accurately , owing to his not having used high enough <unk> powers .
he states that the trophi are soft and functionless , which is far from the case .
the whole mouth ( fig .
2 d ) , is unusually small ; it is , to a certain extent , probosciformed , and being curved a little downwards , projects slightly over the adductor muscle , to which it is closely placed .
the labrum does not project more beyond the general surface of the body , than in many other cirripedes , but the probosciformed structure is caused by the elongation of the surface fronting the thorax .
the summit of the mouth stands above the level of the top of the pedicels of the first pair of cirri .
the labrum is slightly hollowed out in the middle of its upper margin ; it can scarcely be called bullate , in which it differs from all other lepadidæ ; on the other hand , the outer and inner folds of the labrum are not so close together as in balanus .
on each upper corner , there is , as usual , a small rounded prominence , close to which there is a second slight , rounded , <unk> swelling ; these latter represent the quite rudimentary palpi .
the mandibles ( figs .
4 , 5 ) are more highly developed than the other trophi ; they are , however , very minute , the toothed edge being only about <unk> of an inch in length , measured in its longest direction ; the edge is unusually thick , with the teeth placed rather on one side ; this organ , when viewed on the labrum side ( fig .
5 ) , shows two large teeth placed low down , with the inferior <name> pectinated and broadly truncated ; but when viewed on the other or maxillæ side ( fig .
4 ) , several large and small teeth , placed alternately and irregularly in pairs , are seen extending along the whole edge .
the mandibles are furnished , as usual , with three principal sets of muscles attached to the basal fold of the mouth .
the maxillæ ( fig .
7 ) are still smaller than the mandibles ; the spinose edge being only the <unk> of an inch in length ; the edge , instead of being square , and furnished with a double row of long spines , as in all other cirripedes , is rounded , thick , <unk> , and with the side facing the mandibles , thinly and irregularly strewed with short , thick , very minute spines ; there is a large broad <unk> ( a ) , in the usual place , but it is much more transparent and flexible than common : there are also the usual muscles .
in other cirripedes , the mandibles alone seem to force the prey down the oesophagus ; but here , the mandibles and maxillæ equally stand over the orifice , and their adjoining spinose faces and edges , seem excellently adapted to force , by their united action , any minute living creature down the passage .
the outer maxillæ are almost in as rudimentary a condition as the palpi ; they are quite <unk> ; viewed externally , they appear like two smooth , blunt , very minute projecting points ; but viewed internally , the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal hollow seems to be united actually to their tips , so that they do not project at all .
i was surprised to find that the longitudinal muscles going to these organs were developed , in proportion to the other muscles , quite as fully as in ordinary cirripedes : hence , these two little outer maxillæ , no doubt , serve as an under lip , and possess the usual backward and forward movement .
the surface of the probosciformed mouth facing the first pair of cirri , has a deep central longitudinal fold , and rather more than half-way down , a transverse fold ; just above this latter fold , and therefore quite below the outer maxillæ themselves , the two olfactory orifices are seated ; these are unusually large , and the sack into which they lead , is most unusually large and deep .
in this cirripede , i was first enabled to observe that the membrane lining the sack is tubular , and open at the bottom .
cirri.  there are , as usual , six pair , and not of very small size ; they have a shapeless and rudimentary appearance ; they are coloured , like the rest of the body , blackish purple : they are quite <unk> , and not articulated , but their anterior faces are either obscurely or very plainly <unk> , so that in some ( for instance in the third pair , pl .
iv , fig .
6 ) , nine or ten prominent steps could be counted , manifestly representing so many segments .
the rami are equal in length in the first pair , and slightly unequal in the second and third pair ; these two latter are longer than either the first or three posterior pair .
there is a small interspace as usual between the first and second pair of cirri .
internally , the cirri are occupied , even up to their tips , by delicate <unk> muscles .
the external membrane of the thorax and limbs , when examined under a very high power , is seen to be covered with minute toothed scales , as in most cirripedes .
the thorax is articulated as usual : the posterior part , however , is smaller , and tapers more suddenly than in other species , and this corresponds with the smaller size and more rudimentary condition , of the three posterior pair of cirri , compared with the anterior pair .
the prosoma is hardly at all developed .
the orifice ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 e ) of the acoustic ( ? )
sack , beneath the first cirrus , is unusually large .
there are no filamentary appendages .
alimentary <unk>  the membrane lining the oesophagus is unusually thin : it is furnished with the ordinary <unk> muscles , and others radiating from them like spokes of a wheel .
the stomach is lined by unusually prominent <unk> folds , which in the <unk> are transverse , sending forth , however , short folds at right angles ; and these latter , in the proper stomach , become so much developed that the folds appear longitudinal .
the <unk> extends inwards , about as far as the base of the fourth pair of cirri , but is very short , owing to the little development of the three posterior segments of the thorax .
the anus is seated in its usual place , at the dorsal basis of the penis , and is hidden by loose folds of skin ; but there are no distinct caudal appendages .
the stomach , in the specimen examined , was quite empty .
reproductive <unk>  the penis ( fig .
2 , c ) is thick , short ( about twice as long as the sixth cirrus ) , constricted at the base , ringed , <unk> , with the terminal aperture large ; internally it is well furnished with muscles .
the two vesiculæ seminales , appeared to be unusually small ; and one was much smaller than the other ; they do not ( i believe ) become united into a common tube , till near the apex of the penis .
they were empty ; and , i presume , from the state of the ova , that their contents had lately been discharged .
the whole thorax was filled with a white , fibrous and cellular mass , consisting perhaps of the testes in their undeveloped state .
the individual dissected by me , appeared to have been defective in its last act of reproduction , for there were only two or three ova attached to the <unk> on one side , and not very many on the other .
the ova are much less elongated than is usual ; they are of a remarkable size , namely <unk> of an inch in their longer diameter ; the membrane by which they are united into a pair of lamellæ is remarkably strong ; the <unk> ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) on each side is large , strong , with rounded edges , pale coloured and hence conspicuous ; on the side nearest the body , the whole surface is covered with <unk> glands , having very short footstalks , and being in total length <unk> of an inch ; these glands secrete a <unk> layer of <unk> fibres , attached to the ovigerous lamellæ .
in the specimen described by <unk> , the lamellæ ( fig .
1 , and fig .
2 , b , b ) appear to have been very large : and in that examined by myself , the peduncle was gorged with immature ova , showing that the female reproductive powers were ample , though at the foregoing period , only a few eggs had been formed .
<unk>  according to <unk> , this species lives imbedded in the skin of <unk> maximus and <unk> , in the north sea : i suspect that it is not closely compressed in its cavity , otherwise , i do not see the use of the two layers of muscles round the whole peduncle ; it probably adheres to the sides of the cavity by the tips of the branched , <unk> filaments ; owing to the flexible nature of the capitulum , this cirripede can offer little resistance to the water , and , therefore , is little likely to be torn out of its cavity .
i have no doubt that it can fold the membrane of the capitulum , like a cloak , round its thorax and cirri ; but it certainly can offer far less resistance , than other cirripedes , to any enemy .
this creature must obtain its food , and considering its productiveness much food must be required , in a manner quite different from nearly every other member of its order .
as the whole of the peduncle is imbedded , and as the mouth is probosciformed , with the labrum a little curled over the adductor muscle , i conclude that this cirripede can reach minute animals crawling by on the surface of the shark 's body .
it must be borne in mind that the mouth , as in all cirripedes , has the power of independent movement , and that the mandibles and maxillæ are here beautifully adapted to catch and force down any small living creature into the muscular oesophagus ; the rudimentary outer maxillæ , moreover , no doubt have the power of scraping , like a lip , anything towards these prehensile organs .
it <name> hereafter be seen , that the male of ibla cumingii , in which the cirri are quite rudimentary , obtains its food in a somewhat analogous manner , though in this case the whole peduncle moves , and not merely a probosciformed mouth : it deserves attention , that in the male ibla and in anelasma , in neither of which the cirri are prehensile , the palpi are rudimentary and useless .
i am tempted to believe , that the largely developed olfactory sacks , and perhaps , likewise , acoustic ( ? )
sacks , in anelasma , replace , by giving notice of the proximity of prey , the loss of <unk> cirri .
it should be remembered that all cirripedes subsist on animals which happen to swim or float within reach of the cirri ; but here it is only those which happen to crawl within reach of the probosciformed mouth .
it would , however , be rash to assert that the cirri in anelasma , considering their muscular though feeble structure , may not be of some slight use , when thrown over the prey , in preventing its escape .
professor steenstrup informs me that , from late observations , it appears that this animal always adheres to the shark 's body in pairs .
i regret extremely that i have not been able to examine a pair : that the individual examined by me was <unk> , i can hardly doubt , though the male organs certainly were feebly developed ; it appears probable , that the individual described by <unk> was likewise <unk> : but after the facts presently to be revealed regarding the sexes in ibla and scalpellum , it is quite possible that the male and female organs may be developed in inverse degrees in different and adjoining individuals .
the genus anelasma is , i think , properly placed between alepas and ibla .
in several of its characters , such as the absence of calcareous valves , the broad blunt end of the peduncle , the <unk> cirri , the small size of the trophi , and more especially the absence of transverse striæ in those muscles , which in mature cirripedes are thus furnished , we see that this genus is in some degree in an embryonic condition .

general remarks.  as there are only two species as yet known , and as these resemble each other in every respect most closely , a generic description would be a useless repetition of the full details given under ibla cumingii .
i have taken this latter species as the type , from having , owing to the kindness of mr. cuming , better and more numerous specimens .
ibla and lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle ; but there is no distinction of any importance , though useful for classification , between the capitulum and peduncle ; and these two parts , as we have seen , tend to blend together in some species of conchoderma and alepas .
the entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle , at first appears very remarkable ; but we have seen a similar fact in alepas , and there is an approach to it in some varieties of conchoderma aurita and c .
virgata .
in all four valves of ibla , the umbones , or centres of growth , are at their upper points .
the horny spines on the peduncle , are the <unk> of the calcareous scales in scalpellum and pollicipes ; and in this latter genus , two of the species have their scales , almost cylindrical , placed irregularly , with new ones forming over all parts of the surface , and not exclusively at the summit ,  in which several respects there is an agreement with ibla .
the shape of the body ( i .
e. thorax and prosoma , pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is peculiar ; but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera , and shall meet again in some species of scalpellum .
the presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the lepadidæ , though observed in the sessile genus , chthamalus .
the caudal appendages in the i .
quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family , being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
a far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus , in both species , running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle , instead of , as in every other species , close under this muscle .
i took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly : the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented in pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ by faint dotted lines .
the stomach has no cæca ; the <unk> folds are longitudinal ; there is a marked <unk> at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma .
there are no filamentary appendages .
the generative system gives the chief interest to this genus .
we here first meet with males and females distinct ; and , within the limits of this same restricted genus , the far more wonderful fact of hermaphrodites , whose masculine efficiency is aided by one or two complemental males .
the complemental and simple males closely resemble each other , as do the female and hermaphrodite forms ; but under the two following species i enter into such full and minute details on these remarkable facts , that i <name> not here <unk> on them .
i may add that , at the end of the genus scalpellum , i give a summary of the facts , and discuss the whole question .
the penis ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) in the hermaphrodite , i .
quadrivalvis , is singular , from the length of its <unk> support , and from the distinctness of the segments in the articulated portion .
as ovigerous fræna occur in the usual place in i .
quadrivalvis , though much smaller than in any other species , i have no doubt that they occur in i .
cumingii , although i failed in observing them .
the glands on the margin , in i .
quadrivalvis , are singular , from not being borne on a long , <unk> footstalk .
affinities.  ibla , though externally very different in appearance from scalpellum , is more nearly related to that genus than to any other ; in both genera some species have the sexes separate , the imperfect males being parasitic on the female , and other species are <unk> or hermaphrodite , but aided by parasitic complemental males .
in scalpellum , again , the oesophagus pursues a sinuous course , resembling that in ibla , though it does not pass exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle .
the disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva , in both genera , has an unusual oblong form , like a mule 's hoof ; there is also an affinity between the two genera in the size and form of the ova , in the prominent orifices of the olfactory cavities , and in the peduncle not being naked ; though , in these two latter respects , in the structure of the cirri , and in the <unk> caudal appendages , there is an equal affinity to pollicipes and lithotrya .
i have already shown that alepas is likewise related to ibla .

female .
the capitulum is formed of four valves , but is hardly distinct from the peduncle .
the latter includes , in its wide upper part , the <unk> body .
the valves , namely , a pair of scuta and terga , are composed of an extremely hard , horny substance , or properly chitine , and do not contain any calcareous matter ; they are extremely flat or thin , and both pairs project freely , like curved horns , to a considerable height above the sack enclosing the body : the terga project about twice as much as the scuta , and their flat apices generally diverge a little .
the tips of the valves are frequently broken off ; their surfaces are plainly marked or ribbed by the layers of growth , which are wide apart .
the bases of the valves externally are hidden by the long spines of the peduncle .
<unk>  these are shorter and broader than the terga ; their internal ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 b´ ) growing or <unk> surfaces are slightly concave , triangular , with the basal margin longer than the other margins and slightly <unk> in the middle : there is no depression for the strong adductor muscle : the internal surface of the free <unk> portion , has a small central fold ( formed by an oblique crest ) running from the summit of the triangular growing surface to the tip of the valve : in perfect specimens , the growing and the free <unk> portions ( the latter represented much too long in fig .
8 a´ and b´ ) are about equal in length : the basal portion of one side of the scutum <unk> the tergum .
<unk>  the internal glowing surface ( fig .
8 b´ ) is almost <unk> , and less in area than the <unk> : external surface rounded ; internal surface of the free <unk> portion , slightly concave .
colour and structure of <unk>  the external surfaces of the scuta and terga are yellow along the middle , plainly marked by zones of growth , and finely ribbed longitudinally : the internal surfaces and sides of the horns of the two valves , are coloured fine blue or purple ; in the terga , however , the internal surface is mottled with yellow .
in some specimens , especially in one from <unk> , each zone of growth was only very narrowly edged with blue .
when a thin layer is removed from one of the valves , the dark blue or rather purple appears by transmitted light a beautiful pale blue ; and it is a very singular fact , that this blue portion is permanently turned by very gentle into a fiery red ; the same singular effect is produced by muriatic and acetic acids .
this blue part is much harder than the yellow ; the latter exhibits , under a high power , a folded structure , and is penetrated by a few tubuli , whereas the harder blue portion has a cellular or scaled appearance .
the spines of the peduncle exhibit , in a smaller degree , similar phenomena .
<unk>  this , as already remarked , can not be distinctly separated from the capitulum ; it is much compressed ; it is composed of unusually thin and delicate membrane , transversely wrinkled and thickly clothed with long cylindrical horns or spines of chitine .
these horns ( fig .
8 <unk> ) are not the <unk> of the spines which are articulated on the external membranes of many pedunculated and sessile cirripedes , but of the calcified scales on the peduncle of scalpellum and pollicipes ; for they pass through the membrane ( the underlying corium being marked by their bases ) and are persistent , being added to , like the valves , during each successive period of growth .
their bases are concave , so that a section of the layers of growth exhibits a series of pointed cones , one within another .
each spine is nearly cylindrical , irregularly curled , and <unk> or slightly enlarged at intervals : the apex smooth and pointed ; the exterior surface longitudinally and finely ribbed , like the valves .
the spines increase irregularly in size from the bottom to the top of the peduncle , those at the carinal and rostral ends being generally the longest ; they point upwards and hide the bases of the valves .
they are not arranged symmetrically , and new ones are formed over all parts of the peduncle .
they are formed of the same substance as the valves , and do not contain any calcareous matter .
these horns are yellowish , generally ringed with pale and dark <unk> brown , which on pressure becomes slightly <unk> with pale blue and fiery red : sometimes only the upper horns are thus ringed , and in rare instances all are simply yellowish .
the muscles of the peduncle run up to the bases of the four valves .
surface of <unk>  the cement appears to proceed from only two points .
in some specimens , a considerable length of one side of the peduncle was fastened to the surface of attachment , the horns or spines being enveloped in the cement .
the prehensile antennæ of the larva <name> presently be described under the male .
the length of an average specimen , including the peduncle and valves , is about half an inch , and the width across the widest part one fifth of an inch .
mr. cuming has one specimen an inch in length , but this is owing to the peduncle being unusually tapering .
in a specimen kept some years in spirits , the cirri , trophi , caudal appendages , and corium under the membrane between the scuta , were all dark purple ; the sack and corium of peduncle clouded with purple , and the prosoma pale-coloured .
the body ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is small compared with the capitulum and peduncle ; it is much flattened ; the prosoma is of a very peculiar shape , being square , the sides of equal length , and , in an <unk> specimen , <unk> of an inch long .
the peculiar shape arises from the great distance between the first and second cirrus  from the mouth being far removed from the adductor scutorum muscle  and lastly , from the lower part of the prosoma being not at all protuberant .
the thorax which supports the cirri is also unusually small , plainly articulated , and separated from the prosoma by a deep fold .
the thin membrane of the prosoma is studded with some fine , pointed hairs , about <unk> in length , and articulated on little circular discs .
mouth , placed at a considerable distance from the adductor , and directed in an unusual manner towards the ventral surface of the thorax : the trophi are arranged , in a curved line , facing the thorax ( see pl .
v , fig .
2 , for this part in the male ) , and therefore less laterally than is usual .
labrum ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ opposite c ) highly bullate ; the upper part produced into a blunt point : on its crest there are no teeth .
palpi ( fig .
8 a´ opposite d ) small , blunt and rounded at their ends ; inner margins slightly concave .
mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
4 ) , with three teeth , of which the first is much larger than the second and third , and distant from them : inferior <name> produced and pectinated ; upper edges of the second and third teeth finely pectinated .
maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
11 ) small , slightly but distinctly indented by two notches , supporting , besides the three upper great spines , three pairs of moderately long spines and some finer ones : <unk> short , thick .
outer maxillæ , unusually pointed , with the inner bristles not very numerous , continuously arranged ; externally , the bristles are longer .
olfactory orifices , tubular , projecting , flattened , square on the summit , smooth : they point upwards and obliquely towards each other : they arise more laterally than in the other genera , namely outside the bases of the outer maxillæ , and between them and the inner maxillæ .
between the bases of the first pair of cirri , there is a conical prominence , clothed with bristles and coloured purple : it projects nearly as high as the top of the lower segment of the pedicel of the first cirrus : it lies over the <unk> ganglion , and serves , i suspect , to fill up a little interval between the outer maxillæ .
cirri long , little curved : the first pair ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is situated at an extraordinary distance from the second ; hence its basal articulation is on a level with the upper articulation of the pedicel of the second cirrus .
in the three posterior cirri , the segments are laterally very flat , with their anterior surfaces not protuberant ; each supports three pairs of thin , <unk> bristles , of which the second pair is much shorter than the upper , and the lowest pair minute ; between each pair there is a minute , <unk> projecting bristle ; dorsal tufts consist of two or three spines , of which one is longer than the others .
the two bristles forming each pair , are not of equal length ; for in the rami of each cirrus , the inner row of bristles is much shorter than the outer ; and this seems to be connected with the flatness of the whole animal , and the consequent little power of divergence in the rami of the cirri .
the first cirrus is rather short , with the rami unequal in length by about two segments : the anterior ramus is shorter and thicker than the other : segments numerous , each clothed with several rows of bristles .
the second cirrus has the anterior ramus thicker and more thickly clothed with spines than the posterior ramus ; this latter is rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri ; the third cirrus is in all these respects characterised like the second cirrus , but in a lesser degree .
the pedicels of the second and third cirri are thickly and irregularly clothed with spines ; in the three posterior pairs , the spines are placed in two regular rows , with some minute intermediate spines .
caudal appendages ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , f ) , <unk> , thin , tapering , in one specimen equalling , in another just exceeding , in length the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
in the latter specimen there were thirteen segments , of which the basal segments were broader and shorter than the upper ; these latter are slightly constricted round the middle , so that they resemble , in a small degree , an <unk> .
their upper margins are surrounded by rings of bristles ; the terminal segment being surmounted by one or two very fine bristles much longer than the others .
the two appendages are closely approximate ; each arises from a narrow elongated slip , attached to the side of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
nervous system.  i examined the upper part of the nervous chord , in order to ascertain whether the <unk> ganglion , which is of a <unk> shape , was far separated from the second ganglion ; and this i found to be the case , in accordance with the distance of the first cirrus from the second .
i may here remark , that in s .
quadrivalvis i discovered the eye , which , though in all probability really double , appeared to be single ; it was situated near to the supra-oesophageal ganglion ; and this ganglion was situated near to the adductor scutorum muscle , and at a considerable distance from the labrum .
the aperture leading into the acoustic ( ? )
sack , is situated much lower down than is usual ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) , namely , at the length of the pedicel of the first cirrus beneath its basal articulation .
generative system.  the specimens here described , of which i examined six , are exclusively female ; they have no trace of the external , probosciformed penis , or of the two great vesiculæ seminales , or of the testes : on the other hand , the ovarian tubes within the peduncle are developed in the usual manner , and owing to the large size of the ova , are of large diameter , and hence very distinct : i detected , also , the true ovaria at the upper edge of the stomach .

of the above-described ibla cumingii i dissected six specimens , four from the philippine archipelago , [ 47 ] and two from the burmah empire , and none of them , as we have just seen , possessed the probosciformed penis , the vesiculæ seminales , or the testes , so conspicuous in other cirripedes ; on the other hand , all were furnished with the usual branching ovarian tubes and sometimes with ova , and consequently were unquestionably of the female sex .
within each of these specimens there was attached within the sack , in a nearly central line , at the rostral end , ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , h , magnified five times , ) a flattened , purplish , <unk> little body , projecting about the <unk> of an inch : in one of the six individuals , there was a second similar little creature attached at the carinal end of the sack .
before giving the reasons which i think conclusively prove that these little animals are the males of the ordinary form of the ibla cumingii , it <name> be convenient to describe their structure in detail .
[ 47 ] i am deeply indebted to the liberality and kindness of mr. cuming , in allowing me to cut up four specimens of this new species ; and to dr. gould , of boston , u. s. , for the examination of the burmese specimens .
the whole consists of a long , much flattened peduncle , separated from the mouth and thorax by an oblique fold , ( pl .
v , fig .
1 h , b ) , which is conspicuous on the dorsal margin under the cirri , and can be traced with difficulty to the ventral margin .
the thorax , itself rudimentary , and supporting rudimentary cirri , is in some individuals , as in the one represented ( fig .
1 , magnified 32 times ) , covered by , or received in the oblique fold h , just mentioned : in other individuals the thorax is drawn out , and then the fold shows merely as a notch on the dorsal margin , and the basal articulations of the cirri stand some little way above it .
the basal edge of the large , well-developed month can be traced all round , and on the ventral margin ( b ) , is generally marked by a slight notch .
the dimensions and proportions vary much : the longest specimen , including the imbedded portion , was <unk> , and the shortest barely <unk> of an inch in length ; the width of the widest portion varied from 1 to <unk> of an inch : the specimen figured ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , and pl .
v , fig .
1 , ) is a broad , short individual .
generally , the middle of the peduncle is rather wider than the upper part .
<unk>  the main part of the animal , as may be seen in the drawing , consists of the peduncle , of which the imbedded portion tapers more or less suddenly in a very variable manner , and is of variable length ,  in one specimen being one fourth of the entire length , and in another consisting of a mere minute blunt point .
the free upper part of the animal is bent in various directions , in relation to the imbedded portion .
the latter passes obliquely through the chitine membrane and corium , lining the sack of the female , and running along amidst the underlying muscles and <unk> fibrous tissue , is attached to them by cement at the extremity .
the peduncle is often , but not in the individual represented , much constricted at the point where it passes through the skin of the female , and generally at several other points , especially towards the extremity ( see fig .
1 ) ; the stages of its deeper and deeper <unk> being thus marked .
the <unk> are , i believe , simply due to the continued growth of the male , whilst the hole through the membrane of the female does not yield .
the <unk> , which is considerable only when the lower part of the peduncle is almost parallel to the coats of the sack , seems caused by the growth and repeated <unk> of the female ; i believe , that the larva attaches itself to the chitine tunic of the sack , and that the cement , by some unknown means , affects the underlying corium , so that this particular portion of the tunic is not moulted with the adjoining integuments , and that the growth of the surrounding parts subsequently causes this portion to be buried deeper and deeper : it is , i believe , in the same way as the end of the peduncle in conchoderma aurita , sometimes becomes imbedded in the skin of the whale to which it is attached .
the outer tunic of the peduncle is thin and <unk> : in the fold ( fig .
1 h ) under the cirri , there is a central triangular <unk> of still thinner membrane , corresponding in position to the membrane connecting the two terga in the female , and there subjected to much movement .
i may here remark , that this fold , in its office of slightly protecting the thorax and in its position , evidently represents the capitulum with its valves , enclosing the whole body of the female .
the outer tunic is lined by corium , mottled with purple , and within this there are two layers of <unk> muscles , transverse and longitudinal , as in all pedunculated cirripedes .
the corium extends some way into the imbedded portion of the peduncle , and consequently , the outer tunic there continues to be added to layer under layer , and as it can not be periodically moulted , it becomes much thicker than in the upper free part of the animal : the corium , however , does not extend to the extreme point , so that in it growth of all kind ceases .
<unk>  the peduncle terminates ( pl .
v , fig .
1 e ) in the two usual , larval , prehensile antennæ , which it is very difficult to see distinctly ; they are tolerably well represented in fig .
5 , greatly magnified .
their extreme length , measured from the basal articulation to the tip of the hoof-like disc , is <unk> of an inch , the disc itself being <unk> of an inch .
the disc is slightly narrower than the long basal segment , from which it is divided by a broad conspicuous articulation ; its lower surface is flat and its upper convex , altogether resembling in shape a mule 's hoof ; its apex is fuzzy with the finest down ; it bears a narrow ultimate segment , thrown , as usual , on one side ; this segment supports on its rounded irregular summit , at least five , i believe , judging from the structure of the same part in the male larva of ibla quadrivalvis , six or seven spines , longer than the segment itself : one long spine arises from the under side of the disc , near the base of the ultimate segment , and points backward : there is also a single curved spine on the outside , near the distal end of the basal segment .
these organs were imbedded in a <unk> ball or cylinder of brown , transparent , finely laminated cement , and thus attached to the fibrous tissue of the female .
the two cement-ducts ( fig .
1 f ) were very plain , each about <unk> of an inch in diameter , containing the usual inner chord of opaque cellular matter .
i traced them at the one end into the prehensile antennæ as far as the disc ; and at the other , up the peduncle for about one fourth of its length , where i lost them , and could not discover with certainty any cement glands .
i may , however , here mention , that i found in the lower half of the peduncle , numerous , yellowish , transparent , excessively minute , pyramidal bodies , with step-formed sides ; of these two or three often <unk> by their bases like crystals ; i have never seen anything like these in other cirripedes , but it has occurred to me that they may possibly be connected with the formation of the cement : for in the last larval condition of lepas , the cement-ducts run up to the <unk> ovaria , filled at this period with yellowish , <unk> , cellular masses , without the intervention of cement glands , and i can imagine that similar masses , not being developed into functional ovaria , might give rise to the yellow pyramidal bodies .
mouth.  the mouth is well developed ; it is represented as seen vertically from above , in pl .
v , fig .
2 , magnified about 60 times ; the positions of the cirri and the outline of the thorax are accurately shown by dotted lines ; a lateral view is given in fig .
1 .
in the specimen figured , the longitudinal diameter of the mouth , including the labrum , was <unk> of an inch .
the muscles of the several trophi have transverse striæ , and are the strongest and most conspicuous of any in the body .
the labrum is largely bullate , with its summit slightly concave ; the trophi are arranged in a remarkable manner , in a semicircular line , so as to be opposed to the labrum rather than to each other : there are no teeth or spines on the crest of the labrum , which <unk> the <unk> cavity .
the palpi ( fig .
2 b and fig .
3 ) are very small , dark purple , bluntly pointed , with a few small bristles at the point ; they do not extend beyond the knob at each corner of the labrum , which is here present , as in all other lepadidæ ; they are much smaller than in the female , though of a similar shape , and consequently , their points are much further apart : within their bases , the lateral muscles of the mandibles are , as usual , attached ; they are represented in fig .
3 , as seen from the inside , with the eye on a level with the concave summit of the labrum .
the rudimentary condition of the palpi is connected , as remarked under the anelasma <unk> , with the absence of efficient cirri .
the mandibles ( fig .
7 ) are well developed ; they so closely resemble those of the female that it is superfluous to describe them : they are , however , smoother , without any trace of the teeth being pectinated , and with the inferior point smaller : measured in their longer direction , they are <unk> of an inch in length , and , therefore , a little less than one third of the size of those of the female .
these organs have the usual muscles well developed , and the usual articulations .
the maxillæ ( fig .
8 ) have a rather rudimentary appearance ; yet they have the same size relatively to the mandibles , as in the female , the spinose edge being <unk> of an inch in length .
these organs resemble , to a certain extent , those of the female , differing from them in being less prominent ,  in the outline being more rounded , with the notches even less distinct ,  and in the spines being fewer .
the <unk> is short and broad .
the outer maxillæ ( fig .
6 ) are pointed , with a small tuft of bristles at the apex ; they are much less hairy than in the female , but have nearly the same unusual shape .
outside their bases , and between them and the inner maxillæ , the two well-developed , tubular , flattened , <unk> , olfactory orifices , project in exactly the same remarkable position as in the female ; these are not represented in fig .
2 , though sometimes they can be very distinctly seen , when the mouth is viewed from vertically above .
thorax and cirri.  the thorax is in a rudimentary condition : i did not observe the usual articulations .
the whole , as seen from vertically above , is of small size , compared with the mouth ; the outline is accurately shown by dotted lines in tab .
5 , fig .
2 , together with the positions of the two pair of cirri , the caudal appendages , and anus .
the posterior end of the thorax does not rise to the level of the summit of the mouth ; and the thorax seems of no service , excepting perhaps as a sort of outer lip to protect the mouth .
the cirri are in an extreme state of abortion , and evidently functionless ; they are lined with purplish corium , without the vestige of a muscle ; they are usually distorted and bent in different directions ; they vary in size , and even those on opposite sides of the same individual , sometimes do not correspond , and do not arise from exactly corresponding points of the thorax .
there are always two pair of cirri , which , as i conclude from the position of the <unk> orifices , answer to the fifth and sixth pair in other cirripedes .
each cirrus ( fig .
4 ) usually carries only one ramus , placed on a large basal segment , evidently corresponding to the pedicel of a normal cirrus .
the posterior are larger than the anterior cirri , which latter spring from points a little lower down on the thorax .
in the posterior cirrus figured , the great basal articulation or pedicel , almost equals in length , and much exceeds in thickness , the four segments of the ramus ; these segments are furnished on their upper dorsal edges with little brushes of spines , but have not even a trace of the normally larger and far more important anterior spines .
in one specimen , the anterior cirrus had a large pedicel , carrying three segments , like those of the posterior pair ; but in another specimen , one of the three segments showed traces of being divided into two , thus making four imperfect segments ; whilst on the corresponding side of this same individual there were only two <unk> segments , with their few spines differently arranged .
again , in a third specimen , the great basal segment of the anterior cirrus on one side , bore , exteriorly to the usual ramus , a single segment furnished with bristles , and evidently representing a second ramus ; thus showing that the great basal segment certainly answers to a pedicel .
i may here add , that on the integuments of these cirri , i observed with a high power , the serrated <unk> appearance common in other cirripedes .
directly between the bases of the sixth cirrus , there is a very minute <unk> , which , under the highest power , can be seen to consist of two closely approximate , flattened points ; these , i have no doubt , are the caudal appendages in an extremely rudimentary condition , for i traced the vesiculæ seminales to this exact spot : close outside these rudimentary points , on a slight swelling , is the anus .
it <name> presently be seen that in the male of the closely allied ibla quadrivalvis , the nature of these caudal appendages admits of no doubt , for in this species they consist of more than one segment , are spinose , and close under them towards the mouth , there is a perfectly distinct <unk> , representing the usual probosciformed penis .
alimentary <unk>  the oesophagus is very narrow , and of remarkable length ; from the orifice under the mandibles , it first runs back ( in this respect not well represented in pl .
v , fig .
1 , ) under the bullate labrum , and then straight down the peduncle , where it terminates in the usual <unk> expansion , entering one side of the small globular stomach ; the latter , at its lower end , is slightly constricted , and then is rather abruptly upturned .
the <unk> is of unparalleled length , and extremely narrow ; it can be best detected after the dissolution by caustic potash of the softer parts , when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous , in the ordinary manner , with the outer integuments of the thorax .
the anus , as already stated , is seated on a slight swelling , and consists of a small longitudinal slit ( f , fig .
2 ) , placed close outside the two very minute caudal appendages .
organ of <unk>  in all the specimens , a little below the fold separating the mouth from the peduncle , and near the abdominal ( or rostral ) edge , a black ball ( c , fig .
1 ) , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , is conspicuous .
when dissected out , it is somewhat conical in form , and appears to consist of an outer coat , with a layer of <unk> of a dark purple colour , surrounding a transparent , rather hard lens , apparently leaving a circular orifice at the summit , and forming a short tube at the base , surrounding what i believe to be a nerve .
i was not able to perceive that this eye consisted of two eyes united , which the analogy of other cirripedes makes me suppose probable , although in the ordinary and hermaphrodite ibla quadrivalvis , the eye also appeared single .
it is seated under the two transparent muscular layers , close upon the upper end of the stomach , and this is the exact position , as stated in the introductory discussion ( p. 49 ) , in which the eyes of pedunculated cirripedes are commonly situated .
generative system.  within the muscular layer all round the upper part of the peduncle , and surrounding the stomach , there are numerous , little , rather irregular globular balls , with brown granular centres , so closely resembling the testes in other cirripedes , though of smaller size , that i can not doubt that this is their nature : they were much plainer , larger , and more numerous in some specimens than in others .
the vesiculæ seminales can seldom be made distinctly out ; but having cut one specimen transversely across the thorax , they were as plain as could be desired , lying parallel and close to each other above the <unk> , ( the animal being in the position as drawn , ) and therefore in their normal situation .
each had a diameter four times as great as that of the <unk> .
in this individual the contents seemed ( whether from decomposition or state of development , or from my not having used high enough power , i know not , ) merely pulpy ; but i have since found , in another specimen , masses of the most distinct spermatozoa , with the usual little knots on them , associated with numerous cells , about as large as and resembling those which i have examined in living cirripedes , and from which i have every reason to believe the spermatozoa are developed .
the vesiculæ seminales unite and terminate under the two extremely minute caudal appendages , and here i think i saw an orifice ; but there is certainly no projecting , probosciformed penis .
having dissected the six specimens with the utmost care , and having scrupulously examined the ovaria in other cirripedes during their early stages of development , even before the exuviation of the larval locomotive organs , and in specimens of smaller size than the male ibla , i am prepared to assert that there are no ovaria , and that these little creatures are exclusively males .
it should be borne in mind , that in some of the specimens there were perfect spermatozoa in the vesiculæ seminales ( as likewise in some of the males of i .
quadrivalvis ) , and , therefore , if these individuals had been hermaphrodites , their ova would have been , at this period , well developed , and ready for impregnation : in this state it is almost impossible that they could have been overlooked .
moreover , it is probable that such ova would not have been very small , for the larvæ whence the parasitic males are derived , attain ( as might have been inferred from the known dimensions of their prehensile antennæ , and as we shall show actually is the case in i .
quadrivalvis , ) the size common amongst ordinary cirripedia .
concluding remarks.  that these animals are true cirripedes , though having so different an external appearance from others of the class , admits of not the least doubt .
the prehensile antennæ , enveloped in cement and including the two cement-ducts , would have been amply sufficient , without other parts  for instance , the mouth , by itself perfectly characteristic with each organ , together with the whole alimentary canal , constructed on the normal plan ,  to have proved that they were cirripedia .
under the head of the closely-allied ibla quadrivalvis , we shall , moreover , see that the males are developed from larvæ , having every point of structure  the peculiar <unk> shell , the two compound eyes , the six natatory legs , & c. ,  characteristic of the order .
but in some respects , the males are in an embryonic condition , though unquestionably mature , as shown by the spermatozoa ;  thus , in the thorax and mouth opening throughout their whole width into the cavity of the peduncle , that is , <unk> into the anterior part of the head , and in the viscera being there lodged instead of in the thorax and prosoma , there is a manifest resemblance to the larva in its last stage of development : the absence of a probosciformed penis , the <unk> peduncle , the food being obtained without the aid of cirri , and the length of the <unk> , are likewise embryonic characters .
not only are these males , as just remarked , cirripedia ; but they manifestly belong to the pedunculated family .
if a specimen had been brought to me to class , without relation to its sexual characters , i should have placed it , without any hesitation , next to the genus ibla ; if the mouth alone had been brought , i should assuredly have placed it actually in the genus ibla : for let it be observed how nearly all the parts resemble those of ibla cumingii , excepting only in size and in being less hairy .
the trophi are arranged in the same peculiar position as in the female ; the labrum is largely bullate , without teeth on the crest ; the palpi , though relatively smaller , are of the same shape ; so are the mandibles ; the maxillæ are more rounded and less prominent , but have the same exact size relatively to the mandibles ; the outer maxillæ have the same , quite peculiar pointed outline , and the olfactory orifices are tubular , and hold the same unusual position .
it is most rare to find so close a resemblance in the parts of the mouth , except in very closely allied genera , and often species of the same natural genus differ more .
again , in the long oesophagus and constricted stomach there is a resemblance to ibla .
in the male of ibla quadrivalvis , the caudal appendages are <unk> ; now , this is a character confined to four genera , namely , ibla , alepas , pollicipes , and lithotrya .
i may add , that large tubular olfactory orifices are confined to the same genera , together with scalpellum .
lastly , it particularly deserves notice , that the prehensile antennæ , in having a hoof-like and pointed disc , with a single spine on the heel , much more closely resemble these organs in scalpellum , certainly the nearest ally of ibla , than in any other genus ; they differ from the antennæ in scalpellum , only in the ultimate segment not having a notch on one side .
these organs , unfortunately for the sake of comparison , were not found in the female and ordinary form of ibla .
the full importance of the above generic resemblance in the antennæ , <name> hereafter be more clearly seen , when their classificatory value is shown in the final discussion on the sexual relations of ibla and scalpellum .
here , then , we have a pedunculated cirripede very much nearer in all its essential characters to ibla than to any other genus , and exclusively of the male sex ; and this cirripede in six specimens , from two distant localities , adhered to an ibla exclusively of the female sex .
may we not , then , safely conclude that these parasites are the males of the ibla cumingii ?
considering that , in the same class with the cirripedia , there is a whole family of crustaceans , the <unk> , in which the males , compared with the females to which they cling , differ as much in appearance as in ibla , and are even relatively smaller , i should not have added another remark , had there not been under the head of the following species , and of the next genus scalpellum , a class of allied facts to be advanced , which in some respects support the view here taken , but in others are so remarkable and so hard to be believed , that i <name> call attention to the alternative , if the above view be rejected .
the ordinary ibla cumingii must have a male , for that it is not an hermaphrodite can hardly be questioned , seeing how easy it always is to detect the male organs of generation ; and we must consequently believe in the visits of a locomotive male , though the existence of a locomotive cirripede is improbable in the highest degree .
again , as the little animal , considered by me to be the male of i .
cumingii , is exclusively a male , ( for there were no traces of ova or ovaria , though the spermatozoa were perfect , ) we must believe in a locomotive cirripede of the opposite sex , though the existence in any class of a female visiting a fixed male is unknown : [ 48 ] in short , we should have <unk> to make two locomotive cirripedes , which , in all probability , would differ as much from their fixed opposite sexes , as does the cirripede , considered by me to be the male of i .
cumingii , from the ordinary form .
this being the case , i conclude that the evidence is amply sufficient to prove that the little parasitic cirripede here described , is the male of ibla cumingii .
[ 48 ] it deserves notice , that in the class crustacea , both in the <unk> and in the cirripedia , the males more closely resemble the larvæ , than do the females ; whereas amongst insects , as in the case of the <unk> in coleoptera , and of certain nocturnal lepidoptera , it is the female which retains an embryonic character , being <unk> or <unk> , without wings .
but in all these cases , the male is more locomotive than the female .
if we look for analogies to the facts here given , we shall find them in the <unk> already alluded to , but in these the males are not permanently attached to the females , only cling , i believe , to them voluntarily .
the extraordinary case of the <unk> , originally described as a worm parasitic on certain <unk> , but now shown by <unk> to be the male of the species to which it is attached , is perhaps more strictly parallel .
so again in the <unk> worm , the <unk> <unk> the sexes cohere , but are essentially distinct : " this singular species , however , " according to professor <name> , [ 49 ] " offers the transitional grade to that still more extraordinary <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , in which the male is <unk> blended by its caudal extremity with the female , immediately anterior to the <unk> aperture of the <unk> .
by this union a kind of hermaphroditism is produced ; but the male apparatus is furnished with its own peculiar <unk> system ; and an individual animal is constituted distinct in every respect , save in its terminal <unk> with the body of the female .
this condition of animal life , which was conceived by <name> as within the circle of physiological possibilities , has hitherto been exemplified only in the single species of <unk> , the discovery of the true nature of which , is due to the sagacity and patient research of dr. c. th .
<name> <unk> . "
in ibla , the males and females are not <unk> united , but only permanently and <unk> attached to each other .
we have in this genus the additional <unk> of occasionally two males parasitic on one female .
[ 49 ] <unk> of anatomy and physiology , p. 142 .
i have used the term parasitic , which perhaps ought strictly to be confined to cases where one creature derives its nutriment from another , inasmuch as the male is invariably and permanently attached to and imbedded in the female ,  from its being protected by her capitulum , so that its own capitulum is not developed  and from its feeding on minute animals <unk> her sack .
the male ibla must seize its prey , guided probably by its well-developed olfactory organs , through the movement of its long , flexible body , furnished with muscles , and with the mouth seated on the summit .
we have already seen one instance of a cirripede , the anelasma , obtaining its food without the aid of cirri , by means of its probosciformed , flexible mouth .
the eye can serve only to announce to the male when the female opens her valves , allowing occasionally some minute prey to enter .
in ordinary cirripedes the penis is long , articulated , and capable of varied movements , i presume for the purpose of <unk> each separate <unk> : the male ibla has no such organ ; and no doubt the whole body , furnished like the penis with longitudinal and transverse muscles , serves the same purpose !
i may remark , that it seems surprising that so small a male should secrete sufficient <unk> to <unk> the ova of the female , but the ova are not nearly so numerous in ibla as in most genera of cirripedes ; and the smallness of the males in some parasitic crustacea has already been alluded to .
the male must always be younger than the female , for the latter must first grow large enough for the larva of the male to crawl into her sack .
whether the male lives as long as the female i know not , but he certainly lives for a considerable period and increases in size , as shown by the depth to which the end of the peduncle is imbedded .
moreover we shall see , under the next species , that the male is metamorphosed from a larva , not one sixth of its own size .
in the male ibla , abortion has been carried to an extraordinary and , i should think , almost unparalleled extent .
of the twenty-one segments believed to be normally present in every crustacean , or of the seventeen known to be present in cirripedes , the three anterior segments are here well developed , forming the peduncle : the mouth consists as usual of three small segments : the succeeding eight segments are represented by the rudimentary and functionless thorax , supporting only two pair of distorted , rudimentary and functionless cirri : the seven segments of the abdomen have disappeared , with the exception of the excessively minute caudal appendages ; so that , of the twenty-one normal segments , fifteen are more or less aborted .
the state of the cirri is curious , and may be compared to that of the anthers in a <unk> flower ; for they are not simply rudimentary in size and function , but they are monstrous , and generally do not even correspond on opposite sides of the same individual .
as males in other classes of the animal kingdom often retain some female characters , so here ( though the case is not strictly analogous [ 50 ] ) the male possesses the <unk> apparatus , which <unk> is part of an ovarian tube modified .
[ 50 ] certain plants offer a closer , though not perfect , analogy .
thus , in the florets of some <unk> flowers , the pistil , besides its proper female functional end , serves to brush the pollen off the anthers ; while , in the florets of some other <unk> ( see the account of <unk> in <unk> .
k. sprengel das <unk> <unk> der natur ' ) , the pistil is functionless for its proper end , the flower being exclusively male , but its style is developed , and still serves as a brush .
so in the male ibla , part of the ovaria , in a modified condition , is still present , and serves as a <unk> apparatus .
the individuals in every other genus ( with the exception of scalpellum ) , in the several families , in the three orders of cirripedia , are hermaphrodite or <unk> .
why , then , is ibla unisexual ; yet , becoming , in the most paradoxical manner , from its earliest youth , essentially <unk> ?
would food have been deficient , and was the seizure of infusoria by another and differently constructed individual , necessary for the support of the male and female organs ?
the orifice of the sack of the female is unusually narrow ; would the presence of testes and vesiculæ seminales have rendered her thorax and prosoma <unk> thick ?
seeing the analogous facts in the six , <unk> species of the allied genus scalpellum , i infer there must be some <unk> and more mysterious final cause .

hermaphrodite .
all the external parts so closely resemble those of i .
cumingii , that it would be superfluous to describe more than the few points of difference .
the horny substance of both scuta and terga is uniformly yellow ; though in <unk> specimens , from the underlying corium being seen through the valves , these generally have a tinge of blue .
the scuta , viewed internally , are less elongated transversely ; they have their basal margins slightly more hollowed out , and the fold on the upper free and <unk> portion rather deeper .
the terga , viewed internally , have the apex of the growing or <unk> surface higher relatively to the scuta than in i .
cumingii ; and the basal <name> is much broader , owing to the lower carinal margin being much more protuberant than the scutal margin .
the spines on the peduncle are all yellowish-brown , and are rather longer than in i .
cumingii .
i observed in three or four specimens , that the lowest part of the peduncle had become internally filled up with the usual , brown , transparent , laminated cement , cone within cone , so that this lower part was rendered rigid and <unk> ; this latter effect , i apprehend , is the object gained by the formation of cement within the peduncle , of which i have not observed any other instance .
the entire length of the largest specimen was one inch ; some other specimens were only half this size .
the thorax and prosoma are of the same shape as in i .
cumingii , and in the largest specimen , about one tenth of an inch square ; the prosoma , as in that species , is hairy .
in the mouth , all the parts are closely similar to those of i .
cumingii , but one third larger ; the crest of the labrum is a little roughened with minute points : the palpi are <unk> and <unk> at their extremities : the mandibles have their second and third teeth nearly equal in size to the first , and they do not appear pectinated : the maxillæ have their spinose edge very nearly straight : the outer maxillæ are pointed .
the olfactory orifices are similarly situated , and of similar shape ; they are dark coloured .
cirri.  these also are similar to those of i .
cumingii ; the segments , however , of the three posterior cirri have each four pair of spines , placed very close together in a transverse direction .
first cirrus has its two rami unequal in length by about six segments .
the anterior rami of the second and third cirri are thicker , and more thickly clothed with spines , than the posterior rami , to perhaps a greater degree than in i .
cumingii .
in the posterior cirri , the upper segments of the pedicels are nearly as long as the lower segments .
caudal appendages , four times as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , and three fourths of the length of the rami of this same cirrus : segments thirty-two in number , and therefore as many as those forming the sixth cirrus : the upper segments are much thinner and longer than the basal segments ; each furnished with a circle of short bristles ; whole appendage excessively thin and tapering : the two closely approximate .
<unk>  from some <unk> <unk> specimens in mr. <unk> possession , it appears that the sack , cirri and trophi , were dark blue , as in i .
cumingii ; after being long kept in spirits , these parts become brown .
generative system.  the penis ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) is very singular in structure ; it is of the ordinary length , but of small diameter ; it tapers but little ; it consists of a <unk> articulated , and a fixed <unk> portion ; this latter is smooth , much flattened , not divided into segments , and projects straight out under the caudal appendages ; it is about one third of the length of the entire penis ; it corresponds with a part present in all cirripedes , but here surprisingly elongated .
the articulated portion consists of separate segments , twenty in number , quite as distinct as those of the cirri ; each one is oblong , being longer by about a third part than broad ; each has a few short bristles round its upper margin ; the terminal segment has a circular brush of bristles .
the vesiculæ seminales are easily seen , though they are narrow ; they are slightly tortuous ; they enter the prosoma , and lie on each side of the stomach ; their outer case has a ringed structure , but is not fibrous ; the contents in the best specimen consisted of a mass of spermatozoa , which i saw with perfect distinctness .
the testes are unusually large and <unk> .
ova , spherical , <unk> of an inch in diameter , united as usual into two ovigerous lamellæ .
the ovigerous fræna are extraordinarily small , and might be very easily overlooked ; their length , in a full-sized specimen , was only <unk> of an inch , and they projected only <unk> from the inner surface of the sack .
the glands on their margin , to which the lamellæ adhere , are pointed oval , with an extremely short footstalk , and that rather thick ; the entire length of gland and footstalk , being only <unk> of an inch .
the larvæ , in their first stage of development , offer the usual characters , and closely resemble those of scalpellum ; the probosciformed mouth , however , is remarkably prominent , and the limbs unusually thick .
affinities.  this species most closely resembles i .
cumingii , and can not be distinguished externally , except by the absence of the blue colour on the marginal and interior portions of the valves ; and this can hardly be ascertained without separating and cleaning them , owing to the <unk> of the underlying corium .
internally some slight differences may be perceived in the form of the valves .
considering these so slight differences , it is highly remarkable that this species should be hermaphrodite , whilst i .
cumingii is unisexual .
there is a greater , though still slight , difference in the included animal 's body ; the palpi in i .
quadrivalvis are <unk> , the mandibles smoother , the olfactory orifices <unk> ; the rami of the first cirrus more unequal , the spines more numerous on the segments of the posterior cirri , and lastly and most conspicuously , the caudal appendages are very much longer relatively to the length of the sixth cirrus , than in ibla cumingii .
complemental male .
i have examined one specimen of the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , preserved in spirits from kangaroo island , and one dry from <name> , both places in south australia , and four from an unknown locality , purchased from mr. sowerby ; and within five out of these six specimens , males were attached .
in one of them , two males of different ages were included , one adhering to the peduncle of the other : in i .
cumingii , also , it may be remembered , there was a case of two males parasitic on one female .
i may add that i opened another quite young specimen , from <name> , not counted with the above , and it was without a male .
the males in the five specimens were attached low down , at the rostral end , almost in a horizontal position , stretching across the bottom of the sack ; one of them , however , was placed considerably on one side .
one individual which i measured , was <unk> of an inch in length , and <unk> in width in the widest part , namely , about half down the peduncle .
i may state , for the sake of comparison , that the hermaphrodite to which this individual was attached , was , including the peduncle and capitulum , one inch in length , that is , six times as long as the male , and one fifth of an inch in width , that is , four times as wide .
the above measurements show that the male of this species is rather more than twice as large as that of i .
cumingii .
in consequence of this greater size , i dissected , with the utmost care , the one specimen which was excellently preserved in spirits , and found every part , with a few exceptions , so exactly the same as in the male of i .
cumingii , only larger and more conspicuous , that it <name> be sufficient to indicate the few points of difference .
the most conspicuous difference is , that the oblique fold separating the thorax and peduncle is more plainly developed , projecting at the point corresponding to h in fig .
1 , pl .
v , <unk> of an inch ; in the middle the fold is notched ; it can be traced more easily than in i .
cumingii , running beneath and parallel to the basal edge of the mouth , to the ventral margin of the body .
in the mouth there is hardly any difference ; the maxillæ , however , have two notches even plainer than in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , or than in the male i .
cumingii , but the depth of such notches is always a variable character ; there are also more spines on the edge in the male of the present species , than in i .
cumingii .
both mandibles and maxillæ in the male i .
quadrivalvis , are larger than in the male i .
cumingii , to a greater degree than the larger proportional size of the body in the former <name> account for ; and this , likewise , is the case with these same organs in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis compared with the female i .
cumingii .
the tubular olfactory orifices are situated in the same peculiar position as in the hermaphrodite , and as in both sexes of i .
cumingii : they are <unk> of an inch in diameter , and about as thick as one of the lower segments in the rami of the sixth cirrus .
the thorax , as in the male of i .
cumingii , is quite rudimentary , and serves as a mere flap to protect the mouth .
in the three specimens carefully examined , the posterior cirri had each only one ramus , whilst the anterior cirri generally had two : in one specimen , one of the rami in the anterior cirrus was formed of five segments , and the other ramus of three segments , both rami being supported on a <unk> pedicel ; but on the opposite side of the same individual , the anterior cirrus was represented by a mere knob .
the longer ramus of the anterior cirrus , in the <unk> individual , barely exceeded in length the mandibles measured along the line of the teeth !
in one specimen between the bases of the posterior cirri , there were two perfectly distinct caudal appendages ; these , like the cirri , are in a quite rudimentary condition ; one was <unk> of an inch in length , and consisted of three segments , the upper edges of which had short spines ; the other was shorter , <unk> , but spinose .
in a second specimen , these appendages were quite aborted .
close under them , on the inside or towards the mouth , ( that is , in the normal position , ) there was a rudimentary but quite distinct penis , with the apex projecting freely , and with the sides distinguishable from the ventral surface of the thorax , for the length of <unk> of an inch : the corium lining this little penis made the terminal orifice plainly visible .
the vesiculæ seminales lie in the usual position , and are conspicuous ; they are slightly tortuous , with their ends blunt : in the specimen so well preserved in spirits , they were filled with a mass of spermatozoa , perfectly distinct ; and the whole cavity of the body was lined with globular and pear-shaped testes .
assuredly there was no vestige of ovarian tubes .
from the greater size and excellent preservation of this specimen , which rendered the examination of the generative system so easy , i was able to examine the contents of the stomach , in which i found the delicate <unk> coat , separated as usual , and containing cellular matter , on which the animal had preyed , but the nature of which i was unable to make out .
the anus was much plainer than in the male of i .
cumingii .
i saw the eye distinctly .
i could not distinguish the orifices of the acoustic ( ? )
sacks ; and i think i should have seen them , if they had existed .
prehensile <unk>  i examined these in the larvæ presently to be mentioned , and therefore they were in better condition than in the mature animal when cemented .
their total length , measured along the outside , from the basal articulation to the end of the disc , is <unk> or <unk> of an inch  that is , one third longer than in i .
cumingii ; whilst the hoof-like disc itself is <unk> , or only <unk> of an inch longer than this same part in i .
cumingii : the apex of the disc is downy , or bears some excessively minute spines .
the ultimate segment has its end irregularly rounded , with the spines obscurely divided into two groups , the outer group consisting of two or three longer and thinner spines , and the inner group of , as i believe , five rather shorter spines : the longer spines equal in length the whole ultimate segment .
i could not perceive that they were plumose , as in many other genera .
a single , rather thicker and long spine , pointing backwards , is attached to the under side of the disc , nearly opposite to the point where the ultimate segment is articulated on the upper convex surface .
another single , curved spine is attached on the outer side of the basal segment , near its distal end .
development of the <unk>  in the specimen before alluded to , which included two males , one of these was only the <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore between one fifth and one sixth of the size of the mature male .
it had , probably , undergone only one exuviation since its metamorphosis , for the larva is nearly as long , namely , <unk> of an inch .
in this young male , the mouth formed one third of the entire length : it was attached , not as in every other case to the sack of the hermaphrodite , but low down to the peduncle of the other male .
in the sack with these two males , there were certainly four , i believe five , larvæ , which in every main point of structure resembled the larvæ of other pedunculated cirripedes .
from the peculiar form of their prehensile antennæ , differing in no respect , except in the proportional lengths of the segments , from the same organ in the male i .
cumingii , i can feel no doubt that these were the larvæ of the male i .
quadrivalvis ;  for a moment 's reflection <name> show how excessively improbable it is , that several larvæ of some other cirripede , and that a cirripede intimately allied to the parasitic male ibla , should have forced themselves , without any apparent object , into the sack of the hermaphrodite ibla .
the larvæ , though not yet attached , were on the point of attachment , so that the single eye of the mature animal could be distinctly seen , lying near to the two great compound eyes of the larva .
we have also just seen , that one male quite recently here had undergone its metamorphosis .
the larvæ are <unk> of an inch in length , and rather more than <unk> in width in the widest part : they are <unk> , the dorsal edge forming the keel of the boat ; the anterior end is only a little <unk> than the posterior end ; the <unk> carapace is smooth .
all the essential points of structure in the larvæ of other cirripedes at this stage , could be distinctly here seen ,  such as the two compound eyes , with the <unk> to which they are attached , and the two oblong sternal plates whence the <unk> spring ,  the adductor muscle ,  the six natatory legs , with long plumose spines ,  the abdomen , with its three small segments and the caudal appendages ,  the prehensile antennæ already described ,  and , lastly , the two little ( auditory ? )
sacks at the <unk> edges of the carapace , but not so near the anterior extremity as in lepas .
the four or five larvæ , after having undergone in the open sea the several preparatory metamorphoses common to the class , must have voluntarily entered the sack of the hermaphrodite : ultimately would they , on finding two males already attached there , have retired , and sought another individual less well provided ; or would they all have remained , and so formed a <unk> establishment , such as we shall presently see occurs sometimes in scalpellum ?
this must remain quite uncertain .
in this same hermaphrodite specimen of i .
quadrivalvis , the two ovigerous lamellæ contained some hundreds of larvæ in the first stage of development , which were liberated from their enveloping membranes by a touch of a needle : they were about the <unk> of an inch in length , and presented all the usual characters of larvæ at this period .
what a truly wonderful assemblage of beings of the same species , but how marvellously unlike in appearance , did this individual hermaphrodite present !
we have the numerous , almost globular larvæ , with lateral horns to their <unk> , with their three pair of legs , single eye , probosciformed mouth and long tail :  we have the somewhat larger larvæ in the last stage of development , much compressed , <unk> , with their two great compound eyes , curious prehensile antennæ , closed rudimentary mouth and six natatory legs so different from those in the first stage :  we have the two attached males , with their bodies reduced almost to a mouth placed on the summit of a peduncle , with a minute , apparently single eye shining through the integuments , without any carapace or capitulum , and with the thorax as well as the legs or cirri rudimentary and functionless :  lastly , we have the hermaphrodite , with all its complicated organisation , its thorax supporting six pairs of <unk> <unk> cirri , and its well-developed capitulum furnished with horny valves , surrounding this wonderful assemblage of beings .
unquestionably , without a rigid examination , these four forms would have been ranked in different families , if not orders , of the articulated kingdom .
concluding remarks.  if the creature which i have considered as the male of ibla cumingii be really so , and the evidence formerly given seems to me amply conclusive , then the animal just described , from its close affinity in every point of structure with the former , assuredly is the male of ibla quadrivalvis .
but feeling strongly how improbable it is , that an additional or complemental male should be associated with an hermaphrodite , i <name> make a few remarks on the only possible hypothesis , if my view be rejected ,  namely , that the two parasites considered by me to be exclusively males , are not so , but are independent hermaphrodite cirripedes , the female organs and ova ( which , if present , would have been nearly mature , judging from the presence of spermatozoa in both species ) having been overlooked by me in every specimen : and again , that in the animal described as the female i .
cumingii , i have , though minutely <unk> several specimens , and finding far smaller parts , such as the organs of sense and nervous system , entirely overlooked all the conspicuous male organs , though when i came to i .
quadrivalvis , and naturally expected to find it likewise exclusively female , a single glance showed me the great probosciformed penis , and by the simplest dissection the vesiculæ seminales and testes were exhibited .
such an oversight is scarcely credible ; but even if assumed , we have to believe in the extraordinary circumstance of the two parasites being species of an independent genus , not only the very next in alliance to the animals to which they are attached , but in certain most important points , namely , the organs of the mouth , actually deserving a place in the very same genus .
moreover , the two parasites differ from each other , not only in about the same slight degree , but in a corresponding manner , as do the two <unk> to which they are attached ; thus the mouths of ibla quadrivalvis and i .
cumingii are closely similar , ( the difference being barely of specific value , ) so are the mouths of the two parasites ; but the parts are larger in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , than in i .
cumingii , so are they in the parasites .
again , the most conspicuous character in i .
quadrivalvis , is the number of segments in the caudal appendages , far exceeding those in the other species of ibla , as well as of every other pedunculated cirripede , and the parasite of this species has articulated spinose appendages , far larger than the barely visible , <unk> pair in i .
cumingii .
considering the whole case , there seems no room to doubt the <unk> of the conclusion arrived at , under the former as well as under the present species , namely , that these little parasites are the males of the two species of ibla to which they are attached ;  wonderful though the fact be , that in one case , the male should pair with an hermaphrodite already provided with efficient male organs .
it is to bring this fact <unk> forward , that i have called such males , complemental males ; as they seem to form the complement to the male organs in the hermaphrodite .
we look in vain for any , as yet known , analogous facts in the animal kingdom .
in the genus scalpellum , however , next in alliance to ibla , in which , consequently , if anywhere , we might expect to find such facts , they occur ; and until these are fully considered , i <name> the conclusions here arrived at , <name> not be summarily rejected .
although the existence of hermaphrodites and males within the limits of the same species , is a new fact amongst animals , it is far from rare in the vegetable kingdom : the male flowers , moreover , are sometimes in a rudimentary condition compared to the hermaphrodite flowers , exactly in the same manner as are the male <unk> .
if the final cause of the existence of these complemental males be asked , no certain answer can be given ; the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite of ibla quadrivalvis , appeared to be of small diameter ; but on the other hand , the ova to be impregnated are fewer than in most cirripedes .
no explanation , as we have seen , can be given of the much simpler case of the mere separation of the sexes in ibla cumingii : nor can any explanation , i believe , be given of the much more varied arrangement of the parts of <unk> in plants of the linnean class , <unk> .

and <unk> . )
valves 12 to 15 in number : latera of the lower whorl , four or six , with their lines of growth generally directed towards each other : sub-rostrum very rarely present : peduncle <unk> , most rarely naked .
filamentary appendages , none : labrum , with the upper part highly bullate : trophi , various : olfactory orifices , more or less prominent : caudal appendages , <unk> and spinose , or none .
males , parasitic at or near the orifice of the sack of the female or of the hermaphrodite : thorax enclosed within a capitulum , furnished with three or four rudimentary valves , or with six perfect valves : peduncle either short and distinct , or confounded with the capitulum : sometimes mouth and stomach absent , and cirri <unk> ; sometimes mouth and cirri normal .
generally attached to horny corallines , in the warmer temperate seas over the whole world .
i have felt much doubt in limiting this genus : the six recent species which it contains , differ more from each other than do the species in the previous genera .
mr. gray has proposed or adopted generic names for four of the species , and a fifth certainly has equal claims to this same rank .
these genera have been founded almost exclusively on the number of the valves ; and oddly enough , the <name> have generally been given wrongly , namely , in scalpellum , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
scalpellum blends through s .
villosum into pollicipes ; and this latter genus has an equal right with scalpellum , to be divided into sub-genera , three in number .
hence , no less than eight genera might be made out of the twelve recent species of scalpellum and pollicipes , and their formation , in some degree , be justified ; but , in my opinion , this inordinate multiplication of genera destroys the main advantages of classification .
at one time , i even thought that it would be best to follow lamarck , and keep the twelve recent species in one genus ; but considering the number of fossil species , i believe the more prudent course has been followed , in retaining the two genera scalpellum and pollicipes ; more especially as i can hardly doubt , that several other species <name> be hereafter discovered .
having so lately described in the memoirs of the <unk> society , the fossil species , i <name> not here further allude to them , than to state , that out of the fifteen species therein described , s .
<unk> comes very close to the recent s .
vulgare , and that several eocene and cretaceous species , such as s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , and s .
maximum , are allied to s .
rutilum and s .
ornatum .
scalpellum villosum , a recent species , has stronger claims than any other species to be <unk> separated ; and its habits , in not being attached to horny corallines , are also different , but the identity of its complemental male with that of s .
peronii , and its numerous points of resemblance in structure with the other species , have determined me not to separate it .
scalpellum peronii , villosum , and rostratum , in having a sub-carina ,  in the rostrum being pretty well developed ,  and in the complemental male being pedunculated , and furnished with a functional mouth and prehensile cirri , may be separated from s .
vulgare , ornatum and rutilum ; but even between these two little groups , s .
rostratum is in some respects intermediate , namely , in having three pairs of latera , and more especially in the rudimentary condition of the valves of its complemental male , and in the position in which the male is attached to the hermaphrodite .
the three species in the second little group , namely , s .
vulgare , s .
ornatum , and s .
rutilum , are more nearly allied to each other in all their characters , especially in the characters drawn from their males , than are the other three species .
s .
ornatum and s .
rutilum are considerably nearer to each other than any other two of the species .
upon the whole i conclude that the six species must be thrown either into five or into four genera ( the first three species making one genus ) , or all into one genus , and this latter has appeared to me the preferable course .
the separation even of scalpellum and pollicipes , as already stated , is hardly natural .
the fact of these genera having existed from a remote epoch , and having given rise during successive periods to many species now extinct , is probably the cause that the few remaining species are so much more distinct from each other , than is common in the other genera of lepadidæ .
whenever the structure of the whole capitulum in the fossil species is well known , and as soon as more species , recent and fossil , shall have been discovered , then probably the genus scalpellum <name> have to be divided into several smaller genera .
<unk>  the capitulum is much compressed , and generally produced upwards ; it is formed of from twelve to fifteen valves , which are rather thin , and with the exception of s .
ornatum , almost entirely covered by membrane , bearing spines : the valves are seldom locked very closely together .
a sub-rostrum exists only in s .
villosum , which species leads on to pollicipes ; in s .
vulgare the rostrum is rudimentary and hidden .
the scuta , terga and <name> , are much larger than the other valves : these five valves seem to differ essentially from the others in being at first developed under the form of the so-called primordial valves : the other valves commence by a small indistinct brown spot , very different from the hexagonal tissue of the primordial valves : i saw this very clearly in young specimens of s .
vulgare .
at first , the scuta , terga and <name> , grow exclusively downwards ( and permanently so in most fossil species ) , and therefore the growth of the scuta and <name> is in an absolutely opposite direction to what it is in lepas , pæcilasma and dichelaspis .
after a short period the scuta are added to at their upper ends ; the portion thus added , stands at a rather lower level , and projects in a rather different direction from the <unk> part of the valve , giving to it , in some respects , the appearance of having been broken and mended .
this structure is common to s .
vulgare , s .
rostratum and s .
peronii .
the upper latera ( except in s .
villosum ) grow in the same manner , namely , at first exclusively downwards , and then both upwards and downwards .
the rostral and carinal latera ( with the same exception of s .
villosum ) have their umbones seated laterally , at opposite ends of the capitulum ,  the umbones of the rostral latera being close to the rostrum , and those of the carinal pair close to the <name> , and consequently their chief growth is directed towards each other .
the <name> in all the species , except s .
villosum , is either bowed or <unk> bent ; in the latter case the lower half is parallel to the peduncle , and the upper half , extending far up between the terga , is parallel to their longer axes .
in some of the species the <name> is added to almost equally at both ends ; in s .
ornatum it grows but little at the upper end , and to a varying degree in different individuals according to their age ; in s .
rutilum the umbo is at the apex , and there is consequently no upward growth ; lastly , in s .
villosum the <name> widening much from the apex to the basal margin , grows exclusively downwards , and a portion of the apex projects freely ,  characters all common to the <name> in the genus pollicipes .
the upper latera occur in all the species ; in the lower whorl there are either two or three pair of latera , in the former case the infra-median pair being absent .
the latera differ considerably in shape in the different species .
the peduncle is generally rather short , and , with the exception of s .
peronii , is covered with calcified scales .
these scales are generally small , and placed symmetrically in close whorls , in an <unk> order , with each scale corresponding to the interspace between two scales in the whorls above and below .
in s .
ornatum , the scales are so wide , transversely , that there are only four in each whorl .
in s .
villosum , the scales are <unk> and arranged somewhat irregularly in transverse rows , not very near to each other .
new calcareous scales originate only round the top of the peduncle , and they continue to grow only in the few upper whorls ; and as the peduncle itself continues to increase in diameter by the formation of new inner membranous layers and the disintegration of the old outer layers , the calcareous scales come in the lower part of the peduncle to stand further and further apart .
in the earliest stage of growth there are no calcareous scales on the peduncle in s .
vulgare ; they first appear under the <name> .
spines are articulated in great <name> on the surface of the peduncle in s .
vulgare , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , and very short ones on that of s .
rostratum .
<unk>  all the species , except s .
villosum , are attached to horny corallines : the singular means of attachment in s .
vulgare <name> be described under that species , and is probably common to several of the other species .
the larva in most , or in all cases , when it proceeds to attach itself , clings head downwards to the branch , and hence the capitulum comes to be placed upwards , with its orifice fronting the branch and the <name> outwards .
the sucking disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva , in the five species examined , was a little pointed , and in shape resembled the hinder hoof of a mule : this may perhaps be accounted for by the narrowness of the branches of the corallines , to which it has to adhere : a large circular disc , as in lepas , would have been worse than useless : the ultimate segment in most or all the species , has on its inner side ( the segment being supposed to be extended straight forward ) a notch or step , bearing , i believe , two spines .
size and <unk>  some of the species attain a medium size , others are small .
the valves are generally clouded red or pink , but sometimes white .
mouth.  the various parts vary far more than in any genus hitherto described .
the labrum is highly bullate , with the upper part forming a rounded overhanging projection , and with the lower part much produced , so that the mouth is placed far from the adductor scutorum muscle , and consequently the orifice is directed more towards the ventral surface of the thorax than in most other cirripedes : on the crest of the labrum there are some very small teeth in several of the species , but not in all .
the mandibles have either three or four main teeth , generally with either one or two small teeth intermediate between the first and second large teeth , and in the case of s .
peronii , with small teeth between all the larger ones .
the maxillæ have their edges furnished with many spines , and are either straight or have the inferior part prominent and step-formed .
the outer maxillæ have the spines on their inner edges either continuous or divided into two groups , of which latter structure we have not hitherto had any very well characterised example .
the olfactory orifices are either highly or moderately protuberant .
in most of the species the prosoma is little developed , and the first cirrus is placed far from the second .
the cirri are generally but little curled , and have elongated segments , with long , generally serrated spines : the first cirrus varies in proportional length ; the second and third cirri have both their rami more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri , the spines being generally arranged in three or four longitudinal rows : the cirri , however , of s .
villosum in all respects resemble closely the cirri of pollicipes sertus and p .
spinosus .
the caudal appendages are <unk> , small , and clothed with spines : in s .
villosum , however , differently from in all other allied forms , there are no appendages .
the stomach , in those species which i opened , is destitute of cæca .
there are no filamentary appendages .
generative system. the ova are nearly spherical , and remarkably large , as was stated to be the case in the introductory discussion , in which the larva of s .
vulgare , in the first stage of development , was described : the ovigerous fræna are small .
the testes are large , but the vesiculæ seminales in some of the species extraordinarily small .
scalpellum ornatum , and perhaps s .
rutilum , are unisexual ; the other species are hermaphrodite , but most or at least some of the individuals , are furnished with complemental males .
these latter are fully described under each species , so i <name> here only remark , that s .
ornatum , which alone ( excepting perhaps s .
rutilum ) is unisexual , has less claim than the other species to be <unk> separated : we have seen also , in ibla , that similar sexual differences occur in two most closely allied species .
it is very singular how much more some of the males and complemental males in scalpellum differ from each other , than do the female and hermaphrodite forms ; this seems due to the different stages of embryonic development at which the males have been arrested .
in the males , however , of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , compared one with another , but not with the males of the other species , the parts of the mouth and apparently the cirri , resemble each other more closely , than do the same organs in the hermaphrodites .
at the end of this genus i shall give a summary on the highly remarkable sexual relations both in scalpellum and ibla .
<unk>  the species seem distributed over the whole world , but as far as we can trust our present scanty materials , are most common in the warmer temperate regions .
the s .
vulgare ranges from the norwegian seas to naples .
most of the species are inhabitants of deep water .
affinities.  in the preliminary remarks , we have seen how this genus blends into pollicipes ; and under the head of <unk> , i have shown its close affinity to that genus .
if , indeed , we take pollicipes spinosus , and destroy all but six of the already minute and almost rudimentary latera , we shall , as far as the capitulum is concerned , convert it into a scalpellum , closely similar to s .
villosum .
if we take any species of scalpellum , ( excepting s .
villosum and s .
rutilum , ) and destroy all the valves , but the scuta , terga and <name> , we shall convert it into an <unk> .
lastly , i have shown under ibla , that in several most remarkable peculiarities of structure , there is a manifest affinity between scalpellum and that genus .
geological <unk>  full details on this subject have been given in the memoirs of the <unk> society .
i <name> here only state , that the oldest known form of scalpellum occurs in the lower green sand .

capitulum with 14 valves , including the rudimentary rostrum : upper latera irregularly oval .
mandibles , with four or five teeth : maxillæ , with the edge straight , bearing numerous spines .
complemental male <unk> , with four rudimentary valves ; no mouth ; cirri not prehensile ; attached to the occludent margin of the scutum , near the umbo .
great britain , ireland , <name> , norway , naples .
attached to horny corallines , at from twenty to thirty , sometimes even to fifty fathoms in depth , according to forbes and <unk> .
hermaphrodite .
<unk>  capitulum much flattened with the apex produced , of a pale brown colour , sometimes faintly tinted purple , composed of 14 valves , of which the rostrum is rudimentary and barely visible externally ; valves thin , white , translucent , smooth , slightly marked by the lines of growth , separated from each other by rather wide interspaces of colourless membrane , which is thickly clothed by small , articulated spines of unequal length .
the valves , excepting sometimes their umbones , are also covered with membrane , bearing spines , placed in rows parallel to the lines of growth ; the spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack .
scuta slightly convex , thrice as long as broad ; upper part much acuminated ; occludent margin almost straight ; basal margin nearly at right angles to the occludent margin ; the tergal margin is separated from the lateral margin by an <name> more or less prominent ; a slight curved ridge runs from the umbo to this <name> , and this deserves especial notice , inasmuch as it indicates the outline which the valve assumed in its earliest growth , and which is permanently retained in most of the older fossil species .
along the occludent margin , there is a trace of a ledge , developed in a variable degree , and which is noticed only on account of the plainly visible ledge along this same margin , in the allied genus <unk> .
the umbo , or centre of <unk> , is seated close to the occludent margin , and at about one fourth of the length of the valve from the apex .
internally , ( fig .
15 , a´ , pl .
v , ) the part above the umbo is flat ; and beneath this upper part , there is a large rounded hollow ( d ) for the adductor muscle : a fold or indentation ( a ) running downwards from the umbo , extends in a very oblique line across the occludent margin .
this fold is of high interest as giving <unk> to the complemental males , and <name> hereafter often be referred to .
terga , triangular , flat ; occludent margin , very slightly arched .
<name> much bent , with the umbo placed at barely one third of the entire length of the valve from the apex .
two very slight ridges can be perceived , one on each side , running from the umbo to the basal margin , and separating the roof from the <unk> of the valve ; these ridges are of great use in distinguishing the fossil carinæ of scalpellum , from the carinæ of pollicipes .
the part above the umbo is formed by the upward production of a marginal slip along each side of the valve , which slips in the fossil species ( c in the woodcut , fig .
1 , given in the introduction , ) i have designated as the <unk> .
the lower part of the valve gradually widens from the umbo downwards ; internally , the whole is deeply concave , and continuously curved .
the <name> varies at which the upper and lower portions externally meet each other ; but is never less than <unk> .
the upper part of the <name> runs up between the terga for three-quarters of their length ; the basal margin does not extend down low enough to pass between the carinal latera .
rostrum , ( fig .
15 b´ , seen externally , and highly magnified , ) minute , almost hidden by the enveloping membrane and by the small prominent umbones of the rostral latera ; in area equalling about one fourth of the rostral latera ; externally pyramidal , with the upper side rather longer than the lower ; internally slightly concave , square , with the upper margin and sometimes with the lower margin , slightly hollowed out .
umbo of growth nearly central .
upper latera , flat , irregularly oval , with an almost rectangular shoulder under the basal <name> of the terga ; in area , about one third larger than the largest valve of the lower whorl ; the exact degree of elongation of the oval figure varies a little .
umbo seated a little above the central point .
lower whorl ,  rostral latera , nearly twice as long as broad , lying under the basal margins of the scuta : umbo seated over the rostrum ; opposite end , towards which the valve widens either sensibly or but little , is either square or rounded ; in area , less than any of the other valves , excepting the rostrum ; in breadth , equalling either half or one third of the height of the infra-median latera ; growth , directed chiefly towards the infra-median latera .
the <unk> umbo is about one sixth part of the entire length of the valve .
infra-median latera , rather larger than the carinal latera ; their shape varies from elongated <unk> with the angles rounded , to oval , with the longer axis directed upwards .
the umbo is seated a little above the middle of the basal margin , so that there is some little growth downwards , but the main growth is upwards .
the upper point generally stands a little above that of the carinal latera .
carinal latera , flat , less in area than the infra-median latera ; basal margin nearly straight ; carinal margin slightly hollowed out , terminal margin arched and protuberant .
the umbones of the two valves almost touch each other under the middle of the <name> ; main growth towards the infra-median latera and upwards ; umbones projecting not above one fifth of the entire length of the valve .
peduncle , much flattened , rarely as long as the capitulum , with the upper end nearly as wide as it ; the lower end is either blunt , or tapers to a very fine point .
the calcareous scales are transversely elongated , and are about four times as wide as high ; their internal surfaces are slightly concave , and their external , convex ; the two ends are pointed .
viewed internally , the scales approach in shape to <unk> .
there are , in a <unk> specimen , about twenty scales in each whorl , their tips overlapping each other : the whorls are placed not very near each other and at rather unequal distances , except round the uppermost part , where , being in process of formation , they are packed closely together .
the membrane uniting the scales , supports numerous transverse rows of articulated spines , varying from <unk> to <unk> of an inch in length , and each furnished with a long sinuous <unk> , <unk> of an inch in diameter , running through the membrane to the underlying corium .
<unk>  specimens are attached to various horny corallines , and occasionally to the peduncles of each other .
[ 51 ] in both cases , supposing the coralline to be erect , the capitulum is placed upwards , with its orifice towards the branch to which it is attached , and consequently with its <name> outwards .
where several are crowded in a group , their peduncles often become twisted and their positions irregular , with their orifices facing in any direction .
this uniform position is simply the consequence of the larva attaching itself <unk> , and from the position of the prehensile antennæ , necessarily with its sternal surface parallel and close to the branch of the coralline ; hence the dorsal surface , which afterwards is converted into the <name> , faces outwards .
the peduncle , as already stated , often tapers , at its basal extremity , to a sharp point .
in very young specimens , for instance in one with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch in length , the method of attachment is the same as in lepas and many other genera , namely , by cement proceeding exclusively from the antennæ of the larva ; but in older and full-grown specimens , instead of the whole bottom of the peduncle becoming flattened and broadly attached , which would be here impossible , the cement is poured out through a straight row of orifices along the rostral edge , thus causing , by an excellent adaptation , a narrow margin to adhere firmly to the thin and cylindrical branches of the coralline .
these orifices are represented , magnified seven times , in pl .
ix , fig .
7 , in which the lower attached portion of the peduncle is split open and exhibited ; they are circular , and stand at regular intervals , in a straight line ; the higher orifices are larger , but further apart from each other than the lower ones ; in one full-grown specimen , i counted ten of these orifices in a length of exactly a quarter of an inch .
at each period of growth , the corium <unk> a little from the attached portion of the peduncle ; of which portion , the greater part is thus left empty and as incapable of further growth , as are the larval antennæ at the extreme point : in the specimen figured , the corium extended a little below the upper orifice .
the prehensile antennæ , however , i must remark , do not strictly rise from the extreme point of the peduncle , but at a little distance from it , on the rostral surface ; this simply ensues from the antennæ in the larva , being situated on the sternal surface , close to , but not actually on the front of the head .
the two cement glands are seated high up on the sides of the peduncle , and remote from each other ; they are small , unusually globular and transparent .
the two cement-ducts ( fig .
7 a a ) proceeding from them , are <unk> of an inch in diameter , and run in a <unk> line ; at the point where they pass through the corium to enter the lower attached portion of the peduncle , they become closely <unk> , and partially imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle .
together they run along the rostral edge , giving out through each orifice a little disc of brownish cement , and finally they enter the larval antennæ .
the peduncle , just above the attached portion , where still lined by corium , no doubt increases in diameter at each period of growth , and must , i presume , become pressed against the almost parallel branch of the coralline .
the corium , at this same period , shrinks , or is absorbed , and the two cement-ducts come in contact with , and adhere to , the inner surface of the outer membrane of the peduncle ; and then , by a process which i do not understand in this or any other cirripede , apertures are formed both in the ducts and through the membrane , so that the cement passes through , firmly fastening the outer surface of the peduncle with its calcareous scales and spines , to the coralline .
[ 51 ] mr. peach , ( transact .
brit .
<unk> , 1845 , p. 65 , ) states that this is sometimes the case in cornwall ; and i have seen a similar instance in a fine group from naples .
the structure of the larval prehensile antennæ <name> be most conveniently described when we come to the complemental male ; and figures ( <unk> , pl .

size and <unk>  montagu states ( <unk> .

the valves in all the specimens are white , and the membrane connecting them either nearly white , or dirty pale yellowish , or <unk> .
within the sack the corium under the valves is tinted pale purple , and two very faint bands of the same colour can generally be distinguished running down the two sides of the peduncle .
body , coloured <unk> , with the upper segments of the pedicels of the cirri , tinted in front with purple .
body , much flattened , the prosoma is very little developed ; the mouth placed far from the adductor muscle , and is directed in a remarkable manner towards the ventral surface of the thorax : the first pair of cirri stands far separated from the second pair .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , forming an overhanging projection equalling the longitudinal axis of the mouth ; basal margin much produced ; crest with a row of bead-like teeth .
palpi rather small , with their external margin straight , and internal margin oblique : the bristles on the two palpi just meet each other .
mandibles , with five or six teeth , with the second , ( or second and third , when there are six teeth , ) smaller than the others ; in two specimens , there were five teeth on one side and six on the other ; inferior <name> rather broad and strongly pectinated .
maxillæ with the edge nearly straight , without any notch , but with the inferior portion very slightly projecting ; there are twelve or thirteen pairs of unequal spines , of which some of the middle ones are rather longer than the others , and almost as long as the two upper great spines .
outer <unk>  on the inner margin the bristles are divided into two separate tufts ; exteriorly , near the base , there is a distinct rounded swelling with bristles .
the olfactory orifices are highly protuberant , approximate , flattened , scarcely tapering towards their upper ends .
cirri.  the five posterior pair are elongated , very little curled , with short pedicels ; their segments are long , not at all protuberant in front , bearing five or six pairs of long , slightly serrated spines , with a very minute tuft of bristles between each pair , and with some short lateral spines on the inner side of each segment ; on the fourth pair of cirri , these lateral spines are considerably developed ; dorsal tufts consist of fine spines , with one much longer than the others .
first pair short , separated by a wide interval from the second ; rami unequal in length , by between two and four segments ; longer ramus having nine segments , scarcely half as long as the rami of the second cirrus ; shorter ramus with seven segments ; in the same individual there were twenty segments in the sixth cirrus .
the segments in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus are oblong in a transverse direction , and may be compared to a set of shields placed transversely and strung together ; in the longer ramus the segments are longitudinally oblong ; in both they are thickly covered with spines .
second cirrus ; the anterior ramus is a little broader than the posterior ramus , with the segments bearing about five rows of bristles ; fifteen segments in the shorter ramus .
third pair , with the two rami equal in thickness , and with the segments differing very little from those of the posterior cirri , excepting that the serrated spines in the external lateral rows are rather larger .
the fourth pair is remarkable by having , on the inner side of the upper edge of each segment , a little tuft of minute smooth spines , flattened , and a little enlarged near their ends , so as to be <unk> ; i could not see these singular spines on the other cirri .
the lower segments of the pedicels of all the cirri , excepting the sixth pair , are remarkable from having their inner edges , in the middle , produced into a considerable , abrupt , rounded projection , irregularly covered with spines .
caudal appendages , ( pl .
x , fig .
21 , ) very small , flattened , of nearly the same width throughout ; in a <unk> specimen , only <unk> of an inch in length ; each bears from ten to twenty small bristles placed distantly from each other , of which those on the rounded apex are the longest .
generative system.  the penis is remarkably acuminated ; the vesiculæ seminales are unusually small , and enter only for a short distance into the prosoma ; the testes are large .
the ovarian tubes are of large diameter ; the ova are nearly spherical and large , namely , <unk> of an inch in diameter ; they are not numerous , and lie in single layers in the two lamellæ .
the ovigerous fræna are well developed , and lie under the scuta ; one i measured was <unk> of an inch in length and <unk> in width ; the margin is obliquely truncated and slightly sinuous .
this species breeds late in the autumn , and even in <unk> ; i have examined a specimen from cornwall with ova containing larvæ , taken on the 26th of october ; again , in another specimen from belfast , sent to me by mr. thompson , taken in <name> , there were ova in the lamellæ , and therefore no doubt impregnated ; and on february the 12th i received from mr. peach , from cornwall , specimens so very young that they must have become attached during the first days of the month .
<unk>  the specimens from near naples , ( which i owe to the kindness of the rev .
f. w. <name> , ) are somewhat larger , and differ slightly from those of britain : they form , i imagine , the s .
<unk> of <unk> .
after carefully examining them internally and externally , i think it is quite impossible to consider them specifically distinct , for although in several specimens , the valves were placed a little further apart from each other ,  the upper latera a little more elongated ,  the carinal latera rather narrower in their upper half ,  the infra-median latera rather more rounded ,  and , lastly , in the scuta , the tergal margin extended almost in the same line with the lateral margin ; nevertheless in other specimens , i could perceive no difference whatever .
it is , however , remarkable that in several full-grown neapolitan specimens there were no complemental males , whereas i have never seen a single full-grown british specimen without such being present .
in some specimens in the british museum , without any given locality , i have observed considerable variation in the breadth of the carinal and rostral latera .

when first <unk> scalpellum vulgare , i was surprised at the almost constant presence of one or more very minute parasites , on the margins of both scuta , close to the umbones : these are represented , but rendered darker and therefore more conspicuous than in nature , in the drawing , pl .
v , fig .
15 , which is three times the natural size .
i carelessly dissected one or two specimens , and concluded that they belonged to some new class or order amongst the articulata ; but did not at that time even conjecture , that they were cirripedes .
many months afterwards , when i had seen in ibla , that an hermaphrodite could have a complemental male , i remembered that i had been surprised at the small size of the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite s .
vulgare , so that i resolved to look with care at these parasites ; on doing so , i soon discovered that they were cirripedes , for i found that they adhered by cement , and were furnished with prehensile antennæ , which latter , i observed with astonishment , agreed in every minute character , and in size , with those of s .
vulgare : the importance of this agreement <name> not at present be fully appreciated .
i also found , that these parasites were destitute of a mouth and stomach ; that consequently they were short-lived , but that they reached maturity ; and that all were males .
subsequently the five other species of the genus scalpellum were found to present more or less closely analogous phenomena .
these facts , together with those given under ibla ( and had it not been for this latter genus , i never probably should have even struck on the right track in my investigation , ) appear sufficient to justify me , in provisionally considering the truly wonderful parasites of the several species of scalpellum , as males and complemental males .
when these parasites are fully described , <name> be the proper time to discuss and weigh the evidence on their sexual relations and nature .
i <name> now describe the parasite of s .
vulgare .
general appearance.  shape , <unk> , compressed ( pl .
v , fig .
9 , magnified 36 times ) , with a short neck : the outline is usually symmetrical , but sometimes is a little distorted on the under side .
the creature is imbedded more than half its length or depth in the transparent , <unk> chitine border of the scutum of the hermaphrodite .
its length , or longer axis , varies from 10 to <unk> ; its breadth , or transverse axis , is 6 to <unk> ; and its thickness , for it is much flattened , is only <unk> of an inch .
on the summit , there is a <unk> orifice ( a ) , the size of which can rarely be made out quite distinctly , owing to the extreme thinness of the membranous edges .
a little way beneath the orifice , there are four little blunt , bristly points ( b ) , generally rather more than the <unk> of an inch in length ; they are rather variable in size , and seem to be of no functional importance ; directly beneath them , there are four little calcareous beads ( as may be known by their dissolving with <unk> in any acid , and breaking easily under the needle ) ; these are the <unk> of an inch in their larger external diameter ; they are rather deeply imbedded in the outer integument , and taper a little downwards ending in a concave terminal point , into which a minute <unk> enters , like those passing into and through the valves of ordinary cirripedia : along the axis of <unk> , they are often <unk> of an inch in length .
these calcareous beads or rudimental valves are seated in pairs , at the two ends of the flattened animal , so that when the animal is laid on one side , the upper bead in each pair exactly covers and hides the lower one .
the outer integument is composed of chitine , as may be inferred from boiling caustic potash having no effect on it ; the upper part is thicker than the imbedded portion and is wrinkled transversely ; it is covered with minute spines <unk> of an inch in length , either single or in groups of two and three , ( pl .
v , fig .
14 . )
this outer tunic is lined by corium , sometimes slightly mottled with dull purple ; and this by delicate , longitudinal , <unk> muscles , running from the base up to the under edge of the orifice ; these longitudinal muscles are crossed , at least , in the upper part , by still finer transverse muscles .
thorax and <unk>  when the external integument is cut open , the thorax ( pl .
v , fig .
13 ) is found lodged within an inner sack or rather tube , extending from near the bottom of the animal , up to the external orifice .
the whole thorax is sometimes forced through the orifice , owing perhaps to the action of the spirits of wine and consequent <unk> , and is thus well displayed without dissection .
the thorax tapers a little , is much flattened and straight ; its length , together with the terminal abdominal lobe , is about <unk> of an inch ; it is formed of very thin , most finely hirsute membrane , transversely wrinkled and so <unk> , that when <unk> by the internal muscles being seized , it stretches to twice its former length ; in this condition , five transverse articulations are displayed .
the abdominal lobe is smooth , and can not be stretched , or turned inside out by pulling the above muscles .
on the thorax , corresponding with the interspaces between the five transverse articulations , there are four pair of short limbs , but their bases , i believe , are prolonged across the inner or ventral surface of the thorax , so as almost to touch each other .
these limbs , i believe , have no articulations , except , perhaps , where united to the thorax .
the anterior or lowest limb , on each side , supports two or sometimes only a single spine ; this pair is rather smaller than the second , and is placed a little more distant from it , than are the upper pairs from each other .
the second pair differs from the upper two , only in having its three spines a very little shorter .
the two upper or posterior pair exactly resemble each other ; each has two spines on the summit , and a third seated lower down , on a little notch on the outer side , but with its point on a level with the others .
the points of the spines of the two upper limbs , stand on a level with the external spines at the end of the abdomen .
all the spines are of excessive tenuity and sharpness ; they are straight , long , and not plumose .
the abdominal lobe is square , and from not being wrinkled , has a different appearance from the thorax : on each of the posterior angles , there are three moderately long , very sharp spines , with the tips of the outer pair bent a little inwards ; in the middle between them , there are two little spines , and a little below and outside these latter , on the ventral surface , there are two other longer spines with their tips bent inwards ; and again , lower down , two other pair , one beneath the other , of short spines .
perhaps , the three pair of spines on the ventral surface , <name> the three segments , which are distinct on the abdomen of the larva in the last stage of its development , in lepas and other genera .
in the same way , it is probable that the lateral spine on the notch in each limb , marks the point where , in the larva , there is an articulation .
altogether , there are seven pairs of spines on the abdomen , and eleven pairs on the thoracic limbs .
a little way beneath the lower or anterior pair of limbs , the thorax is abruptly bent , and becomes confluent with the lower internal parts of the whole animal .
here , the very delicate membrane of chitine which lines the sack or tube , extending from the external orifice , can be seen to be continuous , as in all cirripedes , with the outer tunic of the thorax .
within the thorax , there are some longitudinal muscles , without transverse striæ , which , i believe , enter the short limbs , but not the abdomen , as i infer from the latter not being <unk> when they are pulled .
at their lower ends these muscles terminate abruptly , and from being contracted are often a little enlarged .
they extend a short way beneath the lower pair of limbs , and are , i suspect , attached to the outer integument of the animal , near the base .
after the most careful dissection of very many specimens , and their examination in many different methods ( as by caustic potash , & c. ) , i can venture positively to assert that there is no vestige of a mouth , or <unk> organs , or stomach : i did not see any anus , but i <name> not affirm that such does not exist .
in the upper part of the animal , lying under the superficial muscles , and close beneath the upper line of their attachment , i found in all the specimens , an eye , of a pointed oval form , rather less than <unk> of an inch in diameter , formed of an outer capsule , lined with purple <unk> , and surrounding , as it appeared , a lens .
the eye is not introduced in fig .
9 , for i could not see it , except by dissection , and therefore do not know its exact relative position .
generative system.  the contents of the animal , between the sack containing the thorax and the outer integuments , and directly under the thorax , varied much in condition : in young and lately attached specimens the whole consisted of a pulpy mass with numerous <unk> ; in other specimens , apparently more mature , there were vast <name> of cells , sometimes <unk> in sheets , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , and having <unk> granular centres ; these i believe to be the testes , for in a specimen presently to be mentioned , in which the <unk> <unk> was gorged with spermatozoa , i found adhering to its outside , a mass of cells of exactly the same diameter , but now empty and transparent instead of having brownish centres .
lastly , in several other specimens , at the very bottom of the <unk> animal , there was a brownish , pear-shaped bag , of different sizes in different individuals , and occasionally broader even than the thorax .
this bag contained either pulpy matter , or a great mass of spermatozoa .
before being disturbed , these spermatozoa lay parallel to each other in flocks , and they yielded to the needle in a peculiar manner , so that i found ( having had experience with these bodies in living cirripedia ) i could almost tell before examination under the compound microscope , whether or not i should see spermatozoa .
many had distinct heads , [ 52 ] which were two or three times as broad as the filamentary bodies ; the latter when placed between glass were the <unk> of an inch in diameter .
i compared these spermatozoa with others taken out of the vesiculæ seminales of the individual hermaphrodite s .
vulgare , to which the parasite was attached , and could not perceive the slightest difference in them .
the brownish pear-shaped bag , or <unk> <unk> , the coat of which seems fibrous , could sometimes be distinctly traced , sending a chord or prolongation far up the thorax : at the end of the abdominal lobe , no doubt there is an orifice ; and this , i believe , i once distinguished .
owing to this chord , the bag often adheres to the thorax , when the latter is dissected out of the general integuments ; in this condition , i twice clearly made out that it was single : in one other specimen , however , there appeared to be two small vesiculæ seminales .
by using a condenser and very brilliant light , the outline of the <unk> <unk> could sometimes be distinguished before dissection , at the bottom of the <unk> animal ; and such was the case in the specimen drawn in fig .
9 .
[ 52 ] i do not understand the development of the spermatozoa in cirripedia : in a recent chthamalus and balanus , i found the greater number had a little filament in front of the head or <unk> enlargement , which latter varied in size and in shape from globular to that of a spindle .
the filament before the head , also , varied in proportional length ; it did not project in exactly the same straight line with the hinder part , and some of the spermatozoa were entirely without this filament in front ;  such is the case with the spermatozoa here described .
although i have dissected , at least , thirty specimens , taken at different times of the year , and from different localities , and when many of the specimens were mature and ready for the impregnation of ova , as clearly shown by the presence of innumerable spermatozoa , i have never seen even a trace of an <unk> or ovaria .
antennæ and <unk>  the prehensile antennæ ( pl .
v , fig .
10 ) , are seated a little above the very base of the <unk> animal ; and this might have been expected from the antennæ in the larva , being seated on the ventral surface , not at the very extremity of the head .
by a very strong light , they can sometimes just be seen whilst the parasite is attached to the hermaphrodite ( the scutum of the latter having been cleaned on the under side ) , and are thus represented in fig .
9 .
they are formed of thicker membrane than the general integument of the body : the second segment , or disc , is pointed and hoof-like ; when seen in profile ( fig .
11 ) , the upper convex surface has a uniform slope with the upper surface of the basal segment ; it is furnished with a single backward pointing spine , attached , i believe , on the under side , nearly opposite the articulation of the ultimate segment : at the apex , there are some excessively minute hairs or down .
the ultimate segment projects rectangularly outwards as usual , and has on its inner side , rather beneath the middle , a conspicuous notch ( fig .
12 ) , which bears two or three long , <unk> spines ; on the summit there are three or four rather shorter spines .
on the outside of the great basal segment there is a single spine curving backwards .
the importance of the following measurements ( in fractions of an inch ) <name> hereafter be seen .
length of whole organ , from end of disc to the further } margin of the oblique basal articulation } <unk> length of whole organ , to the inner margin of the oblique } basal articulation } <unk> breadth of basal segment , measured half-way between the } basal and second articulations ,  the limb being viewed } from vertically above } <unk> length of hoof-like disc , measured from the apex to the } middle of the articulation with the basal segment } <unk> breadth of ditto <unk> length of ultimate segment <unk> breadth of ultimate segment beneath the notch <unk> breadth of ultimate segment above the notch <unk> i did not see the cement-ducts , which , perhaps , was owing to the corium extending from the inside of the whole animal some way into the antennæ , thus rendering them rather less transparent than in common cirripedes .
that the ducts and <unk> exist , is certain , for the antennæ in every case were enveloped in a little irregular mass or capsule of the usual , brown , transparent , laminated cement .
when several of these parasites were attached close together , the cement ran up between them .
i may here state , that i found on one scalpellum , three males very lately attached , and not as yet imbedded in the chitine border ; they were white , opaque , pulpy , and full of oily globules ; the lower part was considerably more pointed , and extended further beyond the prehensile antennæ , than in the older and imbedded specimens .
there were distinct remnants of two great reddish-brown eyes , showing that in this respect the larvæ of the male in their last stage of development , are characterised like the larvæ of other lepadidæ .
the male larva would , probably , be a little larger than the male itself ; but yet compared with the larva in the earliest stage , there can have been unusually little increase of size during the several intermediate metamorphoses ; i judge of this from the dimensions of the larva of the hermaphrodite in the first stage , namely , <unk> of an inch , exactly the size of some of the smaller males .
in the allied genus ibla , the increase is also less than is usual , namely , from <unk> of an inch , the diameter of the <unk> , to only <unk> of an inch , the length of the <unk> larva , just before its final metamorphosis .
habits and concluding remarks.  the males are imbedded in the spinose chitine border of the occludent margin of the scuta , exactly over an oblique fold or notch ( fig .
15 <unk> a ) , close by the umbo .
this fold has no direct relation to the males , but being present is taken advantage of by them ; for it occurs in the young hermaphrodite , before the attachment of the males , and in species of the genus in which the males are attached to other parts .
it occurs , also , in fossil species of pollicipes , and in these it seems caused by the upper inner part of the valve being rendered more and more prominent during growth : in the present species , i suspect , its origin is connected with the formation of a ridge bounding the outer side of the pit for the adductor scutorum muscle : we shall see in the next species , that this fold is of the highest importance in relation to the position of the males .
the transparent chitine border of the scuta is broad , and fills up the fold in the shell , so that the outline of the occludent margin is not affected by it : in the drawing ( fig .
9 ) some of the inner layers of chitine ( e e ) , which dipped into and filled up the fold , have been removed , that the lower part of the animal might be more plainly exhibited .
the chitine bears numerous spines of various lengths , which must afford some protection to the males , rudely arranged in lines , parallel to the edge of the valve , indicating the <unk> layers of chitine ; each spine has a fine , tortuous <unk> connecting its base with the underlying corium .
the extreme outer edge of the border is thin , forming a kind of lip , close beneath which the delicate tunic lining the sack is attached .
during continued growth , the valve is added to in thickness , and so is the chitine border , and likewise in breadth .
it appears that the larva of the male must attach itself on the under side of this border , on the edge of the tunic of the sack , and that by the action of the cement , the corium beneath is killed ( as i believe always is the case with other parasitic cirripedia ) , whereas on both sides , the chitine continues to be added to , so that the male , excepting the upper and always projecting portion , becomes imbedded at first laterally , and ultimately all round : i have seen specimens in several different stages of <unk> .
hence , in old specimens , with a thick and broad chitine border , it might and does come to pass that one male is imbedded ( the valve being laid flat ) directly beneath another .
i have examined a great number of specimens from various localities , taken at different times of the year ,  some dozen specimens from cornwall , [ 53 ] and several from unknown localities in various collections ; some from ireland , from the shetland islands , from norway , and from near naples .
every one of these specimens , with the exception of some of the neapolitan ones , had parasitic males attached to them : i must also except very young specimens , on which they never occur .
on a <unk> specimen , with a capitulum a little more than one fifth of an inch in length , it may be mentioned as unusual that there were three males .
in young specimens there is generally one male on each scutum , but sometimes there are two , and sometimes none on one side .
in large old <unk> specimens i have counted on the two sides together , six , seven , and eight males , and in one <name> specimen no less than ten , seven all close together on one valve and three on the other , but i do not suppose that all these were alive at the same time .
in the neapolitan specimens , however , which are the largest that i have seen , there was in no case more than two ; and out of seven or eight specimens , four had not any male ; so that it would appear there is something in this locality hostile to the development of the parasitic males .
i have noticed only one instance ( that given in fig .
9 ) in which the males were imbedded a little way apart ; generally they touch each other , and are cemented together : where there are several males , they occur at different levels , as measured from the under or upper surface of the chitine border : in one instance of four males adhering to one valve , i distinctly perceived that the lowest one was white , pulpy , and recently attached ; the two above , which were placed close together and between the same laminæ of chitine , were mature ; and the third still higher up , was dead , empty , transparent , and half decayed : in some other instances , i have found the uppermost parasites dead , and , together with the surrounding chitine , partially worn away .
[ 53 ] i am greatly indebted to mr. peach for his unwearied kindness in procuring me fresh specimens .
mr. w. thompson allowed me to <unk> one , possessing particular interest , out of his three <name> specimens .
professor forbes procured me a specimen from the shetland islands , and professor steenstrup was so kind to take pains to send me some <unk> specimens .
the larva of the male must have a different instinct from the larva of the hermaphrodite ; for the latter attaches itself head downwards to a coralline , whilst the male larva crawling on the scuta of the hermaphrodite , discovers , i presume by <unk> , the fold in the shell beneath the translucent border of chitine , and there invariably attaches itself .
its object in choosing this particular spot , i believe , simply is that the depth or thickness of the chitine is there greater , and sufficient for its <unk> , which would hardly be the case elsewhere .
this parasite has , as we have seen , no mouth or stomach , and indeed , considering its fixed position and the <unk> condition of its limbs or cirri , a mouth would have been of no service to it , without it had been extraordinarily elongated .
the male must live on the nourishment acquired during its locomotive larval condition ; and its life no doubt is short , but yet not very short , as i infer from the depth to which mature specimens are buried in the chitine border .
the full development of the spermatozoa <unk> , i suppose , some considerable lapse of time .
the thorax and limbs , though furnished with muscles , are obviously , as already remarked , of no use for prehension ; these parts serve , probably , to defend the little creature , when its eye announces the passing shadow of some enemy , and for this purpose they are well adapted from the extreme sharpness of the spines .
the thorax , into which i traced the <unk> <unk> , no doubt also serves for the <unk> and first direction of the spermatozoa ; and hence , perhaps , its singularly <unk> structure .
i have already remarked , that in specimens preserved in spirits , the thorax is often largely protruded , and bent down at right angles to the orifice .
i presume this is caused by <unk> ; nevertheless it deserves notice , that it was in these protruded specimens that the <unk> <unk> was most conspicuously gorged with spermatozoa .
i suspect the longitudinal and transverse muscles lining the upper part of the outer integuments of the whole animal , can be of little use to the creature , without it be to aid in the protrusion of the thorax , and perhaps in the violent expulsion of the spermatozoa , thus causing them to reach the ovigerous lamellæ within the sack of the hermaphrodite .
it is also probable , that the action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite , would tend to draw inwards the spermatozoa in the right direction .
in one specimen , the spermatozoa in the hermaphrodite and in the male were mature at the same time ; in another this was not the case ; and as the males , apparently , become attached at all periods of the year , this want of coincidence in maturity must often occur .
can the males retain their spermatozoa , till told by some instinct , that the ova in the sack of the often <unk> hermaphrodite are ready for impregnation ; or are the spermatozoa sometimes wasted , as must annually happen with such incalculable quantities of the pollen of many dioecious plants ?
this little cirripede is , in many respects , in a partially embryonic condition .
there is no separation between the capitulum and peduncle ; there is no mouth ; and the thorax , throughout its whole width , opens into the anterior part of the animal : the limbs differ greatly from those both of the mature cirripede and of the larva , but come closest to the latter : the preservation of the abdomen is a well-marked embryonic character .
on the other hand , the four rudimentary calcareous valves , the narrow orifice , the hirsute outer integument , the two muscular layers , the single eye , and male internal organs , are all characteristic of the <unk> condition .
the four little valves , as i believe , represent the scuta and terga , though they are placed considerably below the orifice : the little bristly points have no homological signification , and are absent in the male of the following closely allied species .
the four pairs of limbs answer to the four posterior cirri , as may be inferred from their proximity to the abdominal lobe , and from the three posterior pairs closely resembling each other , and differing a little from the first pair ; this latter pair corresponds with the third pair in the hermaphrodite form of scalpellum .
if i am right in believing that only a single <unk> <unk> is ordinarily developed in the male , this is a special and singular character .
as stated in the beginning of this description , from the one great fact of the absolute correspondence of the prehensile antennæ of the parasite , with those of the hermaphrodite scalpellum vulgare , together with its fixed condition , its short existence , and exclusively male sex , i have thought myself justified in provisionally considering it as the complemental male of the cirripede to which it is attached ; but i <name> final judgment <name> not be passed on this view , until the whole case is summed up at the end of the genus .
[ 54 ] [ 54 ] i trust , before long , that some naturalist , with more skill than i possess , <name> examine these parasites on scalpellum vulgare , which unfortunately is the only species of the genus that can be easily obtained .
fresh specimens , or those preserved in spirits of wine , are necessary .
the action of boiling caustic potash is very useful in cleaning the prehensile antennæ .
if these latter organs are sought in the hermaphrodite for the sake of comparison , young specimens , adhering to clean branches of a coralline , should be procured , and caustic potash used .

[ 55 ] [ 55 ] i am greatly indebted to mr. <unk> for specimens of this extremely interesting species ; also to mr. <name> , to whom mr. <unk> had given some of the original specimens .
female .
capitulum oblong , with the upper portion much produced ; valves , 14 , thick , naked , closely locked together , irregularly clouded with pale crimson ; the membrane connecting the valves is not furnished with spines .
on most of the valves there are furrows and ridges diverging from the umbones , and the lines of growth are plainly marked : in the valves of the lower whorl , the umbones are slightly protuberant .
scuta , convex , unusually thick , oblong , quadrilateral , with the occludent margin the longest ; lateral margin slightly hollowed out .
the umbo ( and primordial valve ) is situated at the uppermost point of the valve , and consequently the growth is exclusively downwards .
on the under side ( pl .
<name> , figs .
1 b´ and 1 <unk> ) , in about the middle of the valve , there is a pit ( a ) for the adductor scutorum muscle , the depth and distinctness of which varies a little ; above the pit , and between it and the apex , there is a transverse , oblong , deeper depression ( b ) , within which , the male is lodged .
a small portion of the apex of the valve projects over the terga .
terga , large , nearly equalling the scuta in area , flat and sub-triangular ; the scutal margin is not quite straight .
the apex of the valve is thick and solid , and must have projected freely for a length equalling one third of the occludent margin .
<name> , laterally broad , <unk> bent ; slightly widening from the apex to the base ; internally , deeply concave .
the position of the umbo varies , in young specimens it is seated at the uppermost point , and consequently in such there is no upward growth ; in older specimens , from the junction and upward production of that part on each side of the valve , which i have called in fossil specimens the <unk> , the valve is added to above the umbo , but to a lesser degree than in s .
vulgare .
slight ridges separate the roof from the <unk> , and the <unk> from the <unk> .
rostrum , minute , narrow , widening a little from the apex downwards , inserted like a wedge between the umbones of the rostral latera , and hardly projecting above their upper margins , so as to be easily overlooked : internally concave .
upper latera ( fig .
1 <unk> ) , <unk> , with a deep square notch cut out of the arched margin , which notch receives the upper point of the carinal latera ; the surface of the valve between the notch and the umbo is depressed .
[ 56 ] rostral latera , small , gradually widening from the umbo to the opposite end , which is obliquely rounded .
infra-median latera , approaching to <unk> , placed obliquely to the longer axis of the capitulum ; or the upper part may be described as <unk> .
[ 56 ] the only valve which i have seen at all like this , is a fossil specimen from the upper chalk of <unk> ; this is described in my memoir on the fossil lepadidæ ( <unk> society ) , under the name of scalpellum <unk> ( tab .

8 , e , f ) , and is perhaps erroneously there considered as a carinal latus .
carinal latera : these appear as if formed of two valves united together ; the upper portion , widening as it ascends in a curved line , terminates in a rounded margin , which enters the deep notch in the upper latera ; the other and lower portion is shorter , and terminates in a square margin <unk> against the infra-median latera ; the umbones of the carinal latera project beyond the line of the <name> .
direction of the lines of growth in the <unk>  this should always be carefully observed , on account of the great diversity there is in this respect between the different species , especially when the recent are compared with the older fossil species ; moreover one of the chief characters between the genus scalpellum and pollicipes , depends on the direction of the lines of growth .
in the scuta , terga , rostrum , and upper latera of the present species , the chief growth is downwards ; in the <name> , in mature specimens , it is both upwards and downwards ; in the carinal latera , both upwards and towards the infra-median latera ; in the infra-median latera chiefly upwards ; and , lastly , in the rostral latera , towards the infra-median latera .
peduncle , short , not half as long as the capitulum ; calcareous scales <unk> as usual , tinged red , almost <unk> , acuminated at both ends , of remarkable length , so that in each whorl there are only four scales : a full-sized scale equals in length one of the rostral latera .
the tips of two scales , in one whorl , lie under the middle points of the <name> and rostrum ; and in the whorl , both above and below , a single much curved scale occupies this same medial position .
the peduncle does not seem to have been attached in any definite position to the horny coralline , as is the case with s .
vulgare .
length of capitulum in the largest specimen <unk> of an inch .
the mouth is directed towards the ventral surface of the thorax .
the labrum is far removed from the adductor muscle , with the upper part forming an overhanging projection ; i believe there are some very minute bead-like teeth on the crest .
palpi , small , narrow , thinly clothed with bristles .
mandibles , with three teeth , of which the first is distant from the second ; inferior <name> not much acuminated , pectinated on both edges .
maxillæ , small , narrow , produced , without any notch , with two large upper spines , of which one is much thicker than the other ; on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of very small hairs .
outer maxillæ , with few bristles , arranged in a continuous line on the anterior surface ; on the external surface there is a tuft of long bristles .
olfactory orifices situated laterally , forming two flattened , tubular projections .
cirri.  first pair placed not far from the second ; the three posterior pair not very long , with their segments elongated , not protuberant , bearing four pair of <unk> spines , with a single short bristle between each pair ; dorsal tufts small , with one spine longer than the others .
first cirrus rather short , segments not very broad ; second cirrus with the rami nearly equal in length , anterior ramus rather thicker than the posterior ramus , with three longitudinal rows of spines .
caudal appendages.  these are minute , rather broad , not half as long as the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with four very long spines at the tip .
<unk>  there is no trace of a probosciformed penis in the four specimens examined ; and as this organ is present in every ordinary cirripede , with the exception of ibla cumingii which we know to be exclusively female , so we may infer with some confidence that the form here described is female , although it is impossible in specimens once dried to demonstrate the absence of the vesiculæ seminales and testes .
affinities.  this is a very distinct species ; it is , however , much more nearly related to s .
rutilum , than to any other species ; and next to this , to s .
vulgare ; from this latter species it chiefly differs in the large scales of the peduncle , in the scuta not being added to at their upper ends , and in the membrane covering and connecting the valves being <unk> ; but there is a greater difference in the trophi and in the cirri .
the peduncle of s .
ornatum presents some resemblance to that of the singular cretaceous genus , <unk> .
male .
all the specimens , as already stated , were dry , but in an excellent state of preservation , so that after having been soaked in spirits , they could be minutely examined .
in the four which i opened , i found , in a transverse pouch on the under side of each scutum , a male lodged ; in a fifth dead and bleached specimen , the cavities in the shell for the reception of the males , were present ; and in a sixth young specimen , also dead , cavities were in process of formation .
as compared with plants , the relation of the sexes in this species may be briefly given , by saying that it belongs to the class <unk> <unk> .
i <name> first describe the males themselves , and then the cavities in the shell of the female .
the males differ in every point of detail , from the complemental males of s .
vulgare , but yet present so close a general resemblance , that a comparative description <name> be most convenient .
the general shape of the whole animal is rather more elongated , and i suspect flatter , but this latter point could not be positively ascertained in dry specimens .
the entire length is greater , being in the largest specimen <unk> ( instead of at most <unk> ) , and the width , <unk> of an inch .
the orifice is not <unk> ; the four bristly points over the calcareous beads are absent .
the whole outer integument is much thinner , owing evidently to its protected position , and is not covered by little bristles , but with an extremely high power , minute points arranged in transverse lines can be distinguished .
the calcareous beads , or rudimentary valves , are thin and regularly oval .
it is remarkable that in all the specimens , two on one side were smaller than the two on the other side ,  the smaller beads being <unk> , and the larger , <unk> of an inch in diameter ; therefore more than twice the size of one of the beads in s .
vulgare , which are only <unk> externally in diameter .
from the position of the eye , close to one margin , near the upper end of the flattened animal , and from the manner in which the little limbs and spines lay between two of the beads at the opposite end , it was manifest that these latter , one large and one small , corresponded with the terga of the other cirripedes , and that the other two , near the eye , answered to the scuta .
the valves being of unequal sizes on the right and left-hand sides of the animal , is probably connected with one side being pressed against the hard , <name> valve of the female ; in the same way as the valves in certain <unk> ; are smaller and flatter on the side nearest to the crustacean to which they are attached .
the eye , in being slightly notched on the upper and lower edge , shows signs of really consisting of two eyes , which i believe is always normally the case ; it is rather larger , in the proportion of 13 to 11 , being <unk> of an inch in diameter , than in s .
vulgare ; and from the almost perfect transparency of the integuments , is far more conspicuous than in that species .
hence when the valves of the female are opened , the black little eye is the first part of the male which catches the attention .
no vestige of a mouth could be discovered .
thorax and <unk>  the thorax , as in s .
vulgare , is highly <unk> , and when stretched exhibits the same five transverse folds or articulations ; when contracted , it is broader , so that even the truncated end of the abdomen is wider than the lower ( properly anterior ) end of the thorax in s .
vulgare .
its thin outer integument is studded with excessively minute points in transverse rows .
the four pair of limbs are longer than in s .
vulgare , but the spines on them much shorter and thicker ; each limb ( including the first ) supports three spines , of which one is seated on a notch low down on the outside , and is longer than the other two ; of these two , the one on the same side with the notch , is a little longer than the other .
the spines on the first and second pair of limbs are considerably shorter than those on the third pair , and these latter , are a little shorter than those on the fourth or posterior pair .
hence , the spines on the thoracic limbs , compared with those of s .
vulgare , present considerable differences , both in their relative and absolute dimensions .
the abdominal lobe is in proportion rather shorter ; its end is less abruptly truncated , and supports a row of , i believe , six moderately long , and <unk> thick spines ; these spines are not so long as those <unk> the fourth pair of limbs .
on both lateral margins of the abdomen , rather on the ventral face , there is a row of , i believe , seven long spines , but it is very difficult to count the spines in specimens which have been once dried .
i was able to distinguish that the two lower pair of spines on the ventral surface , are seated a little way one below and within the other , as in s .
vulgare .
the abdominal spines altogether form quite a brush , and there are certainly several more than in s .
vulgare , and those on the two sides are much longer .
<unk>  the disc is hoof-like , with the upper surface forming a straight line with the upper edge of the basal segment ; the apex is pointed and clothed with some fine down ; there is a single spine pointing backwards , which rises from the lower flat surface .
the ultimate segment was hidden in laminæ of cement ; and i was not able to make out its structure .
there is a single spine on the outer edge of the basal segment , in the usual position .
the entire length of the limb , measured from the end of the disc to the further margin of the basal articulation , is <unk> of an inch ; measured to the inner margin , it is ; <unk> of an inch ; the disc itself is <unk> of an inch long ; these measurements differ a little both absolutely ad proportionally , compared with those of the antennæ of s .
vulgare .
cavities in the scuta of the female for the reception of the <unk>  these extend nearly parallel to the tergal margin , transversely across the valves , for three fourths of their width ; they are seated above the depression for the adductor muscle , and are more conspicuous than it ; they are deep and well defined , and each exactly contains one male .
the males are placed with their orifices in a little notch in the occludent margin , and their prehensile antennæ at the further end .
the distance to which the cavities extend across the valve , and their distance from the upper or tergal margin , varies a little , but chiefly in accordance with the age of the specimens ; for the valve continues to increase in width , whilst the size of the cavity remains the same .
the occludent margin of the scutum in the largest female , was <unk> of an inch in length ; of another , in which there was a fully developed cavity , <unk> ; of a third , in which there was no cavity , only a slight concavity , with a preparatory impression , the length of the occludent margin was <unk> .
the larger and smaller of these three valves , are drawn of their proper proportional sizes , in pl .
<name> , figs .
1 b´ , 1 <unk> .
the preparatory impression ( fig .
1 <unk> , b ) , consists of a narrow , not quite straight , extremely slight furrow , of slightly irregular width , bordered on each side by a very minute ridge , which is distinctly continuous with the inner edge of the occludent margin , both above and below the cavity .
the furrow appears to have been formed by calcareous matter not having been deposited along this line , during the thickening or growth of the internal surface of the valve : i suspect , that it originates at a single period of growth , for i could see no signs of <unk> transverse lines .
i believe that it is strictly homologous with the fold , over which the complemental male is attached in s .
vulgare , but carried , for a special purpose , much further across the valve and rectangularly inwards , for in structure and position both are identical .
in comparing the internal views of the scuta in s .
vulgare and s .
ornatum ( pl .
v , fig .
15 a´ , and pl .
<name> , fig .
1 <unk> ) , it must be borne in mind , that the latter should be compared , as clearly shown by the lines of growth , with that portion alone of the scutum in s .
vulgare , which lies under the curved ridge connecting the umbo and <unk> <name> .
the deep cavity in which the male is lodged , is formed subsequently to the preparatory furrow , simply by the gradual thickening of the surrounding surface of the valve , more especially of a ridge just above the pit for the adductor muscle , and of another broad ridge just beneath the tergal margin .
the deepest part of the cavity lies parallel to the tergal margin along the upper side , and here , in the older valves , the preparatory furrow can by care be distinctly traced .
in conformity with the shape of the cavity , the orifice or notch in the occludent margin of the scutum , is situated at the point where the preparatory furrow sweeps round and enters .
i believe that the cavity is lined by membrane , and that between the cavity and the body of the female , there is a complex membranous layer ,  a pouch or bag being thus formed .
an imaginary section of this pouch ( with the thickness of all the parts extremely exaggerated and in a reversed position ) is given in pl .
<name> , fig .
1 <unk> : a is the shell ; x the cavity , converted , as i believe , into a pouch by , firstly , the delicate tunic ( c ) lining the sack of the female ; secondly , a double layer ( d ) of corium ; and , thirdly , by a special , rather thick membranous layer ( b ) , which thinning out round the cavity coats only part of the under surface of the scutum .
this latter membrane i have not seen in any other cirripede , and i believe it is nothing but the tissue , here not calcified , which , in a calcified condition , ordinarily forms the valves .
on this view , the males may be said to be lodged in pouches , formed in the thickness of the valves .
concluding remarks.  the males from the absence of a mouth ( and no doubt of a stomach ) , must necessarily be short-lived , and , i suppose , are periodically replaced by fresh males .
[ 57 ] in one instance , the remnants of the two great compound eyes of the larva , could be seen at the end of the pouch , opposite the orifice .
the larvæ , i conclude , crawl in at the orifice , one side of which is formed , as we have seen , of yielding membrane , and scratch out the dead <unk> of the former occupant : certainly , the males are less firmly attached to their pouches , though some small quantity of cement is excreted , than are other cirripedes to the objects to which they are attached .
the small size of the female , and her valves not being thickly edged with chitine , accounts for the males having pouches specially formed for them , instead of being , as in s .
vulgare , laterally imbedded in the <unk> of the scuta .
in hereafter weighing the evidence on the nature of the parasites in ibla and in scalpellum , the fact of the valves of the supposed female being here modified for the special purpose of lodging the males , <name> be seen to be important .
if we imagine the male parasites to be extraneous animals , and that by adhering to the sack of the scalpellum , they injure the corium and thus prevent the growth of the shell over an area exactly corresponding to their own size , and so form for themselves cavities ; yet what can be said regarding the preparatory furrows ?
surely these narrow lines can not have been produced by the pressure of the much broader parasites .
must we not see in the furrows , the first marking out , if such an expression may be used , of the habitation for the male , which has to be specially formed by the independent laws of growth of the female ?
[ 57 ] it is possible , though opposed to all analogy , that the females may be short-lived , and breed only once , in which case the males would not have to be periodically replaced .

british museum .
female or hermaphrodite .
there is only a single specimen in the british museum , and this had nearly all its valves separated , and many of them in fragments : from its state of decay , i think the specimen must have been dead , when originally collected .
<unk>  the capitulum consists of fourteen valves , including from analogy a rostrum .
[ 58 ] valves , apparently covered with membrane , bearing some thin spines on the margins ; clouded with a fine , though pale , orange tint ; surfaces plainly marked with lines of growth .
[ 58 ] in my first , and as i thought careful examination of the separated valves ( my only materials ) of this species , i mistook one of the triangular rostral latera for the rostrum , and hence was unfortunately led into an error in my <unk> on the fossil lepadidæ of great britain , ' in which i state that the present species has only twelve valves in the capitulum ; and i inferred from this , that s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , & c. , had only twelve valves ; i still believe this to be correct , but the existence of fourteen valves in s .
rutilum and s .
ornatum , the recent species to which the above fossils are most closely allied , no doubt is a strong argument in favour of this higher number .
scuta , elongated , nearly three times as long as broad ; apex , pointed ; basal margin extremely oblique , forming an acute <name> with the occludent margin ; the lateral margin is slightly hollowed out , and is separated from the tergal margin by a large rectangular projection or shoulder .
the occludent margin is nearly straight ; externally , there is a slight ridge running down the middle of the valve , from the apex to the <unk> <name> ; and a second ridge running from the apex to the <unk> <name> .
the lines of growth do not end abruptly at the <unk> <name> , as is the case with s .
ornatum and several fossil species , but run up a little way along the tergal margin .
the umbo is seated at the uppermost point , and , therefore , the main growth is downwards .
there is a large rounded depression for the adductor muscle ( a , fig .
2 a´ ) , and higher up , opposite the <unk> <name> , there is another hollow ( b ) , for the <unk> of the males ; this latter is of nearly the same shape as the hollow for the adductor muscle , but rather more conspicuous than it .
from the appearance of the under surface of the scuta , it might readily have been thought , that there had been two adductor muscles .
terga , of large size , longer than the scuta , flat , triangular , with the whole inferior part much produced and <unk> .
a portion of the apex , must have projected freely above the sack .
<name> ( pl .
<name> , fig .
2 b´ ) , simply bowed ( i .
e. , not rectangularly bent ) , with the umbo ( and primordial valve ) seated at the upper point ; rather massive , narrow , only slightly increasing in width from the upper to the lower end ; the two sides are flat , and at right angles to the roof , which is bordered on each side by a rather broad , <unk> ridge ( see section fig .
2 <unk> ) , or the roof may be said to have a <unk> furrow running from the apex to the basal margin , and widening downwards ; these two ridges have their lines of growth oblique , and hence have a twisted appearance ; the central depressed portion of the basal margin , which is square or truncated , descends lower down than the two ridges .
the sides of the valve close to the apex are broad , and consist , as i believe , of <unk> , as well as of <unk> , but these parts are not separated from each other by ridges , as is commonly the case , more especially with the fossil species .
i have described the <name> in some detail , on account of its resemblance to that of the cretaceous s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , and s .

rostrum , unknown ; but one probably existed .
upper latera , of large size , elongated , quadrilateral , approaching to <unk> , with the angles rounded , nearly twice as long as broad ; almost flat ; upper half acuminated , lying between the scuta and terga ; the lower half broad , forming a rectangular projection lying between two latera of the lower whorl .
the umbo is near the apex , the greater part of the growth being downwards , but the valve is added to a little , round the two sides of the apex ; these additions do not take place in the early stages of growth , ( as explained under s .
vulgare , ) and , therefore , they form a depressed rim .
rostral latera , almost exactly triangular , curved ; basal margin furnished with a just perceptible rim .
infra-median latera , quadrilateral , sides unequal in length ; the <unk> margin being the longest ; in area not quite twice double the rostral latera ; directed obliquely upwards .
carinal latera , sub-triangular , produced upwards , with the apex rounded , and the two lateral margins hollowed out ; the basal margin exceeds a little in length the basal margin of the rostral latera .
the umbones of these two latera are seated at their basal outer angles , so that the growth of the valves is towards each other and upwards .
the umbo of the infra-median latus is seated at the <unk> <name> , and hence the growth is obliquely upwards .
the umbones of the rostral latera must have been close together , over the unknown rostrum .
length of capitulum about <unk> of an inch .
peduncle , only small fragments are preserved ; the calcified scales are small , closely <unk> , several of them together only equalling in length the basal margin of the rostral latera .
each scale is thin , transversely elongated ; basal imbedded portion straight ; upper margin rounded .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , forming an overhanging projection ; palpi apparently small and narrow .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with three teeth ; inferior <name> pectinated , as is sometimes the third tooth ; the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth equals that between the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , extremely narrow , produced , without any notch ; spinose edge exactly one third of the length of the mandibles : beneath the two upper great spines there are only three or four pair of spines ; on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of the smallest hairs .
outer maxillæ , rounded with the inner margins very sparingly but continuously covered with bristles .
i could not ascertain whether the olfactory orifices were tubular .
cirri.  these consisted , in the one specimen , of merely small fragments .
the segments of the posterior cirri are elongated , not protuberant , and support , i believe , five pair of <unk> spines , and an exterior row of very minute spines : dorsal spines fine and long .
either the second or third cirri , or probably both , are remarkable for having the whole of one side of each segment covered with irregular rows of long spines .
moreover , in the upper segments of these same cirri , between each separate dorsal tuft , there is placed one or two long bristles .
the first cirrus appears to have had very broad segments , and these are singular from the spines in the dorsal rows , being extremely long .
in some of the cirri , several of the basal segments are soldered together .
caudal appendages , lost .
from the state of the specimen , it was quite impossible to ascertain whether the individual here described was an hermaphrodite or female ; from the analogy of its nearest <unk> , s .
ornatum , the latter is the most probable ; but the genus ibla shows how the sexes may differ in the most closely-allied forms .
affinities.  from the hollows on the under sides of the scuta , for the <unk> of the males ; from the umbones of the scuta and of the <name> being situated on the apices of these valves ; and from all the characters of the mouth , s .
rutilum is much more closely allied to s .
ornatum than to any other species .
male , or complemental male .
in the concavity or hollow above the depression for the adductor muscle ( pl .
<name> , fig .
2 a´ ) , i found males , but in so extremely decayed a condition , that they could hardly be examined .
on one side , however , i distinctly saw the larval prehensile antennæ , with pointed , hoof-like discs ; and part of the thorax , with its small limbs and long spines , as in s .
vulgare or s .
ornatum .
i also saw clearly the eye .
the four calcified beads or rudimentary valves , i believe , were present ; but in removing the specimen , the whole fell to pieces and was lost .
the outer integument was covered with rather thick , very minute bristles , each about , <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore only half the length of those on the complemental males of s .
vulgare .
the cavities for the males are not formed , as in s .
ornatum , by the thickening of the internal surface of the valve round a defined space , but by the scutum being externally convex and internally concave down the middle , hollows being thus produced both for the <unk> of the males and for the attachment of the adductor muscle .
these hollows are separated from each other by a slight transverse ridge .
i do not know at which point of the margin of the valve , the orifice of the male is situated , but i presume close under the apex .
in this species , as in s .
ornatum , there can be no question that the scuta of the female are specially modified by their own growth for the reception of the males .
it must be added that , as it was not possible to ascertain whether the ordinary form of s .
rutilum was hermaphrodite or female , so it must remain doubtful whether the parasites are males or complemental males ; but the former , i think , is most probable .

terga large , one third of their own length longer than the scuta ; fat , sub-triangular ; the three margins are not quite straight ; the carinal margin projects a little above the apex of the <name> , and the scutal margin is <unk> to fit the upper part of the scuta .
<name> bowed , internally deeply concave ; upper portion above the umbo , about one fourth of the total length , extending between the terga for two thirds of their length , up to the slight prominences on their carinal margins : a ridge separates , on each side , the <unk> from the <unk> .

sub-carina minute , not above one third of the size of the rostral latera , which are the smallest of the other valves ; internally deeply concave ; externally solid , pyramidal , standing out beyond the surface of the <name> , with the umbo at the apex .
the umbones of the four pair of latera are seated a little above the centre in each valve , on the summit of a raised triangular portion ; this arises from the valve at first growing only downwards , and when added to at the upper end , the new part forms a ledge at a lower level round the old part , which had already acquired some thickness .

the latter project more , and are externally more pointed , as in the genus pollicipes .
the rostrum is well developed ; the infra-median latera , in proportion , are the least of all the valves .
the <name> is straight and pointed , and not , relatively to the scuta , quite so long .
the scuta are rather broader in proportion to their length , which would naturally follow from less having been added to their apices ,  these valves at first growing only downwards .

before describing the parasite of the present species , which departs entirely from the character of the males of the three preceding species , it is proper to state that i consider it to be a complemental male simply from analogy , as <name> hereafter be more fully shown at the end of the genus .
had a specimen of the parasite been brought to me without any information , i should have concluded that it was an immature individual of a new genus of pedunculated cirripedes , remarkable from the rudimentary condition of the valves , and exhibiting , in one important character , namely , in the form of the larval prehensile antennæ , an alliance to scalpellum .
had i been then told that three individuals in a group , had been found attached to s .
rostratum , not outside the valves , but to the integument , in a central line , between the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle , in such a position that when the scalpellum closed its valves , these parasites were enclosed within the capitulum , my surprise would have been great ; for it is very improbable that this singular and unparalleled position was accidental in this one group of specimens , inasmuch as there seems to be a relation between the naked condition of the capitulum of the parasite , and the protection afforded to it by the capitulum of the scalpellum .
it further becomes apparent on reflection , that these minute parasites , though having the appearance of immaturity , can not increase in size , or but little , for if they did grow , and acquired an ordinary size , they would either be killed by the pressure of the scuta of the scalpellum , or they would destroy the latter , and in doing so soon lose their own support , and thus necessarily perish !
the one full-grown specimen of s .
rostratum , in mr. <unk> collection , was in a good state of preservation , but dry .
the three parasites were attached , as stated , close under the labrum , between it and the adductor muscle .
they are constructed like ordinary cirripedia , and have a mouth , thorax and cirri , enclosed in a capitulum , supported on a peduncle of moderate length and narrow .
the entire length of the capitulum and peduncle , as far as could be ascertained in the shrivelled condition of the specimens , was <unk> , and the greatest width of the capitulum <unk> of an inch .
both capitulum and peduncle are hirsute with spines , nearly <unk> of an inch in length , mingled with shorter hairs in little rows of three and four together .
the figure ( 5 ) in pl .
<name> is merely a restoration , as accurate as could be made from the much shrivelled specimens .
there are only three valves ,  namely , an oval <name> ( a ) , seated rather high up on the capitulum , in a rudimentary condition and only <unk> of an inch in length , and a pair of scuta ; these latter consist of a narrow , slightly curved plate , <unk> in length , broadest at the lower end , where the breadth is <unk> of an inch .
the prehensile antennæ , at the end of the peduncle , have pointed hoof-like discs : i was not able to make out the other parts .
it deserves notice , that in the young specimen of the ordinary form of s .
rostratum , <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore only thrice as long as the parasites , all the valves were perfect , and seemed to have followed the ordinary law of development .
mouth.  the largely bullate labrum is placed far from the adductor , in the same manner as in the hermaphrodite .
the mandibles have three large sharp teeth , with the inferior point very sharp and small , so that there is one less tooth than in the hermaphrodite .
the maxillæ have two or three large upper spines , the others being very thin ; i believe the lower part is upraised and <unk> , as in the hermaphrodite .
the outer maxillæ are <unk> in front , with a few short bristles on the outer side near the bottom .
i was not able , from the dried state of the specimens , to discover whether the olfactory orifices were tubular .
altogether it was apparent , from this imperfect examination , that there was a close similarity between the mouth of the parasite and of the hermaphrodite .
the thorax is unusually elongated .
cirri.  the first pair is very short , and is distant from the second .
all have the appearance of immaturity , with their pedicels very long in proportion to their rami ; the latter are slightly unequal in length , even in the sixth pair .
there appeared to be six segments in the rami of the sixth pair , each segment bearing two or three pair of long spines .
caudal appendages , with two or three little spines on their summits .
penis , short , blunt , thick at the apex , with one or two spines on it .
i did not see any ovaria , but this could hardly have been expected in specimens in a dried condition , without they had happened to have been in a gorged condition .
certainly there were no ova .
in the general summary at the end of the genus , i shall give my reasons for believing this parasite to be the complemental male of the scalpellum rostratum .

hermaphrodite .
capitulum formed of 13 valves ; namely , two scuta , two terga , a <name> and sub-carina , a rostrum , a pair of upper latera , and two pair of lower latera ; these latter valves , with the sub-carina and the rostrum , make a whorl of six pieces .
the upper part of the capitulum is , as usual , produced .
the upper valves are separated ( in specimens which have not been dried ) by rather wide interspaces of membrane ; they are covered ( excepting , generally , their umbones , ) by membrane , which in the interspaces is clothed with fine spines .
the spines , or the marks where they were once articulated , are visible over nearly the entire surface of the membrane covering the valves .
the spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack .
the whole capitulum , ( in a dried condition ) , is coloured dull <unk> , which is only in part due to the underlying corium , for the valves themselves are pale red .
after having been long kept in spirits , the whole capitulum becomes colourless .
the valves are smooth , faintly marked by lines of growth .
the umbones of the lower valves project outwards , giving a <unk> appearance to the base of the capitulum .
scuta , slightly convex , oblong , breadth about two thirds of the length , almost quadrilateral , with the upper portion produced into a flat projection ; this projection is almost <unk> , being constricted a little on each side below the apex .
there is a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the umbo is near the apex , the part above not being above one fifth of the whole length of the valve .
as in s .
vulgare , the growth is at first downwards , and subsequently a little upwards and downwards , thus producing the upper , small , <unk> projection , which lies at a lower level than the umbo .
there is a fold on the occludent margin .
terga , large , flat , triangular ; carinal margin slightly hollowed out ; occludent margin slightly arched , with a small portion protuberant to a variable amount .
the apex is slightly curved towards the <name> .
<name> , long , internally deeply concave , <unk> bent , the lower portion slightly longer and wider than the upper part ; the two halves meet each other at about an <name> of <unk> ; the upper half is parallel to the longer axis of the terga , between which it extends for three fourths of their length .
the external surface is rounded , except near the umbo , where the edge is <unk> ; growth almost equally upwards and downwards ; the <unk> and <unk> are not separated by ridges .
the sub-carina lies close under the <name> , and is placed almost transversely to the longer axis of the capitulum ; external surface arched and smooth , the whole having the shape of half of a cone , with the apex a little curved outwards ; seen internally , it may be said to be formed of two triangular wings placed at right angles to each other ; basal margin straight ; in size equalling the carinal latera .
rostrum , lying almost transversely to the longer axis of the capitulum , under the basal margins of the scuta ; in shape ( fig .
6 a ) closely resembling the sub-carina , but about one third larger than it ; larger also than either the rostral or carinal latera ; seen externally , appears like a half cone ; seen internally , is formed of two triangular wings ( with curved edges ) , placed at <unk> to each other .
upper latera , internally flat , oblong , twice as long as broad ; upper end square , truncated ; upper half rather wider than the lower half ; fully twice as large as either of the lower latera .
the basal points extend below the basal margins of the scuta .
the umbo is placed a little above the centre .
rostral latera , minute , scarcely exceeding one third of the size of the carinal latera , and very much less than the rostrum ; they are placed transversely under the basal point of the upper latus , or rather between it and the <unk> <name> of the scutum ; basal margin , as seen internally , straight ; upper margin arched ; rostral <name> produced ; internally flat ; the whole valve is very thick and solid , so that the umbo which lies at the rostral end , projects rectangularly outwards .
carinal latera , oblong , nearly quadrilateral , with the upper <name> produced ; placed obliquely , parallel to the lower half of the upper latera ; umbo slightly prominent , seated near the apex , with three rounded ridges proceeding from it ; internal surface very slightly concave .
peduncle and <unk>  the peduncle is short , not equalling the capitulum in length .
the whole surface is most thickly clothed with minute spines , which are not visible when the specimen is dry ; i think it probable that they may sometimes all drop off before a new period of exuviation .
the peduncle does not ( at least in the specimens which i have examined , which were grouped in a bunch ) taper at the lower end to a point ; and after careful examination , i feel sure that the cement does not <unk> from several successively formed orifices , as in s .
vulgare and as in some pollicipes , but only from the two original orifices in the prehensile antennæ of the larva .
in these latter organs , the sucking disc is hoof-like and pointed , and is narrower than the basal segment .
the ultimate segment has on its inner side ( supposing this segment stretched straight forwards , ) a notch or step bearing at least three spines .
the proportions of the different parts differ slightly from those in s .
vulgare ; but , as i shall hereafter have to give all the measurements , i do not think them worth repeating here .
in the one large group of specimens examined by me , in mr. <unk> possession , all were attached symmetrically to the coralline , as in the case of s .
vulgare , capitulum upwards , and their <unk> outwards .
length of capitulum about three quarters of an inch ; width about half an inch ; entire length , with peduncle , a little more than one inch .
the mouth is placed far from the adductor muscle .
labrum , with its basal margin much produced ; upper part highly bullate , forming a rounded projection equalling the longitudinal axis of the rest of the mouth ; crest without any teeth .
palpi , triangular , with the two margins , thickly clothed with bristles ; on each side of the mouth , near where the palpi are united to the mandibles , there is a slight , orbicular , <unk> swelling .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
3 ) have nine or ten very unequal teeth , with the inferior <name> rather broad and pectinated ; of these , there are four main teeth , of which the second is always the smallest , and between the four , one or two small teeth are <unk> ; so that the total number is either nine or ten , and often varies on the two sides of the same individual , as likewise does the shape of the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , with the edge nearly half as long as that of the mandibles , supporting from seventeen to twenty pairs of spines ; the upper pair is only slightly larger than the others ; a part near the inferior <name> projects slightly beyond the rest of the nearly straight edge .
the <unk> , at its base or point of origin , is unusually broad and flat .
outer maxillæ , large and triangular .
the inner margin is slightly concave , and continuously covered with short spines .
the outer margin is <unk> , as in s .
vulgare , with the basal part supporting a great tuft of long bristles , of which the greater number turn outwards , and almost cover the olfactory orifices .
the latter are slightly prominent , placed some way apart from each other , with the above-mentioned tufts of bristles between them .
all the spines of the trophi are in some degree doubly serrated .
cirri.  the first pair is seated rather far from the second pair , and the prosoma being little developed , the shape of the body nearly resembles that of s .
vulgare .
the posterior cirri are elongated , very little curled , with the segments much flattened , not at all protuberant , bearing from five to seven pair of long serrated spines , with a few small spines in an exterior row ; between each pair there is a very minute tuft of small bristles ; the upper lateral rim of each segment is toothed with small spines ; spines of the dorsal tufts , long , serrated .
first pair , elongated , having numerous segments , namely , seventeen , whilst the sixth pair in the same individual had only twenty-one segments ; rami nearly equal ; segments short , nearly cylindrical , thickly clothed with long serrated spines .
the second and third pair are nearly equal in length ; they have their anterior rami slightly thicker than their posterior rami , both being much more thickly clothed with spines , than are the three posterior pair of cirri .
pedicels , rather short , with their inner edges not forming a projection , as in s .
vulgare .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
20 ) , <unk> , flat , rounded at their ends and moderately long ; clothed most thickly , like brushes , with very fine bristles , which latter are serrated , and are longer than the appendages themselves .
penis , of small size , narrow , pointed , and thickly clothed with delicate hairs ; in length equalling only one fourth of the sixth cirrus .
ovigerous fræna , small , semicircular ; entire edge thickly covered with glands .
ovarian tubes , within the peduncle , fully developed as usual .
affinities.  this species differs from all the others in the absence of calcareous scales on the peduncle ; but it has no other character which at all justifies its generic separation .
in the shape of the scuta and <name> it comes nearest to s .
vulgare .
taking all the characters together , it is scarcely possible to say to which of the other species it is most closely allied , having close affinities with all .
in the entire structure , however , of the complemental male , immediately to be described , this species certainly comes nearer to s .
villosum than to any other species .
i may add , that in s .
villosum the latera are almost rudimentary , and therefore tend to disappear , whereas in s .
peronii it is the calcareous scales on the peduncle which have actually disappeared .

i examined , owing to the great kindness of mr. cunning , six dry specimens of the hermaphrodite s .
peronii , from swan river , and one in spirits from another locality , in the british museum .
out of these seven specimens , only three appeared to have had parasites attached to them , and these i infer , from reasons to be more fully given at the end of the genus , are complemental males .
one of the three specimens , however , had two males close together .
these parasites were firmly cemented to the integument of the hermaphrodite , in a fold , in a central line between the scuta , a little below ( the animal being in the position in which it is figured ) the adductor scutorum muscle , and therefore some way below the umbones of these valves .
when the scuta are closed , the parasites , from their small size , are enclosed and protected .
in every detail of structure , they are obviously pedunculated cirripedia .
the capitulum ( pl .
<name> , fig .
3 ) has six valves ; namely , a pair of scuta and of terga , a <name> , and a rostrum , all united by <unk> membrane , furnished near the orifice with some much longer and thicker spines .
the capitulum is truncated in a remarkable manner , the orifice not being , as in the hermaphrodite , in the same line with the peduncle , but almost transverse to it , and therefore almost parallel to the surface of attachment .
the largest specimen measured transversely , through the scuta and terga , was <unk> of an inch in breadth ; another was only <unk> to <unk> : this latter specimen , measured longitudinally , from the base of the <name> to the tips of the terga , was <unk> of an inch .
a scutum of the largest specimen was <unk> in length .
the scuta and terga are broadly oval , with the primordial valves very plain at their upper ends .
i may here mention , that in a central line between the scuta , i observed the apparently single , minute , black eye , as in ordinary cirripedia .
the <name> is straight , triangular , and internally slightly concave ; its basal margin descends far below the basal points of the terga .
the rostrum is shorter , and internally more concave than the <name> : i believe it projects more abruptly outwards than is represented in the figure .
the peduncle commences some little way below the scuta : it is narrow and very short : it is finely <unk> : it is lined by delicate transverse <unk> muscles , within which there are the usual stronger , longitudinal muscles .
the base is flat and truncated .
i examined , and carefully compared , the prehensile antennæ with those of the hermaphrodite , and found every part and every measurement the same .
the full importance of this identity <name> hereafter be more fully insisted on .
the antennæ are represented of their proper proportional size in fig .

mouth.  the labrum , as in the hermaphrodite , is highly bullate , and far removed from the adductor scutorum muscle .
the palpi are small and triangular , with their blunt apices clothed with a very few scattered bristles .
mandibles , with only three teeth , and the lower <name> minute , slightly pectinated ; the first tooth is distant from the second , and larger than it .
width of the whole organ , <unk> of an inch .
maxillæ , bearing only a few spines , furnished with a long <unk> ; beneath the upper large pair there is a notch , under which there are two spines of considerable size and a small tuft of fine bristles ; width <unk> of an inch , and therefore only <unk> of the size of the same organ in the hermaphrodite : the relative sizes of the maxillæ and mandibles are the same in the male and hermaphrodite .
outer maxillæ blunt , triangular , with a few <unk> bristles on the inner face ; those on the outside being longer .
cirri.  the first pair is far removed from the second ; the rami are very short , barely exceeding the pedicel in length ; they are formed of only four segments , each bearing a pair of spines ; but on the end of the terminal segment , there are three spines , of which the central one is very long .
second pair also short .
in the sixth pair there are five or six elongated segments , each bearing three pair of long spines ; dorsal tufts large .
the cirri are furnished with <unk> muscles .
the caudal appendages exist as two very minute plates , with a few bristles at their apices .
the penis is not acuminated , with four bristles at the end ; it is short , equalling only the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
in the one specimen preserved in spirits , i unfortunately omitted to search for the vesiculæ seminales ; i can not doubt that such existed , but it would have been important to have ascertained whether they contained spermatozoa .
i made out , most distinctly , that there was no trace of ovarian tubes within the peduncle ; and my assertion may be believed when i state , that i traced the two much finer and more transparent cement-ducts , from the prehensile antennæ up to the body of the animal : in lepas i have repeatedly detected , with ease , the ovarian tubes within the peduncle , before the <unk> of the valves had even commenced , and therefore at a much earlier period of growth than in these parasites .
consequently i am prepared to affirm , that these parasites are not females , but that , as far as can be judged , from external organs , they are exclusively males .
concluding remarks.  in comparing the capitulum of the hermaphrodite with that of the complemental male ( pl .
<name> , figs .
6 and 3 ) , we must be struck with the differences in their shape , in the number , relative sizes , and forms of the several valves .
it should , however , be borne in mind , that the scuta and <name> in the hermaphrodite at first grow exclusively downwards ; so that if we remove the upper portions subsequently added , the difference in shape in these valves is not so great as it at first appears .
the rostrum in the male is of much larger relative size ; whilst of the upper latera there is not a trace , although in the hermaphrodite these valves are larger than the rostrum .
the terga , compared with those of the hermaphrodite , differ more essentially than do the other valves ; and the manner in which the primordial valves project , shows that from the first commencement of <unk> , the lines of growth have followed an unusual course .
the great breadth and shortness of the terga is evidently related to the shortening of the whole capitulum , and the transverse position of the orifice ; and this shortening of the capitulum , no doubt , is rendered necessary for its reception and protection within the shallow furrow between the scuta of the hermaphrodite .
finally , if we compare the internal parts of the hermaphrodite and male , the differences are considerable , though partly to be accounted for by the youth of the latter : the form and position of the labrum , and the distance between the first and second pair of cirri , is the same in both ; but the mandibles and maxillæ differ considerably .
to put the case as i have before done , if a specimen of one of these parasites had been brought to me to class without any information of its habits ,  the downward direction of growth in all the valves , the presence of a rostrum , the <unk> outer integument , all the details of the prehensile antennæ , the form of the animal 's body , and the position of the labrum , would have convinced me that , though a quite new genus , it ought to have stood close to scalpellum , and nearer to it than to ibla .

hermaphrodite .
capitulum with fourteen valves , consisting of a pair of scuta and of terga , a <name> , ( which five valves are much larger than the others , ) a rostrum , sub-rostrum , sub-carina , and three pair of small latera .
all the valves are covered by membrane , as are the calcareous scales on the peduncle ; and this membrane everywhere is densely clothed with spines .
the upper valves are not very thick ; they stand rather close together .
the eight valves of the lower whorl are more solid , and are placed far apart ; they are small , tending to become rudimentary .
none of the valves are added to at their upper ends , in which respect this species differs remarkably from the others of the genus , and approaches in character to pollicipes .
scuta , with a deep hollow for the adductor muscle , triangular , with the basal margin elongated , and protuberant .
terga , large , flat , triangular , basal point blunt , with the carinal margin slightly hollowed out , and the scutal margin protuberant .
apex solid .
<name> , rather longer than the terga , straight , gradually widening from the upper to the basal end , deeply concave .
in young specimens the upper part is slightly bowed inwards .
apex solid .
sub-carina , with the inner surface <unk> ; the umbo points transversely outwards ; in width it exceeds the largest of the latera .
rostrum , triangular , internally ( fig .
8 a ) concave ; basal margin slightly hollowed out , and deeply notched ; rather less in width than the <name> ; short , with the umbo pointing upwards and outwards .
in young specimens the apex curves a little inwards .
sub-rostrum , with the inner surface transversely elongated ( fig .
8 b ) , slightly <unk> , about two thirds as wide as the rostrum .
the apex points transversely outwards .
latera , three pair ; the middle pair apparently corresponds with the upper latera of the other species of the genus .
the two other pair of latera , together with the rostrum and sub-carina , form a whorl .
the sub-rostrum lies by itself , a little beneath this whorl .
the latera are smaller than the rostrum or the sub-carina .
they are placed far distant from each other ; their inner surfaces are triangular ; their umbones point upwards ; the rostral pair is smaller than the other two pair , which are of equal size .
the exact position of the rostral latus differed on the two sides of the specimen examined ; apparently its normal position is at the <unk> <name> of the scuta .
peduncle , wide at the summit , longer than the capitulum ; calcified scales small , not arranged very regularly ; flattened , <unk> , rather far separated from each other ; imbedded in membrane , so that even their summits are rarely uncovered .
the surface of the membrane is thickly clothed with spines , which are strong , thick , yellow , pointed , and furnished with large tubuli running to the underlying corium .
these spines are arranged in groups of from three or four , to five or six .
besides these larger spines , the whole surface is <unk> with very minute colourless spines , not above <unk> of the length of the larger ones .
the surface of attachment is broad .
this species , not being symmetrically attached to a coralline , the peduncle does not curve , as in most of the other species , towards the rostrum .
the capitulum is above half an inch in length .
mouth.  the labrum is much produced downwards , but yet the mouth is not very far distant from the adductor muscle : the upper part is bullate , forming a small overhanging point , and in longitudinal diameter equals the rest of the mouth .
palpi blunt .
mandibles with four teeth , strong , short , thick , the second tooth much smaller than the others ; inferior <name> broad , pectinated .
maxillæ with a long , rather sinuous edge , which , near the inferior <name> , has a narrow projecting point , bearing rather finer spines ; there is , also , apparently , a very minute tuft of small spines close under the two large upper spines : there are , altogether , about twenty pair of spines , without counting the smaller ones .
outer maxillæ , with the inner edge slightly concave , continuously covered with bristles ; exteriorly , with a prominence covered with longer bristles .
olfactory orifices prominent , protected by a slight punctured swelling between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
cirri.  prosoma moderately developed ; first pair of cirri rather far removed from the second pair .
the segments of the three posterior pair are not elongated , short , slightly protuberant in front , bearing four or five pairs of strong spines ; a little below each pair , there is an intermediate tuft of very fine straight bristles , of which the upper tuft is the largest ; on the lateral upper rims there are some short , strong spines ; dorsal tufts rather small and thick ; spines all more or less serrated , especially on the broad basal segments of the three anterior cirri .
pedicels of the cirri not particularly protuberant in front .
first cirrus with rami , slightly unequal in length ; not short ; basal segments much thicker and more protuberant than the upper segments .
second cirrus ; anterior ramus with six or seven basal segments highly protuberant , and crowded with spines ; posterior ramus with about six segments , similarly characterised .
third cirrus with the anterior ramus having six , and the posterior ramus five segments , also similarly characterised .
caudal appendages absent , there being only a slight swelling on each side of the anus .
the oesophagus runs parallel to the labrum , and enters obliquely the summit of the stomach , which is destitute of cæca : the <unk> envelope is longitudinally <unk> .
there are no filamentary appendages .
testes large , branched like a stag 's horns , attached in a sheet to the ventral surface of the stomach : the vesiculæ seminales enter the prosoma , and have their reflexed ends not very blunt .
the penis is rather narrow , with the terminal half plainly ringed , and bearing tufts of fine bristles arranged in circles , one tuft below the other ; on the basal half there are only a few scattered minute bristles .
affinities.  in the downward growth of all the valves , in the presence of a sub-rostrum , in the shape of the scuta , <name> , and more especially of the triangular latera , in the form of the peduncle , with its <unk> calcified scales , in the shape of the <unk> body , in the structure both of the mandibles and maxillæ , in the arrangement of the spines , both on the anterior and posterior cirri , scalpellum villosum most closely resembles , or rather is identical with , pollicipes .
had it not been for the formation of the valves forming the capitulum , and from the presence of complemental males , i should have placed this species alongside of pollicipes spinosus and sertus .
in not having caudal appendages , s .
villosum differs from all the species of scalpellum and pollicipes ; but this organ is variable to an unusual degree in pollicipes .
complemental male .
pl .
<name> , fig .
4 .
from the kindness of professor <name> , mr. gray , and mr. cuming , i have been enabled to examine six specimens of this species ; and on two of them i found complemental males .
they were attached in the same position as in s .
peronii ; namely , beneath the adductor muscle , in the fold between the scuta , so as to be protected by the latter when closed .
this parasite is <unk> , and has a close general resemblance with that of s .
peronii , but differs in very many points of detail .
it is represented of the natural size at <unk> fig .
4 .
the capitulum is <unk> of an inch , measured across the scuta and terga ; and the same measured from the base of the <name> to the top of the capitulum ; hence it is broader , by a quarter of the above measurement , and considerably higher than the male of s .
peronii .
from the capitulum being higher , that is , not so much truncated , the orifice is placed more obliquely .
the membrane connecting the valves is finely <unk> , and is besides furnished with spines , conspicuously thicker and longer than those on the male s .
peronii .
the scuta and terga are much more elongated , a scutum being here <unk> of an inch in length .
the <name> descends only just below the basal points of the terga , instead of far below them .
the rostrum is a little broader and more arched than the <name> ; it is <unk> in length , and therefore more than two thirds of the length of the <name> , the latter being <unk> of an inch from the apex to the basal margin .
the primordial valves , with the usual hexagonal tissue , are seated on the tips of the scuta , terga , and <name> , but not on the rostrum ; so that these valves follow the same law of development , as in the ordinary and hermaphrodite form of scalpellum .
the scuta ( a , fig .
4 , greatly enlarged ) , the terga ( b ) , and <name> ( c ) of the male , resemble the same valves in the hermaphrodite , much more closely than do these valves in the male and hermaphrodite s .
peronii .
the rostrum has not its basal margin hollowed out , and is very much larger relatively to the <name> , than in the hermaphrodite .
the large relative size of the rostrum in the complemental male both of this species and of s .
peronii , is a remarkable character , which i can in no way account for .
the peduncle is narrow and short , but in a different degree in the two specimens examined .
it is naked .
the prehensile antennæ were not in a good state of preservation : the disc is narrower than the basal segment , and only slightly pointed , in which important respect it differs from the same part in the foregoing species ; at its distal end , rather on the inner side , there are two or three spines , apparently in place of the excessively minute hairs , which are found at the same spot in some or in all the other species of scalpellum , and in ibla : similar strong spines occur in pollicipes .
unfortunately , for the sake of comparison , i was not able to find the prehensile antennæ in the hermaphrodite s .

maxillæ , with a considerable notch under the upper pair of large spines ; inferior part of the edge not prominent .
outer maxillæ , with the spines on the inner edge arranged into two groups .
olfactory orifices tubular and prominent , with some long bristles near their bases .
in the mandibles having only three teeth , in the maxillæ being notched and in the lower part not being prominent , and , lastly , in the bristles on the inner face of the outer maxillæ being arranged in two groups , these several organs differ from those in the hermaphrodite .
cirri.  first pair short , with only three or four segments in each ramus : second cirrus , with the basal segments not very thickly clothed with spines : sixth cirrus with seven segments , not protuberant in front , each bearing four pairs of spines , without intermediate tufts .
caudal appendages , none .
this is an interesting fact , considering that these organs are likewise absent in the hermaphrodite s .
villosum ,  an absence highly remarkable , and confined to the genus conchoderma and the one species of anelasma .
penis thick , not tapering , rather exceeding in length the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , square at the end , and furnished with some spines .
in one specimen , i believe i distinguished the vesiculæ seminales : if so , they contained only pulpy matter , and not spermatozoa .
there were no ovarian tubes within the peduncle , which was lined by the usual muscles ; i traced the two delicate cement-ducts , running from within the antennæ close up to the animal 's body .
hence in this case , as in that of s .
peronii , i dare positively affirm that ovarian tubes do not occur ; for it is out of the question that i could have traced the cement-ducts , and , at the same time , overlooked the far larger and more conspicuous ovarian tubes , into which , moreover , the ducts , had they existed , would have run .
consequently , these parasites are not females ; but judging from the probosciformed penis , and from the presence , as i believe , of vesiculæ seminales , they are males .
the complemental males of the present species , and of s .
peronii , so closely resemble each other , that what i have stated regarding the affinities of the latter , are here quite applicable .
it is singular how much more alike the parts of the mouth and the cirri of these two complemental males are , than the corresponding parts in the two hermaphrodites : this no doubt is due to the two males having been arrested in their development , at a corresponding early period of growth .
several of the characters , by which the hermaphrodite s .
villosum so closely approaches , and almost blends into the genus pollicipes ,  such as the thicker cirri , with the intermediate tufts of bristles , the small second tooth of the mandibles , and the little <unk> prominence on the maxillæ ,  are not in the least apparent in the complemental male .
summary on the nature and relations of the males and complemental males , in ibla and scalpellum .
had the question been , whether the parasites which i have now described , were simply the males of the cirripedes to which they are attached , the present summary and discussion would perhaps have been superfluous ; but it is so novel a fact , that there should exist in the animal kingdom hermaphrodites , aided in their sexual functions by independent and , as i have called them , complemental males , that a brief consideration of the evidence already advanced , and of some fresh points , <name> not be useless .
these parasites are confined to the allied genera ibla and scalpellum ; but they do not occur in pollicipes ,  a genus still more closely allied to scalpellum ; and it deserves notice , that their presence is only occasional in those species of scalpellum which come nearest to pollicipes .
in the genera ibla and scalpellum , the facts present a singular parallelism ; in both we have the simpler case of a female , with one or more males of an abnormal structure attached to her ; and in both the far more extraordinary case of an hermaphrodite , with similarly attached complemental males .
in the two species of ibla , the complemental and ordinary males resemble each other , as closely as do the corresponding hermaphrodite and female forms ; so it is with two sets of the species of scalpellum .
but the males of ibla and the males of scalpellum certainly present no special relations to each other , as might have been expected , had they been distinct parasites independent of the animals to which they are attached , and considering that they are all cirripedes having the same most unusual habits .
on the contrary , it is certain that the animals which i consider to be the males and complemental males of the two species of ibla , if classed by their own characters , would , from the reasons formerly assigned , form a new genus , nearer to ibla than to the parasites of scalpellum : so , again , the assumed males of the three latter species of scalpellum would form two new genera , both of which would be more closely allied to scalpellum , than to the parasites of ibla .
with respect to the parasites of the first three species of scalpellum , they are in such an extraordinarily modified and embryonic condition , that they can hardly be compared with other cirripedes ; but certainly they do not approach the parasites of ibla , more closely than the parasites of scalpellum ; and in the one important character of the antennæ , they are identical both with the parasitic and ordinary forms of scalpellum .
that two sets of parasites having closely similar habits , and belonging to the same <unk> , should be more closely related in their whole organisation to the animals to which they are respectively attached , than to each other , would , if the parasites were really distinct and independent creatures , be a most singular phenomenon ; but on the view that they differ only sexually from the cirripedes on which they are parasitic , this relationship is obviously what might have been expected .
the two species of ibla differ extremely little from each other , and so , as above remarked , do the two males .
in scalpellum the species differ more from each other , and so do the males .
in this latter genus the species may be divided into two groups , the first containing s .
vulgare , s .
ornatum and s .
rutilum , characterised by not having a sub-carina , by the rostrum being small , by the constant presence of four pair of latera , and by the peculiar shape of the carinal latera ; the second group is characterised by having a sub-carina and a large rostrum , and may be subdivided into two little groups ; viz. , s .
rostratum having four pairs of latera , and s .
peronii and villosum having only three pairs of latera : now the males , if classed by themselves , would inevitably be divided in exactly the same manner , namely , into two main groups ,  the one including the closely similar , <unk> males of s .
vulgare , ornatum , and rutilum , the other the pedunculated males of s .
rostratum , peronii , and villosum ; but this latter group would have to be subdivided into two little sub-groups , the one containing the <unk> male of s .
rostratum , and the other the <unk> males of s .
peronii and s .
villosum .
it should not , however , be overlooked , that the two main groups of parasites differ from each other , far more than do the two corresponding groups of species to which they are attached ; and , on the other hand , that the parasitic males of s .
peronii and s .
villosum resemble each other more closely , than do the two hermaphrodite forms ;  but it is very difficult to weigh the value of the differences in the different parts of species .
besides these general , there are some closer relations between the parasites and the animals to which they are attached ; thus the most conspicuous internal character by which ibla quadrivalvis is distinguished from i .
cumingii , is the length of the caudal appendages and the greater size of the parts of the mouth ; in the parasites , we have exactly corresponding differences .
out of the six species of scalpellum in their ordinary state , s .
ornatum is alone quite destitute of spines on the membrane connecting the valves ; and had it not been for this circumstance , i should even have used the presence of spines as a generic character ; on the other hand , s .
villosum , in accordance with its specific name , has larger and more conspicuous spines than any other species .
in the parasites we have an exactly parallel case ; the parasite of s .
ornatum being the only one without spines , and the spines on the parasite of s .
villosum being much the largest !
this latter species is highly singular in having no caudal appendages , and the parasite is destitute of these same organs , though present inn the parasites of s .
rostratum and s .
peronii .
again , s .
villosum approaches , in all its characters , very closely to the genus pollicipes , and the parasite in having prehensile antennæ , with the disc but little pointed , and with spines at the further end , departs from scalpellum and approaches pollicipes !
<name> any one believe that these several parallel differences , between the <unk> parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached , are accidental , and without signification ?
yet , this must be admitted , if my view of their male sex and mature be rejected .
one more , and the most important special relation between the parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached , remains to be noticed , namely that of their prehensile larval antennæ .
i observed the antennæ more or less perfectly in the males of all , and except in s .
villosum , in all the species , though so utterly different in general appearance and structure , i found the peculiar , pointed , hoof-like discs , which are confined , i believe , to the genera ibla and scalpellum .
in the hermaphrodite forms of scalpellum , i was enabled to examine the antennæ only in two species , s .
vulgare and s .
peronii , ( belonging , fortunately , to the two most distinct sections of the genus , ) and after the most careful measurements of every part , i can affirm that , in s .
vulgare , the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical ; but that they differ slightly in the proportional lengths of their segments , and in no other respect , from these same organs in s .
peronii ,  in which again the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical .
the importance of this agreement <name> be more fully appreciated , if the reader <name> consider the following table , in which the generic and specific differences of the antennæ in the lepadidæ , as far as known to me , are given .
these organs are of high functional importance ; they serve the larva for crawling , and being furnished with long , sometimes plumose spines , they serve apparently as organs of touch ; and lastly , they are indispensable as a means of permanent attachment , being adapted to the different objects , to which the larva adheres .
hence the antennæ might , à priori , have been deemed of high importance for classification .
they are , moreover , embryonic in their nature ; and embryonic parts , as is well known , possess the highest classificatory value .
from these considerations , and looking to the actual facts as exhibited in the following table , the improbability that the parasites of s .
vulgare and s .
peronii , so utterly different in external structure and habits one from the other , and from the cirripedes to which they are attached , should yet have absolutely similar prehensile antennæ with these cirripedes , appears to me , on the supposition of the parasites being really independent creatures , and not , as i fully believe , merely in a different state of sexual development , <unk> great .
the parasites of s .
vulgare take advantage of a pre-existing fold on the edge of the scutum , where the chitine border is thicker ; and in this respect there is nothing different from what would naturally happen with an independent parasite ; but in s .
ornatum the case is very different , for here the two scuta are specially modified , before the attachment of the parasites , in a manner which it is impossible to believe can be of any service to the species itself , <unk> of the <unk> thus afforded for the males .
so again in s .
rutilum , the shape of the scutum seems adapted for the reception of the male , in a manner which must be attributed to its own growth , and not to the pressure or attachment of a foreign body .
now there is a strong and manifest improbability in an animal being specially modified to favour the <unk> of another , though there are innumerable instances in which parasites take advantage of pre-existing structures in the animals to which they are attached .
on the other hand , there is no greater improbability in the female being modified for the attachment of the male , in a class in which all the individuals are attached to some object , than in the mutual organs of <unk> being adapted to each other throughout the animal kingdom .

in using the terms inner and outer sides of the end segment , it is supposed , that this segment is stretched straight forwards , instead of being bent rectangularly outwards , as in its natural position ; and then there can be no doubt which is the inner and outer sides .
it should be observed that the evidence in this summary is of a cumulative nature .
if we think it highly , or in some degree probable ,  from the ordinary form of ibla cumingii having been shown on good evidence to be exclusively female ,  from the absence of ova and ovaria in the assumed males of both species of ibla , at the period when their vesiculæ seminales were gorged with spermatozoa ,  from the close general resemblance between the parts of the mouth in the parasites and in the <unk> to which they are attached ,  from the differences between the two parasites being strictly analogous to the differences between the two species of ibla ,  from the generic character of their prehensile antennæ ,  and from other such points ,  if from these several considerations , we admit that these parasites really are the males of the two species to which they adhere , then in some degree the occurrence of parasitic males in the allied genus scalpellum is rendered more probable .
so the absolute similarity in the antennæ of the males and hermaphrodites both in s .
vulgare and s .
peronii ; and such relations as that of the relative <unk> of the several species in this same genus , all in return strengthen the case in ibla .
again , the <unk> parasites of s .
peronii and s .
villosum are so closely similar , that their nature , whatever it may be , must be the same ; hence we may add up the evidence derived from the identity of the antennæ in the parasite and hermaphrodite s .
peronii , with that from the antennæ in the male s .
villosum , approaching in character to pollicipes , to which genus the hermaphrodite is so closely allied ; and to this evidence , again , may be added the singular coincident absence of caudal appendages in the male and hermaphrodite s .
villosum .
if these two <unk> parasites be received as the complemental males of their respective species , no one , probably , <name> doubt regarding the nature of the parasite of s .
rostratum , in which the direct evidence is the weakest ; but even in this case , the particular point of attachment , and the state of development of the valves , form a link connecting in some degree , the parasites of the first three species with the last two species of scalpellum , in accordance with the affinities of the hermaphrodites .
when first examining the parasites of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , before the weight of the cumulative evidence had struck me , and noting their apparent state of immaturity , it occurred to me that possibly they were the young of their respective species , in their normal state of development , attached to old individuals , as may often be seen in lepas ; this , however , would be a surprising fact , considering that s .
rostratum and s .
peronii are ordinarily attached , in a certain definite position , to horny corallines , and considering that the exact points of attachment in these three parasites , ( of which i have seen no other instance amongst common cirripedes , ) namely , between the scuta , would inevitably cause their early destruction , either directly or indirectly , by their living supports being destroyed .
nevertheless , i carefully examined a young specimen of s .
rostratum only thrice as large as the parasite ; and not having very young specimens of s .
peronii and villosum , i procured the young of closely-allied forms , namely , of s .
vulgare , ( with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch in length , ) and of pollicipes polymerus , ( with a capitulum of less size than that of one of the parasites , ) and there was not the least sign of anything abnormal in the development of the valves .
in s .
vulgare , at a period when the calcified scuta could have been only <unk> of an inch in length , ( and therefore considerably less than the scuta in the parasites , ) the upper latera must have been as much as <unk> of an inch in length , and the valves of the lower whorl certainly distinguishable .
to sum up the evidence on the sex of the parasites , i was not able to discover a vestige of ova or ovaria in the two male <unk> ; and i can venture to affirm positively , that the parasites of s .
peronii and s .
villosum are not female .
on the other hand , in the two male <unk> , i was enabled to demonstrate all the male organs , and i most distinctly saw spermatozoa .
in the parasitic complemental male of s .
vulgare , i also most plainly saw spermatozoa .
in the parasites of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , the external male organs were present .
i may here just allude to the facts given in detail under ibla , showing that it was hardly possible that i could be mistaken regarding the exclusively female sex of the ordinary form of i .
cumingii , seeing how immediately i perceived all the male organs in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis ; and as the parasite contained spermatozoa and no ova , the only possible way to escape from the conclusion that it was the male and i .
cumingii the female of the same species , was to invent two hypothetical creatures , of opposite sexes to the ibla and its parasite , and which , though cirripedes , would have to be locomotive !
i insisted upon this alternative , because if the parasite of i .
cumingii be the male of that species , then unquestionably we have in i .
quadrivalvis a male , complemental to an hermaphrodite ,  a conclusion , as we have seen , hardly to be avoided in the genus scalpellum , even if we trust exclusively to the facts therein exhibited .
with respect to the positions of the parasitic males , in relation to the impregnation of the ova in the females and hermaphrodites , it may be observed that in the two male <unk> , the elongated <unk> body seems perfectly adapted for this end ; in the males of the first three species of scalpellum , the spermatozoa , owing to the manner in which the thorax is bent when protruded , would be easily discharged into the sack of the female or hermaphrodite ; this would likewise probably happen with the complemental male of s .
rostratum , considering its position within the orifice of the capitulum , between the mouth and the adductor scutorum muscle .
the males of s .
peronii and villosum being fixed a little way beneath the orifice of the sack , below the adductor muscle , are less favorably situated , but the spermatozoa would probably be drawn into the sack by the ordinary action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite , and therefore would at least have as good a chance of fertilising some of the ova , as the pollen of many dioecious plants , trusted to the wind , has of reaching the stigmas of the female plants .
regarding the final cause , both of the simpler case of the separation of the sexes , notwithstanding that the two individuals , after the metamorphosis of the male , become <unk> united together , and of the much more singular fact of the existence of complemental males , i can throw no light ; i <name> only repeat the observation made more than once , that in some of the hermaphrodites , the vesiculæ seminales were small , and that in others the probosciformed penis was unusually short and thin .
viewing the parasitic males , in relation to the structure and appearance of the species to which they belong , they present a singular series .
in s .
peronii and s .
villosum , the internal organs have the appearance of immaturity ; the shape of the capitulum is specially modified for its reception between the scuta of the hermaphrodite , and several of the valves have not been developed .
this atrophy of the valves , is carried much further in s .
rostratum .
in ibla , many of the parts are embryonic in character , but others mature and perfect ; some parts , as the capitulum , thorax , and cirri , are in a quite extraordinary state of atrophy ; in fact , the parasitic males of ibla consist almost exclusively of a mouth , mounted on the summit of the three anterior segments of the 21 normal segments of the <unk> crustacean .
in the males of the first three species of scalpellum , some of the characters are embryonic ,  as the absence of a mouth , the presence of the abdominal lobe , and the position of the few existing internal organs ; other characters , such as the general external form , the four bead-like valves , the narrow orifice , the peculiar thorax and limbs , are special developments .
these three latter parasites , certainly , are wonderfully unlike the hermaphrodites or females to which they belong ; if classed as independent animals , they would assuredly be placed not in another family , but in another order .
when mature they may be said essentially to be mere bags of spermatozoa .
in looking for analogies to the facts here described , i have already referred to the minute male <unk> which cling to their females ,  to the <unk> males of certain <unk> , parasitic on the females ,  and to certain <unk> , in which the sexes cohere , or even are <unk> blended by one extremity of their bodies .
the females in certain insects depart in structure , nearly or quite as widely from the order to which they belong , as do these male parasitic cirripedes ; some of these females , like the males of the first three species of scalpellum , do not feed , and some , i believe , have their mouths in a rudimentary condition ; but in this latter respect , we have , amongst the <unk> , a closely analogous case in the male of the <unk> of gosse , which was discovered by mr. <unk> [ 62 ] to be entirely destitute of mouth and stomach , exactly as i find to be the case with the parasitic male of s .
vulgare , and doubtless with its two close allies .
for any analogy to the existence of males , complemental to hermaphrodites , we must look to the vegetable kingdom .
finally , the simple fact of the diversity in the sexual relations , displayed within the limits of the general ibla and scalpellum , appears to me eminently curious ; we have ( 1st ) a female , with a male ( or rarely two ) permanently attached to her , protected by her , and nourished by any minute animals which may enter her sack ; ( 2d ) a female , with successive pairs of short-lived males , destitute of mouth and stomach , inhabiting two pouches formed on the under sides of her valves ; ( 3d ) an hermaphrodite , with from one or two , up to five or six similar short-lived males without mouth or stomach , attached to one particular spot on each side of the orifice of the capitulum ; and ( 4th ) hermaphrodites , with occasionally one , two , or three males , capable of seizing and devouring their prey in the ordinary <unk> method , attached to two different parts of the capitulum , in both cases being protected by the closing of the scuta .
as i am summing up the <unk> of the phenomena here presented , i <name> allude to the marvellous assemblage of beings seen by me within the sack of an ibla quadrivalvis ,  namely , an old and young male , both minute , <unk> , destitute of a capitulum , with a great mouth , and rudimentary thorax and limbs , attached to each other and to the hermaphrodite , which latter is utterly different in appearance and structure ; secondly , the four or five , free , <unk> larvæ , with their curious prehensile antennæ , two great compound eyes , no mouth , and six natatory legs ; and lastly , several hundreds of the larvæ in their first stage of development , globular , with <unk> projections on their <unk> , minute single eyes , <unk> antennæ , probosciformed mouths , and only three pair of natatory legs ; what diverse beings , with scarcely anything in common , and yet all belonging to the same species !

[ 63 ] this is one of the rare cases in which , after much deliberation , and with the advice of several distinguished naturalists , i have departed from the rules of the british association ; for it <name> be seen that mitella of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , are both prior to pollicipes of leach ; yet , as the latter name has been universally adopted throughout europe and north <name> , and has been extensively used in geological works , it appears to me to be as useless as hopeless to attempt any change .
it may be observed that the genus pollicipes was originally proposed by sir <name> hill ( 'history of animals , ' vol .
iii , p. 170 ) , in <unk> , but as this was before the discovery of the <unk> system , by the rules it is absolutely excluded as of any authority .
in my opinion , under all these circumstances , it would be mere <unk> to go back to <unk> 's <unk> der <unk> ' for the name mitella ,  a work little known , and displaying entire ignorance regarding the cirripedia .
<unk> ab 18 <unk> ad 100 et <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : sub-rostrum <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> valves from 18 to above 100 in number : latera of the lower whorl numerous , with their lines of growth directed downwards : sub-rostrum always present : peduncle <unk> .
hermaphrodite ; filamentary appendages either none , or numerous and seated on the prosoma and at the bases of the first pair of cirri ; labrum bullate ; trophi various ; olfactory orifices generally highly prominent ; caudal appendages <unk> and spinose , or <unk> .
attached to fixed , or less commonly to floating objects , in the warmer temperate , and tropical seas .
it has been remarked , under scalpellum , how imperfectly that genus is separated from pollicipes ; and we have seen under scalpellum villosum that the addition of a few small valves to the lower whorl , would convert it into a pollicipes , most closely allied to p .
sertus and spinosus .
it has also been shown , that the six recent species of pollicipes might be divided into three genera , of which p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus , would form one thoroughly natural genus , as natural as lepas and the earlier genera ; p .
mitella would form a second ; and p .
sertus and p .
spinosus a third ; but i have acted to the best of my judgment in at present retaining the six species together .
as far as the valves of the capitulum are concerned , it would be very difficult to separate p .
mitella from p .
sertus and spinosus .
<unk> the number of valves in the capitulum has in this genus acquired its maximum .
the number varies considerably in the same species , and even on opposite sides of the same individual , and generally increases with age .
it is more important , that the number of the whorls in p .
cornucopia , and in the two following closely-allied forms , also increases with age .
in p .
sertus and p .
spinosus , even the number of the whorls varies in different individuals , independently of age .
the valves are arranged alternately with those above and below ; they are generally thick and strong , making the capitulum somewhat massive ; in some species they are subject to much disintegration ; but in others , the apices of the several valves , especially of the <name> and rostrum , are well preserved , and project freely : they are covered with membrane , which , differently from in most species of scalpellum , either does not bear any spines , or only exceedingly minute points .
in all the species there is a sub-rostrum and sub-carina , and often beneath these a second sub-rostrum and sub-carina .
in <unk> specimens there are at least 20 valves in the <unk> whorl .
the <name> is either straight or curved , but never rectangularly bent , and is always of considerable breadth .
none of the valves are added to at their upper ends .
the scuta have a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the valves lie either some little way apart , or more commonly close together .
in p .
mitella the scuta and terga are locked together by a fold , and the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in a peculiar manner , resembling that in which the compartments in the shells of sessile cirripedes fold over each other .
the peduncle is of considerable length in some of the species , and rather short in others ; it is , in every case , clothed with calcified scales .
the scales in the first four species are placed alternately and symmetrically ; they are formed and added to in the same manner as in scalpellum ; they differ in size according to the size of the individual , and consequently the lower scales on the peduncle , formed when the specimen was young , are smaller than the upper scales ; the lower scales are separated from each other by wide interspaces of membrane , owing to the continued growth of the peduncle by the formation of new layers of membrane , and the disintegration of the old outer layers .
each scale is invested by tough membrane ( or has been , for it is often abraded off ) , in the same manner as the valves ; each is furnished with one or more tubuli , in connection with the underlying corium .
in p .
sertus and p .
spinosus , the scales are small , <unk> , and not of equal sizes , and the rows are distant from each other , so that their alternate arrangement is not distinguishable ; in these two species , new scales are formed round the summit of the peduncle , and the growth of each is completed whilst remaining in the uppermost row ; but , besides these normal scales , such as exist in the other species of pollicipes and in scalpellum , new scales are formed in the lower part of the peduncle , which are generally of very irregular shapes , are often larger than the upper ones , are crowded together , and sometimes do not reach the outer surface of the membrane .
this formation of scales in the lower part of the peduncle , independently of the regular rows round the uppermost part , is perhaps a feeble representation of the calcareous cup at the bottom of the peduncle in the genus lithotrya .

size.  most of the species are large : and p .
mitella is the most massive of the pedunculated cirripedes .
the mouth is not placed far from the adductor muscle .
the labrum is highly bullate .
the mandibles have either three or four main teeth ( pl .
x , fig .
1 ) , with often either one or two smaller teeth inserted between the first and second .
the maxillæ ( pl .
x , figs .
13 , 14 ) , have their edges either straight and square , or notched , or more commonly with two or three prominences bearing tufts of finer spines .
the outer maxillæ ( fig .
17 ) generally have a deep notch on their inner edges , but this is not invariable .
the olfactory orifices in most of the species are highly prominent .
cirri.  the first pair is never placed far distant from the second .
the posterior cirri have strong , somewhat protuberant segments ; and between each of the four or five pair of main spines ( pl .
x , fig .
27 ) , there is a rather large tuft of straight , fine , short bristles .
the second and third pair have the basal segments , either of the anterior rami , or of both rami , so thickly clothed with spines ( fig .
25 ) , as to be <unk> : in p .
mitella , however , the third pair is like the three posterior pair in the arrangement of its spines , in this respect resembling the sessile <unk> .
the caudal appendages are either <unk> and spinose , or <unk> : it is remarkable that there should be this difference in such closely allied species as p .
cornucopia and p .
polymerus : the short , obtuse , <unk> caudal appendage of the former species ( fig .
22 ) makes an excellent passage from the <unk> ( fig .
19 ) to the <unk> form , as in p .
mitella .
the stomach , in those species which i opened , is destitute of cæca ; the <unk> glands are arranged in straight lines ; the <unk> is unusually short .
the prosoma is well developed .
in p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus , there are numerous filamentary appendages both on the prosoma , and at the bases of the first pair of cirri : these appendages are occupied by testes , and i suspect stand in relation to the length of the peduncle and consequent great development of the ovaria .
in order to give space for the filamentary appendages , the sack ( generally roughened by small <unk> <unk> ) penetrates more deeply than usual into the upper part of the peduncle .
there are small ovigerous fræna in p .
sertus , p .
spinosus , and p .
mitella : in the three other species , the <unk> or fold occupies the usual position on each side , and is large ; but in one specimen carefully examined by me , i was unable to see any glands ; and in another specimen , the ovigerous lamellæ were not attached to the fræna ; hence i conclude that the fræna are functionless in these three species .
affinities.  i have already remarked on the close relationship between this genus and scalpellum ; there is also some affinity with lithotrya .
<unk>  all over the world .
the p .
cornucopia ranges from scotland to teneriffe : the p .
polymerus is found in opposite hemispheres in the pacific ocean , extending from california to at least as far as <unk> south of the equator .
geological <unk>  having so lately given , in the <unk> of the <unk> society , ' a full account of all the fossil species known , i <name> not repeat here the conclusions there arrived at .
i <name> only state , that species of pollicipes are found in all the formations , extending from the lower <unk> to the upper tertiary beds .

according to mr. w. thompson ( 'annals of nat .

vol .
xiii , p. 436 ) , it has been found attached to <unk> near dublin .
capitulum , <unk> triangular , massive : valves close together , rather thick , with their exterior surfaces convex , naked , except in the lower parts , where united together by tough , <unk> membrane , destitute of spines .
the edges of the orifice are widely bordered by membrane , coloured fine crimson red .
the valves , in a specimen with a capitulum above three quarters of an inch long , were 52 in number ; in a specimen one fifth of an inch long , only between 20 and 30 .
two whorls of valves are distinct beneath the <name> and rostrum .
in one specimen in mr. cuming 's collection , with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , there were three whorls beneath the rostrum , and four beneath the <name> .
the scuta , terga , and <name> are much larger than the other valves .
scuta , oval , the basal and <unk> margins sweeping into each other , and the apex pointed ; internally ( pl .
vii , fig .
1 a ) the pit for the adductor muscle is deep .
terga , larger than the scuta , internally ( fig .
1 a ) slightly concave ; carinal margin much curved and protuberant ; basal <name> blunt ; scutal margin either curved with the upper part straight , or formed of two almost distinct lines , corresponding with the tergal margin of the scutum , and with one of the sides of the upper latus .
<name> , much curved , extending far up between the terga , internally deeply concave , widening much from the top to the bottom ; basal margin highly protuberant , with a central portion either truncated and very slightly hollowed out , or bluntly and rectangularly pointed , with the apex itself rounded .
rostrum , not one third of the length of the <name> , concave , triangular , with the basal margin slightly protuberant .
of the other valves , including the sub-carina and sub-rostrum , the shape of their inner surfaces is sub-triangular , with the basal margin convex ; externally the umbones are pointed , and slightly curled inwards , so as to overlap each other like tiles : the smaller valves , however , of the lower whorls ( fig .
1 a ) are more or less transversely elongated , so as to become almost elliptic instead of triangular .
of the latera , the upper pair , which corresponds to the interspace between the scuta and terga , is the largest , but barely exceeds in size the pair answering to the carinal latera in scalpellum , which lie between the terga and <name> : the next largest pair is the rostral , or that between the scuta and rostrum .
some , however , of the lower latera are of nearly equal size .
peduncle , narrower , but generally longer than the capitulum ; upper part encased with small calcareous scales , with their apices curved inwards , and overlapping each other .
the inner surface of each scale is triangular , with the basal margin protuberant .
the scales continue to grow or be added to , only in about the ten upper whorls , which form but a small part of the whole peduncle ; in the lower part , the scales become further and further separated from each other .
the surface of attachment , in full-grown specimens , is broad ; but in two very young specimens , which i removed with great care after the action of potash , i found the peduncle ending in a <unk> prolongation , such as often occurs in scalpellum vulgare and in lepas fascicularis .
at the extremity of the pointed peduncle , there were seated the larval prehensile antennæ , of which the following measurements are given to show how minute they are .
<unk> length , from apex of disc , to the further edge of the basal articulation <unk> breadth of basal segment , in broadest part <unk> hoof-like disc , length of <unk> ultimate segment , entire length of <unk> " " breadth , in broadest part <unk> the disc resembles a broad , rounded hoof , very little longer than broad , and narrowed in at the heel ; the apex is not at all pointed , and bears some minute and thin spines .
there is one large spine on the under side of the disc ; and another on the basal segment , on the outside , in the usual position .
the ultimate segment is long and thin ; it has a notch on the inner side ( the segment supposed to be stretched forward ) , bearing two or three long <unk> spines ; and there are three or four other spines on the summit : altogether there is a close resemblance with the antennæ in scalpellum , excepting that the hoof-like disc is not here pointed .
<unk>  valves internally tinted , in parts , grey ; peduncle , brown ; corium of sack , <unk> , of peduncle , <name> <unk> brown ; cirri , banded <unk> , and with the front surfaces of the segments , <unk> .
edge of the orifice of sack , fine crimson red .
the specimen here described had been dried for a few weeks , and was then moistened .
<unk>  the largest specimen which i have seen , in mr. <unk> collection , had a capitulum 1 and <unk> of an inch long ; a fine specimen , from teneriffe , was <unk> in length .
in a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and about the same in breadth , there were eighteen valves ; so that , besides the principal valves , five pair of latera , the sub-carina , and sub-rostrum , were already developed , and on the upper part of the peduncle , there were many calcareous scales .
filamentary appendages.  the prosoma is well-developed , with thirteen or fourteen pair of short , blunt filaments , placed close together in two longitudinal rows ; those nearest the thorax are the longest ; outside this double row , on each side , there is a row of <unk> , indicating a tendency to the formation of two other rows of filaments .
there is a pair of longer filaments , one on each side of the mouth , pointing upwards , and thinly clothed with long spines ; at the bases of the first pair of cirri there is a second pair of filaments , shorter and bearing a few minute spines .
the bottom of the sack is studded with small rounded <unk> , with roughened summits .
mouth , not placed very far from the adductor muscle .
labrum , highly bullate , equalling , in its longitudinal diameter , the rest of the mouth ; upper part square , not overhanging the lower part ; there are some small teeth on the crest .
palpi , oval , outer and inner margins nearly alike , thickly clothed with spines .
mandibles , with three very strong , yellow teeth ; inferior point broad , coarsely pectinated .
in one specimen , on one side , the third tooth was represented by two smaller teeth .
the maxillæ bear three conspicuous tufts of fine bristles , separated by larger spines ; the first tuft is placed close to the two , upper , large , but <unk> spines ; the second tuft is placed in the middle , and the third at the inferior <name> .
the two latter tufts stand on prominences ; between the two upper tufts there are three pair , and between the two lower tufts four or more pair of rather strong spines : ( see the figure , 13 , pl .
x , in the allied p .
polymerus . )
outer maxillæ , with the inner edge divided in the middle by a conspicuous notch , and with the bristles above and below short , making two equal combs .
on the exterior surface , the bristles are longer and more spread out .
olfactory orifices prominent , protected by a punctured swelling between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
cirri , short and rather thick ; the first pair is not far removed from the second .
the segments of the three posterior pair are somewhat protuberant , bearing six pair of short , strong spines , graduated in length , between which there is a very thick , longitudinal brush of short , fine , straight bristles , of which the lower ones are the longest ; some thick , minute spines arise from the upper lateral edges of the segments .
the spines in the dorsal tufts are short , much crowded , and of nearly equal length ; see figure , 27 , pl .
x , in the allied p .
polymerus .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had seventeen segments , the first cirrus had , in the shorter ramus , eight segments , of which the lower four were thick and protuberant , with the spines doubly serrated .
in this same specimen , the anterior ramus of the second cirrus had twelve segments , of which the five basal ones were highly protuberant , and thickly clothed with <unk> spines .
in the third cirrus the basal segments of the anterior ramus are highly protuberant .
the basal segments in the posterior rami of both these cirri , are slightly protuberant , but otherwise resemble the segments in the three posterior pair .
the caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
22 ) , in full-grown specimens , just exceed in length the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; they are nearly cylindrical , bluntly pointed , with five oblique imperfect articulations ; the lower or basal articulations can not be traced all round , being distinct only on the ventral surface .
there is a row of short spines round the upper edge of each segment , with a little , short tuft on the point of the terminal segment .
in a rather young specimen , however , with its capitulum one fifth of an inch long , each appendage certainly consisted of a single segment , with spines only on the summit .
penis purple , with excessively short and fine spines in tufts , chiefly near the extremity .
in a specimen with a capitulum only one fifth of an inch long , the penis consisted of a mere pointed <unk> , not so long as the caudal appendage , and therefore equalling in length only the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
ovigerous <unk>  i could see none , though there were two large lamellæ in the sack .
the ova were <unk> , but they had been dried and then placed in spirits .
the ova were wonderfully numerous , oval , much elongated , and <unk> of an inch in length .

the resemblance of this species is so close to p .
cornucopia , that it is quite useless to do more than point out the few points of difference .
valves of the capitulum and scales of the peduncle , coloured ( after having been in spirits , ) <unk> .
in a specimen in which the capitulum was <unk> of an inch in length , there were three whorls of valves below the <name> ; in this large specimen altogether there were about eighty valves ; in <unk> specimens , the number is about the same as in p .
cornucopia .
the upper latus , ( viewed internally , ) has an area about twice as large as that latus , which corresponds to the interspace between the <name> and terga ; whereas in p .
cornucopia the upper latus is only slightly larger than this same valve .
the apex of the basal internal margin of the <name> is here rounded , instead of being square , as is generally the case with p .
cornucopia .
the strong membranous margin of the orifice of the sack , in its upper part , is almost one third as wide as the widest part of the terga , whereas in p .
cornucopia it is only one fourth of this same width .
the peduncle apparently is rather longer , compared with p .
cornucopia , and the calcareous scales on it perhaps a little larger in proportion .
in a very young specimen , with the capitulum barely exceeding <unk> of an inch in length , i could distinguish the sub-rostrum , sub-carina , the upper , and some of the lower latera .
filamentary appendages.  these , in a <unk> specimen , are arranged on the prosoma in four longitudinal approximate rows , there being twelve in each row ; those in the two outer rows are only half the length of those in the two inner rows ; those nearest the thorax are the longest ; there are some <unk> outside the outer rows .
in a very large specimen with its capitulum <unk> in length , these filaments were very much more numerous , and some were placed on the first segment of the thorax , and at the bases of several of the posterior cirri .
some of the filaments are bifid , <unk> , and even branched .
in all the specimens , at the bases of the first pair of cirri , there are , on each side , a pair of filaments , ( one below the other , ) pointing upwards , less than half as long as those on the prosoma : also on each side of the mouth , there is a longer and thicker filament , pointing upwards , with a few very minute scattered spines on it ; the apices of these three pair of filaments , as well as of some of the others , are roughened with very minute pectinated scales .
all these filaments were gorged with the branching testes .
mouth.  the parts are closely similar to those in p .
cornucopia ; in the mandibles , the interspace between the third tooth and the inferior <name> , is slightly pectinated : in the maxillæ , there are six or eight pairs of spines between the two upper tufts of fine spines .
cirri.  these are in most respects similar , to those of p .
cornucopia .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had eighteen segments , the shorter ramus of the first pair had ten segments , of which the five lower segments were thick and clothed with doubly serrated spines .
in the second cirrus the anterior ramus had fifteen segments , of which the four basal ones were highly protuberant , and thickly clothed with spines .
these spines , and some on the third cirrus , and a few on the first cirrus , have peculiar bent teeth , presently to be described under p .
polymerus .
these singularly toothed spines are absent in p .
cornucopia .
from the above <name> , we see that the first and second pairs of cirri have more segments in proportion to the sixth pair , than in p .
cornucopia ; and in the second pair , a fewer proportional number of the basal segments are protuberant and thickly clothed with spines .
caudal appendages , shorter than the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with only four articulations ; rather constricted near the base .
the ovigerous fræna consist of very long and prominent folds , thinning out to nothing towards the bases of the scuta , but not furnished , as far as i could see , with glands , and therefore not normally functional .
diagnosis with p. <unk>  the <unk> colour of the valves alone suffices .
there is a very slight difference , in the larger proportional size of the upper latera , and in the outline of the basal margin of the <name> .
in the maxillæ there is , in p .
elegans , a greater width between the two upper tufts of fine spines .
in the cirri , the segments in the first pair , are more than half as many as those in the sixth pair ; in the anterior ramus of the second pair , only <unk> of the segments are protuberant and <unk> , whereas in p .
cornucopia <unk> are in this condition .

capitulum , but little compressed , broad , with the scuta and terga placed in a more oblique direction , with respect to the peduncle , than is usual , so that the line of orifice forms an unusually small <name> with the basal margin of the capitulum .
the capitulum is composed of several whorls of valves , which gradually decrease in size from above downwards .
in a <unk> specimen there were four whorls under the rostrum ; in the lowest of these whorls , there were between eighty and ninety valves , and in the whole capitulum from one hundred and seventy , to one hundred and eighty .
the valves in the lower whorls are not of equal sizes .
viewed externally , the valves seem to touch and overlap each other ; viewed internally ( pl .
vii , fig .
2 a ) they are found to be just separated from each other by transparent membrane ; none of the valves are articulated together .
the outer surfaces of nearly all the valves , except in the two last formed whorls , are much disintegrated , and seem to be composed of alternate white and brown layers of shell .
the membrane connecting the valves , as well as that of the peduncle , ( in specimens long kept in spirits , ) is brown ; but in some dried specimens , there are indications of its having been coloured crimson ( as in p .
cornucopia ) , round the orifice and between the valves .
scuta , irregularly oval , convex , narrow at the upper end ; basal margin may be almost said to be formed of three short , unequal margins , corresponding with the rostrum , the rostral and the adjoining latus .
the edge corresponding with the latter , is the best marked , and is generally slightly hollowed out , as if a piece had been broken off .
the <unk> margin is curved and protuberant .
the umbo projects a little over the scutal margin of the terga .
terga , projecting beyond the other valves to an unusually small degree , broadly oval ; basal <name> bluntly pointed , apex rounded , blunt ; scutal margin , hollowed out to receive the upper part of the tergal margin of the scuta ; carinal margin curved and protuberant ; occludent margin consists of two short sides at right angles to each other .
the whole valve in length and area is about equal to the scuta ; internally , somewhat concave .
<name> , triangular , rather narrow , internally deeply concave , very slightly curled inwards ; basal margin protuberant , with a large central portion considerably hollowed out .
rostrum , triangular , of nearly the same shape as the <name> , but only one third of its length , internally very slightly concave , and with the basal margin various , being either truncated or <unk> prominent in the middle .
<unk>  the upper pair ( corresponding to the interval between the scuta and terga ) is only a trifle larger than the latera immediately beneath ; and these only a little larger than those lower down .
in the lowest whorl , the valves are very minute , though still about twice as large as the scales on the peduncle , and of a different shape from them .
the upper latera ( viewed internally ) are almost <unk> , owing to the prominence of the basal margin , but this varies considerably in degree .
the latera in the next whorl are triangular , with the basal margins protuberant and arched , in a less and less degree in the lower whorls , until in the lowest , the valves are elongated transversely .
microscopical <unk>  a valve placed in acid leaves a thick opaque mass , formed of three different kinds of tissue , one having a finely shaded appearance ; a second with a largely hexagonal <unk> structure , and the third thin , transparent , and marked with <unk> lines , which i imagine to be tubes , as <name> be hereafter seen in lithotrya .
near the exterior surface , there are many tubuli .
it appears to me probable that the strong tendency which the valves in this species have to disintegrate , is connected with the unusual quantity of <unk> tissue contained by them .
externally the valves are covered by a strong membrane , either white or yellow , or white streaked with yellow , and marked by lines of growth , and by longitudinal , sinuous , little ridges .
peduncle , in the upper part , of rather less diameter than the capitulum ; twice or thrice as long as it ; tapering a little downwards ; surface of attachment wide and flat .
calcareous scales , minute , symmetrically and closely packed together : each scale is much flattened , and its shape , including the imbedded portion , is that of a spear with its point broken off .
the basal end of each scale is <unk> hollow , and from the layers of growth <unk> to this hollow , there is a false appearance of an open tube running through the scale .
<unk>  the surface of attachment is wide : the two cement-ducts , after running down the sides of the peduncle in a sinuous course , within the longitudinal muscles and close outside the ovarian tubes , pass through the corium , and then separately form the most abrupt loops or folds .
these are represented in pl .
ix , fig .
2 , in which a space about <unk> of an inch square is given , as seen from the outside .
at each of the bends , an aperture has been formed through the membrane of the peduncle , and cement poured forth .
the manner in which the discs of cement ( b ) come out of the two ducts ( a a ) , and reach the external surface , is shown in the section , figure 2 a´ .
the two tubes are firmly attached to the older layers of membrane , and are covered by the <unk> layers .
in a young specimen , the cement-ducts were a little above <unk> of an inch in diameter , which had increased , in a <unk> specimen , to <unk> .
the <unk> are <unk> , seated near each other , high up in the peduncle .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , was three inches in length including the peduncle ; the capitulum was <unk> of an inch long , and one in width .
young <unk>  i examined one with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , measured from the lowest whorl to the tips of the terga ; the width was only <unk> of an inch ; in old specimens the width of the capitulum is greater than the length .
the length of one of the scuta was <unk> of an inch , therefore , greater than the width of the entire capitulum , which is not the case with mature specimens .
besides the scuta and terga , the <name> and rostrum , and three pair of large latera , there was a lower whorl formed of ten or twelve valves , giving altogether to the capitulum of this very small specimen , either twenty-two or twenty-four valves .
shape of body , sack , colours , & c.  from the position of the orifice of the capitulum , the animal 's body is suspended to the scuta in a more transverse direction than is usual .
the prosoma is well-developed , and is distinctly separated from the three posterior thoracic segments , by a band of thin membrane .
the tunic of the basal part of the sack , where it enters the peduncle in a blunt point , is thickened and covered with roughened rounded <unk> .
the corium of the sack under the valves , is coloured ( after spirits ) so dark a brown as to be nearly black ; the cirri and trophi are similar , but with a tinge of <unk> .
filamentary appendages.  of these there were , on the prosoma of one specimen , twelve pairs , and in another specimen fourteen pairs , seated in two approximate rows ; the middle filaments are the longest , equalling about half the diameter of the thorax : each is flattened , and tapers but little towards its summit , which is roughened with microscopical crests serrated on both sides ; on the summit , also , there are a few bristles and some very short , thick , minute spines .
these appendages are directed rather towards each other , and towards the thorax .
i do not doubt that their <name> vary according to the size of the specimen .
i believe that they are occupied by testes .
outside these filaments , on each side of the prosoma , there are two very irregular rows of <unk> , intermediate in length between the filaments and the rounded <unk> at the bottom of the sack .
beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , there is on each side , a short appendage , with a few bristles on its summit .
lastly , on each side of the middle of the mouth , on the prosoma , there is a longer appendage , dark-coloured , furnished with a few scattered bristles on its sides and apex , and directed upwards and a little towards the adductor scutorum muscle .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate , but with the uppermost part not more bullate than the lower part , and therefore not overhanging it ; basal margin much produced ; crest with some small blunt teeth and some bristles .
the inner fold of the labrum is much thickened , yellow , punctured , and with a tuft of fine bristles on each side .
palpi , approaching each other but not touching , <unk> , or with broad and square extremities , thickly fringed with serrated bristles .
mandibles with three unusually strong teeth , slightly graduated in size , with the inferior <name> very coarsely pectinated ; the lower edges of the main teeth are roughened .
maxillæ , ( pl .
x. fig .
13 ) .
spinose edge about half the length of the mandibles ; the two upper spines are unusually strong ; close under , and almost hidden by them , there is a tuft of fine spines ; in the middle there is a second similar tuft mounted on a prominence ; and at the inferior <name> there is a third tuft , also mounted on a rather wider prominence , not quite accurately figured .
in the interspaces between these tufts there are three or four pairs of spines of the usual appearance and projecting just beyond the fine tufts ; the upper of the two interspaces is rather narrower , but rather deeper , than the lower interspace .
<unk> very long , irregularly shaped , like an <unk> , with a remarkable elbow near its attachment ; apex slightly enlarged , thin and rounded .
outer <unk>  on the inner margin there is a deep and conspicuous notch , above and beneath which , there is a compact row of serrated bristles ; exteriorly the bristles are rather longer .
olfactory orifices very prominent , pointing obliquely towards each other .
cirri.  posterior cirri moderately long , much curled , with the segments ( pl .
x , fig .
27 ) flattened and wide ; the anterior surface <unk> protuberant , supporting six pairs of spines , of which the lower ones approach each other ; between these spines there is a large tuft of very fine spines , of which the central ones are the longest ; there is an upper lateral group of very short strong spines ; dorsal tufts composed of short , fine numerous spines .
first pair seated close to the second pair , short , having in both rami eight segments , whereas in the same individual the second pair , which is nearly twice as long , had thirteen , and the sixth pair eighteen segments .
rami of the first pair nearly equal in length , with their segments , excepting the two upper ones , thickly paved with bristles , in the midst of which a tuft of fine spines , as in the posterior cirri , may be distinguished ; the dorsal tufts <unk> the whole of each segment ; the <unk> anterior surfaces are protuberant chiefly in the upper part , so that they are oblique .
the posterior ( ? )
ramus has its segments much wider than those on the other ramus ; and amongst the common spines , in the third and fourth segments , ( counting from the bottom , ) there are some very strong spines with their upper ends coarsely and doubly pectinated , each tooth being <unk> bent into a rectangular elbow .
in the fifth segment , some of the spines are doubly pectinated with simple teeth ; and most of the spines are doubly serrated .
the second ( pl .
x , fig .
25 ) and third cirri have the five basal segments ( <unk> of the whole number in the second cirrus , and <unk> in the third cirrus ) of their anterior rami , extremely broad , protuberant , and paved with serrated bristles , amongst which , ( except on the actual lowest segment , ) there are some simply pectinated spines , and others with their teeth <unk> , exactly as in the first cirrus .
the basal segments of the posterior rami of the second and third cirri , differ from the three posterior cirri only in the spines being slightly more numerous ; but none of them are pectinated .
pedicels , rather short ; the upper segment resembles , in the arrangement of its spines , the segments of the posterior cirri ; the lower segment is longer than the upper , and has two tufts of fine spines , between the two rows of long spines .
in the second and third cirri , these two intermediate tufts on the lower segment of the pedicel , are not so distinctly separated from each other .
caudal appendages , very small , <unk> , blunt and rounded ; tips bearing a few , very short , thick spines .
alimentary <unk>  oesophagus , somewhat curved at the lower end , where it enters the stomach , which has no cæca ; <unk> , unusually short , extending from the anus only to the base of the fifth pair of cirri .
within the stomach , from top to bottom , there were thousands of a <unk> <unk> crustacean .
generative system.  both ovaria and testes are largely developed ; the former fill the long peduncle ; the testes enter both the pedicels of the cirri , and the filamentary appendages on the prosoma ; vesiculæ seminales very large , reflected at their ends , extending across each side of the stomach .
penis rather small , coloured purplish , with numerous little tufts of bristles .
<unk>  in some specimens in the british museum , collected by sir j. <name> , in the southern ocean , and in another older set from an unknown source , several parts of the outer tunic of the animal 's body presented the remarkable fact of being calcified , but to a variable degree ; whereas in several specimens from california , there was no vestige of this <unk> .
considering it most improbable that the <unk> of the integuments should be a variable character , i most carefully compared the above-mentioned sets of specimens , valve by valve , trophi by trophi , and cirri by cirri , and found no other difference of any kind ; therefore i can not hesitate to consider both to be the same species .
the first southern specimen which i examined presented the following characters : on the prosoma there was a central longitudinal band , formed of a thin , brittle , <unk> calcified layer , which became irregularly rather narrow towards the thorax ; on each side it sent out six or seven irregular rectangular plates , which surrounded and supported the bases of the two rows of filamentary appendages ; and outside these , some of the <unk> projections also had their bases surrounded by small , calcified , separate rings .
the thoracic segments corresponding with the second , fourth , fifth , and sixth cirri had , on each side , an elongated calcified plate ; on the ventral surface of the thorax , between the first and second cirri , there were two minute plates .
in all the cirri , excepting the first pair , the segments of the rami , and in the three posterior pairs , the segments of the pedicels , had their dorsal surfaces strengthened by oblong , quadrilateral , calcified shields , the upper margins of which are notched for the dorsal tufts of spine , and the two lateral margins are also slightly hollowed out ; these are represented in figure 27 .
the lower segments of the pedicels of some of the cirri , had an additional calcified plate on the <unk> face .
these plates are of a <unk> or yellowish colour , and are conspicuous : the degree of <unk> differs considerably ; some are quite brittle and very thin , others half horny , and <unk> only slightly in acids .
after having been placed in acid , there is no apparent difference between the parts before occupied by the calcified plates and the surrounding membrane ; these plates , however , are not superficial , but consist of several of the laminæ , which together compose the ordinary integument , in a calcified condition .
like the integuments of the body , and unlike the valves of the capitulum , these calcified plates are thrown off at each exuviation .
neither the exact shape nor number of the plates corresponded in different individuals , nor even on opposite sides of the same individual .
the margins of the plates often have a sinuous corroded appearance ; they are , moreover , often penetrated by minute rounded holes , that is , by minute , rounded , <unk> portions .
in one specimen from the antarctic expedition , there were only here and there a single shield on the segments of the posterior rami , and no plate on the prosoma .
of two specimens in another and older set in the british museum , from an unknown locality , both had shields on the segments of the cirri , but only one had the large plate on the prosoma .
i may here mention that in one specimen , in which the calcified plates were most developed , and which was nearly ready to moult , there were , within the filamentary appendages on the prosoma , small irregular balls of calcareous matter , appearing to me as if calcareous matter had been <unk> excreted , and not like a provision for the future .
<unk>  this species , in the present state of our knowledge , seems to range further than any other of the genus , extending from upper california , ( lat .
<unk> to <unk> n. , ) across the pacific , to at least <unk> s. , perhaps much farther south , for it was collected during the antarctic expedition , and <unk> was the highest latitude traversed by that expedition .
affinities.  this species is closely related to p .
cornucopia and p .
elegans , but differs rather more from them , than these two do from each other .
in the capitulum the chief distinctive characters are  the more perfect graduation in size , and the greater number , ( taking <unk> specimens , ) of the whorls of latera  the darker colours  the central part of the basal margin of the <name> in this species , being considerably <unk>  the peculiar form of the basal margin of the scuta  and lastly , the scutal margin of the terga being more hollowed out .
in the animal 's body , the most obvious distinctive character is the <unk> caudal appendage .
this species agrees with p .
elegans , in the presence of the singular <unk> teeth , on some of the spines in the first three pairs of cirri .

capitulum , compressed , consisting of the scuta , terga , <name> , rostrum , and a large pair of upper latera , with a single lower whorl of smaller valves ; these latter vary from 22 in very small specimens , to 26 in large specimens .
the capitulum , therefore , is formed of at most 34 valves ; but in the largest specimen seen by me , the capitulum being <unk> of an inch in width , there were only 32 valves .
in the smallest , namely , with a capitulum <unk> of an inch in width , there were 30 valves .
the valves are remarkably strong , and formed of white <name> matter ; they are closely approximate , and overlap each other : the scuta and terga are articulated together by a fold ; the apices of the valves are either worn and disintegrated , or they project freely like horns beyond the sack , to a much greater extent than in any other recent species of the genus : even a considerable portion of the scuta projects obliquely upwards .
the exterior surfaces of the valves ( when not worn ) are covered by a strong yellow membrane , and the upper free parts are generally attached together for some little length by this same membrane .
the valves are plainly marked by the zones of successive growth ; and most of them are ribbed and furrowed slightly , from their umbones to their basal margins .
the yellow external membrane , examined <unk> , is marked by , or rather formed of , numerous <unk> , crossed by longitudinal <unk> ridges .
the tubuli are not numerous , and of small diameter .
scuta ( pl .
vii , fig .
3 a´ , a ) triangular , with the apex more or less produced , according to the state of its preservation , and a little curved towards the terga ; basal margin , and in some degree the <unk> margin , arched , and slightly protuberant ; occludent margin thickened , slightly prominent , with the inner edge covered by the yellow membrane , like the exterior surface of the valve .
the upper part of the <unk> margin <unk> a little the edge of the tergum , and receives it in a furrow ,  the two valves being thus locked together .
this furrow lies in the <unk> , <unk> portion , and extends up to the apex ; it is of variable depth .
internally the scuta are concave , and in some old specimens to a high degree .
in these latter , the basal margin , towards the <unk> side , is strongly sinuous ; the prominences are formed by the terminations of the external longitudinal ridges , and correspond to the interspaces between the valves of the lower whorl .
these ridges , which are interesting , from throwing light on similar ridges in some fossil species , are present , both on old and young specimens , and run from the apex of the valve , in a slightly curved line , to the <unk> half of the basal margin , where , as we have just seen , they sometimes form prominences .
they consist of three or even four obscure , almost confluent , ridges , of which the middle one is generally ( but not always ) the smallest : together they cover the whole of that part of the scutum , which is not <unk> along the basal margin by the rostrum and large upper latus ; and they seem evidently due to the growth of the shell in this interspace having been freer .
so , again , the three or four small , confluent , component ridges have the same relation to the interspaces between the small latera of the lower whorl .
terga large , <unk> , with the internal growing surface ( fig .
3 a´ b ) , almost <unk> ; basal <name> blunt , rounded ; exteriorly , from the apex to the basal <name> there is a rather broad , very slight prominence , which bears the same relation to the <name> and upper latus , as do the compound ridges on the scuta to the rostrum and upper latus .
the upper part of the scutal margin forms a <unk> , rounded shoulder , though variable in its degree of prominence , in relation to the variable depth of the recipient furrow in the scuta .
externally , parallel to the occludent margin , and close below the prominent shoulder , just mentioned , there is a slight and variable depression , extending up to the apex of the valve .
this depression is due to the prominence , variable in degree , of the tergal edge of the recipient furrow in the scuta .
<name> , triangular , strong , inwardly bowed , generally with a large upper portion freely projecting ; exteriorly with a narrow , sharp , central ridge or keel , which is solid , the interior concavity not reaching so deep ; inner growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ , b ) deeply concave , triangular .
basal margin square  that is , transverse to the longer axis of the <name> , or it even rises ( as is best seen in the <unk> ) a little towards the exterior keel .
on each side of the central exterior keel , there is a narrow longitudinal ridge , corresponding with the interspace between the sub-carina and the <unk> latus of the lower whorl ; the latus next to the sub-carina is very small , and <unk> the ridge itself .
in a very large specimen , these lateral longitudinal ridges formed ( as they likewise did on the rostrum ) slight prominences on the basal margin .
in one specimen the <name> was straight .
rostrum closely similar , in almost every respect , to the <name> , even to the exterior , lateral , longitudinal ridges , and in their relation to the interspaces in the lower whorl .
the valve is generally not so long , but rather wider , more inwardly bowed , and with the exterior solid keel less prominent than in the <name> .
the inner growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ d ) is less acuminated at its upper end .
upper pair of <unk>  these are much larger than the remaining valves of the lower whorl ; they are straight , triangular , and much acuminated , with their apices , when well preserved , extending far up , for fully three fourths of the height of the scuta .
they nearly equal in length the <name> .
the growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ , a ) is flat , triangular , in <unk> specimens forming only a third or a quarter of the entire length of the valve .
in the middle of the basal margin there is a very slight prominence , corresponding with a slight external central ridge , formed as heretofore by the overlapping of two of the valves of the lower whorl .
basal margin nearly on a level with that of the scuta and with the basal points of the terga .
the foregoing eight larger valves form the main cavity , in which the body of the animal is lodged .
valves of the lower <unk>  these , seen externally , seem to belong to more than one whorl , but internally their basal margins stand on a level .
they vary in number , as already stated , from 22 to 26 .
i have seen an individual with a valve more on one side than on the other .
they are of unequal sizes , but they are rather variable in this respect : the largest are not above half the size of the upper latera : three or four pairs , together with the sub-rostrum ( e ) and sub-carina ( c ) , are always larger than the others : these two latter valves differ from the others only in being more concave .
seen externally , all these valves project considerably , and curl a little inwards , with their apices generally worn and truncated .
viewed internally ( fig .
3 b´ ) , whilst the valves are in their proper places , the inner and growing surfaces of the smallest are seen to be triangular ,  of the larger , some are <unk> , and others quadrilateral with the upper side much longer than the lower .
these latter valves overlap the upper parts of the little valves on both sides of them ; the <unk> valves overlap a valve on one side , and are <unk> on the other ; the triangular valves are <unk> on both sides .
the corium lining the capitulum is produced into narrow purple crests , which enter the interstices between the valves , more especially along the line separating the upper and lower whorls .
there is , also , a distinct flattened , tapering , free projection of corium , which enters between the <name> and sub-carina ; and another between the rostrum and sub-rostrum .
peduncle , much compressed , short , rarely as long as the capitulum ; in one very large specimen it was extremely short , barely one fifth of the length of the capitulum .
the attached portion , which is moderately pointed in young specimens , becomes extremely broad in old specimens .
the calcified scales sometimes differ a little in size , in specimens of the same age : they are always compactly and symmetrically arranged : in old specimens they are much larger than in young ones : each scale has , at first , a transversely elliptic growing base , which ultimately becomes nearly circular .
exteriorly the tips of the scales are always disintegrated ; they are sometimes <unk> , owing to the scales having been <unk> to after a period of reduced growth .
the scales are fringed with brown <unk> membrane .
<unk>  at the base of the peduncle , the two cement-ducts running together , twist about in a singular manner , and at their bends pour forth cement .
according to the age of the specimen , the ducts vary in diameter from <unk> to <unk> of an inch .
the two cement glands are small and difficult to find ; they are <unk> , with two ovarian tubes entering each .
they lie close together , in nearly the centre of the peduncle , and less than half-way down it .
this proximity of the two <unk> , and their position low down the peduncle , are of interest in relation to the position of these same glands in the sessile cirripedes .
size and <unk>  this is the largest and most massive species in the family .
i have seen one specimen in the british museum , from the coast of <name> , <unk> inches across the capitulum , and 1.5 in length , with the valves surprisingly thick .
the relative width and length of the capitulum varies .
the sack ( in specimens long kept in spirits ) is dirty purple , and exteriorly between the scuta , dark purple .
the cirri , trophi , penis , caudal appendages , three posterior segments of the thorax , and the abdominal surface are <unk> purple .
<unk>  thorax remarkably compressed and <unk> ; prosoma pretty well developed .
extending from the base of the second cirrus , to nearly a central line on the thorax , there is on each side a rounded ridge : there is a second transverse ridge , running from the base of the first cirrus to near the adductor scutorum muscle : these ridges seem formed merely to allow of the larger development of the testes .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate ; crest without any teeth , but with a few minute hairs .
the inner fold of the labrum forming the supra-oesophageal cavity , is thickened , and shows a trace of a central line of junction , as in sessile cirripedes .
palpi ( pl .

mandibles ( pl .

1 ) , with five teeth , of which the second is very small ; inferior <name> coarsely pectinated .
maxillæ ( fig .
14 ) , with a deep narrow notch ( bearing some fine spines ) beneath the two upper great spines , which stand on a prominence ; edge straight , bearing fourteen or fifteen pairs of spines : on the inferior <name> there is an obscure tuft of shorter and finer spines : <unk> long , sinuous , and slender .
outer maxillæ ( fig .
17 ) , with the inner margin divided by a deep notch into two lobes , of which the upper one is rather short ; both are clothed with a compact row of short bristles ; exterior margin with longer bristles .
olfactory orifices , large and prominent to an unusual degree .
cirri , moderately long and curled ; the four posterior pair are alike ; each segment has its anterior face somewhat protuberant , and bears six pairs of long spines , with a rather large , narrow tuft of intermediate spines , some of which are finely and doubly serrated .
the dorsal tufts consist of short , thick spines , with some fine longer ones .
the first cirrus is seated near the second ; its rami are slightly unequal in length ; lower segments paved with bristles ; one ramus is thicker than the other , and some of its segments have coarsely pectinated spines .
second cirrus has the five basal segments of its anterior ramus highly protuberant , and paved with bristles , of which some are coarsely pectinated ; the basal segments of the posterior ramus are rather more thickly clothed with bristles than are the posterior cirri , but otherwise resemble them .
the third cirrus , as already stated , is exactly like the three posterior pairs ; and this is a very unusual circumstance .
on the dorsal surfaces and sides of the pedicels of the posterior cirri , there are some scattered , short , thick , minute spines .
caudal appendages , <unk> : in a <unk> specimen , each contained eight segments , which reached half-way up the upper segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
lower segments flattened ; the upper , tapering , and cylindrical ; all have their upper margins furnished with stiff , little spines .
in a young specimen ( only <unk> of an inch in length , including the peduncle ) , the caudal appendage contained only four segments , and the tip did not reach to the upper edge of the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
stomach , without cæca .
generative system.  vesiculæ seminales not reflexed at their broad ends ; white , spotted with black .
testes , pear-shaped , borne on long footstalks : penis covered with minute bristles , in little tufts arranged in straight lines .
the ovarian tubes fill up the peduncle to its base , but do not surround the sack ; they are of small diameter , and simply branched .
there is a very narrow ovigerous <unk> , with a straight edge , lying on each side under the line of junction between the scutum and upper latus .
affinities.  this species differs from all the others of the genus , in the third cirrus resembling exactly the three posterior pairs .
in most of its characters  namely , in the symmetrical arrangement of the scales on the peduncle , in the considerable size of the valves of the lower whorl , in the general approximation of the valves , in the <unk> caudal appendages , in the form of the outer maxillæ , in the prominent olfactory orifices , in the basal segments of the anterior ramus alone of the second cirrus being paved with bristles , there is more affinity to p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus than to p .
sertus and p .
spinosus .
in the scuta and terga being articulated together , in the union of all the valves by stiff membrane , in the peculiar manner in which the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other , in the corium entering between some of the valves in <unk> appendages , in the near equality of size of the rostrum and <name> , in the shortness of the peduncle in old specimens , in the position of the <unk> , and lastly in the characters of the third pair of cirri , this species presents a closer affinity to the sessile cirripedes , more especially to the <unk> , than does any other species of any other genus amongst the lepadidæ .
the movements , however , of the four <unk> valves are not at all more independent of the other valves , than in the other pedunculated cirripedes ; and the peduncle is furnished with all its characteristic muscles .

capitulum , flattened , triangular , broad , with the valves varying in number , in full-grown specimens of the same size , from 30 to above 60 ; the scuta , terga , and <name> are very much larger than the other valves ; the rostrum , however , is nearly half the size of the <name> ; the remaining valves are exceedingly small .
in some specimens there is only one whorl under the <name> ; in other specimens there are distinctly two whorls .
the scuta , terga , and <name> stand pretty close together ; they are moderately thick , and are covered , in chief part , by yellowish-brown membrane , which is destitute of spines .
scuta , triangular , broad , basal margin slightly protuberant .
terga , as large as the scuta , flat , regularly oval , basal point blunt and rounded .
<name> very slightly curved , triangular , internally rather deeply concave , basal margin straight .
the inner and growing surface is four <unk> of the entire length of the valve .
in half-grown specimens the apex projects a little outwards .
rostrum , small , much curled inwards ; the basal margin is much hollowed out ; the inner surface is broadly triangular , more than twice as wide as high , and about one fourth of the entire length of the valve .
the remaining valves , about 26 in number , do not correspond on the opposite sides of the same individual , they are exceedingly small , with the sub-carina , sub-rostrum , and three pairs of latera a trifle larger than the lower latera , which are generally arranged in two whorls .
in shape all the latera are nearly alike ; they consist of flattened styles , with their inner surfaces transversely oval , and more or less elongated , the larger ones being most elongated .
peduncle , broad , barely as long as the capitulum .
the calcareous scales are irregularly shaped , minute , elongated and pointed , placed in separate transverse rows , and crowded together in each row .
only the scales in the uppermost row grow regularly ; but some of the lower scales continue to be added to irregularly , and hence are the largest .
on the other hand , the lower part of the peduncle , from the first formed scales having been worn away , is often quite naked .
from this cause , and from the continued and irregular growth of some of the lower scales , the rows in this part of the peduncle , generally become irregular .
the surface of attachment is broad .
in a half-grown specimen , with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch long , all the lower valves were considerably larger in proportion to the scuta , terga , and <name> , than in full-grown individuals .
size and <unk>  length of capitulum in the largest specimen , <unk> of an inch ; breadth , slightly exceeding the length .
colours after having been long in spirits  upper part of sack , thorax , pedicels of cirri , and penis , clouded with fine purple ; cirri banded with the same ; exterior convex surface of the outer and inner maxillæ and palpi dark purple ; prosoma yellow .
the membrane of the peduncle and of the capitulum is dirty yellow , with bands of purple between some of the valves .
filamentary appendages , none .
ovigerous fræna placed near the middle of the basal margin of the scuta ; small , <unk> , with an <unk> ring of bead-like glands ; glands seated on long footstalks .
mouth.  labrum far produced towards the adductor muscle ; upper part highly bullate , nearly equalling the longitudinal diameter of the rest of the mouth , and very slightly overhanging the lower part ; crest with very minute bead-like teeth .
palpi , with their inner margins considerably <unk> , most thickly clothed with spines .

outer maxillæ , with the bristles in front , continuous , and without any notch ; exterior surface with a prominence clothed with long spines .
olfactory orifices slightly prominent .
cirri.  first cirrus placed near to the second ; posterior cirri not much elongated , with their segments slightly protuberant , bearing four pairs of spines , of which the lower pair is small ; spines slightly serrated .
in the lower segments , these spines are exceedingly unequal in length , the inner spines on both rami , not being above one fourth of the length of the outer corresponding spine in each pair .
the tufts intermediate between these pairs , are not very large : on the lateral upper rims there are some strong , short spines : dorsal tufts with short , thick spines .
first cirrus about three fourths as long as the second cirrus , with numerous tapering segments , three or four of the lower ones being thick and protuberant : in the first cirrus there are eleven segments , and in the sixth cirrus , seventeen .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus slightly thicker than the posterior ramus : a few of the basal segments of both rami are protuberant , and thickly clothed with spines .
in the third cirrus , the two rami are nearly equally thick , with some of the basal segments in both clothed , like a brush , with spines .
in these brushes on the first , second , and third cirri , most of the spines are doubly toothed , each tooth being simply conical .

capitulum , much flattened , broad , sub-triangular .
valves exceedingly various in number ; in the largest specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch high , and <unk> of an inch wide , there were only thirty-one valves , and these formed only a single whorl under the <name> and rostrum ; whereas , in another specimen , which was barely <unk> of an inch in length , there were fifty-two valves , and these formed two or three distinct whorls under the <name> .
scuta , terga , <name> , and rostrum , much larger than the other valves .
all are moderately thick , placed rather distant from each other , covered with thick membrane which abounds with tubuli , arranged in rows ; surface apparently smooth , but with a very high power , extremely minute spines can be seen at the extremities of almost all the tubuli .
little bunches of reddish fibrous matter are imbedded in the membrane , like tufts of sea-weed floating in water .
scuta , triangular , basal margin curved , protuberant ; the upper part of the <unk> margin is , also , slightly protuberant .
terga , large , oval , basal <name> broad , square ; lower part of carinal margin straight , upper part narrowed in ; the apex is covered with membrane and projects freely .
<name> , triangular , internally deeply concave , either straight , and with the apex free , or inwardly and considerably curved ; basal margin nearly straight .
rostrum , about half the length of the <name> ; either straight or inwardly curved ; it projects freely for full half its length ; inner growing surface triangular , more than twice as high as wide ; basal margin very slightly hollowed out .
the sub-carina and sub-rostrum are larger than the largest of the latera ; their inner surfaces are transversely elongated , rounded at both ends , and slightly concave ; externally they are pointed , and project outwards ; sometimes the sub-carina , and sometimes the sub-rostrum is the largest .
latera , small , with their inner surfaces transversely elongated , the larger being the most elongated .
externally they are acuminated , and directed upwards ; they project but very little beyond the thick membrane in which they are imbedded .
neither the number , size , nor shape of the latera agree on opposite sides of the same individual ; and it would appear that , occasionally , some of them cease to grow , and disappear .
in the large specimen with only thirty-one valves , the three pairs of latera , corresponding to the upper , rostral , and carinal latera in scalpellum , were larger in a marked manner than the others ; but in the specimen with fifty-four valves , this could hardly be said to be the case .
in this latter specimen , some of the valves in the <unk> whorl were exceedingly minute .
peduncle , broad , about as long as the capitulum ; surface of attachment wide ; calcareous scales minute , placed in transverse rows , which become less and less regular in the lower part .
the scales do not stand very close together ; they are of unequal sizes and irregular outline ; generally <unk> ; calcareous matter is added regularly only to the scales in the uppermost row , and irregularly to some of the lower scales .
the latter , consequently , are the largest , and often much elongated ; they are sometimes of singular and irregular shapes .

filamentary appendages , none , but on the prosoma there are scattered some small <unk> , which are roughened by finely spinose scales , like combs ; these <unk> certainly seem to represent the filaments in pollicipes cornucopia and its two allies .

affinities.  this species makes a very close approach in the general form and relative sizes of all the valves , and in the variability of the number of the whorls , to p .
spinosus ; there is a still closer and more important resemblance , in the inequality and manner of growth of the calcareous scales on the peduncle .
these species differ , in the colour of the membrane covering the valves , and in the greater development of both rostrum and sub-rostrum in p .
sertus .
the rostrum of the latter is longer than half the length of the <name> , and its inner surface is more than twice as high as wide ; and the sub-rostrum is twice as large as any of the latera ,  all points of difference from p. spinosus .
in the characters of the mandibles , and more especially of the outer maxillæ ; in the length of the first pair of cirri ; in both rami of the second and third cirri having their basal segments <unk> , with pectinated spines ; and in the shape of the caudal appendages , there is a close relationship to p .
spinosus , and through this species to scalpellum villosum .
in the little prominence of the olfactory orifices , p. sertus differs from most of the allied forms , excepting p .
spinosus .
in the maxillæ having two prominences bearing fine tufts of bristles , in the roughened knobs on the prosoma , and in the presence , in some individuals , of two or three whorls of valves under the <name> and rostrum , there is a marked tendency in p .
sertus to approach p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus .

[ 65 ] the description of <unk> is so inaccurate , that i should not have recognised it , had not the lithotrya nicobarica , in a bottle in the british museum , borne this name .

peduncle covered with small calcareous scales , those of the upper whorls <unk> ; attached either to a basal calcareous cup , or to a row of discs .
body lodged within the peduncle : mandibles with three teeth , the interspaces being pectinated ; maxillæ various : olfactory orifices slightly prominent : caudal appendages <unk> .
lodged in cavities , bored in calcareous rocks , or shells , or corals ; generally within the tropics .
<unk>  the capitulum is not much compressed , a horizontal section giving an oval figure ; it is placed obliquely on the peduncle , the scuta descending lower than the terga and <name> .
there are eight valves , of which the scuta , terga , and <name> are large ; the rostrum and a pair of latera are very small and often rudimentary .
these three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle , the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size , by not being moulted at each period of exuviation .
the latera <unk> the carinal half of the terga ; i presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in scalpellum .
each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick , and extends over nearly the whole inner surface ; hence the <name> and terga , and to a certain extent the scuta , either actually do project freely much beyond the sack , or would have done so , had not their upper ends been removed ; for the upper and old layers of shell , in most of the species , either scale off or disintegrate and wear away .
a rectangularly projecting rim , serrated by small teeth , is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth , along the external surfaces of each valve ( see upper part of fig .
1 b´ pl .
viii . )
this structure , as well as that of the <unk> scales on the peduncle , is important , for by this means the animal , as we shall presently see , forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded .
the scutum <unk> either about one third or even one half of the entire width of the tergum , and <unk> against a prominent longitudinal ridge on its exterior surface .
in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> , this ridge on the tergum being folded over towards the scutum , forms a conspicuous furrow , receiving the tergal margin of the latter .
in l .
<unk> , there is a second furrow on the carinal side of the tergum , receiving the upper end of the <unk> or growing surface of the <name> .
besides these provisions for holding together the valves , there are , apparently , others for a similar purpose ; thus in each scutum , under the rostral <name> , there is a roughened <unk> tooth , which touches the under side of the little rostrum , and no doubt serves to give attachment to the membrane uniting the three valves together .
in some species , the adjoining basal margins of the scuta and terga , where touching each other , are inflected and roughened ; again in l .
rhodiopus , the carinal angles of the terga are produced into points , and in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> into prominent roughened knobs , which touch two corresponding small knobs , on the upper part of the growing surface of the <name> .
moreover , considerable portions of the inner surfaces of the scuta and terga , are roughened with minute sharp , <unk> points , apparently for the firmer attachment of the corium .
the roughened knobs at the rostral angles of the scuta , no doubt are homologous with the teeth in a similar position on one or both scuta in lepas , and in some fossil species of pollicipes , as in p .
<unk> .
the other projections and roughened surfaces are peculiar to lithotrya .
the growth of all the valves is , as in pollicipes , simply downwards .
the scuta are triangular , with their umbones or centres of growth at the apex ; the tergal margin , as seen from within , is either nearly straight or much hollowed out , accordingly as the scuta simply overlap the terga , or are received in a furrow .
in some of the species there is a distinct pit for the adductor muscle , and in others this can not be distinguished .
<unk>  these present great differences in shape ; but all appear to be modifications , ( as seen internally , ) of a <unk> figure , which seems to be the normal form of the terga in the lepadidæ .
of the lower part of the valve , the whole exterior surface , with the exception of a narrow ridge running from the apex down to the basal <name> , is hidden by the overlapping of the scuta , latera , and <name> .
the <name> , in outline is triangular , with the basal margin in some species extremely protuberant .
in the first four species , the internal surface is concave , in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> it is convex , with a central raised ridge , and consequently the upper <unk> portion of the valve , has a prominent central crest or ridge ; in l .
nicobarica and l .
rhodiopus there is only a trace of this ridge .
the rostrum , as before stated , is always very small ; it , as well as the latera , are most developed in l .
nicobarica , and least in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> ; generally only a few zones of growth are preserved , and from their being enlarged at their basal serrated rims , the rostrum sometimes appears like a few beads of a necklace strung together .
the latera are remarkable from being placed over the carinal half of the terga , in an oblique position , parallel to the lower carinal margin of the terga .
a section , parallel to the growth layers , varies in the different species from elliptic to broadly oval , and in l .
nicobarica it is triangular .
only a few layers of growth are ever preserved .
in l .
truncata , where the latera are represented by mere <unk> , ( like strings of beads ) , and are even less in width than the rostrum , they are imperfectly calcified .
microscopical structure of the <unk>  the <name> layers are white , and generally separate easily , so that in l .
dorsalis it is rare to find a specimen with the upper part of the valves perfect .
the valves are so translucent , that in the thin margins , even the tubuli could be sometimes distinguished .
the valves are coated by strong yellow membrane , which , after the <name> matter in l .
dorsalis had been dissolved in acid , separated into broad slips , answering to each zone of growth .
on the lower margin of each slip , there is a row of closely approximate spines , generally slightly hooked , pointed , <unk> of an inch in length , and <unk> of an inch in diameter ; they arise out of a little fold ; all are furnished with tubuli of the same diameter with themselves , running through the whole thickness of the <name> layers , and attached , apparently , by their apices , to the underlying corium .
as the spines are very numerous , so are the parallel rows of tubuli .
after the <name> layers had been dissolved , there was left in l .
dorsalis ( well seen in the latera ) , an extraordinary , <unk> mass of branching , jointed , excessively thin tubes , sometimes slightly enlarged at the articulations , and appearing to contain brown granular matter : other portions of the valves , instead of this appearance , exhibited membranes or films with similar , branching , articulated tubes or vessels attached to them : i have not seen this appearance in any other cirripede .
the yellow exterior enveloping membrane , with its spines , is present in all the species of the genus ; in l .
rhodiopus these spines are much larger than in l .
dorsalis , and on the inner sides of the <name> they are <unk> and quadrifid , and large enough to be conspicuous with a lens of weak power .
<unk>  the most remarkable fact concerning this part , is that the outer tunic , together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered , is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth .
i demonstrated this fact in l .
dorsalis and l .
truncata , by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath ; and as these two species , ( i obtained , also , pretty good evidence in l .
nicobarica , ) are at the opposite extremes of the genus , no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus .
i know of no other instance , amongst cirripedia , in which calcified valves or scales are moulted .
i am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece ; though this almost certainly is the case with the uppermost and lowest portions .
the animal 's body is partly lodged within the peduncle , which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum , and in the upper part is fully as broad as it .
the scales with which it is clothed , extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves .
the scales of the upper whorl , or of the two or three upper whorls ( pl .
viii , figs .
1 b´ and 3 d ) are larger than those below ; and these latter rapidly decrease in size , so as to become low down on the peduncle , almost or quite invisible to the naked eye .
the scales in each whorl , are placed alternately with those in the whorls , above and below .
all the upper scales are packed rather closely together ; those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral ; those in the few next succeeding whorls , are triangular , with their basal margins protuberant and arched ; the scales , low down on the peduncle , stand some way apart from each other , and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads , of which some of the smallest in l .
dorsalis were only <unk> of an inch in diameter .
in the lowest part of the peduncle these scales , after each fresh exuviation , are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity ; hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked .
this same part , however , is furnished with nail or rather <unk> little projections of hard , yellow , horny chitine ( fig .
3 e ) .
the <name> on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points ; one <name> which i measured was <unk> of an inch in total width , the footstalk being only <unk> of an inch in diameter ; the whole projected <unk> of an inch above the surface of the peduncle ; from the footstalk a fine <unk> runs through the membrane to the underlying corium .
these <unk> little points are often much worn down ; in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation , there remained , in the lower part , close above the basal calcareous cup , only some hard , smooth , yellow , little discs , on a level with the general surface of the membrane ,  these being the intersected or worn down footstalks , with every trace of the calcareous beads gone .
but in this same specimen , under the old <unk> membrane , there was a new one , studded with the usual circular calcareous beads , slightly unequal in size , generally about <unk> of an inch in diameter , and each furnished with a <unk> ; but as yet none of the <unk> points of chitine had been formed .
i believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads , and , therefore , are formed directly under them .
in l .
<unk> the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in l .
dorsalis , giving a <unk> appearance to it , and all of them are serrated ( fig .
3 d ) round their entire margins .
generally only the scales in the uppermost , or in the three or four upper rows are serrated , and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins .
the state of the serrated edge varies extremely in the same species , from elongated conical teeth to mere notches , according to the amount of wear and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation ; so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum .
each scale has a fine <unk> passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its <unk> imbedded <unk> or base .
the membrane is transparent , thin , and tender , to a degree i have not seen equalled in the other lepadidæ , except , perhaps , in ibla .
it is much wrinkled transversely .
muscles of the <unk>  these consist of the usual interior and longitudinal ,  exterior and transverse  and oblique <unk> ; the former are unusually strong ; downwards they are attached to the basal calcareous cup or disc , and upwards they extend all round to the lower curved margins of the valves .
they are , as usual , without transverse striæ .
besides these , there are , ( at least in l .
dorsalis and l .
nicobarica , ) two little fans of <unk> muscles , which occur in no other pedunculated cirripede ; they are attached on each side of the central line of the <name> , near its base ; they extend transversely and a little upwards , and each fan <unk> to a point where the lower margins of the <name> and terga touch ; of these muscles , the upper <unk> are the longest .
their action , i conceive , must be either to draw slightly together the basal points of the terga , and so serve to open their occludent margins , or to draw inwards the base of the <name> : these muscles apparently first shadow forth the posterior or carinal , <unk> , <unk> muscles of sessile cirripedes .
basal calcareous cup or <unk>  i have seen this part in all the species , except l .
<unk> , and in this it probably occurs , considering its very close alliance with l .
truncata .
the size , form , and conditions of the cup or disc varies infinitely according to the age , size , and position of the individual specimen .
we <name> commence with a full-sized animal , which has ceased to burrow downwards into the rock , in which case the discs usually grow into a cup , and become largely developed .
in l .
dorsalis alone , i have seen many specimens , so that the following description and remarks , though applicable i believe to all the species , are drawn up from that alone .
the cup ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 a´ , 1 <unk> ) is hardly ever regular in outline , and is either slightly or very deeply concave ; i have seen one , half an inch in diameter ; it is formed of several thick layers of dirty white , translucent , calcareous matter , with sinuous margins ; externally the surface is very irregular , and is coated by yellow membrane presently to be described .
the innermost and <unk> layer sometimes covers the whole inside of the cup , and extends a little beyond its margin all round ; but more generally it projects beyond only one side , leaving the other sides deserted .
i have seen a single new layer extending beyond the underlying old layers , as much as one sixth of an inch ; and again i have seen a part of the cup , as much as a quarter of an inch in width , deserted and covered with <unk> .
so irregular , however , is the growth , that after a period an old deserted portion <name> occasionally be again covered by a new layer , though of course without organic adhesion .
again it sometimes happens that the <unk> layer , remaining central , is very much less than the older layers ; in one such instance the innermost and <unk> layer ( fig .
1 a´ ) had a diameter of only a quarter of that of the whole cup , in the middle of which it was placed ; the cup thus tends to become filled up in the middle .
the cup , in its fully developed condition , is seated at the very bottom of the cavity in the rock .
from the aggregate thickness of the several component layers forming the cup , the old and mature animal rises a little in its burrow ; for instance , the bottom of the cup in one specimen which i measured , was <unk> of an inch in thickness .
in a younger condition , before the animal has bored down to the full depth , and whilst the cavity is only of moderate diameter , the lower part of the peduncle , instead of being attached to the inside of a cup , adheres to small , irregular , nearly flat , calcareous discs , overlapping each other like tiles ( figs .
1 , 2 a´ ) .
they are placed one below the other , generally in a straight line , and are attached firmly to one side of the burrow .
the discs are oval , or rounded , or irregular , and are commonly from <unk> to <unk> of an inch across : they usually form a quite straight ribbon , widening a little downwards : each little disc <unk> and extends beyond the one last formed , fully half its own diameter .
i have seen one row of discs an inch in length , but the upper discs are always worn away by the friction of the calcified serrated scales on the peduncle .
it is very important to observe that the lowest disc is not fixed , ( as was the case with the cup , ) at the very bottom of the burrow , but on one side , just above the bottom , which latter part is occupied by the blunt basal end of the peduncle .
in a valuable paper on l .
nicobarica , by <unk> , presently to be referred to , the disc is said to be attached on the carinal side ( see fig .
2 ) of the peduncle ; and this , i believe , is general .
i have seen one instance in which , during the excavation of a new burrow , an old burrow was met with , and the row of discs turned down it , making , with their previous course , nearly a <unk> .
in another similar instance , the discs , instead of turning down , became very large and broad , and so fairly formed a bridge across the old burrow ( fig .
1 ) ,  becoming narrow again as soon as the animal recommenced burrowing into the solid rock .
sometimes , as it appears , the animal , whilst still small , from some unknown cause , stops burrowing downwards , and then a cup is formed at the bottom of the hole .
as soon as the animal has got to its full depth , the burrow increases only in diameter , and during this process the linear row of discs is ground away and lost ; a cup is then formed .
the little discs can be deposited or formed only at each fresh exuviation ; and as some of the burrows are above two inches in depth , and as on an average each disc does not extend beyond the underlying disc more than <unk> of an inch , an animal which has bored two inches in depth , must have moulted at least thirty times .
i may here remark that i have reason to believe , from some interesting observations made by mr. w. thompson , of belfast , that some sessile cirripedes moult about every fortnight .
internal structure of the <unk>  when the cup is dissolved in acid , each <name> layer is represented by a rather tough , <unk> membrane , itself composed of numerous fine laminæ , which , under a one-eighth of an inch object glass , exhibit generally only the appearance of a <unk> drawing ; but there often were layers of branching vessels , ( like <unk> , ) less than the <unk> of an inch in diameter , and of a <unk> colour ; these vessels are not articulated , but otherwise resemble the same peculiar structure in the valves of the capitulum .
the exterior yellow membrane is marked , or rather composed of successive narrow rims , which , in fact , are the lines of termination of the laminæ of membrane , which in a calcified state form the cup itself .
in most parts , both on the borders and under the centre of the cup , but not everywhere , there are imbedded in the yellow membrane , elongated , irregular , <unk> masses of bright yellow chitine , each furnished with a <unk> , which penetrating the calcareous laminæ leads to the corium ; the little apertures thus formed , are clearly visible in the layers of membrane , left after exposure to acid .
in l .
nicobarica , the innermost <name> layer of the cup was punctured , like the surface of the shell in chthamalus and many other sessile cirripedes , by the internal orifices of these tubuli .
the <unk> masses often have <unk> summits ; and they differ in no essential respects from those on the lower part of the peduncle , excepting that they are quite imbedded in the membrane covering the under surface of the cup , whereas those on the peduncle project freely .
i found these <unk> bodies in the outer membrane of the cups in l .
dorsalis , l .
<unk> , and l .
rhodiopus , which alone i was enabled to dissolve in acid ; and i mention this fact , as indicating the probable presence of the more important <unk> projections on the lower parts of the peduncle in these same species .
the basal calcareous cup resembles , in essential structure , the valves of the capitulum ; the chief difference being that in the former there is a larger proportion of animal matter or membranous layers .
after the dissolution of the cups , in l .
dorsalis and l .
rhodiopus , i most distinctly traced the two cement-ducts ; they included the usual darker chord of cellular matter ; they were of rather small diameter , namely , <unk> of an inch .
the two ( in l .
dorsalis ) ran in a very irregular course , not parallel to each other , making the most abrupt bends .
they passed through the membranous layers , ( as seen after dissolution , ) and running for short spaces parallel to the component laminæ , were attached to them .
in their irregular course , these cement-ducts resemble those of pollicipes mitella , but i could not perceive that any cement had been poured out at the abrupt bends .
in one specimen of a basal cup , which i was enabled to examine whilst still attached to the rock , i found under the very centre , ( and of course outside the yellow membrane , ) a very small area of dark brown cement of the usual appearance .
in several specimens of full-sized cups , i was not able to perceive any cement on the external surfaces of the upper and <unk> layers ; hence i believe that the cup is cemented to the bottom of the hole only during the early stages of its formation ; and this , considering its protected situation , would no doubt be sufficient to <unk> the animal .
this probably accounts for the small size of the cement-ducts , and for the facility with which , as it appears , the cups can be removed in an unbroken condition from the rock .
in the case , however , of the small , flat , calcareous discs , which are formed whilst the animal is burrowing into the rock , these are attached firmly to the sides of the holes , in the usual manner , by cement .
in this cirripede it would be useless to look for the prehensile antennæ of the larva under the cup , for the animal , during the formation of the successive discs , must have travelled some distance from the spot on which the larva first attached itself .
the membrane of the peduncle is continuous with the yellow membrane coating the external surface of the cup ; and this latter membrane is continuous with those delicate laminæ which , in a calcified condition , form the layers of the cup itself .
in an exactly similar manner , in this and other cirripedes , the membrane of the peduncle , at the top , is continuous with that coating the valves , and is attached to the lower exterior edge of the <unk> layer of shell .
when a new <name> layer is formed , both under the valves of the capitulum and inside the basal calcareous cup , it projects beyond the old layer , and is included within the old , as yet not moulted , membrane of the peduncle .
within the cup of l .
nicobarica i found a <unk> layer of shell , projecting <unk> of an inch on one side of the cup , and by its protuberance distinguishable even through the old coat of the peduncle , which was nearly ready to be moulted .
in an analogous manner , in the capitulum of l .
dorsalis and l .
truncata , i have found a new <unk> membrane bearing the usual , but then sharp , calcified scales , attached to the lower projecting edge of the <unk> <name> layer , lying under the old <unk> membrane , which was attached to the penultimate layer of shell , and with its worn scales was just ready to be moulted .
the final cause of the moulting of the calcified scales , together with the membrane of the peduncle to which they are attached ,  a case confined to lithotrya ,  i have scarcely any doubt is the reproduction of a succession of scales , sharply serrated for the purpose of enlarging the cavity in which the animal is lodged .
the extreme thinness of the membrane of the peduncle has been noticed ; this may be partly related to its protected condition , but partly , i think , to the necessity of its being formed in a very <unk> condition ; for the new coat , owing to the projection of the new <name> layers under the valves , and within the basal cup , is by so much shorter than the old peduncle , yet after exuviation it has to stretch to a greater length than the old membrane , to allow of the growth of the cirripede .
owing to the thinness and <unk> of this membrane , the basal attachment of the cirripede is , no doubt , chiefly effected by the unusually strong longitudinal muscles ; and the necessity of a surface of attachment for these muscles , stronger than the external membrane of the peduncle , probably is one of the final causes of the basal calcareous disc and cup , and likewise for the unusual manner in which the valves of the capitulum are locked together by folds and small roughened projections .
the basal discs and cup , however , apparently serve for several other purposes , namely , for raising the animal a little in its burrow , ( which is narrow and pointed at the bottom , ) at that period of growth when it has ceased to burrow downwards , but still increases in diameter ; also for carrying the animal , as over a bridge , across any pre-existing cavity in the rock ; and lastly , perhaps , for removing lower down , in the intervals of exuviation , the point of attachment for the longitudinal <unk> muscles .
position of the animal in the rock , and its power of <unk>  a specimen of rock , two or three inches square , in mr. <unk> possession , is full of <unk> ; the cavities extend in every possible direction , and several were parallel , but with the animals in reversed positions ; the same thing is apparent in some specimens of mr. stutchbury 's , and it was evident that the positions occupied by the animals were entirely due to chance .
in mr. cuming 's specimen of rock , a considerable portion of the external surface is preserved , and here it can be seen that many of the specimens have their <unk> directed from the external surface directly inwards .
these individuals , which were of full size , must have preyed on infusoria inhabiting the cavities of the porous , calcareous rock .
on the other hand , i have seen some young specimens of l .
dorsalis with their valves not at all rubbed , and others of full size with uninjured <unk> and corallines on the tips of the valves , and again a specimen of l .
truncata with minute <unk> sea-weed on the summit of the capitulum ,  all which appearances induce me to believe that in these cases , the valves had projected freely beyond the cavity in which their peduncles were lodged .
i may here also mention that in mr. cuming 's specimen , above alluded to , the basal cups of five specimens touched and adhered to each other ; i was not able to make out whether there had originally existed separate burrows , as i think is most probable , and that the walls had been wholly worn away , or whether the five specimens had fixed themselves on one side of a large pre-existing , common cavity .
young specimens seem to burrow to the full depth , before nearly acquiring the diameter which they ultimately attain .
i measured one burrow , <unk> of an inch in depth , which , at its mouth or widest part , was only <unk> in diameter .
the several species occur imbedded in soft calcareous rocks , in massive corals , and in the shells of mollusca and of cirripedes .
it has been doubted by several naturalists , whether the basal calcareous cup at all belongs to the lithotrya , but after the foregoing microscopical observations on its structure , it is useless to discuss this point .
so again it has been doubted whether the cavity is formed by the cirripede itself ; but there is so obvious a relation between the diameters of specimens of various sizes , and the holes occupied by them , that i can entertain no doubt on this head .
the holes , moreover , are not quite cylindrical , but broadly oval , like the section of the animal .
the simple fact , that in this genus alone each fresh <name> layer round the bases of the valves , and therefore at the widest part of the capitulum , are sharply toothed ; and secondly , that in this genus alone a succession of sharply serrated scales , on the upper and widest part of the peduncle , are periodically formed at each exuviation ; and that consequently the teeth on the valves and scales are sharp , and fit for wearing soft stone , at that very period when the animal has to increase in size , would alone render the view probable that the lithotrya makes or at least enlarges the cavities in which it is imbedded .
although it may be admitted that lithotrya has the power of enlarging its cavity , how does it first bore down into the rock ?
it is quite certain that the basal cup is absolutely fixed , and that neither in form nor state of surface it is at all fitted for boring .
[ 66 ] i was quite unable to answer the foregoing question , until seeing the admirable figures by <unk> [ 67 ] , ( pl .
viii , figs .
2 and 2 a´ ) of l .
nicobarica , still attached in its cavity .
subsequently i obtained from mr. stutchbury several pieces of rock completely drilled with holes , many of small diameter , by l .
dorsalis , and in these i found numerous instances of the linear rows of little discs , like those of l .
nicobarica , showing in the plainest manner , that each time a new disc is formed , that is , at each exuviation , the animal moves a short step downwards ; and as the lowest of these little discs in none of the burrows was placed at the very bottom , we see that the lowest point of the peduncle must be the wearing agent .
in the peduncle of an individual of l .
dorsalis , nearly ready to moult , i found , it may be remembered , beneath and round the basal disc , under the old membrane of the peduncle , a new membrane studded with calcified beads , but with the horny <unk> spines not yet developed , whilst on the old outer coat these latter had been worn down quite smooth , and the calcified beads worn entirely away .
here , then , we have an excellent rasping surface .
with respect to the power of movement necessary for the boring action , the peduncle is amply furnished with transverse , oblique , and longitudinal <unk> muscles ,  the latter attached to the basal disc .
in all the <unk> , i have reason to believe that these muscles are in constant slight involuntary action .
this being the case , i conceive that the small , blunt , <unk> portion of the peduncle , descending beneath the basal rim of the lowest disc , would inevitably partake slightly of the movements of the whole distended animal .
as soon as the lithotrya has reached that depth , which its instinct points out as most suitable to its habits , the discs are converted into an irregularly growing cup , and the animal then only increases in diameter , enlarging its cavity by the action of the serrated scales on the peduncle , and of the serrated lower edges of the valves of the capitulum .
with respect to those reversed individuals attached with their <unk> downwards , i suppose that the larvæ had crept into some deep cavity , perhaps made originally by a lithotrya , of which the rock in the specimen in question was quite full , and had there attached themselves .
finally , it appears that in lithotrya the burrowing is simply a mechanical action ; it is effected by each layer of shell in the basal attached discs overlapping , in a straight line , the <unk> layer ,  by the membrane of the peduncle and the valves of the capitulum having excellent and often renewed rasping surfaces ,  and , lastly , by the end of the peduncle ( that is <unk> the front of the head ) thus roughened , extending beyond the surface of attachment , and possessing the power of slight movement .
[ 66 ] mr. hancock , in his admirable account of his burrowing cirripede , <unk> <unk> , ( 'annals of nat .
<unk> , ' nov. 1849 , p. 313 , ) came to this conclusion regarding the cup of lithotrya , and hence was led to think that this genus did not form its own burrows , but inhabited pre-existing cavities .
i am much indebted to this gentleman , who has been so eminently successful in his researches on the boring powers of <name> animals , for giving me his opinion on several points connected with the present discussion .
[ 67 ] i owe to the great kindness of prof. steenstrup the sight of this plate , published in the <unk> communications from the union of natural history , ' copenhagen , <name> 30 , 1850 , no .
i .
since this sheet has been set up in type , i have received from prof. steenstrup the memoir , in danish , belonging to the figures in question ; and the greater part of this has been translated to me by the kindness of a friend .
my account of the means of burrowing is essentially the same as that published by <unk> ; but the moulting of the scales on the peduncle , the presence of scales and of points of a different nature , the method of attachment by cement , the conversion of the discs into a cup , & c. , seem not to have been known to this naturalist .
<unk> states that the points on the peduncle <name> scratch iceland spar , and that , apparently , they are formed of phosphate of lime : in the case of the closely-allied l .
dorsalis , i must believe that the scales or beads on the peduncle are formed of carbonate of lime , for they were quickly dissolved with <unk> in acetic acid ; and the <unk> points , which are subsequently developed under the calcareous scales , appeared to me , under the compound microscope , to be formed of a horn or chitine substance .
<unk> states that the basal point of the peduncle is arched a little under the lowest disc , and there forms for itself a slight furrow ( as represented in the lateral view , pl .
viii , fig .
2 ) ; but in the burrows examined by me , this furrow or depression did not really exist , the appearance resulting from the basal margin of the lowest disc , projecting beyond the wall of the cavity by the amount of its own slight thickness .
* * * * * we <name> now proceed with our generic <unk>  animal 's <unk>  this , as already stated , is partially lodged within the peduncle .
the prosoma is rather largely developed .
the mouth is placed at a moderate distance from the adductor muscle .
the labrum is moderately bullate , with a row of blunt bead-like teeth , mingled with fine bristles , on the crest , which in the middle part is generally somewhat flattened .
the palpi are blunt , and even squarely truncated at their ends ; they are of large size , so that , if they had been half as large again , or even less , their tips would have met .
mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , with three nearly equal large teeth , and the inferior <name> produced , broad , and strongly pectinated : in the interspaces between these teeth there are , in all the species , some very fine teeth or <unk> , which are seated a little on one side of the medial line .
the mandibles are somewhat singular from the size of the transparent flexible <unk> ( a a ) to which the muscles are attached ; these are oval and constricted at their <unk> : in l .
dorsalis they are roughened with little points ; in l .
<unk> and l .
truncata they are large , of the same shape , but smooth .
<unk>  these are larger , compared to the mandibles , than is usual with pedunculated cirripedes ; they differ in shape in the different species , being either nearly straight on their edge , and notched or not ( fig .
10 ) , or notched with the inferior part forming a double prominence ( fig .
12 ) ; the spines on the inferior <name> , which is sometimes slightly produced , are always crowded together into a brush , and are finer than those on the upper parts .
the <unk> are less straight than is usual , and at their origin take , in all the species , a rather abrupt bend ; their extremity is enlarged into a little disc , which in l .
dorsalis is covered with strong points , but in the other species is , as usual , smooth .
outer <unk>  the inner margin is slightly concave , and in l .
truncata alone , the bristles are hardly continuous , being interrupted in the middle part .
the olfactory orifices are only very slightly prominent .
the spines on all the trophi are more or less doubly serrated .
cirri.  the three posterior pair are elongated , with their anterior surfaces not at all protuberant .
the segments bear from three to five pair of spines , with a row of three or four small intermediate spines ; there are , as usual , some little lateral upper rim spines ; the dorsal tufts contain some thick and thin spines mingled .
first cirrus is short , and placed not quite close to the second pair ; the basal segments are broad and thickly paved with bristles .
the second pair is rather short compared with the third pair ; a varying number of the basal segments in both rami of both these cirri are protuberant , and are thickly paved with bristles ; such segments are more numerous and are broader on the anterior rami than on the posterior rami .
in l .
<unk> alone , none of the basal segments in the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are thickly paved with bristles .
the pedicels of the first three pair are irregularly covered with spines ; those of the three posterior pair have the spines arranged in a regular double line .
most of the spines are doubly serrated .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
23 and 24 ) , <unk> , with thin elongated segments fringed with short spines ; in length generally exceeding the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , and in l .
nicobarica equalling half the entire length of this cirrus .
stomach , destitute of cæca ; oesophagus somewhat curled .
filamentary appendages , none .
ovaria filling up the peduncle and surrounding the sack , but not extending up to the bases of the scuta and terga ; i saw the ova only in l .
truncata ; they were here oval and large , being nearly <unk> of an inch in length .
penis , elongated ; vesiculæ seminales extending into the prosoma .
i noticed the ovigerous fræna only in l .
truncata ; here they were large , with an almost <unk> outline ; the margin and whole lateral surface being covered with elongated cylinders , finely pointed , but not enlarged at their extremities , as are the glands observed in most of the other genera .
<unk>  the posterior thoracic segments , the pedicels , the anterior and dorsal surfaces of the segments of the cirri , the caudal appendages , and the outer sides of the trophi are , in most of the species , more or less mottled with dark purple ; parts of the interior surfaces of the valves in some of the species are coloured fine purple .
geographical <unk>  the species are found all round the world in the tropical seas ; this fact may have some connection with the presence of soft coral-reef limestone and of massive corals in these seas .
the presence , however , of l .
<unk> on the shores of new south wales , shows that the genus is not strictly tropical .
affinities.  lithotrya is a <unk> distinct genus ; although there is a considerable difference in the shape of the valves between l .
dorsalis and l .
<unk> , at the opposite extremes of the genus , the strict uniformity of the internal characters shows that there are no grounds whatever for any generic separation ; moreover , l .
rhodiopus neatly blends together these extreme forms .
indeed it is not easy to imagine a better marked series of transitional forms , than those presented by the terga , in passing from l .
dorsalis through l .
nicobarica , l .
rhodiopus , and l .
truncata , to l .
<unk> .
lithotrya has most affinity to scalpellum villosum or to pollicipes spinosus and p .
sertus ; though the affinity is far from close .
in these two species of pollicipes , we have seen that large irregular calcified spines are formed at the base of the peduncle , whereas in the other <unk> the scales or spines are formed exclusively round the upper margin of the peduncle .
lithotrya , as has been remarked by sowerby and other authors , exhibits some affinity to the sessile cirripedes , as shown by the calcareous basis ,  by the manner in which the scuta and terga are locked together ,  by the two little fans of muscle attached to near the basal points of the terga ,  and perhaps by some of the characters of the trophi ; nevertheless , this affinity is far from being well-marked , and i think is hardly so plain as in pollicipes mitella .

the state of preservation of the valves in different specimens varies greatly ; generally only two or three , or even only the <unk> <name> layer , is preserved , the upper ones having scaled off ; in a few young specimens , however , all the layers were perfect .
the <name> is generally better preserved than the other valves , and hence the upper part usually projects freely ; in one specimen no less than ten zones of growth were preserved in the <name> , whilst the other valves consisted of only three : the terga generally project rather more than the scuta .
as each <unk> is thick , if the scaling process had not taken place , all the valves would have projected greatly .
the little teeth lie close together on the prominent serrated rims , on each zone of growth .
the internal surfaces of the valves are roughened with small <unk> points .
exteriorly the valves are covered with yellow membrane , with rows , corresponding with each zone of growth , of very minute , yellow , horny spines , generally having their tips bent over , and so made <unk> .
these spines are less than <unk> of an inch in length .
scuta , triangular ; internally concave , with a large depression for the adductor muscle ; there is the usual small roughened internal knob , or tooth , at the rostral <name> of both the right and left hand valves .
tergal margin straight , overlapping about one third of the entire width of the terga .
terga , irregularly oval , with the scutal margin straight ; basal point blunt , with the two sides placed at about an <name> of <unk> to each other ; the lower part of the carinal margin , immediately over the latera , ( as seen internally , ) is slightly hollowed out .
exteriorly , towards the bottom of the valve , from the overlapping of the scuta , of the latera , and of the <name> , only a narrow rounded ridge is exposed , which runs down to the basal <name> at about one third of the entire width of the valve , from the scutal margin .
internally the valve is slightly concave .
the <name> slightly <unk> the terga ; internally concave ; generally with a large upper portion freely projecting ; inwardly curved , without any central crest or ridge ; valve nearly as wide as the middle part of the terga ; inner growing or <unk> surface , with its basal margin , protuberant and arched .
rostrum ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 a´ , a , and greatly magnified 1 b´ ) very narrow ; rarely more than two or three layers of growth are preserved ; the sides are deeply sinuous , owing to each zone widening downwards ; basal margin rounded ; in width equalling about two and a half of the uppermost scales of the peduncle , and about half as wide as the latera .
latera , small , placed obliquely , and parallel to the lower carinal margin of the terga ; longer axis equal to five of the uppermost scales of the peduncle , and to nearly half the width of the base of the <name> ; growing surface ( or a section made parallel to the <unk> , ) is narrow , elliptic , pointed at both ends , but the carinal half rather thicker than the scutal half .
the peduncle varies in length , generally about twice as long as the capitulum , in one specimen above thrice as long .
the upper part as wide as the capitulum , the lower part sometimes much attenuated .
the calcified scales in the uppermost whorl ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 b´ ) are only slightly larger than those in the second whorl ; the scales in the succeeding three or four whorls , are considerably larger than those below , which latter very gradually decrease in size , till , low down on the peduncle , they are barely visible to the naked eye .
in this lower part , they may be called calcareous beads ; they stand some way apart from each other ; they are nearly hemispherical , smooth , translucent , and furnished with a conical <unk> ; some of the smallest were <unk> and <unk> of an inch in diameter .
the upper scales vary somewhat in the outline , the most usual shape being sub-triangular , with the lower margin arched and protuberant ; and this margin , in the two or three upper whorls , is <unk> with teeth , which are conical and sharp , after exuviation , but soon become reduced to mere notches .
the scales in the uppermost whorl are usually nearly quadrilateral ; the imbedded portion , or <unk> of each scale , is , in all , produced into a blunt rounded point .
the basal calcareous cup ( fig .
1 a´ and 1 <unk> ) is well developed , and is sometimes even half an inch in diameter .
before the cup is formed , there is a row of small , flat discs ( fig .
1 , and like those in fig .
2 a´ ) attached to the sides of the burrow : but a full account of these parts of the peduncle , and of the burrowing habits of this species , has been given under the generic description .
size and <unk>  full <unk> specimens have a capitulum half an inch in width and height ; the entire length , with the contracted peduncle , being about an inch and a half .
valves coloured dirty white , with the enveloping membrane , when preserved , yellow .
the outer maxillæ , palpi , pedicels of the cirri , anterior faces of the segments , dorsal tufts , caudal appendages , and penis , dark purple .
thoracic segments brown .
there is a purple spot between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
mouth.  labrum considerably bullate , equalling about half the longitudinal diameter of the mouth ; inferior part produced so as to separate the mouth some way from the adductor muscle ; crest with a row of blunt teeth and hairs ; central part depressed and flattened .

mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , with twice as many <unk> , namely 15 , between the first and second main teeth , as between the second and third teeth , namely about 7 ; inferior <name> strongly and coarsely pectinated ; distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , considerably less than between the tips of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> ; sides hirsute .
maxillæ ( fig .
10 ) , with the edge not quite straight , with the whole inferior part slightly projecting ; spines very numerous , thirty or forty pairs ; those close beneath the two upper great unequal spines , form a tuft and are rather thinner than the others , as are also those near the inferior <name> ; sides hirsute .
outer maxillæ , rather pointed , with the inner edge slightly concave , continuously and thickly clothed with short spines ; spines on the outer edge long ; there are also some minute , short , thinly scattered spines or points on the sides .
bristles on all the trophi doubly serrated .
cirri.  the first pair is placed at a small distance from the second .
the segments in the three posterior pairs , support five pairs of very long spines , with a row of ( i believe ) four small intermediate spines ; on the lateral upper edges , there are some short blunt spines ; anterior faces of the segments not protuberant ; the dorsal tufts consist of thick serrated , and of thin spines .
the whole integument is hirsute with minute pectinated scales .
two or three of the basal segments in the sixth cirrus are confluent .
first cirrus , anterior ramus rather shorter and thicker than the posterior ramus ; basal segments thickly paved with serrated spines ; in the posterior ramus , the six terminal segments are not paved with bristles .
second cirrus has the seven basal segments of the anterior ramus very broad , and paved with bristles ; the eight terminal segments having the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus the three or four basal segments are similarly paved , but to a very much less degree , and the remaining thirteen have the usual structure .
third cirrus has the six basal segments of the anterior ramus very broad and paved , and the fourteen terminal ones of the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus , the three or four basal segments are similarly paved , but to a very much less degree , and the seventeen terminal ones have the usual structure .
the pedicel of the first cirrus has very few spines ; those of the second and third cirrus are thickly and irregularly clothed with spines ; and those of the three posterior pair have a double row with intermediate small spines .
on the <unk> faces of the pedicels of the second , third , and fourth pairs of cirri , there is an elongated white swelling or shield .
moreover , on the posterior thoracic segments , there are similar <unk> <unk> , with the membrane more plainly marked with scales than in other parts .
the spines on the first three pairs of cirri are coarsely serrated .
caudal appendages ( pl .

general remarks.  it is difficult to give obvious characters , ( excepting the smallness of the rostrum compared with the scales on the peduncle , ) by which this species can be externally <unk> from l .
dorsalis , l .
nicobarica , and l .
rhodiopus ; yet almost all the valves differ slightly in shape .
in this species alone , ( the peduncle of l .
rhodiopus is not known , ) the lower , <unk> minute , bead-like scales of the peduncle are <unk> , though obscurely , all round .
in the animal 's body , the <unk> characters are strongly marked ;  the long spines on the terminal segment of the first cirrus ,  none of the segments in the posterior rami of the second and third cirri being thickened and paved with bristles ,  the <unk> being equal in number between the main teeth of the mandibles ,  are all characters exclusively confined to this species .

the teeth on the prominent rims of the valves are small and approximate ; but the specimen was much worn .
scuta , triangular , slightly overlapping the terga ; the line of junction between these valves slightly sinuous , the upper part of the tergal margin of the scuta being slightly hollowed out , and the corresponding upper portion of the margin of the terga being slightly protuberant .
internally , there is a considerable depression for the adductor muscle ; and besides the usual knob at the rostral <name> , there is a trace of a knob at the <unk> <name> .
terga , as seen internally , irregularly <unk> , ending downwards in a blunt point , of which the two sides , ( neither being sensibly hollowed out , ) stand at about an <name> of <unk> to each other .
scutal margin , with the upper part , ( as above remarked , ) slightly protuberant : near the bottom of this margin , there is a very slight projection , answering to the small knob at the <unk> <name> of the scutum .
externally , towards the basal <name> , the narrow strip not concealed by the overlapping of the latera and <name> is <unk> , with the zones of growth on it straight .
<name> , internally concave in the upper free part , with a slight , central , internal crest , caused by the projection of each successive zone of growth .
the inner growing surface is almost <unk> in outline ; with the basal margin square and truncated in the middle .
rostrum ( fig .
2 a ) , rather conspicuous , many zones of growth being preserved .
it equals in width six of the subjacent scales of the peduncle , but as these are rather smaller than elsewhere , the width equals about five of the ordinary uppermost scales ; compared with the latera , it is nearly <unk> of their width .
latera , unusually large ; as seen on their interior surfaces , ( or in a section parallel to the zones of growth , ) they are triangular , elongated transversely , with the carinal <name> a <unk> .
in width they equal the seven subjacent scales of the peduncle , and are more than half as long as the basal margin of the <name> .
peduncle , with the upper scales varying from circular to quadrilateral , thrice as large as those in the second whorl ; beneath which , in the next three or four whorls , the scales rapidly decrease in size ; and beneath these the whole peduncle is studded with <unk> , rounded , calcareous beads , so minute as to be quite invisible to the naked eye .
this specimen was nearly ready to moult , and perhaps in consequence of this , even the upper scales were most obscurely serrated on their lower margins , and all the others quite smooth : there were some much worn horny spines close to the bottom of the peduncle .
basal calcareous cup slightly concave , of moderate size ; its diameter , in the one specimen examined , was <unk> of an inch ; it was composed of several layers .
in the specimen figured ( 2 a´ ) by <unk> , instead of a cup , there is a straight row of small discs , which are attached to the walls of the cavity , as explained in the generic description .
mouth.  palpi with their ends square and truncated ; thickly clothed with long spines .
mandibles , with fully twice as many <unk> , ( viz .
from 16 to 20 , ) between the first and second main teeth , as between ( viz .
8 to 10 ) the second and third main teeth .
inferior <name> , coarsely pectinated .
the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth , is considerably less than between the tip of the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , with the edge very slightly irregular ; beneath the two great upper spines there is a slight notch , with some small spines : inferior <name> slightly prominent , with a brush of moderately fine spines ; besides these , there are about seventeen pairs of large spines ; sides very hairy .
outer maxillæ , with the inner margin slightly concave , and with the spines continuous .
cirri.  the segments in the three posterior pairs support three or four pairs of long spines , with a single row of moderately long intermediate spines ; the dorsal tufts consist of a few rather thick , and some long and thin spines .
the front of the segments is not protuberant ; the whole surface is hirsute with minute <unk> scales .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus having its eight basal segments highly protuberant and thickly clothed with spines , the upper nine having the usual structure ; the posterior ramus has four or five basal segments thickly clothed with spines , and the twelve upper ones with the usual structure .
third cirrus , with the anterior ramus having six segments highly protuberant and thickly clothed with bristles , and the fifteen upper ones on the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus , only three or four of the basal segments are paved with bristles .
the spines on the first three pairs of cirri , are coarsely and doubly serrated .
the caudal appendages are more than twice as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , and equal half the length of the whole cirrus .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus contained twenty-two segments , the caudal appendages actually contained twenty .
the segments are thin , with their upper edges clothed with serrated spines .
the slip of membrane on each side , whence this organ springs is united , for a little space , to the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .

the specimens are in a rather bad condition , and have been <unk> .
they are of rather small size ; the rostrum and peduncle are lost , and animal 's body much injured .
valves white , thin , translucent ; teeth on the projecting rims small , narrow , standing further apart than their own width .
the upper layers have undergone but little disintegration or scaling off , and consequently the <name> and terga project freely .
the valves , where not rubbed , are covered by bright yellow membrane , which is thickly clothed with rows of spines ; these are small on the exterior surfaces , but are very large and hooked in certain parts , as near the tergal margins of the scuta , and on the carinal margins of the terga , and especially on the inner face of the upper free part of the <name> .
here the hooked spines ( fig .
4 d ) are <unk> or quadrifid , and are very conspicuous .
scuta , as seen externally , triangular ; they overlap half the width of the terga ; on their internal faces ( fig .
4 a ) , in the upper projecting part , there is a strong ridge , against which the scutal margin of the terga <unk> .
there is a deep and conspicuous pit for the adductor muscle .
terga , as seen externally , nearly triangular .
the ridge which leads from the apex to the basal <name> , is rounded , central , and extremely prominent ; but does not form a furrow , or include the overlapping margin of the scuta .
the basal <name> is narrow , <unk> , and slightly hollowed out on both margins .
the growing <unk> surface ( fig .
4 b ) is transversely elongated , with the occludent margin rounded , and the carinal <name> much produced , but not forming a roughened knob .
<name> ( fig .
4 d ) , concave within , with a slight central ridge in the upper free portion .
the inner growing surface is concave , almost <unk> , with a just perceptibly raised central rim in the upper part , and with two minute prominences on each side , against which the produced carinal angles of the terga <unk> .
rostrum , lost .
latera ( fig .

several zones of growth preserved .
peduncle , lost , but a few scales accidentally adhering to one of the valves , show that they are <unk> in the three or four upper whorls .
no basal calcareous cup was preserved , but by clearing out the base of one of the holes in the <name> , in which a specimen had been imbedded , i found a little flat disc about the size of a pin 's head ; it was composed of two or three layers , and was externally coated by yellow membrane , including the usual <unk> bodies and tubuli .
the cement-ducts were also discovered after dissolution in acid .
so that there could be no doubt regarding the nature of the little disc .
mouth.  labrum with a row of little blunt teeth .
palpi , blunt , rather expanded at their ends , with the extreme margin much arched and furnished with two rows of long spines ; there is a fringe of short spines on the straight inner side .
<unk>  there are nine <unk> between the first and second main teeth , and only two between the second and third teeth ; the inferior <name> is coarsely pectinated , with one central spine twice as long as the others .
the distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , is greater than between the tip of the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
12 ) .  these may be described as having their edge formed into three prominences ; or , as having a very wide notch under the two upper great spines , and with the whole inferior part forming two prominences .
there are , altogether , about twelve pairs of spines , of which two stand singly on the inferior side of the wide notch under the two upper great spines .
the spines on the inferior <name> are rather smaller than those above ; sides hirsute .
outer maxillæ , with the inner margin slightly concave , and sparingly covered with bristles .
cirri , imperfectly preserved ; the three posterior pairs have segments of the usual character , bearing five pairs of very long spines , with the usual little intermediate , the minute lateral , and the dorsal spines .
first cirrus lost ; second and third with only their few basal segments preserved , sufficient , however , to show that at least two or three segments , in both the anterior and posterior rami of both cirri , were paved with bristles .
pedicels , as in the other species .
caudal appendages , lost .
this species comes very close , as far as the characters derived from the trophi serve , to the l .
truncata , though readily distinguished from that species by the shape of the valves .
on the other hand , the capitulum of this species is distinguished with difficulty from that of l .
nicobarica and l .
<unk> ; no doubt this difficulty is much enhanced by the rostrum and peduncle having been lost .

caudal appendages shorter than , or barely exceeding in length , the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
friendly archipelago , mus .
<name> ; philippine archipelago , mus .
cuming ; imbedded in <name> rock .
capitulum rather thick , with the five main valves having their free apices , diverging and truncated .
the upper and old layers of shell do not here scale off so readily as in many of the foregoing species ; and hence an unusually large proportional length of each valve projects freely above the sack ; and the valves are of unusual thickness .
the capitulum is very nearly as wide at its summit as at its base , owing to the divergence of the apices of the valves .
the scuta and terga are articulated together by a conspicuous fold , which , when seen from vertically above , ( pl .
ix , fig .
1 a´ , ) appears like a deep <unk> notch in the terga .
on the exterior surfaces of the valves , the teeth on the successive rims are approximate ; on the inner surfaces , the rims are covered by strong yellow membrane , which is generally fringed with small horny spines .
scuta , exterior surface convex , sub-triangular , with the apex truncated : seen vertically from above , there is a small rectangular indentation or fold which receives the projecting scutal margin of the terga .
the inner growing or <unk> surface ( fig .
1 b , b´ ) is triangular , with its tergal margin largely hollowed out .
along the occludent margin there is a slight ridge , which terminates at the rostral <name> , in both the right and left-hand valves , in a rounded , <unk> , roughened tooth .
the lower part of the tergal margin is slightly inflected and roughened , where it meets the corresponding lower part of the scutal margin of the terga .
there is a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the interior surface of the valve above this pit is <unk> purple .
the inner surfaces of both scuta and terga , are roughened with little points .
terga , seen externally , are almost quadrilateral ( owing to the apex being truncated ) , with the free margin facing the scutum , arched .
seen vertically from above , each shows a deep fold , which receives the lower part of the tergal margin of the scutum .
in the foregoing species , a prominent ridge runs down the exterior surface of the terga from the apex to the basal <name> , against which ridge , the margin of the overlapping scuta <unk> : here this ridge , instead of projecting straight out , is oblique or folded over , and thus forms a furrow , receiving the margin of the scuta .
the interior growing surface of the tergum ( fig .
1 b´ , c ) , presents so irregular a figure , that it can hardly be described ; in area it quite equals the scuta ; it is slightly concave ; at the upper point of the carinal margin , there is a large , rounded , protuberant , roughened knob , which corresponds with a small knob on each side of the inner face of the <name> ; these knobs seem firmly united together by membrane .
the scutal margin of the terga , in the upper part , forms a shoulder , largely projecting over the scuta ; on its lower part , there is a small roughened projection .
the occludent margin is arched and protuberant , with a slight fold above the knob on the carinal margin , just mentioned : this fold is caused by the protuberance of the central internal ridge of the <name> , but is so small , that when the capitulum is seen from vertically above , it can hardly be distinguished .
finally , the basal half of the carinal margin , runs in the same line with the basal margin of the scuta .
<name> , moderately large ; seen externally , the surface presents an elongated triangle , with the apex truncated ; on the internal face ( fig .
1 b´ , d ) of the free part , there is ( instead of being concave as is usual ) a great central ridge , which projects between the diverging apices of the terga , as may be seen from vertically above ; hence the thickness of the upper part of the <name> , in a longitudinal plane , almost equals its breadth .
the edge of this ridge is rounded .
the inner or growing surface of the <name> is tinted purple , and lies in a plane , oblique to the longer axis of the valve ; it is triangular , with the apex cut off , and the basal margin rounded and protuberant ; it is not concave .
there is a central raised line or slight ridge on this inner surface , and on each side in the upper part there is a small , white , roughened knob , corresponding with the similar knobs on the carinal margins of the terga .
rostrum ( fig .
1 b´ , a ) , rudimentary ; in one specimen it was about <unk> of an inch in width ; it is either as wide , or only half as wide , as the subjacent scale on the peduncle .
latera , rudimentary , placed between the edges of the <name> and the terga ; rather smaller than the rostrum ; almost cylindrical , slightly flattened , enlarged at each zone of growth , with one or two sharp teeth or spines on both faces ; imperfectly calcified ; in width barely <unk> part of the <name> .
peduncle , short ; the scales alone in the uppermost whorl are plainly toothed ; they are transversely elongated , and almost <unk> , and are nearly twice as large as those in the second whorl .
beneath this second whorl , there are two or three whorls , with scales , graduated in size ; and the rest of the peduncle is covered by rather distantly scattered , minute , rounded or acutely pointed scales : the pointed scales are directed upwards , and are best developed under the <name> .
the basal calcareous cup , judging from two specimens , is thin , and not much developed .
size and <unk>  the largest specimen was nearly <unk> of an inch across its capitulum .
the calcareous valves are dirty white .
the sack is ( after having been long kept in spirits ) pale coloured , excepting a small purple space , between the scuta and another over the <name> .
the three posterior segments of the thorax and portions under the second and third cirri , the trophi , the pedicels and the anterior faces of the segments ( especially of the basal segments in the second and third cirri ) , and a spot on their dorsal surfaces , and the penis are all coloured dark <unk> .
the prosoma is pale coloured .
mouth.  crest of labrum with a row of bead-like teeth and hairs .
palpi bluntly pointed , with neither margin hollowed out .
mandibles , with eight <unk> between the first and second main teeth , and three between the second and third teeth ; inferior <name> coarsely pectinated , with a central spine much longer than the others ; the distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , is about equal to that between the tip of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> .
<unk>  under the two upper long spines ( associated with some smaller ones ) , there is a slight and wide hollow ; and the whole inferior edge obscurely forms two blunt points , with the spines on the lower projection smaller than the upper spines .
outer maxillæ , considerably concave in front , with the spines almost <unk> in the middle part .
cirri.  first pair rather far separated from the second pair .
the segments of the three posterior cirri bear three or four pairs of main spines , and are otherwise characterised like the foregoing species .
first cirrus , with its anterior ramus much thicker than the posterior ramus , and of nearly equal length ; all the segments , except the two terminal ones , thickly clothed with serrated spines .
second cirrus considerably shorter than the third cirrus : anterior ramus with the seven basal segments very protuberant , and paved with bristles , and the four terminal ones on the usual structure ; posterior ramus , with the five basal segments paved ( but much less thickly than in the anterior ramus ) , and the nine terminal ones on the usual structure .
third cirrus , the anterior ramus , with the five basal segments , thick and paved , and eleven terminal segments on the usual structure : posterior ramus , with one basal segment paved , and sixteen other segments on the usual structure .
in the posterior rami , however , of both the second and third cirri , it is difficult to draw any distinct line between the paved segments and the others .
caudal appendages , short , either just exceeding in length the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , or equalling only the lower segment : segments flattened , cylindrical , six in number , there being , in the same individual , twenty-one segments in both rami of the sixth cirrus .

british museum .
general remarks.  the two specimens in the british museum are small , and in an imperfect condition , without the peduncle or the latera , and without the body of the animal .
the capitulum so closely resembles that of l .
truncata , that it is quite superfluous to do more than point out the few differences .
it is just possible , though not probable , that this form may prove to be merely a variety or younger state of l .
truncata , in which case this latter name would have to be sunk .
the difference , though one only of degree , in the form of the terga of the two species is conspicuous , and there is a slight difference in the <name> , and again some dissimilarity in habits .
<unk>  the valves , as just stated , generally resemble those of l .
truncata ; scarcely any appreciable difference can be detected in the scuta ; the apex , however , of the inner surface seems coloured a darker purple .
the terga , as seen from vertically above ( pl .
viii , fig .
5 b ) , have a fold or indentation on the upper or occludent margin , as large and as conspicuous as that receiving the margin of the scuta : this fold , as seen on the inner <unk> surface ( fig .
5 a ) , descends below the roughened knob at the upper <name> of the carinal margin , which is not the case with the slight fold in the same place in l .
truncata ; its presence seems caused by the edge of the central internal crest , in the upper part of the <name> , being square ( instead of round , as in l .
truncata ) , and thus more deeply affecting the outline of the terga , between which it is inserted .
the upper part of the scutal margin of the terga , as seen internally ( fig .
5 a ) , <unk> the scuta in a large rectangular projection .
from the depth of the two opposite folds , namely , that caused by the tergal edge of the scuta and that by the crest of the <name> , the inner face of the tergum is divided into two almost equal areas .
the <name> has its central crest square ( fig .
5 c , d , ) instead of being rounded as in l .
truncata .
the inner growing or <unk> face is nearly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the whole valve , instead of being oblique to it ; it is convex or protuberant , with a central raised line , and two little knobs on each side of the upper part ; the two lateral margins are slightly hollowed out , and the basal margin is not highly protuberant .
the rostrum is excessively minute , barely above <unk> of an inch in width ; it is a little enlarged at each zone of growth .
latera lost ; no doubt they were rudimentary .
a fragment of a posterior cirrus , which adhered to one of the valves , shows that each segment supported four pairs of spines .
width of the capitulum before <unk> , probably was about <unk> of an inch .

the a .

now , in young individuals of lepas australis , the peduncle is hairy , whilst in full-grown specimens it is quite smooth .
again , in some varieties of l .

this , i think , is certainly a distinct and new species , but i am unable to decide whether to place it in lepas or pæcilasma .
it is briefly described and pretty well figured in the above work .
it was procured at new zealand , but it is not stated to what object it was attached .
the capitulum is much elongated , and one inch in length ; the peduncle is from six to eight lines long .
the <name> is said to be very narrow ; it is not stated whether it terminates downwards in a fork or disc ; judging from the figure , it extends some way up between the terga , the basal ends of which are bluntly pointed .
the scuta are almost quadrilateral .
the peduncle is short , yellow , and <unk> .
the general appearance of the drawing makes me suspect that it is a pæcilasma .

leach has most briefly characterised a specimen in <unk> 's museum , from the red sea , under the above name of <unk> .

london <name> <name> , albemarle street 1913 .
to <name> lyell , esq. , <unk> , this second edition is dedicated with grateful pleasure , as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may possess , has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable principles of geology .
<unk> notice to the illustrated edition .
this work was described , on its first appearance , by a writer in the " quarterly review " as " one of the most interesting narratives of <unk> that it has fallen to our lot to take up , and one which must always occupy a distinguished place in the history of scientific navigation . "
this prophecy has been amply verified by experience ; the extraordinary minuteness and accuracy of mr. <name> 's observations , combined with the charm and simplicity of his descriptions , have ensured the popularity of this book with all classes of readers  and that popularity has even increased in recent years .
no attempt , however , has hitherto been made to produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work : numberless places and objects are mentioned and described , but the difficulty of obtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn for the purpose has never been overcome until now .
most of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by mr. <unk> , with mr. <name> 's book by his side .
some few of the others are taken from engravings which mr. <name> had himself selected for their interest as illustrating his voyage , and which have been kindly lent by his son .
mr. <unk> 's name is well known in connection with the voyages of the " <unk> " and " wanderer , " and it is believed that the illustrations , which have been chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains , <name> greatly add to the value and interest of the " voyage of a naturalist . "

author 's preface .
i have stated in the preface to the first edition of this work , and in the " zoology of the voyage of the beagle , " that it was in consequence of a wish expressed by captain fitz <name> , of having some scientific person on board , accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own accommodations , that i volunteered my services , which received , through the kindness of the <unk> , captain beaufort , the sanction of the lords of the admiralty .
as i feel that the opportunities which i enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we visited have been wholly due to captain fitz <name> , i <name> i may here be permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him ; and to add that , during the five years we were together , i received from him the most cordial friendship and steady assistance .
both to captain fitz <name> and to all the officers of the " beagle " i shall ever feel most thankful for the <unk> kindness with which i was treated during our long voyage .
( <unk> .
i must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr. <unk> , the surgeon of the " beagle , " for his very kind attention to me when i was ill at valparaiso . )
this volume contains , in the form of a journal , a history of our voyage , and a sketch of those observations in natural history and geology , which i think <name> possess some interest for the general reader .
i have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some parts , and have added a little to others , in order to render the volume more fitted for popular reading ; but i trust that naturalists <name> remember that they must refer for details to the larger publications which <unk> the scientific results of the expedition .
the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle ' " includes an account of the fossil mammalia , by professor <name> ; of the living mammalia , by mr. waterhouse ; of the birds , by mr. gould ; of the fish , by the reverend l. <unk> ; and of the reptiles , by mr. <name> .
i have appended to the descriptions of each species an account of its habits and range .
these works , which i owe to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished authors , could not have been undertaken had it not been for the liberality of the lords commissioners of her majesty 's treasury , who , through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of the <unk> , have been pleased to <name> a sum of one thousand pounds towards <unk> part of the expenses of publication .
i have myself published separate volumes on the " structure and distribution of <name> reefs " ; on the " volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the 'beagle ' " ; and on the " geology of south <name> . "
the sixth volume of the " geological transactions " contains two papers of mine on the erratic boulders and volcanic phenomena of south <name> .
messrs. waterhouse , <name> , newman , and white , have published several able papers on the insects which were collected , and i trust that many others <name> hereafter follow .
the plants from the southern parts of <name> <name> be given by dr. j. hooker , in his great work on the botany of the southern hemisphere .
the <name> of the galapagos archipelago is the subject of a separate memoir by him , in the " linnean transactions . "
the reverend professor henslow has published a list of the plants collected by me at the keeling islands ; and the reverend j.m .
berkeley has described my <unk> plants .
i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which i have received from several other naturalists in the course of this and my other works ; but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere thanks to the reverend professor henslow , who , when i was an <unk> at cambridge , was one chief means of giving me a taste for natural history ,  who , during my absence , took charge of the collections i sent home , and by his correspondence directed my endeavours ,  and who , since my return , has constantly rendered me every assistance which the kindest friend could offer .

st. jago  cape de verd islands .
after having been twice driven back by heavy south-western gales , her majesty 's ship " beagle , " a <unk> brig , under the command of captain fitz <name> , r.n. , sailed from <unk> on the 27th of december , 1831 .
the object of the expedition was to complete the survey of patagonia and <name> <name> fuego , commenced under captain king in 1826 to 1830  to survey the shores of chile , peru , and of some islands in the pacific  and to <name> a chain of <unk> measurements round the world .
on the 6th of <name> we reached teneriffe , but were prevented landing , by fears of our bringing the cholera : the next morning we saw the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the grand canary island , and suddenly <unk> the peak of teneriffe , whilst the lower parts were veiled in fleecy clouds .
this was the first of many delightful days never to be forgotten .
on the 16th of <name> 1832 we anchored at porto praya , in st. jago , the chief island of the cape de verd archipelago .
the neighbourhood of porto praya , viewed from the sea , wears a desolate aspect .
the volcanic fires of a past age , and the scorching heat of a tropical sun , have in most places rendered the soil unfit for vegetation .
the country rises in successive steps of table-land , interspersed with some <unk> conical hills , and the horizon is bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains .
the scene , as beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate , is one of great interest ; if , indeed , a person , fresh from sea , and who has just walked , for the first time , in a grove of cocoa-nut trees , can be a judge of anything but his own happiness .
the island would generally be considered as very uninteresting , but to any one accustomed only to an english landscape , the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil .
a single green leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains ; yet flocks of goats , together with a few cows , contrive to exist .
it rains very seldom , but during a short portion of the year heavy torrents fall , and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs out of every crevice .
this soon withers ; and upon such naturally formed hay the animals live .
it had not now rained for an entire year .
when the island was discovered , the immediate neighbourhood of porto praya was clothed with trees ( <unk> .
i state this on the authority of dr. e. <unk> , in his <name> translation of the first edition of this journal .
) , the reckless destruction of which has caused here , as at st. <name> , and at some of the canary islands , almost entire sterility .
the broad , flat-bottomed valleys , many of which serve during a few days only in the season as <unk> , are clothed with thickets of leafless bushes .
few living creatures inhabit these valleys .
the commonest bird is a kingfisher ( <unk> <unk> ) , which <unk> sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant , and thence darts on grasshoppers and lizards .
it is brightly coloured , but not so beautiful as the european species : in its flight , manners , and place of habitation , which is generally in the driest valley , there is also a wide difference .
one day , two of the officers and myself rode to <unk> grande , a village a few miles eastward of porto praya .
until we reached the valley of st. <name> , the country presented its usual dull brown appearance ; but here , a very small rill of water produces a most refreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation .
in the course of an hour we arrived at <unk> grande , and were surprised at the sight of a large ruined fort and cathedral .
this little town , before its harbour was filled up , was the principal place in the island : it now presents a melancholy , but very picturesque appearance .
having procured a black padre for a guide , and a spaniard who had served in the <unk> war as an interpreter , we visited a collection of buildings , of which an ancient church formed the principal part .
it is here the governors and <unk> of the islands have been buried .
some of the <unk> recorded dates of the sixteenth century .
( 1/2 .
the cape de verd islands were discovered in <unk> .
there was a tombstone of a bishop with the date of <unk> ; and a crest of a hand and dagger , dated <unk> . )
the <unk> ornaments were the only things in this retired place that reminded us of europe .
the church or chapel formed one side of a <unk> , in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were growing .
on another side was a hospital , containing about a dozen <unk> inmates .
we returned to the <unk> to eat our dinners .
a considerable number of men , women , and children , all as black as jet , collected to watch us .
our companions were extremely <name> ; and everything we said or did was followed by their hearty laughter .
before leaving the town we visited the cathedral .
it does not appear so <name> as the smaller church , but boasts of a little organ , which sent forth singularly <unk> cries .
we presented the black priest with a few shillings , and the spaniard , patting him on the head , said , with much <unk> , he thought his colour made no great difference .
we then returned , as fast as the ponies would go , to porto praya .
another day we rode to the village of st. <name> , situated near the centre of the island .
on a small plain which we crossed , a few stunted <unk> were growing ; their tops had been bent by the steady trade-wind , in a singular manner  some of them even at right angles to their trunks .
the direction of the branches was exactly north-east by north , and south-west by south , and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing direction of the force of the trade-wind .
the travelling had made so little impression on the barren soil , that we here missed our track , and took that to <unk> .
this we did not find out till we arrived there ; and we were afterwards glad of our mistake .
<unk> is a pretty village , with a small stream ; and everything appeared to prosper well , excepting , indeed , that which ought to do so most  its inhabitants .
the black children , completely naked , and looking very wretched , were carrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies .
near <unk> we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl  probably fifty or sixty in number .
they were extremely wary , and could not be approached .
they avoided us , like partridges on a rainy day in <name> , running with their heads cocked up ; and if pursued , they readily took to the wing .
the scenery of st. <name> possesses a beauty totally unexpected , from the prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island .
the village is situated at the bottom of a valley , bounded by lofty and jagged walls of stratified lava .
the black rocks afford a most striking contrast with the bright green vegetation , which follows the banks of a little stream of clear water .
it happened to be a grand <unk> , and the village was full of people .
on our return we overtook a party of about twenty young black girls , dressed in excellent taste ; their black skins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large shawls .
as soon as we approached near , they suddenly all turned round , and covering the path with their shawls , <name> with great energy a wild song , beating time with their hands upon their legs .
we threw them some <unk> , which were received with screams of laughter , and we left them <unk> the noise of their song .
one morning the view was singularly clear ; the distant mountains being projected with the sharpest outline , on a heavy bank of dark blue clouds .
judging from the appearance , and from similar cases in england , i supposed that the air was saturated with moisture .
the fact , however , turned out quite the contrary .
the <unk> gave a difference of <unk> degrees , between the temperature of the air , and the point at which dew was precipitated .
this difference was nearly double that which i had observed on the previous mornings .
this unusual degree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of lightning .
is it not an uncommon case , thus to find a remarkable degree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather ?
generally the atmosphere is hazy ; and this is caused by the falling of <unk> fine dust , which was found to have slightly injured the astronomical instruments .
the morning before we anchored at porto praya , i collected a little packet of this <unk> fine dust , which appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the vane at the masthead .
mr. lyell has also given me four packets of dust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these islands .
professor ehrenberg finds that this dust consists in great part of infusoria with siliceous shields , and of the siliceous tissue of plants .
( <unk> .
i must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my specimens .
i have sent ( <name> 1845 ) a full account of the falling of this dust to the geological society . )
in five little packets which i sent him , he has ascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms !
the infusoria , with the exception of two <name> species , are all inhabitants of fresh-water .
i have found no less than fifteen different accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the atlantic .
from the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen , and from its having always fallen during those months when the <unk> is known to raise clouds of dust high into the atmosphere , we may feel sure that it all comes from africa .
it is , however , a very singular fact , that , although professor ehrenberg knows many species of infusoria peculiar to africa , he finds none of these in the dust which i sent him .
on the other hand , he finds in it two species which hitherto he knows as living only in south <name> .
the dust falls in such quantities as to dirty everything on board , and to hurt people 's eyes ; vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the atmosphere .
it has often fallen on ships when several hundred , and even more than a thousand miles from the coast of africa , and at points sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction .
in some dust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land , i was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of an inch square , mixed with finer matter .
after this fact one need not be surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller <unk> of <unk> plants .
the geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural history .
on entering the harbour , a perfectly horizontal white band in the face of the sea <name> , may be seen running for some miles along the coast , and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water .
upon examination , this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous matter , with numerous shells embedded , most or all of which now exist on the neighbouring coast .
it rests on ancient volcanic rocks , and has been covered by a stream of basalt , which must have entered the sea when the white <name> bed was lying at the bottom .
it is interesting to trace the changes , produced by the heat of the overlying lava , on the friable mass , which in parts has been converted into a crystalline limestone , and in other parts into a compact spotted stone .
where the lime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower surface of the stream , it is converted into groups of beautifully <unk> fibres resembling <unk> .
the beds of lava rise in successive <unk> plains , towards the interior , whence the deluges of melted stone have originally proceeded .
within historical times no signs of volcanic activity have , i believe , been manifested in any part of st. jago .
even the form of a crater can but rarely be discovered on the summits of the many red <unk> hills ; yet the more recent streams can be distinguished on the coast , forming lines of cliffs of less height , but stretching out in advance of those belonging to an older series : the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude measure of the age of the streams .
during our stay , i observed the habits of some <name> animals .
a large <unk> is very common .
this <unk> is about five inches long ; and is of a dirty yellowish colour , <unk> with purple .
on each side of the lower surface , or foot , there is a broad membrane , which appears sometimes to act as a <unk> , in causing a current of water to flow over the dorsal branchiae or lungs .
it feeds on the delicate <unk> which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water ; and i found in its stomach several small pebbles , as in the gizzard of a bird .
this slug , when disturbed , emits a very fine <unk> fluid , which stains the water for the space of a foot around .
besides this means of defence , an acrid secretion , which is spread over its body , causes a sharp , stinging sensation , similar to that produced by the <unk> , or portuguese man-of-war .
i was much interested , on several occasions , by watching the habits of an <unk> , or cuttle-fish .
although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide , these animals were not easily caught .
by means of their long arms and suckers , they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices ; and when thus fixed , it required great force to remove them .
at other times they darted tail first , with the rapidity of an arrow , from one side of the pool to the other , at the same instant <unk> the water with a dark <unk> ink .
these animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary , <unk> power of changing their colour .
they appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass : when in deep water , their general shade was brownish purple , but when placed on the land , or in shallow water , this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green .
the colour , examined more carefully , was a french grey , with numerous minute spots of bright yellow : the former of these varied in intensity ; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns .
these changes were effected in such a manner that clouds , varying in tint between a <name> red and a <unk> , were continually passing over the body .
( 1/4 .
so named according to <name> <unk> 's nomenclature . )
any part , being subjected to a slight shock of <unk> , became almost black : a similar effect , but in a less degree , was produced by scratching the skin with a needle .
these clouds , or blushes as they may be called , are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids .
( <unk> .
see " encyclopedia of anatomy and physiology " article " <unk> . " )
this cuttle-fish displayed its <unk> power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom .
i was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual , which seemed fully aware that i was watching it .
remaining for a time motionless , it would then stealthily advance an inch or two , like a cat after a mouse ; sometimes changing its colour : it thus proceeded , till having gained a deeper part , it darted away , leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled .
while looking for <name> animals , with my head about two feet above the <name> shore , i was more than once saluted by a jet of water , accompanied by a slight grating noise .
at first i could not think what it was , but afterwards i found out that it was this cuttle-fish , which , though concealed in a hole , thus often led me to its discovery .
that it possesses the power of <unk> water there is no doubt , and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or <unk> on the under side of its body .
from the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads , they can not crawl with ease when placed on the ground .
i observed that one which i kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark .
st. <name> 's rocks .
in crossing the atlantic we <unk> , during the morning of february 16th , 1832 , close to the island of st. <name> 's .
this cluster of rocks is situated in 0 degrees 58 ' north latitude , and 29 degrees 15 ' west longitude .
it is <unk> miles distant from the coast of <name> , and 350 from the island of <name> noronha .
the highest point is only fifty feet above the level of the sea , and the entire circumference is under three-quarters of a mile .
this small point rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean .
its mineralogical constitution is not simple ; in some parts the rock is of a <unk> , in others of a feldspathic nature , including thin veins of serpentine .
it is a remarkable fact that all the many small islands , lying far from any continent , in the pacific , indian , and atlantic oceans , with the exception of the <unk> and this little point of rock , are , i believe , composed either of <name> or of erupted matter .
the volcanic nature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law , and the effect of those same causes , whether chemical or mechanical , from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either near <unk> or as islands in the midst of the sea .
( plate 4 .
incrustation of <name> sand . )
the rocks of st. <name> appear from a distance of a brilliantly white colour .
this is partly owing to the <name> of a vast multitude of <unk> , and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a <name> lustre , which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks .
this , when examined with a lens , is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers , its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch .
it contains much animal matter , and its origin , no doubt , is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds ' <name> .
below some small masses of <unk> at ascension , and on the <unk> islets , i found certain <unk> branching bodies , formed apparently in the same manner as the thin white coating on these rocks .
the branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae ( a family of hard calcareous <unk> ) , that in lately looking hastily over my collection i did not perceive the difference .
the globular extremities of the branches are of a <name> texture , like the enamel of teeth , but so hard as just to scratch plate-glass .
i may here mention , that on a part of the coast of ascension , where there is a vast accumulation of <name> sand , an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks , by the water of the sea , resembling , as represented in plate 4 , certain <unk> plants ( <unk> ) often seen on damp walls .
the surface of the fronds is beautifully glossy ; and those parts formed where fully exposed to the light , are of a jet black colour , but those shaded under ledges are only grey .
i have shown specimens of this incrustation to several geologists , and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous origin !
in its hardness and <unk>  in its polish , equal to that of the finest <unk>  in the bad smell given out , and loss of colour under the blowpipe  it shows a close similarity with living sea-shells .
moreover in sea-shells , it is known that the parts habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal , are of a paler colour than those fully exposed to the light , just as is the case with this incrustation .
when we remember that lime , either as a phosphate or carbonate , enters into the composition of the hard parts , such as bones and shells , of all living animals , it is an interesting physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of teeth , and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell , <unk> through inorganic means from dead organic matter  mocking , also , in shape , some of the lower vegetable productions .
( <unk> .
mr. <unk> and sir <name> brewster have described ( " philosophical transactions " 1836 <name> 65 ) a singular " artificial substance resembling shell . "
it is deposited in fine , transparent , highly polished , <unk> laminae , possessing peculiar optical properties , on the inside of a vessel , in which cloth , first prepared with glue and then with lime , is made to revolve rapidly in water .
it is much softer , more transparent , and contains more animal matter , than the natural incrustation at ascension ; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell . )
we found on st. <name> 's only two kinds of birds  the <unk> and the <unk> .
the former is a species of <unk> , and the latter a <unk> .
both are of a tame and stupid disposition , and are so unaccustomed to visitors , that i could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer .
the <unk> lays her eggs on the bare rock ; but the <unk> makes a very simple nest with seaweed .
by the side of many of these nests a small flying-fish was placed ; which i suppose , had been brought by the male bird for its partner .
it was amusing to watch how quickly a large and active crab ( <unk> ) , which inhabits the crevices of the rock , stole the fish from the side of the nest , as soon as we had disturbed the parent birds .
sir w. <unk> , one of the few persons who have landed here , informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even the young birds out of their nests , and devouring them .
not a single plant , not even a lichen , grows on this islet ; yet it is inhabited by several insects and spiders .
the following list <unk> , i believe , the terrestrial fauna : a fly ( <unk> ) living on the <unk> , and a tick which must have come here as a parasite on the birds ; a small brown moth , belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers ; a beetle ( <unk> ) and a woodlouse from beneath the <name> ; and lastly , numerous spiders , which i suppose prey on these small attendants and <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> description of the stately palm and other <name> tropical plants , then birds , and lastly man , taking possession of the <name> islets as soon as formed , in the pacific , is probably not quite correct ; i fear it destroys the poetry of this story , that feather and <unk> and parasitic insects and spiders should be the first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land .
the smallest rock in the tropical seas , by giving a foundation for the growth of innumerable kinds of seaweed and compound animals , supports likewise a large number of fish .
the sharks and the seamen in the boats maintained a constant struggle which should secure the greater share of the prey caught by the <unk> .
i have heard that a rock near the <unk> , lying many miles out at sea , and at a considerable depth , was first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed in the neighbourhood .
<name> noronha , february 20 , 1832 .
as far as i was enabled to observe , during the few hours we stayed at this place , the constitution of the island is volcanic , but probably not of a recent date .
the most remarkable feature is a conical hill , about one thousand feet high , the upper part of which is exceedingly steep , and on one side <unk> its base .
the rock is phonolite , and is divided into irregular columns .
on viewing one of these isolated masses , at first one is inclined to believe that it has been suddenly pushed up in a <unk> state .
at st. <name> , however , i ascertained that some pinnacles , of a nearly similar figure and constitution , had been formed by the injection of melted rock into yielding strata , which thus had formed the moulds for these gigantic <unk> .
the whole island is covered with wood ; but from the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance .
half-way up the mountain some great masses of the columnar rock , shaded by <unk> trees , and ornamented by others covered with fine pink flowers but without a single leaf , gave a pleasing effect to the nearer parts of the scenery .
bahia , or san <name> .
brazil , february 29 , 1832 .
the day has past delightfully .
delight itself , however , is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who , for the first time , has wandered by himself in a brazilian forest .
the elegance of the grasses , the novelty of the <unk> plants , the beauty of the flowers , the glossy green of the foliage , but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation , filled me with admiration .
a most paradoxical mixture of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood .
the noise from the insects is so loud , that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored several hundred yards from the shore ; yet within the recesses of the forest a universal silence appears to reign .
to a person fond of natural history , such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he can ever <name> to experience again .
after wandering about for some hours , i returned to the landing-place ; but , before reaching it , i was overtaken by a tropical storm .
i tried to find shelter under a tree , which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by common english rain ; but here , in a couple of minutes , a little torrent flowed down the trunk .
it is to this violence of the rain that we must attribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods : if the showers were like those of a colder clime , the greater part would be absorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground .
i <name> not at present attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this <name> bay , because , in our homeward voyage , we called here a second time , and i shall then have occasion to remark on it .
along the whole coast of brazil , for a length of at least 2000 miles , and certainly for a considerable space inland , wherever solid rock occurs , it belongs to a granitic formation .
the circumstance of this enormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists believe to have been crystallised when heated under pressure , gives rise to many curious reflections .
was this effect produced beneath the depths of a profound ocean ?
or did a covering of strata formerly extend over it , which has since been removed ?
can we believe that any power , acting for a time short of infinity , could have denuded the granite over so many thousand square leagues ?
on a point not far from the city , where a rivulet entered the sea , i observed a fact connected with a subject discussed by humboldt .
( <unk> .
" personal narrative " volume 5 part 1 <name> 18 . )
at the cataracts of the great rivers <unk> , nile , and congo , the <unk> rocks are coated by a black substance , appearing as if they had been polished with <unk> .
the layer is of extreme thinness ; and on analysis by <unk> it was found to consist of the oxides of manganese and iron .
in the <unk> it occurs on the rocks periodically washed by the floods , and in those parts alone where the stream is rapid ; or , as the indians say , " the rocks are black where the waters are white . "
here the coating is of a <name> brown instead of a black colour , and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone .
hand specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones which glitter in the sun 's rays .
they occur only within the limits of the tidal waves ; and as the rivulet slowly <unk> down , the surf must supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers .
in like manner , the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the periodical inundations ; and thus the same effects are produced under apparently different but really similar circumstances .
the origin , however , of these <unk> of metallic oxides , which seem as if cemented to the rocks , is not understood ; and no reason , i believe , can be assigned for their thickness remaining the same .
( plate 5 .
<unk> <unk> ( distended and contracted ) . )
one day i was amused by watching the habits of the <unk> <unk> , which was caught swimming near the shore .
this fish , with its <unk> skin , is well known to possess the singular power of <unk> itself into a nearly spherical form .
after having been taken out of water for a short time , and then again immersed in it , a considerable quantity both of water and air is absorbed by the mouth , and perhaps likewise by the branchial orifices .
this process is effected by two methods : the air is swallowed , and is then forced into the cavity of the body , its return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally visible : but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth , which is kept wide open and motionless ; this latter action must , therefore , depend on <unk> .
the skin about the abdomen is much <unk> than that on the back ; hence , during the inflation , the lower surface becomes far more distended than the upper ; and the fish , in consequence , floats with its back downwards .
cuvier doubts whether the <unk> in this position is able to swim ; but not only can it thus move forward in a straight line , but it can turn round to either side .
this latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the <unk> fins ; the tail being collapsed and not used .
from the body being buoyed up with so much air , the branchial openings are out of water , but a stream drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them .
the fish , having remained in this distended state for a short time , generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the branchial apertures and mouth .
it could emit , at <name> , a certain portion of the water , and it appears , therefore probable that this fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific gravity .
this <unk> possessed several means of defence .
it could give a severe bite , and could eject water from its mouth to some distance , at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of its jaws .
by the inflation of its body , the papillae , with which the skin is covered , become erect and pointed .
but the most curious circumstance is , that it <unk> from the skin of its belly , when handled , a most beautiful <unk> fibrous matter , which stains <name> and paper in so permanent a manner , that the tint is retained with all its brightness to the present day : i am quite ignorant of the nature and use of this secretion .
i have heard from dr. <name> of <unk> , that he has frequently found a <unk> , floating alive and distended , in the stomach of the shark ; and that on several occasions he has known it eat its way , not only through the coats of the stomach , but through the sides of the monster , which has thus been killed .
who would ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed the great and savage shark ?
march 18 , 1832 .
( plate 6 .
pelagic <unk> . )
we sailed from bahia .
a few days afterwards , when not far distant from the <unk> islets , my attention was called to a reddish-brown appearance in the sea .
the whole surface of the water , as it appeared under a weak lens , seemed as if covered by chopped bits of hay , with their ends jagged .
these are minute cylindrical <unk> , in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each .
mr. berkeley informs me that they are the same species ( <unk> <unk> ) with that found over large spaces in the red sea , and whence its name of red sea is derived .
( 1/8 .
m. <unk> in " <unk> rendus " etc .
<unk> 1844 ; and " annales des sciences <unk> " december 1844 . )
their <name> must be infinite : the ship passed through several bands of them , one of which was about ten yards wide , and , judging from the <unk> colour of the water , at least two and a half miles long .
in almost every long voyage some account is given of these <unk> .
they appear especially common in the sea near australia ; and off cape <unk> i found an allied , but smaller and apparently different species .
captain cook , in his third voyage , remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the name of <unk> .
near keeling atoll , in the indian ocean , i observed many little masses of <unk> a few inches square , consisting of long cylindrical threads of excessive thinness , so as to be barely visible to the naked eye , mingled with other rather larger bodies , finely conical at both ends .
two of these are shown in plate 6 united together .
they vary in length from <unk> to <unk> , and even to <unk> of an inch in length ; and in diameter from <unk> to <unk> of an inch .
near one extremity of the cylindrical part , a green <unk> , formed of granular matter , and thickest in the middle , may generally be seen .
this , i believe , is the bottom of a most delicate , colourless sac , composed of a pulpy substance , which lines the exterior case , but does not extend within the extreme conical points .
in some specimens , small but perfect spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the <unk> ; and i observed the curious process by which they were produced .
the pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into lines , some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre ; it then continued , with an irregular and rapid movement , to contract itself , so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a perfect little sphere , which occupied the position of the <unk> at one end of the now quite hollow case .
the formation of the granular sphere was hastened by any accidental injury .
i may add , that frequently a pair of these bodies were attached to each other , as represented above , cone beside cone , at that end where the <unk> occurs .
i <name> here add a few other observations connected with the <unk> of the sea from organic causes .
on the coast of chile , a few leagues north of <name> , the " beagle " one day passed through great bands of muddy water , exactly like that of a swollen river ; and again , a degree south of valparaiso , when fifty miles from the land , the same appearance was still more extensive .
some of the water placed in a glass was of a pale reddish tint ; and , examined under a microscope , was seen to swarm with minute <unk> darting about , and often exploding .
their shape is oval , and contracted in the middle by a ring of vibrating curved <unk> .
it was , however , very difficult to examine them with care , for almost the instant motion ceased , even while crossing the field of vision , their bodies burst .
sometimes both ends burst at once , sometimes only one , and a quantity of coarse , brownish , granular matter was ejected .
the animal an instant before bursting expanded to half again its natural size ; and the explosion took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had ceased : in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a <unk> movement on the longer axis .
about two minutes after any number were isolated in a drop of water , they thus perished .
the animals move with the narrow apex forwards , by the aid of their vibratory <unk> , and generally by rapid starts .
they are exceedingly minute , and quite invisible to the naked eye , only covering a space equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch .
their <name> were infinite ; for the smallest drop of water which i could remove contained very many .
in one day we passed through two spaces of water thus stained , one of which alone must have extended over several square miles .
what incalculable <name> of these microscopical animals !
the colour of the water , as seen at some distance , was like that of a river which has flowed through a red <name> district ; but under the shade of the vessel 's side it was quite as dark as chocolate .
the line where the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined .
the weather for some days previously had been calm , and the ocean abounded , to an unusual degree , with living creatures .
( <unk> .
m. lesson " voyage de la <unk> " tome 1 <name> 255 , mentions red water off lima , apparently produced by the same cause .
<unk> , the distinguished naturalist , in the " voyage aux <unk> <unk> , " gives no less than twelve references to voyagers who have alluded to the discoloured waters of the sea ( volume 2 <name> 239 ) .
to the references given by <unk> may be added , humboldt 's " personal narrative " volume 6 <name> <unk> ; <unk> " voyage " volume 1 <name> 92 ; <unk> , volume 1 <name> 287 ; <unk> 's " voyage " ; " voyage of the <unk> and of the <unk> " ; captain king 's " survey of australia " etc . )
in the sea around <name> <name> fuego , and at no great distance from the land , i have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour , from the number of crustacea , which somewhat resemble in form large <unk> .
the sealers call them <unk> .
whether whales feed on them i do not know ; but terns , <unk> , and immense herds of great unwieldy seals derive , on some parts of the coast , their chief sustenance from these swimming crabs .
seamen invariably attribute the <unk> of the water to spawn ; but i found this to be the case only on one occasion .
at the distance of several leagues from the archipelago of the galapagos , the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish , or <unk> water ; these strips were some miles long , but only a few yards wide , and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous yet distinct margin .
the colour was caused by little gelatinous balls , about the fifth of an inch in diameter , in which numerous minute spherical ovules were embedded : they were of two distinct kinds , one being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other .
i can not form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these belonged .
captain <unk> remarks that this appearance is very common among the galapagos islands , and that the direction of the bands indicates that of the currents ; in the described case , however , the line was caused by the wind .
the only other appearance which i have to notice , is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent colours .
i saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the coast of brazil ; the seamen attributed it to the <unk> carcass of some whale , which probably was floating at no great distance .
i do not here mention the minute gelatinous particles , hereafter to be referred to , which are frequently dispersed throughout the water , for they are not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour .
there are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear remarkable : first , how do the various bodies which form the bands with defined edges keep together ?
in the case of the <unk> crabs , their movements were as <unk> as in a regiment of soldiers ; but this can not happen from anything like voluntary action with the ovules , or the <unk> , nor is it probable among the infusoria .
secondly , what causes the length and narrowness of the bands ?
the appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent , where the stream <unk> into long streaks the froth collected in the eddies , that i must attribute the effect to a similar action either of the currents of the air or sea .
under this supposition we must believe that the various organised bodies are produced in certain favourable places , and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water .
i confess , however , there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of <unk> and <unk> : for whence come the germs at such points ?  the parent bodies having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean .
but on no other hypothesis can i understand their linear grouping .
i may add that <unk> remarks that green water abounding with pelagic animals is invariably found in a certain part of the arctic sea .

<name> 4 to july 5 , 1832 .
a few days after our arrival i became acquainted with an englishman who was going to visit his estate , situated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital , to the northward of cape <unk> .
i gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing me to accompany him .
<name> 8 , 1832 .
our party amounted to seven .
the first stage was very interesting .
the day was powerfully hot , and as we passed through the woods , everything was motionless , excepting the large and brilliant butterflies , which lazily fluttered about .
the view seen when crossing the hills behind <unk> grande was most beautiful ; the colours were intense , and the prevailing tint a dark blue ; the sky and the calm waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour .
after passing through some cultivated country , we entered a forest which in the grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded .
we arrived by midday at <unk> ; this small village is situated on a plain , and round the central house are the huts of the negroes .
these , from their regular form and position , reminded me of the drawings of the hottentot habitations in southern africa .
as the moon rose early , we determined to start the same evening for our <unk> at the <unk> <name> .
as it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive , bare , and steep hills of granite which are so common in this country .
this spot is notorious from having been , for a long time , the residence of some runaway slaves , who , by cultivating a little ground near the top , contrived to <unk> out a subsistence .
at length they were discovered , and a party of soldiers being sent , the whole were seized with the exception of one old woman , who , sooner than again be led into slavery , dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain .
in a <name> matron this would have been called the <name> love of freedom : in a poor negress it is mere brutal obstinacy .
we continued riding for some hours .
for the few last miles the road was intricate , and it passed through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons .
the scene by the dimmed light of the moon was most desolate .
a few <unk> flitted by us ; and the solitary snipe , as it rose , uttered its plaintive cry .
the distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night .
<name> 9 , 1832 .
we left our miserable <unk> before sunrise .
the road passed through a narrow <name> plain , lying between the sea and the interior salt lagoons .
the number of beautiful fishing birds , such as egrets and cranes , and the succulent plants assuming most <unk> forms , gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have possessed .
the few stunted trees were loaded with <unk> plants , among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the <unk> were most to be admired .
as the sun rose , the day became extremely hot , and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very distressing .
we dined at <unk> ; the thermometer in the shade being 84 degrees .
the beautiful view of the distant wooded hills , reflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon , quite refreshed us .
as the <unk> here was a very good one , and i have the pleasant , but rare remembrance , of an excellent dinner , i <name> be grateful and presently describe it , as the type of its class .
( <unk> .
<unk> , the portuguese name for an inn . )
these houses are often large , and are built of thick upright posts , with boughs <unk> , and afterwards plastered .
they seldom have floors , and never glazed windows ; but are generally pretty well roofed .
universally the front part is open , forming a kind of verandah , in which tables and benches are placed .
the bedrooms join on each side , and here the passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can , on a wooden platform covered by a thin straw mat .
the <unk> stands in a courtyard , where the horses are fed .
on first arriving , it was our custom to <unk> the horses and give them their indian corn ; then , with a low bow , to ask the <unk> to do us the favour to give us something to eat .
" anything you choose , sir , " was his usual answer .
for the few first times , vainly i thanked providence for having guided us to so good a man .
the conversation proceeding , the case universally became deplorable .
" any fish can you do us the favour of giving ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
 " any soup ? "
 " no , sir . "
 " any bread ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
 " any dried meat ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
if we were lucky , by waiting a couple of hours , we obtained fowls , rice , and <unk> .
it not unfrequently happened that we were obliged to kill , with stones , the poultry for our own supper .
when , thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger , we <unk> hinted that we should be glad of our meal , the pompous , and ( though true ) most unsatisfactory answer was , " it <name> be ready when it is ready . "
if we had dared to remonstrate any further , we should have been told to proceed on our journey , as being too impertinent .
the hosts are most <unk> and disagreeable in their manners ; their houses and their persons are often <unk> dirty ; the want of the accommodation of forks , knives , and spoons is common ; and i am sure no cottage or hovel in england could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every comfort .
at <unk> <unk> , however , we fared sumptuously ; having rice and fowls , biscuit , wine , and spirits , for dinner ; coffee in the evening , and fish with coffee for breakfast .
all this , with good food for the horses , only cost 2 shillings 6 pence per head .
yet the host of this <unk> , being asked if he knew anything of a whip which one of the party had lost , gruffly answered , " how should i know ?
why did you not take care of it ?  i suppose the dogs have eaten it . "
leaving <unk> , we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness of lakes ; in some of which were fresh , in others salt water shells .
of the former kind , i found a <unk> in great <name> in a lake , into which the inhabitants assured me that the sea enters once a year , and sometimes oftener , and makes the water quite salt .
i have no doubt many interesting facts in relation to <name> and fresh-water animals might be observed in this chain of lagoons which skirt the coast of brazil .
m. <name> has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of rio shells of the <name> genera <unk> and mytilus , and fresh-water <unk> , living together in brackish water .
( <unk> .
" annales des sciences <unk> " for 1833 . )
i also frequently observed in the lagoon near the botanic garden , where the water is only a little less salt than in the sea , a species of <unk> , very similar to a <unk> common in the ditches of england : in the same lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in <unk> .
( plate 9 .

head , full size . )
leaving the coast for a time , we again entered the forest .
the trees were very lofty , and remarkable , compared with those of europe , from the whiteness of their trunks .
i see by my notebook , " wonderful and beautiful flowering parasites , " invariably struck me as the most novel object in these grand scenes .
travelling onwards we passed through tracts of pasturage , much injured by the enormous conical ants ' nests , which were nearly twelve feet high .
they gave to the plain exactly the appearance of the mud volcanoes at <unk> , as figured by humboldt .
we arrived at <unk> after it was dark , having been ten hours on horseback .
i never ceased , during the whole journey , to be surprised at the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring ; they appeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our english breed .
the <unk> bat is often the cause of much trouble , by biting the horses on their withers .
the injury is generally not so much owing to the loss of blood , as to the inflammation which the pressure of the saddle afterwards produces .
the whole circumstance has lately been doubted in england ; i was therefore fortunate in being present when one ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> . )
was actually caught on a horse 's back .
we were <unk> late one evening near coquimbo , in chile , when my servant , noticing that one of the horses was very restive , went to see what was the matter , and <unk> he could distinguish something , suddenly put his hand on the beast 's withers , and secured the <unk> .
in the morning the spot where the bite had been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and bloody .
the third day afterwards we rode the horse , without any ill effects .
<name> 13 , 1832 .
after three days ' travelling we arrived at <unk> , the estate of <unk> <name> <unk> , a relation of one of our party .
the house was simple , and , though like a barn in form , was well suited to the climate .
in the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls , thatched roof , and windows without glass .
the house , together with the granaries , the stables , and workshops for the blacks , who had been taught various trades , formed a rude kind of <unk> ; in the centre of which a large pile of coffee was drying .
these buildings stand on a little hill , overlooking the cultivated ground , and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green luxuriant forest .
the chief produce of this part of the country is coffee .
each tree is supposed to yield annually , on an average , two pounds ; but some give as much as eight .
<unk> or <unk> is likewise cultivated in great quantity .
every part of this plant is useful : the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses , and the roots are ground into a pulp , which , when pressed dry and baked , forms the <unk> , the principal article of sustenance in the <unk> .
it is a curious , though well-known fact , that the juice of this most nutritious plant is highly poisonous .
a few years ago a cow died at this <unk> , in consequence of having drunk some of it .
<unk> <unk> told me that he had planted , the year before , one bag of <unk> or beans , and three of rice ; the former of which produced eighty , and the latter three hundred and twenty fold .
the pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle , and the woods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days .
this profusion of food showed itself at dinner , where , if the tables did not groan , the guests surely did ; for each person is expected to eat of every dish .
one day , having , as i thought , nicely calculated so that nothing should go away <unk> , to my utter dismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial reality .
during the meals , it was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds , and dozens of little black children , which crawled in together , at every opportunity .
as long as the idea of slavery could be banished , there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and <unk> style of living : it was such a perfect retirement and independence from the rest of the world .
as soon as any stranger is seen arriving , a large <name> is set tolling , and generally some small cannon are fired .
the event is thus announced to the rocks and woods , but to nothing else .
one morning i walked out an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene ; at last , the silence was broken by the morning hymn , raised on high by the whole body of the blacks ; and in this manner their daily work is generally begun .
on such <unk> as these , i have no doubt the slaves pass happy and contented lives .
on saturday and <name> they work for themselves , and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week .
<name> 14 , 1832 .
( plate 10 .
virgin forest . )
leaving <unk> , we rode to another estate on the rio <unk> , which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction .
the estate was two and a half miles long , and the owner had forgotten how many broad .
only a very small piece had been cleared , yet almost every acre was capable of yielding all the various <name> productions of a tropical land .
considering the enormous area of brazil , the proportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as anything compared to that which is left in the state of nature : at some future age , how vast a population it <name> support !
during the second day 's journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers .
the forest abounded with beautiful objects ; among which the tree ferns , though not large , were , from their bright green foliage , and the elegant curvature of their fronds , most worthy of admiration .
in the evening it rained very heavily , and although the thermometer stood at 65 degrees , i felt very cold .
as soon as the rain ceased , it was curious to observe the extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the forest .
at the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a dense white vapour , which rose like columns of smoke from the most <unk> parts , and especially from the valleys .
i observed this phenomenon on several occasions : i suppose it is owing to the large surface of foliage , previously heated by the sun 's rays .
while staying at this estate , i was very nearly being an <unk> to one of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave country .
owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit , the owner was on the point of taking all the women and children from the male slaves , and selling them separately at the public auction at rio .
interest , and not any feeling of compassion , prevented this act .
indeed , i do not believe the <unk> of separating thirty families , who had lived together for many years , even occurred to the owner .
yet i <name> pledge myself , that in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of men .
it may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest and selfish habit .
i may mention one very trifling anecdote , which at the time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty .
i was crossing a ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid .
in endeavouring to make him understand , i talked loud , and made signs , in doing which i passed my hand near his face .
he , i suppose , thought i was in a passion , and was going to strike him ; for instantly , with a frightened look and half-shut eyes , he dropped his hands .
i shall never forget my feelings of surprise , disgust , and shame , at seeing a great powerful man afraid even to <name> off a blow , directed , as he thought , at his face .
this man had been trained to a degradation lower than the slavery of the most helpless animal .
<name> 18 , 1832 .
( plate 11 .
cabbage palm . )
in returning we spent two days at <unk> , and i employed them in collecting insects in the forest .
the greater number of trees , although so lofty , are not more than three or four feet in circumference .
there are , of course , a few of much greater <unk> .
<unk> <name> was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid trunk , which had originally been 110 feet long , and of great thickness .
the contrast of palm trees , growing amidst the common branching kinds , never fails to give the scene an intertropical character .
here the woods were ornamented by the cabbage palm  one of the most beautiful of its family .
with a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two hands , it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet above the ground .
the woody creepers , themselves covered by other creepers , were of great thickness : some which i measured were two feet in circumference .
many of the older trees presented a very curious appearance from the tresses of a <name> hanging from their boughs , and resembling bundles of hay .
if the eye was turned from the world of foliage above , to the ground beneath , it was attracted by the extreme elegance of the leaves of the ferns and <unk> .
the latter , in some parts , covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high .
in walking across these thick beds of <unk> , a broad track was marked by the change of shade , produced by the drooping of their sensitive petioles .
it is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes ; but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder , astonishment , and devotion , which fill and elevate the mind .
( plate 12 .
<unk> or <unk> . )
<name> 19 , 1832 .
leaving <unk> , during the two first days we retraced our steps .
it was very wearisome work , as the road generally ran across a glaring hot <name> plain , not far from the coast .
i noticed that each time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand , a gentle chirping noise was produced .
on the third day we took a different line , and passed through the <name> little village of <unk> de <unk> .
this is one of the principal lines of road in brazil ; yet it was in so bad a state that no wheel vehicle , excepting the clumsy <unk> , could pass along .
in our whole journey we did not cross a single bridge built of stone ; and those made of logs of wood were frequently so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid them .
all distances are <unk> known .
the road is often marked by crosses , in the place of <unk> , to signify where human blood has been spilled .
on the evening of the 23rd we arrived at rio , having finished our pleasant little excursion .
during the remainder of my stay at rio , i resided in a cottage at <unk> bay .
it was impossible to wish for anything more delightful than thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country .
in england any person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great advantage , by always having something to attract his attention ; but in these fertile climates , teeming with life , the attractions are so numerous , that he is scarcely able to walk at all .
the few observations which i was enabled to make were almost exclusively confined to the <unk> animals .
the existence of a division of the genus <unk> , which inhabits the dry land , interested me much .
these animals are of so simple a structure , that cuvier has arranged them with the intestinal worms , though never found within the bodies of other animals .
numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh water ; but those to which i allude were found , even in the <unk> parts of the forest , beneath logs of rotten wood , on which i believe they feed .
in general form they resemble little slugs , but are very much narrower in proportion , and several of the species are beautifully coloured with longitudinal stripes .
their structure is very simple : near the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small transverse slits , from the anterior one of which a <unk> and highly irritable mouth can be protruded .
for some time after the rest of the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any other cause , this organ still retained its vitality .
i found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial <unk> in different parts of the southern hemisphere .
( <unk> .
i have described and named these species in the " annals of natural history " volume 14 <name> 241 . )
some specimens which i obtained at van <unk> 's land , i kept alive for nearly two months , feeding them on rotten wood .
having cut one of them transversely into two nearly equal parts , in the course of a fortnight both had the shape of perfect animals .
i had , however , so divided the body , that one of the halves contained both the inferior orifices , and the other , in consequence , none .
in the course of twenty-five days from the operation , the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from any other specimen .
the other had increased much in size ; and towards its posterior end , a clear space was formed in the <unk> mass , in which a rudimentary <unk> mouth could clearly be distinguished ; on the under surface , however , no corresponding slit was yet open .
if the increased heat of the weather , as we approached the equator , had not destroyed all the individuals , there can be no doubt that this last step would have completed its structure .
although so well known an experiment , it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every essential organ , out of the simple extremity of another animal .
it is extremely difficult to preserve these <unk> ; as soon as the cessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act , their entire bodies become soft and fluid , with a rapidity which i have never seen equalled .
i first visited the forest in which these <unk> were found , in company with an old portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him .
the sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs , and then patiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear .
we were accompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer  a good specimen of a wild brazilian youth .
he was dressed in a tattered old shirt and trousers , and had his head uncovered : he carried an old-fashioned gun and a large knife .
the habit of carrying the knife is universal ; and in traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary , on account of the creeping plants .
the frequent occurrence of murder may be partly attributed to this habit .
the <unk> are so dexterous with the knife that they can throw it to some distance with precision , and with sufficient force to cause a fatal wound .
i have seen a number of little boys practising this <name> as a game of play , and from their skill in hitting an upright stick , they promised well for more <name> attempts .
my companion , the day before , had shot two large bearded monkeys .
these animals have prehensile tails , the extremity of which , even after death , can support the whole weight of the body .
one of them thus remained fast to a branch , and it was necessary to cut down a large tree to procure it .
this was soon effected , and down came tree and monkey with an awful crash .
our day 's sport , besides the monkey , was confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans .
i profited , however , by my acquaintance with the portuguese padre , for on another occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the <unk> cat .
every one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near <unk> .
the house in which i lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain of the <unk> .
it has been remarked , with much truth , that abruptly conical hills are characteristic of the formation which humboldt <unk> as <unk> .
nothing can be more striking than the effect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the most luxuriant vegetation .
i was often interested by watching the clouds , which , rolling in from seaward , formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the <unk> .
this mountain , like most others , when thus partly veiled , appeared to rise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of <unk> feet .
mr. <name> has observed , in his <unk> essays , that a cloud sometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit , while the wind continues to blow over it .
the same phenomenon here presented a slightly different appearance .
in this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl over , and rapidly pass by the summit , and yet was neither diminished nor increased in size .
the sun was setting , and a gentle southerly breeze , striking against the southern side of the rock , mingled its current with the colder air above ; and the vapour was thus condensed : but as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge , and came within the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping bank , they were immediately <unk> .
the climate , during the months of may and <name> , or the beginning of <name> , was delightful .
the mean temperature , from observations taken at nine o'clock , both morning and evening , was only 72 degrees .
it often rained heavily , but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the walks pleasant .
one morning , in the course of six hours , <unk> inches of rain fell .
as this storm passed over the forests which surround the <unk> , the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless multitude of leaves was very remarkable , it could be heard at the distance of a quarter of a mile , and was like the rushing of a great body of water .
after the hotter days , it was delicious to sit quietly in the garden and watch the evening pass into night .
nature , in these climes , chooses her <unk> from more humble performers than in europe .
a small frog , of the genus <unk> , sits on a blade of grass about an inch above the surface of the water , and sends forth a pleasing chirp : when several are together they sing in <name> on different notes .
i had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this frog .
the genus <unk> has its toes terminated by small suckers ; and i found this animal could crawl up a pane of glass , when placed absolutely perpendicular .
various <unk> and crickets , at the same time , keep up a ceaseless shrill cry , but which , softened by the distance , is not unpleasant .
every evening after dark this great concert commenced ; and often have i sat listening to it , until my attention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect .
at these times the <unk> are seen flitting about from hedge to hedge .
on a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred paces distant .
it is remarkable that in all the different kinds of <unk> , shining <unk> , and various <name> animals ( such as the crustacea , <unk> , <unk> , a coralline of the genus <unk> , and <unk> ) , which i have observed , the light has been of a well-marked green colour .
all the <unk> , which i caught here , belonged to the <unk> ( in which family the english <unk> is included ) , and the greater number of specimens were of <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> .
i am greatly indebted to mr. waterhouse for his kindness in naming for me this and many other insects , and giving me much valuable assistance . )
i found that this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated : in the intervals , the abdominal rings were obscured .
the flash was almost <unk> in the two rings , but it was just perceptible first in the anterior one .
the shining matter was fluid and very adhesive : little spots , where the skin had been torn , continued bright with a slight <unk> , whilst the uninjured parts were obscured .
when the insect was <unk> the rings remained uninterruptedly bright , but not so brilliant as before : local irritation with a needle always increased the vividness of the light .
the rings in one instance retained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the death of the insect .
from these facts it would appear probable , that the animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light for short intervals , and that at other times the display is involuntary .
on the muddy and wet <unk> i found the larvae of this <unk> in great <name> : they resembled in general form the female of the english <unk> .
these larvae possessed but feeble luminous powers ; very differently from their parents , on the slightest touch they feigned death , and ceased to shine ; nor did irritation excite any fresh display .
i kept several of them alive for some time : their tails are very singular organs , for they act , by a <unk> contrivance , as suckers or organs of attachment , and likewise as <unk> for saliva , or some such fluid .
i repeatedly fed them on raw meat ; and i invariably observed , that every now and then the extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth , and a drop of fluid <unk> on the meat , which was then in the act of being consumed .
the tail , notwithstanding so much practice , does not seem to be able to find its way to the mouth ; at least the neck was always touched first , and apparently as a guide .
when we were at bahia , an <unk> or beetle ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> . )
seemed the most common luminous insect .
the light in this case was also rendered more brilliant by irritation .
i amused myself one day by observing the springing powers of this insect , which have not , as it appears to me , been properly described .
( <unk> .
<name> 's " entomology " volume 2 <name> 317 . )
the <unk> , when placed on its back and preparing to spring , moved its head and thorax backwards , so that the <unk> spine was drawn out , and rested on the edge of its sheath .
the same backward movement being continued , the spine , by the full action of the muscles , was bent like a spring ; and the insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and <unk> .
the effort being suddenly relaxed , the head and thorax flew up , and in consequence , the base of the <unk> struck the supporting surface with such force , that the insect by the reaction was jerked upwards to the height of one or two inches .
the projecting points of the thorax , and the sheath of the spine , served to steady the whole body during the spring .
in the descriptions which i have read , sufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity of the spine : so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple muscular contraction , without the aid of some mechanical contrivance .
on several occasions i enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions in the neighbouring country .
one day i went to the botanic garden , where many plants , well known for their great utility , might be seen growing .
the leaves of the camphor , pepper , <unk> , and <unk> trees were delightfully <unk> ; and the <unk> , the <unk> , and the mango , vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage .
the landscape in the neighbourhood of bahia almost takes its character from the two latter trees .
before seeing them , i had no idea that any trees could cast so black a shade on the ground .
both of them bear to the evergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which laurels and <unk> in england do to the lighter green of the <unk> trees .
it may be observed that the houses within the tropics are surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation , because many of them are at the same time most useful to man .
who can doubt that these qualities are united in the banana , the cocoa-nut , the many kinds of palm , the orange , and the <unk> tree ?
during this day i was particularly struck with a remark of humboldt 's , who often alludes to " the thin vapour which , without changing the transparency of the air , renders its tints more harmonious , and <unk> its effects . "
this is an appearance which i have never observed in the temperate zones .
the atmosphere , seen through a short space of half or three-quarters of a mile , was perfectly lucid , but at a greater distance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze , of a pale french grey , mingled with a little blue .
the condition of the atmosphere between the morning and about noon , when the effect was most evident , had undergone little change , excepting in its dryness .
in the interval , the difference between the dew point and temperature had increased from <unk> to 17 degrees .
on another occasion i started early and walked to the <unk> , or <unk> mountain .
the air was delightfully cool and fragrant ; and the drops of dew still glittered on the leaves of the large <unk> plants , which shaded the <unk> of clear water .
sitting down on a block of granite , it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as they flew past .
the humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady retired spots .
whenever i saw these little creatures buzzing round a flower , with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely visible , i was reminded of the sphinx moths : their movements and habits are indeed in many respects very similar .
( plate 13 .
rio de janeiro . )
following a pathway i entered a <name> forest , and from a height of five or six hundred feet , one of those splendid views was presented , which are so common on every side of rio .
at this elevation the landscape attains its most brilliant tint ; and every form , every shade , so completely <unk> in magnificence all that the european has ever beheld in his own country , that he knows not how to express his feelings .
the general effect frequently recalled to my mind the <unk> scenery of the <unk> or the great theatres .
i never returned from these excursions empty-handed .
this day i found a specimen of a curious fungus , called <unk> .
most people know the english <unk> , which in autumn <unk> the air with its odious smell : this , however , as the entomologist is aware , is to some of our beetles a delightful fragrance .
so was it here ; for a <unk> , attracted by the odour , alighted on the fungus as i carried it in my hand .
we here see in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and insects of the same families , though the species of both are different .
when man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species this relation is often broken : as one instance of this i may mention that the leaves of the cabbages and <unk> , which in england afford food to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars , in the gardens near rio are untouched .
during our stay at brazil i made a large collection of insects .
a few general observations on the comparative importance of the different orders may be interesting to the english entomologist .
the large and <unk> lepidoptera <unk> the zone they inhabit , far more plainly than any other race of animals .
i allude only to the butterflies ; for the moths , contrary to what might have been expected from the <unk> of the vegetation , certainly appeared in much fewer <name> than in our own temperate regions .
i was much surprised at the habits of papilio <unk> .
this butterfly is not uncommon , and generally <unk> the <unk> .
although a high <unk> , yet it very frequently alights on the trunks of trees .
on these occasions its head is invariably placed downwards ; and its wings are expanded in a horizontal plane , instead of being folded vertically , as is commonly the case .
this is the only butterfly which i have ever seen that uses its legs for running .
not being aware of this fact , the insect , more than once , as i cautiously approached with my <unk> , shuffled on one side just as the instrument was on the point of closing , and thus escaped .
but a far more singular fact is the power which this species possesses of making a noise .
( <unk> .
mr. doubleday has lately described ( before the entomological society , march 3 , 1845 ) a peculiar structure in the wings of this butterfly , which seems to be the means of its making its noise .
he says , " it is remarkable for having a sort of drum at the base of the fore wings , between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
these two nervures , moreover , have a peculiar <unk> diaphragm or vessel in the interior . "
i find in <unk> 's travels ( in the years <unk> <name> 74 ) it is said , that in the island of st. <unk> on the coast of brazil , a butterfly called <unk> <unk> , makes a noise , when flying away , like a rattle . )
several times when a pair , probably male and female , were chasing each other in an irregular course , they passed within a few yards of me ; and i distinctly heard a clicking noise , similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a spring catch .
the noise was continued at short intervals , and could be distinguished at about twenty yards ' distance : i am certain there is no error in the observation .
i was disappointed in the general aspect of the coleoptera .
the number of minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great .
( <unk> .
i may mention , as a common instance of one day 's ( <name> 23rd ) collecting , when i was not attending particularly to the coleoptera , that i caught sixty-eight species of that order .
among these , there were only two of the <unk> , four <unk> , fifteen <unk> , and fourteen of the <unk> .
thirty-seven species of <unk> , which i brought home , <name> be sufficient to prove that i was not paying overmuch attention to the generally favoured order of coleoptera . )
the cabinets of europe can , as yet , boast only of the larger species from tropical climates .
it is sufficient to disturb the composure of an entomologist 's mind , to look forward to the future dimensions of a complete catalogue .
the carnivorous beetles , or <unk> , appear in extremely few <name> within the tropics : this is the more remarkable when compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds , which are so abundant in hot countries .
i was struck with this observation both on entering brazil , and when i saw the many elegant and active forms of the <unk> <unk> on the temperate plains of la plata .
do the very numerous spiders and <unk> hymenoptera supply the place of the carnivorous beetles ?
the <unk> and <unk> are very uncommon ; on the other hand , the <unk> and <unk> , all of which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence , are present in astonishing <name> .
i do not here refer to the number of different species , but to that of the individual insects ; for on this it is that the most striking character in the entomology of different countries depends .
the orders orthoptera and <unk> are particularly numerous ; as likewise is the stinging division of the hymenoptera ; the bees , perhaps , being excepted .
a person , on first entering a tropical forest , is astonished at the labours of the ants : <unk> paths branch off in every direction , on which an army of <unk> <unk> may be seen , some going forth , and others returning , burdened with pieces of green leaf , often larger than their own bodies .
a small dark-coloured ant sometimes <unk> in countless <name> .
one day , at bahia , my attention was drawn by observing many spiders , <unk> , and other insects , and some lizards , rushing in the greatest agitation across a bare piece of ground .
a little way behind , every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant .
the swarm having crossed the bare space , divided itself , and descended an old wall .
by this means many insects were fairly enclosed ; and the efforts which the poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death were wonderful .
when the ants came to the road they changed their course , and in narrow files <unk> the wall .
having placed a small stone so as to intercept one of the lines , the whole body attacked it , and then immediately retired .
shortly afterwards another body came to the charge , and again having failed to make any impression , this line of march was entirely given up .
by going an inch round , the file might have avoided the stone , and this doubtless would have happened , if it had been originally there : but having been attacked , the <unk> little warriors scorned the idea of yielding .
certain <unk> insects , which construct in the corners of the verandahs <name> cells for their larvae , are very numerous in the neighbourhood of rio .
these cells they stuff full of <unk> spiders and caterpillars , which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive , until their eggs are hatched ; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless , <unk> victims  a sight which has been described by an enthusiastic naturalist as curious and pleasing !

i was much interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a <unk> and a large spider of the genus <unk> .
the wasp made a sudden dash at its prey , and then flew away : the spider was evidently wounded , for , trying to escape , it rolled down a little slope , but had still strength sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass .
the wasp soon returned , and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim .
it then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox ; making short semicircular casts , and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings and antennae .
the spider , though well concealed , was soon discovered , and the wasp , evidently still afraid of its <unk> jaws , after much manoeuvring , inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax .
at last , carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless spider , it proceeded to drag away the body .
but i stopped both tyrant and prey .
( <unk> .
<name> <name> azara volume 1 <name> 175 , mentioning a hymenopterous insect , probably of the same genus , says he saw it dragging a dead spider through tall grass , in a straight line to its nest , which was one hundred and sixty-three paces distant .
he adds that the wasp , in order to find the road , every now and then made " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . " )
the number of spiders , in proportion to other insects , is here compared with england very much larger ; perhaps more so than with any other division of the articulate animals .
the variety of species among the jumping spiders appears almost infinite .
the genus , or rather family of epeira , is here characterized by many singular forms ; some species have pointed <unk> shells , others enlarged and <unk> <unk> .
every path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a species , belonging to the same division with the epeira <unk> of fabricius , which was formerly said by <unk> to make , in the west indies , webs so strong as to catch birds .
a small and pretty kind of spider , with very long fore-legs , and which appears to belong to an <unk> genus , lives as a parasite on almost every one of these webs .
i suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great epeira , and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects , which , adhering to the lines , would otherwise be wasted .
when frightened , this little spider either <unk> death by extending its front legs , or suddenly drops from the web .
a large epeira of the same division with epeira <unk> and <unk> is extremely common , especially in dry situations .
its web , which is generally placed among the great leaves of the common <unk> , is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a pair or even four zigzag ribbons , which connect two adjoining rays .
when any large insect , as a grasshopper or wasp , is caught , the spider , by a dexterous movement , makes it revolve very rapidly , and at the same time emitting a band of threads from its <unk> , soon <unk> its prey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm .
the spider now examines the powerless victim , and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of its thorax ; then retreating , patiently waits till the poison has taken effect .
the <unk> of this poison may be judged of from the fact that in half a minute i opened the <unk> , and found a large wasp quite lifeless .
this epeira always stands with its head downwards near the centre of the web .
when disturbed , it acts differently according to circumstances : if there is a thicket below , it suddenly falls down ; and i have distinctly seen the thread from the <unk> lengthened by the animal while yet stationary , as preparatory to its fall .
if the ground is clear beneath , the epeira seldom falls , but moves quickly through a central passage from one to the other side .
when still further disturbed , it <unk> a most curious manoeuvre : standing in the middle , it violently jerks the web , which is attached to elastic twigs , till at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement , that even the outline of the spider 's body becomes indistinct .
it is well known that most of the british spiders , when a large insect is caught in their webs , endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their prey , to save their nets from being entirely spoiled .
i once , however , saw in a hot-house in shropshire a large female wasp caught in the irregular web of a quite small spider ; and this spider , instead of cutting the web , most perseveringly continued to <unk> the body , and especially the wings , of its prey .
the wasp at first aimed in vain repeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist .
pitying the wasp , after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour , i killed it and put it back into the web .
the spider soon returned ; and an hour afterwards i was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the orifice through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp .
i drove the spider away two or three times , but for the next twenty-four hours i always found it again sucking at the same place .
the spider became much distended by the <unk> of its prey , which was many times larger than itself .
i may here just mention , that i found , near st. fé bajada , many large black spiders , with <unk> marks on their backs , having gregarious habits .
the webs were placed vertically , as is invariably the case with the genus epeira : they were separated from each other by a space of about two feet , but were all attached to certain common lines , which were of great length , and extended to all parts of the community .
in this manner the tops of some large bushes were encompassed by the united nets .
azara has described a gregarious spider in paraguay , which <unk> thinks must be a theridion , but probably it is an epeira , and perhaps even the same species with mine .
( <unk> .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 213 . )
i can not , however , recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat , in which , during autumn , when the spiders die , azara says the eggs are deposited .
as all the spiders which i saw were of the same size , they must have been nearly of the same age .
this gregarious habit , in so typical a genus as epeira , among insects , which are so bloodthirsty and solitary that even the two sexes attack each other , is a very singular fact .
in a lofty valley of the cordillera , near mendoza , i found another spider with a <unk> web .
strong lines <unk> in a vertical plane from a common centre , where the insect had its station ; but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical <unk> ; so that the net , instead of being , as is generally the case , circular , consisted of a <unk> segment .
all the webs were similarly constructed .

july 5 , 1832 .
in the morning we got under way , and stood out of the splendid harbour of rio de janeiro .
in our passage to the plata , we saw nothing particular , excepting on one day a great shoal of porpoises , many hundreds in number .
the whole sea was in places furrowed by them ; and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented , as hundreds , proceeding together by jumps , in which their whole bodies were exposed , thus cut the water .
when the ship was running nine knots an hour , these animals could cross and <unk> the bows with the greatest ease , and then dash away right ahead .
as soon as we entered the estuary of the plata , the weather was very unsettled .
one dark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and <unk> , which made such strange noises , that the officer on watch reported he could hear the cattle bellowing on shore .
on a second night we witnessed a splendid scene of natural fireworks ; the <unk> and <unk> shone with st. <name> 's light ; and the form of the vane could almost be traced , as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus .
the sea was so highly luminous , that the tracks of the <unk> were marked by a fiery wake , and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the most vivid lightning .
when within the mouth of the river , i was interested by observing how slowly the waters of the sea and river mixed .
the latter , muddy and discoloured , from its less specific gravity , floated on the surface of the salt water .
this was curiously exhibited in the wake of the vessel , where a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies with the adjoining fluid .
july 26 , 1832 .
we anchored at <name> video .
the " beagle " was employed in surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of <name> , south of the plata , during the two succeeding years .
to prevent useless repetitions , i <name> extract those parts of my journal which refer to the same districts , without always attending to the order in which we visited them .
maldonado is situated on the northern bank of the plata , and not very far from the mouth of the estuary .
it is a most quiet , forlorn , little town ; built , as is universally the case in these countries , with the streets running at right angles to each other , and having in the middle a large plaza or square , which , from its size , renders the <unk> of the population more evident .
it possesses scarcely any trade ; the <unk> being confined to a few hides and living cattle .
the inhabitants are chiefly <unk> , together with a few shopkeepers and the necessary tradesmen , such as <unk> and carpenters , who do nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round .
the town is separated from the river by a band of <unk> , about a mile broad : it is surrounded on all other sides by an open <unk> country , covered by one uniform layer of fine green turf , on which countless herds of cattle , sheep , and horses graze .
there is very little land cultivated even close to the town .
a few hedges made of <unk> and <unk> <name> out where some wheat or indian corn has been planted .
the features of the country are very similar along the whole northern bank of the plata .
the only difference is , that here the granitic hills are a little bolder .
the scenery is very uninteresting ; there is scarcely a house , an enclosed piece of ground , or even a tree , to give it an air of cheerfulness .
yet , after being imprisoned for some time in a ship , there is a charm in the <unk> feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf .
moreover , if your view is limited to a small space , many objects possess beauty .
some of the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured ; and the bright green <unk> , <unk> short by the cattle , is ornamented by dwarf flowers , among which a plant , looking like the <name> , claimed the place of an old friend .
what would a <unk> say to whole tracts , so thickly covered by the <unk> <unk> , as , even at a distance , to appear of the most gaudy <name> ?
i stayed ten weeks at maldonado , in which time a nearly perfect collection of the animals , birds , and reptiles , was procured .
before making any observations respecting them , i <name> give an account of a little excursion i made as far as the river <unk> , which is about seventy miles distant , in a northerly direction .
i may mention , as a proof how cheap everything is in this country , that i paid only two dollars a day or eight shillings , for two men , together with a troop of about a dozen <unk> .
my companions were well armed with pistols and sabres ; a precaution which i thought rather unnecessary ; but the first piece of news we heard was , that , the day before , a traveller from <name> video had been found dead on the road , with his throat cut .
this happened close to a cross , the record of a former murder .
on the first night we slept at a retired little <unk> ; and there i soon found out that i possessed two or three articles , especially a pocket compass , which created unbounded astonishment .
in every house i was asked to show the compass , and by its aid , together with a map , to point out the direction of various places .
it excited the liveliest admiration that i , a perfect stranger , should know the road ( for direction and road are synonymous in this open country ) to places where i had never been .
at one house a young woman who was ill in bed , sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass .
if their surprise was great , mine was greater , to find such ignorance among people who possessed their thousands of cattle , and " <unk> " of great extent .
it can only be accounted for by the circumstance that this retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners .
i was asked whether the earth or sun moved ; whether it was hotter or colder to the north ; where spain was , and many other such questions .
the greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that england , london , and north <name> , were different names for the same place ; but the better informed well knew that london and north <name> were separate countries close together , and that england was a large town in london !
i carried with me some <unk> matches , which i ignited by biting ; it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike fire with his teeth , that it was usual to collect the whole family to see it : i was once offered a dollar for a single one .
washing my face in the morning caused much speculation at the village of las <unk> ; a superior <unk> closely <unk> me about so singular a practice ; and likewise why on board we wore our beards ; for he had heard from my guide that we did so .
he eyed me with much suspicion ; perhaps he had heard of <unk> in the <unk> religion , and knowing me to be a heretic , probably he came to the conclusion that all <unk> were turks .
it is the general custom in this country to ask for a night 's lodging at the first convenient house .
the astonishment at the compass , and my other feats of <unk> , was to a certain degree advantageous , as with that , and the long stories my guides told of my breaking stones , knowing venomous from harmless snakes , collecting insects , etc. , i repaid them for their hospitality .
i am writing as if i had been among the inhabitants of central africa : banda oriental would not be flattered by the comparison ; but such were my feelings at the time .
the next day we rode to the village of las <unk> .
the country was rather more hilly , but otherwise continued the same ; an inhabitant of the pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly alpine .
the country is so thinly inhabited , that during the whole day we scarcely met a single person .
las <unk> is much smaller even than maldonado .
it is seated on a little plain , and is surrounded by low <name> mountains .
it is of the usual symmetrical form , and with its whitewashed church standing in the centre , had rather a pretty appearance .
the <unk> houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings , without the accompaniment of gardens or <unk> .
this is generally the case in the country , and all the houses have , in consequence , an uncomfortable aspect .
at night we stopped at a <unk> , or <unk> .
during the evening a great number of gauchos came in to drink spirits and smoke cigars : their appearance is very striking ; they are generally tall and handsome , but with a proud and dissolute expression of countenance .
they frequently wear their moustaches , and long black hair curling down their backs .
with their brightly coloured garments , great spurs clanking about their heels , and knives stuck as daggers ( and often so used ) at their waists , they look a very different race of men from what might be expected from their name of gauchos , or simple countrymen .
their politeness is excessive ; they never drink their spirits without expecting you to taste it ; but whilst making their exceedingly graceful bow , they seem quite as ready , if occasion offered , to cut your throat .
on the third day we pursued rather an irregular course , as i was employed in examining some beds of marble .
on the fine plains of turf we saw many ostriches ( <unk> <name> ) .
some of the flocks contained as many as twenty or thirty birds .
these , when standing on any little eminence , and seen against the clear sky , presented a very <name> appearance .
i never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of the country : it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them ; but then , expanding their wings , they made all sail right before the wind , and soon left the horse astern .
at night we came to the house of <name> <name> <unk> , a <name> landed proprietor , but not personally known to either of my companions .
on approaching the house of a stranger , it is usual to follow several little points of etiquette : riding up slowly to the door , the salutation of <unk> <name> is given , and until somebody comes out and asks you to alight , it is not customary even to get off your horse : the formal answer of the owner is , " sin <unk> <unk> "  that is , conceived without sin .
having entered the house , some general conversation is kept up for a few minutes , till permission is asked to pass the night there .
this is granted as a matter of course .
the stranger then takes his meals with the family , and a room is assigned him , where with the <unk> belonging to his <unk> ( or saddle of the pampas ) he makes his bed .
it is curious how similar circumstances produce such similar results in manners .
at the cape of good <name> the same hospitality , and very nearly the same points of etiquette , are universally observed .
the difference , however , between the character of the spaniard and that of the dutch <unk> is shown , by the former never asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of politeness , whilst the honest dutchman demands where he has been , where he is going , what is his business , and even how many brothers , sisters , or children he may happen to have .
shortly after our arrival at <name> <name> 's one of the largest herds of cattle was driven in towards the house , and three beasts were picked out to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment .
these half-wild cattle are very active ; and knowing full well the fatal lazo , they led the horses a long and laborious <name> .
after witnessing the rude wealth displayed in the number of cattle , men , and horses , <name> <name> 's miserable house was quite curious .
the floor consisted of hardened mud , and the windows were without glass ; the sitting-room boasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools , with a couple of tables .
the supper , although several strangers were present , consisted of two huge piles , one of roast beef , the other of boiled , with some pieces of pumpkin : besides this latter there was no other vegetable , and not even a morsel of bread .
for drinking , a large earthenware jug of water served the whole party .
yet this man was the owner of several square miles of land , of which nearly every acre would produce corn , and , with a little trouble , all the common vegetables .
the evening was spent in smoking , with a little impromptu singing , accompanied by the guitar .
the <unk> all sat together in one corner of the room , and did not sup with the men .
( plate 16 .
<unk> or <unk> of gaucho . )
so many works have been written about these countries , that it is almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas .
the lazo consists of a very strong , but thin , <unk> rope , made of raw hide .
one end is attached to the broad <unk> , which <unk> together the complicated gear of the <unk> , or saddle used in the pampas ; the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass , by which a noose can be formed .
the gaucho , when he is going to use the lazo , keeps a small coil in his <unk> , and in the other holds the running noose , which is made very large , generally having a diameter of about eight feet .
this he whirls round his head , and by the dexterous movement of his wrist keeps the noose open ; then , throwing it , he causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses .
the lazo , when not used , is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the <unk> .
the bolas , or balls , are of two kinds : the simplest , which is chiefly used for catching ostriches , consists of two round stones , covered with leather , and united by a thin plaited thong , about eight feet long .
( see chapter 11 . )
the other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a common centre .
the gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand , and whirls the other two round and round his head ; then , taking aim , sends them like chain shot revolving through the air .
the balls no sooner strike any object , than , winding round it , they cross each other , and become firmly hitched .
the size and weight of the balls varies , according to the purpose for which they are made : when of stone , although not larger than an apple , they are sent with such force as sometimes to break the leg even of a horse .
i have seen the balls made of wood , and as large as a turnip , for the sake of catching these animals without injuring them .
the balls are sometimes made of iron , and these can be hurled to the greatest distance .
the main difficulty in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full speed , and while suddenly turning about , to whirl them so steadily round the head , as to take aim : on foot any person would soon learn the <name> .
one day , as i was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head , by accident the free one struck a bush , and its revolving motion being thus destroyed , it immediately fell to the ground , and , like magic caught one hind leg of my horse ; the other ball was then jerked out of my hand , and the horse fairly secured .
luckily he was an old practised animal , and knew what it meant ; otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself down .
the gauchos roared with laughter ; they cried out that they had seen every sort of animal caught , but had never before seen a man caught by himself .
during the two succeeding days , i reached the farthest point which i was anxious to examine .
the country wore the same aspect , till at last the fine green turf became more wearisome than a <name> turnpike road .
we everywhere saw great <name> of partridges ( <unk> <name> ) .
these birds do not go in <unk> , nor do they conceal themselves like the english kind .
it appears a very silly bird .
a man on horseback by riding round and round in a circle , or rather in a spire , so as to approach closer each time , may knock on the head as many as he pleases .
the more common method is to catch them with a running noose , or little lazo , made of the stem of an ostrich 's feather , fastened to the end of a long stick .
a boy on a quiet old horse <name> frequently thus catch thirty or forty in a day .
in arctic north <name> the indians catch the varying hare by walking spirally round and round it , when on its form : the middle of the day is reckoned the best time , when the sun is high , and the shadow of the <name> not very long .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " journey " <name> 383 . )
on our return to maldonado , we followed rather a different line of road .
near pan de <unk> , a landmark well known to all those who have sailed up the plata , i stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable old spaniard .
early in the morning we ascended the <name> de las <unk> .
by the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost picturesque .
to the westward the view extended over an immense level plain as far as the mount , at <name> video , and to the eastward , over the <unk> country of maldonado .
on the summit of the mountain there were several small heaps of stones , which evidently had lain there for many years .
my companion assured me that they were the work of the indians in the old time .
the heaps were similar , but on a much smaller scale , to those so commonly found on the mountains of wales .
the <name> to <unk> any event , on the highest point of the neighbouring land , seems a universal passion with mankind .
at the present day , not a single indian , either civilised or wild , exists in this part of the province ; nor am i aware that the former inhabitants have left behind them any more permanent records than these insignificant piles on the summit of the <name> de las <unk> .
the general , and almost entire absence of trees in banda oriental is remarkable .
some of the <name> hills are partly covered by thickets , and on the banks of the larger streams , especially to the north of las <unk> , <unk> are not uncommon .
near the <unk> <unk> i heard of a wood of palms ; and one of these trees , of considerable size , i saw near the pan de <unk> , in latitude 35 degrees .
these , and the trees planted by the spaniards , offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of wood .
among the introduced kinds may be enumerated <unk> , olives , peach , and other fruit trees : the peaches succeed so well , that they afford the main supply of firewood to the city of buenos ayres .
extremely level countries , such as the pampas , seldom appear favourable to the growth of trees .
this may possibly be attributed either to the force of the winds , or the kind of drainage .
in the nature of the land , however , around maldonado , no such reason is apparent ; the <name> mountains afford protected situations ; enjoying various kinds of soil ; <unk> of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley ; and the <unk> nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture .
it has been inferred , with much probability , that the presence of woodland is generally determined by the annual amount of moisture ( <unk> .
<unk> , article " <name> " " encyclopedia <unk> .
" ) ; yet in this province abundant and heavy rain falls during the <name> ; and the summer , though dry , is not so in any excessive degree .
( <unk> .
azara says " je <unk> que la <unk> <unk> des <unk> est , dans toutes ces <unk> , plus <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
 volume 1 <name> 36 . )
we see nearly the whole of australia covered by lofty trees , yet that country possesses a far more arid climate .
hence we must look to some other and unknown cause .
confining our view to south <name> , we should certainly be tempted to believe that trees flourished only under a very humid climate ; for the limit of the <unk> follows , in a most remarkable manner , that of the damp winds .
in the southern part of the continent , where the western gales , charged with moisture from the pacific , prevail , every island on the broken west coast , from latitude 38 degrees to the extreme point of <name> <name> fuego , is densely covered by impenetrable forests .
on the eastern side of the cordillera , over the same extent of latitude , where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere has been deprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains , the arid plains of patagonia support a most scanty vegetation .
in the more northern parts of the continent , within the limits of the constant south-eastern trade-wind , the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent forests ; whilst the western coast , from latitude 4 degrees south to latitude 32 degrees south , may be described as a desert ; on this western coast , northward of latitude 4 degrees south , where the trade-wind loses its regularity , and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically , the shores of the pacific , so utterly desert in peru , assume near cape blanco the character of luxuriance so celebrated at <unk> and panama .
hence in the southern and northern parts of the continent , the forest and desert lands occupy reversed positions with respect to the cordillera , and these positions are apparently determined by the direction of the prevalent winds .
in the middle of the continent there is a broad intermediate band , including central chile and the provinces of la plata , where the <unk> winds have not to pass over lofty mountains , and where the land is neither a desert nor covered by forests .
but even the rule , if confined to south <name> , of trees flourishing only in a climate rendered humid by <unk> winds , has a strongly marked exception in the case of the falkland islands .
these islands , situated in the same latitude with <name> <name> fuego and only between two and three hundred miles distant from it , having a nearly similar climate , with a geological formation almost identical , with favourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil , yet can boast of few plants deserving even the title of bushes ; whilst in <name> <name> fuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the <unk> forest .
in this case , both the direction of the heavy gales of wind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of seeds from <name> <name> fuego , as is shown by the canoes and trunks of trees drifted from that country , and frequently thrown on the shores of the western falkland .
hence perhaps it is , that there are many plants in common to the two countries : but with respect to the trees of <name> <name> fuego , even attempts made to <unk> them have failed .
during our stay at maldonado i collected several quadrupeds , eighty kinds of birds , and many reptiles , including nine species of snakes .
of the indigenous mammalia , the only one now left of any size , which is common , is the cervus campestris .
this deer is exceedingly abundant , often in small herds , throughout the countries bordering the plata and in northern patagonia .
if a person crawling close along the ground , slowly advances towards a herd , the deer frequently , out of curiosity , approach to reconnoitre him .
i have by this means , killed from one spot , three out of the same herd .
although so tame and inquisitive , yet when approached on horseback , they are exceedingly wary .
in this country nobody goes on foot , and the deer knows man as its enemy only when he is mounted and armed with the bolas .
at bahia <name> , a recent establishment in northern patagonia , i was surprised to find how little the deer cared for the noise of a gun : one day i fired ten times from within eighty yards at one animal ; and it was much more startled at the ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle .
my powder being exhausted , i was obliged to get up ( to my shame as a sportsman be it spoken , though well able to kill birds on the wing ) and halloo till the deer ran away .
the most curious fact with respect to this animal , is the <unk> strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the <name> .
it is quite indescribable : several times whilst skinning the specimen which is now mounted at the zoological museum , i was almost overcome by nausea .
i tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief , and so carried it home : this handkerchief , after being well washed , i continually used , and it was of course as repeatedly washed ; yet every time , for a space of one year and seven months , when first unfolded , i distinctly perceived the odour .
this appears an astonishing instance of the permanence of some matter , which nevertheless in its nature must be most <unk> and volatile .
frequently , when passing at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a herd , i have perceived the whole air tainted with the <unk> .
i believe the smell from the <name> is most powerful at the period when its horns are perfect , or free from the hairy skin .
when in this state the meat is , of course , quite <unk> ; but the gauchos assert , that if buried for some time in fresh earth , the taint is removed .
i have somewhere read that the islanders in the north of scotland treat the rank carcasses of the <unk> birds in the same manner .
the order <unk> is here very numerous in species : of mice alone i obtained no less than eight kinds .
( 3/4 .
in south <name> i collected altogether twenty-seven species of mice , and thirteen more are known from the works of azara and other authors .
those collected by myself have been named and described by mr. waterhouse at the meetings of the zoological society .
i must be allowed to take this opportunity of returning my cordial thanks to mr. waterhouse , and to the other gentleman attached to that society , for their kind and most liberal assistance on all occasions . )
the largest gnawing animal in the world , the <unk> capybara ( the <unk> ) , is here also common .
one which i shot at <name> video weighed <unk> pounds : its length , from the end of the snout to the <unk> tail , was three feet two inches ; and its girth three feet eight .
these great rodents occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the plata , where the water is quite salt , but are far more abundant on the borders of fresh-water lakes and rivers .
near maldonado three or four generally live together .
in the daytime they either lie among the aquatic plants , or openly feed on the turf plain .
( <unk> .
in the stomach and <unk> of a capybara which i opened , i found a very large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid , in which scarcely a fibre could be distinguished .
mr. <name> informs me that a part of the oesophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a <unk> can be passed down .
certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this animal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which it feeds . )
when viewed at a distance , from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs : but when seated on their haunches , and attentively watching any object with one eye , they <unk> the appearance of their <unk> , <unk> and rabbits .
both the front and side view of their head has quite a ludicrous aspect , from the great depth of their jaw .
these animals , at maldonado , were very tame ; by cautiously walking , i approached within three yards of four old ones .
this tameness may probably be accounted for , by the jaguar having been banished for some years , and by the gaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them .
as i approached nearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise , which is a low abrupt grunt , not having much actual sound , but rather arising from the sudden expulsion of air : the only noise i know at all like it , is the first hoarse bark of a large dog .
having watched the four from almost within arm 's length ( and they me ) for several minutes , they rushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity , and emitted at the same time their bark .
after diving a short distance they came again to the surface , but only just showed the upper part of their heads .
when the female is swimming in the water , and has young ones , they are said to sit on her back .
these animals are easily killed in <name> ; but their skins are of trifling value , and the meat is very indifferent .
on the islands in the rio parana they are exceedingly abundant , and afford the ordinary prey to the jaguar .
the <unk> ( ctenomys <unk> ) is a curious small animal , which may be briefly described as a <unk> , with the habits of a mole .
it is extremely numerous in some parts of the country , but it is difficult to be procured , and never , i believe , comes out of the ground .
it throws up at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the mole , but smaller .
considerable tracts of country are so completely undermined by these animals that horses , in passing over , sink above their <unk> .
the <unk> appear , to a certain degree , to be gregarious : the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six together , and he said this was a common occurrence .
they are nocturnal in their habits ; and their principal food is the roots of plants , which are the object of their extensive and superficial burrows .
this animal is universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when beneath the ground .
a person , the first time he hears it , is much surprised ; for it is not easy to tell whence it comes , nor is it possible to guess what kind of creature utters it .
the noise consists in a short , but not rough , nasal grunt , which is monotonously repeated about four times in quick succession ( <unk> .
at the r. negro , in northern patagonia , there is an animal of the same habits , and probably a closely allied species , but which i never saw .
its noise is different from that of the maldonado kind ; it is repeated only twice instead of three or four times , and is more distinct and sonorous : when heard from a distance it so closely resembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe , that i have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it .
) : the name <unk> is given in imitation of the sound .
where this animal is abundant , it may be heard at all times of the day , and sometimes directly beneath one 's feet .
when kept in a room , the <unk> move both slowly and clumsily , which appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs ; and they are quite incapable , from the socket of the <unk> not having a certain <unk> , of jumping even the smallest vertical height .
they are very stupid in making any attempt to escape ; when angry or frightened they utter the <unk> .
of those i kept alive , several , even the first day , became quite tame , not attempting to bite or to run away ; others were a little wilder .
the man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found blind .
a specimen which i preserved in spirits was in this state ; mr. <name> considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating membrane .
when the animal was alive i placed my finger within half an inch of its head , and not the slightest notice was taken : it made its way , however , about the room nearly as well as the others .
considering the strictly subterranean habits of the <unk> , the blindness , though so common , can not be a very serious evil ; yet it appears strange that any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured .
lamarck would have been delighted with this fact , had he known it , when speculating ( probably with more truth than usual with him ) on the <unk> blindness of the <unk> , a <unk> living under ground , and of the proteus , a reptile living in dark caverns filled with water ; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost rudimentary state , and is covered by a <unk> membrane and skin .
( <unk> .
" <unk> .
zoolog . "
tome 1 <name> 242 . )
in the common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect , though many anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic nerve ; its vision must certainly be imperfect , though probably useful to the animal when it leaves its burrow .
in the <unk> , which i believe never comes to the surface of the ground , the eye is rather larger , but often rendered blind and useless , though without apparently causing any inconvenience to the animal ; no doubt lamarck would have said that the <unk> is now passing into the state of the <unk> and proteus .
birds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy plains around maldonado .
there are several species of a family allied in structure and manners to our starling : one of these ( molothrus niger ) is remarkable from its habits .
several may often be seen standing together on the back of a cow or horse ; and while perched on a hedge , <unk> themselves in the sun , they sometimes attempt to sing , or rather to hiss ; the noise being very peculiar , resembling that of bubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water , so as to produce an acute sound .
according to azara , this bird , like the cuckoo , deposits its eggs in other birds ' nests .
i was several times told by the country people that there certainly is some bird having this habit ; and my assistant in collecting , who is a very accurate person , found a nest of the sparrow of this country ( <unk> <unk> ) , with one egg in it larger than the others , and of a different colour and shape .
in north <name> there is another species of molothrus ( m. <unk> ) , which has a similar <unk> habit , and which is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the plata , even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of cattle ; it differs only in being a little smaller , and in its plumage and eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour .
this close agreement in structure and habits , in representative species coming from opposite quarters of a great continent , always strikes one as interesting , though of common occurrence .
mr. <unk> has well remarked , that with the exception of the molothrus <unk> , to which must be added the m. niger , the <unk> are the only birds which can be called truly <unk> ; namely , such as " fasten themselves , as it were , on another living animal , whose animal heat brings their young into life , whose food they live upon , and whose death would cause theirs during the period of infancy . "
( 3/8 .
" magazine of zoology and botany " volume 1 <name> 217 . )
it is remarkable that some of the species , but not all , both of the cuckoo and molothrus should agree in this one strange habit of their <unk> propagation , whilst opposed to each other in almost every other habit : the molothrus , like our starling , is eminently sociable , and lives on the open plains without <name> or disguise : the cuckoo , as every one knows , is a singularly shy bird ; it <unk> the most retired thickets , and feeds on fruit and caterpillars .
in structure also these two genera are widely removed from each other .
many theories , even <unk> theories , have been advanced to explain the origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds ' nests .
m. <unk> alone , i think , has thrown light by his observations on this puzzle : he finds that the female cuckoo , which , according to most observers , lays at least from four to six eggs , must pair with the male each time after laying only one or two eggs .
( <unk> .
read before the academy of sciences in <name> .
<unk> 1834 <name> 418 . )
now , if the cuckoo was obliged to sit on her own eggs , she would either have to sit on all together , and therefore leave those first laid so long , that they probably would become <unk> ; or she would have to hatch separately each egg or two eggs , as soon as laid : but as the cuckoo stays a shorter time in this country than any other migratory bird , she certainly would not have time enough for the successive <unk> .
hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times , and laying her eggs at intervals , the cause of her depositing her eggs in other birds ' nests , and leaving them to the care of <unk> .
i am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct , from having been independently led ( as we shall hereafter see ) to an analogous conclusion with regard to the south american ostrich , the females of which are <unk> , if i may so express it , on each other ; each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other females , and the male ostrich undertaking all the cares of incubation , like the strange <unk> with the cuckoo .
i <name> mention only two other birds , which are very common , and render themselves prominent from their habits .
the <unk> <unk> is typical of the great american tribe of <unk> .
in its structure it closely approaches the true <unk> , but in its habits may be compared to many birds .
i have frequently observed it , hunting a field , hovering over one spot like a hawk , and then proceeding on to another .
when seen thus suspended in the air , it might very readily at a short distance be mistaken for one of the <unk> order ; its stoop , however , is very inferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk .
at other times the <unk> haunts the neighbourhood of water , and there , like a kingfisher , remaining stationary , it catches any small fish which may come near the margin .
these birds are not unfrequently kept either in cages or in <unk> , with their wings cut .
they soon become tame , and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners , which were described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie .
their flight is undulatory , for the weight of the head and <name> appears too great for the body .
in the evening the <unk> takes its stand on a bush , often by the roadside , and continually repeats without change a shrill and rather agreeable cry , which somewhat resembles articulate words : the spaniards say it is like the words " bien te <unk> " ( i see you well ) , and accordingly have given it this name .
a <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , called by the inhabitants <unk> , is remarkable , from possessing a song far superior to that of any other bird in the country : indeed , it is nearly the only bird in south <name> which i have observed to take its stand for the purpose of singing .
the song may be compared to that of the <unk> <unk> , but is more powerful ; some harsh notes and some very high ones , being mingled with a pleasant <unk> .
it is heard only during the spring .
at other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious .
near maldonado these birds were tame and bold ; they constantly attended the country houses in <name> , to pick the meat which was <name> up on the posts or walls : if any other small bird joined the feast , the <unk> soon chased it away .
on the wide uninhabited plains of patagonia another closely allied species , o. patagonica of d'orbigny , which <unk> the valleys clothed with <unk> bushes , is a wilder bird , and has a slightly different tone of voice .
it appears to me a curious circumstance , as showing the fine shades of difference in habits , that judging from this latter respect alone , when i first saw this second species , i thought it was different from the maldonado kind .
having afterwards procured a specimen , and comparing the two without particular care , they appeared so very similar , that i changed my opinion ; but now mr. gould says that they are certainly distinct ; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit , of which , however , he was not aware .
the number , tameness , and disgusting habits of the <unk> hawks of south <name> make them <unk> striking to any one accustomed only to the birds of northern europe .
in this list may be included four species of the <unk> or <unk> , the turkey buzzard , the <unk> , and the condor .
the <unk> are , from their structure , placed among the eagles : we shall soon see how ill they become so high a rank .
in their habits they well supply the place of our <unk> , magpies , and ravens ; a tribe of birds widely distributed over the rest of the world , but entirely absent in south <name> .
to begin with the <unk> <unk> : this is a common bird , and has a wide geographical range ; it is most numerous on the grassy <unk> of la plata ( where it goes by the name of <unk> ) , and is far from <unk> throughout the sterile plains of patagonia .
in the desert between the rivers negro and colorado , <name> constantly attend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted animals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst .
although thus common in these dry and open countries , and likewise on the arid shores of the pacific , it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious forests of west patagonia and <name> <name> fuego .
the <unk> , together with the <unk> , constantly attend in <name> the <unk> and <unk> .
if an animal dies on the plain the <unk> commences the feast , and then the two species of <unk> pick the bones clean .
these birds , although thus commonly feeding together , are far from being friends .
when the <unk> is quietly seated on the branch of a tree or on the ground , the <unk> often continues for a long time flying backwards and forwards , up and down , in a semicircle , trying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger relative .
the <unk> takes little notice , except by bobbing its head .
although the <unk> frequently assemble in <name> , they are not gregarious ; for in desert places they may be seen solitary , or more commonly by pairs .
the <unk> are said to be very crafty , and to steal great <name> of eggs .
they attempt , also , together with the <unk> , to pick off the <unk> from the sore backs of horses and mules .
the poor animal , on the one hand , with its ears down and its back arched ; and , on the other , the hovering bird , eyeing at the distance of a yard the disgusting morsel , form a picture , which has been described by captain head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy .
these false eagles most rarely kill any living bird or animal ; and their <unk> , <unk> habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep on the desolate plains of patagonia , for when he wakes , he <name> see , on each surrounding hillock , one of these birds patiently watching him with an evil eye : it is a feature in the landscape of these countries , which <name> be recognised by every one who has wandered over them .
if a party of men go out hunting with dogs and horses , they <name> be accompanied , during the day , by several of these attendants .
after feeding , the uncovered <unk> <unk> ; at such times , and indeed generally , the <unk> is an inactive , tame , and cowardly bird .
its flight is heavy and slow , like that of an english <unk> .
it seldom <unk> ; but i have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the air with much ease .
it runs ( in <unk> to hopping ) , but not quite so quickly as some of its <unk> .
at times the <unk> is noisy , but is not generally so : its cry is loud , very harsh and peculiar , and may be likened to the sound of the spanish guttural g , followed by a rough double r r ; when uttering this cry it <unk> its head higher and higher , till at last , with its beak wide open , the crown almost touches the lower part of the back .
this fact , which has been doubted , is quite true ; i have seen them several times with their heads backwards in a completely inverted position .
to these observations i may add , on the high authority of azara , that the <unk> feeds on worms , shells , slugs , grasshoppers , and frogs ; that it destroys young lambs by tearing the <unk> cord ; and that it pursues the <unk> , till that bird is compelled to <unk> up the carrion it may have recently gorged .
lastly , azara states that several <unk> , five or six together , <name> unite in <name> of large birds , even such as herons .
all these facts show that it is a bird of very versatile habits and considerable ingenuity .
the <unk> <unk> is considerably smaller than the last species .
it is truly <unk> , and <name> eat even bread ; and i was assured that it materially <unk> the <unk> in chiloe , by stocking up the roots when first planted .
of all the <unk> it is generally the last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal , and may often be seen within the ribs of a cow or horse , like a bird in a cage .
another species is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is exceedingly common in the falkland islands .
these birds in many respects resemble in their habits the <unk> .
they live on the flesh of dead animals and on <name> productions ; and on the <unk> rocks their whole sustenance must depend on the sea .
they are extraordinarily tame and fearless , and haunt the neighbourhood of houses for offal .
if a hunting party kills an animal , a number soon collect and patiently await , standing on the ground on all sides .
after eating , their uncovered <unk> are largely protruded , giving them a disgusting appearance .
they readily attack wounded birds : a <unk> in this state having taken to the shore , was immediately seized on by several , and its death hastened by their blows .
the " beagle " was at the falklands only during the summer , but the officers of the " adventure , " who were there in the <name> , mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and <unk> of these birds .
they actually pounced on a dog that was lying fast asleep close by one of the party ; and the sportsmen had difficulty in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes .
it is said that several together ( in this respect resembling the <unk> ) wait at the mouth of a <unk> , and together seize on the animal when it comes out .
they were constantly flying on board the vessel when in the harbour ; and it was necessary to keep a good look-out to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging , and the meat or game from the stern .
these birds are very mischievous and inquisitive ; they <name> pick up almost anything from the ground ; a large black glazed hat was carried nearly a mile , as was a pair of the heavy balls used in catching cattle .
mr. <unk> experienced during the survey a more severe loss , in their stealing a small <unk> 's compass in a red morocco leather case , which was never recovered .
these birds are , moreover , quarrelsome and very passionate ; tearing up the grass with their bills from rage .
they are not truly gregarious ; they do not soar , and their flight is heavy and clumsy ; on the ground they run extremely fast , very much like pheasants .
they are noisy , uttering several harsh cries , one of which is like that of the english <unk> , hence the sealers always call them <unk> .
it is a curious circumstance that , when crying out , they throw their heads upwards and backwards , after the same manner as the <unk> .
they build in the <name> cliffs of the sea-coast , but only on the small adjoining islets , and not on the two main islands : this is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird .
the sealers say that the flesh of these birds , when cooked , is quite white , and very good eating ; but bold must the man be who attempts such a meal .
we have now only to mention the <unk> ( <unk> <name> ) , and the <unk> .
the former is found wherever the country is moderately damp , from cape horn to north <name> .
differently from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it has found its way to the falkland islands .
the <unk> is a solitary bird , or at most goes in pairs .
it may at once be recognised from a long distance , by its lofty , soaring , and most elegant flight .
it is well known to be a true <unk> .
on the west coast of patagonia , among the <unk> islets and broken land , it lives exclusively on what the sea throws up , and on the carcasses of dead seals .
wherever these animals are congregated on the rocks , there the vultures may be seen .
the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) has a different range from the last species , as it never occurs southward of latitude 41 degrees .
azara states that there exists a tradition that these birds , at the time of the conquest , were not found near <name> video , but that they subsequently followed the inhabitants from more northern districts .
at the present day they are numerous in the valley of the colorado , which is three hundred miles due south of <name> video .
it seems probable that this additional migration has happened since the time of azara .
the <unk> generally prefers a humid climate , or rather the neighbourhood of fresh water ; hence it is extremely abundant in brazil and la plata , while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of northern patagonia , excepting near some stream .
these birds frequent the whole pampas to the foot of the cordillera , but i never saw or heard of one in chile : in peru they are preserved as <unk> .
these vultures certainly may be called gregarious , for they seem to have pleasure in society , and are not solely brought together by the attraction of a common prey .
on a fine day a flock may often be observed at a great height , each bird wheeling round and round without closing its wings , in the most graceful evolutions .
this is clearly performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise , or perhaps is connected with their matrimonial alliances .
i have now mentioned all the <unk> , excepting the condor , an account of which <name> be more appropriately introduced when we visit a country more congenial to its habits than the plains of la plata .
in a broad band of <unk> which separate the laguna <name> <unk> from the shores of the plata , at the distance of a few miles from maldonado , i found a group of those <unk> , siliceous tubes , which are formed by lightning entering loose sand .
these tubes resemble in every particular those from <unk> in cumberland , described in the " geological transactions . "
( <unk> .
" geological transactions " volume 2 <name> <unk> .
in the " philosophical transactions " <unk> <name> 294 , dr. <unk> has described some imperfect siliceous tubes and a melted pebble of quartz , found in digging into the ground , under a tree , where a man had been killed by lightning . )
the <unk> of maldonado , not being protected by vegetation , are constantly changing their position .
from this cause the tubes projected above the surface ; and numerous fragments lying near , showed that they had formerly been buried to a greater depth .
four sets entered the sand perpendicularly : by working with my hands i traced one of them two feet deep ; and some fragments which evidently had belonged to the same tube , when added to the other part , measured five feet three inches .
the diameter of the whole tube was nearly equal , and therefore we must suppose that originally it extended to a much greater depth .
these dimensions are however small , compared to those of the tubes from <unk> , one of which was traced to a depth of not less than thirty feet .
the internal surface is completely <unk> , glossy , and smooth .
a small fragment examined under the microscope appeared , from the number of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles , like an <unk> fused before the blowpipe .
the sand is entirely , or in greater part , siliceous ; but some points are of a black colour , and from their glossy surface possess a metallic lustre .
the thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch , and occasionally even equals a tenth .
on the outside the grains of sand are rounded , and have a slightly glazed appearance : i could not distinguish any signs of <unk> .
in a similar manner to that described in the " geological transactions , " the tubes are generally compressed , and have deep longitudinal furrows , so as closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk , or the bark of the elm or cork tree .
their circumference is about two inches , but in some fragments , which are cylindrical and without any furrows , it is as much as four inches .
the compression from the surrounding loose sand , acting while the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat , has evidently caused the creases or furrows .
judging from the <unk> fragments , the measure or bore of the lightning ( if such a term may be used ) must have been about one inch and a quarter .
at <name> , m. <unk> and m. <unk> succeeded in making tubes , in most respects similar to these <unk> , by passing very strong shocks of <unk> through <unk> glass : when salt was added , so as to increase its <unk> , the tubes were larger in every <unk> .
( <unk> .
" annales de chimie et de physique " tome 37 <name> 319 . )
they failed both with powdered feldspar and quartz .
one tube , formed with pounded glass , was very nearly an inch long , namely <unk> , and had an internal diameter of <unk> of an inch .
when we hear that the strongest battery in <name> was used , and that its power on a substance of such easy <unk> as glass was to form tubes so diminutive , we must feel greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning , which , striking the sand in several places , has formed cylinders , in one instance of at least thirty feet long , and having an internal bore , where not compressed , of full an inch and a half ; and this in a material so extraordinarily <unk> as quartz !
the tubes , as i have already remarked , enter the sand nearly in a vertical direction .
one , however , which was less regular than the others , <unk> from a right line , at the most considerable bend , to the amount of thirty-three degrees .
from this same tube , two small branches , about a foot apart , were sent off ; one pointed downwards , and the other upwards .
this latter case is remarkable , as the electric fluid must have turned back at the acute <name> of 26 degrees , to the line of its main course .
besides the four tubes which i found vertical , and traced beneath the surface , there were several other groups of fragments , the original sites of which without doubt were near .
all occurred in a level area of shifting sand , sixty yards by twenty , situated among some high <unk> , and at the distance of about half a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height .
the most remarkable circumstance , as it appears to me , in this case as well as in that of <unk> , and in one described by m. <unk> in germany , is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces .
at <unk> , within an area of fifteen yards , three were observed , and the same number occurred in germany .
in the case which i have described , certainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by twenty yards .
as it does not appear probable that the tubes are produced by successive distinct shocks , we must believe that the lightning , shortly before entering the ground , divides itself into separate branches .
the neighbourhood of the rio plata seems peculiarly subject to electric phenomena .
in the year 1793 , one of the most destructive <unk> perhaps on record happened at buenos ayres : thirty-seven places within the city were struck by lightning , and nineteen people killed .
( <unk> .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 36 . )
from facts stated in several books of travels , i am inclined to suspect that <unk> are very common near the mouths of great rivers .
is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh and salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium ?
even during our occasional visits to this part of south <name> , we heard of a ship , two churches , and a house having been struck .
both the church and the house i saw shortly afterwards : the house belonged to mr .
hood , the <unk> at <name> video .
some of the effects were curious : the paper , for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the <unk> had run , was blackened .
the metal had been fused , and although the room was about fifteen feet high , the globules , dropping on the chairs and furniture , had drilled in them a chain of minute holes .
a part of the wall was shattered as if by gunpowder , and the fragments had been blown off with force sufficient to <unk> the wall on the opposite side of the room .
the frame of a looking-glass was blackened , and the gilding must have been <unk> , for a <unk> , which stood on the <unk> , was coated with bright metallic particles , which adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled .

july 24 , 1833 .
the " beagle " sailed from maldonado , and on <name> the 3rd she arrived off the mouth of the rio negro .
this is the principal river on the whole line of coast between the strait of magellan and the plata .
it enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the estuary of the plata .
about fifty years ago , under the old spanish government , a small colony was established here ; and it is still the most southern position ( latitude 41 degrees ) on this eastern coast of <name> inhabited by civilised man .
the country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme : on the south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences , which exposes a section of the geological nature of the country .
the strata are of sandstone , and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a <unk> conglomerate of pumice pebbles , which must have travelled more than four hundred miles , from the andes .
the surface is everywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel , which extends far and wide over the open plain .
water is extremely scarce , and , where found , is almost invariably brackish .
the vegetation is scanty ; and although there are bushes of many kinds , all are armed with formidable thorns , which seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable regions .
the settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river .
the road follows the foot of the sloping <name> , which forms the northern boundary of the great valley in which the rio negro flows .
on the way we passed the ruins of some fine <unk> , which a few years since had been destroyed by the indians .
they withstood several attacks .
a man present at one gave me a very lively description of what took place .
the inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle and horses into the corral which surrounded the house , and likewise to mount some small cannon .
( <unk> .
the corral is an enclosure made of tall and strong stakes .
every estancia , or farming estate , has one attached to it . )
the indians were <unk> from the south of chile ; several hundreds in number , and highly disciplined .
they first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill ; having there dismounted , and taken off their fur <unk> , they advanced naked to the charge .
the only weapon of an indian is a very long bamboo or <unk> , ornamented with ostrich feathers , and pointed by a sharp <unk> .
my <unk> seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of these <unk> as they approached near .
when close , the <unk> <unk> hailed the besieged to give up their arms , or he would cut all their throats .
as this would probably have been the result of their entrance under any circumstances , the answer was given by a volley of musketry .
the indians , with great steadiness , came to the very fence of the corral : but to their surprise they found the posts fastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs , and , of course , in vain attempted to cut them with their knives .
this saved the lives of the christians : many of the wounded indians were carried away by their companions , and at last , one of the under <unk> being wounded , the bugle sounded a retreat .
they retired to their horses , and seemed to hold a council of war .
this was an awful pause for the spaniards , as all their ammunition , with the exception of a few cartridges , was expended .
in an instant the indians mounted their horses , and galloped out of sight .
another attack was still more quickly repulsed .
a cool frenchman managed the gun ; he stopped till the indians approached close , and then raked their line with <unk> : he thus laid thirty-nine of them on the ground ; and , of course , such a blow immediately routed the whole party .
the town is indifferently called el <name> or <unk> .
it is built on the face of a <name> which fronts the river , and many of the houses are excavated even in the sandstone .
the river is about two or three hundred yards wide , and is deep and rapid .
the many islands , with their <unk> , and the flat headlands , seen one behind the other on the northern boundary of the broad green valley , form , by the aid of a bright sun , a view almost picturesque .
the number of inhabitants does not exceed a few hundreds .
these spanish colonies do not , like our british ones , <name> within themselves the elements of growth .
many indians of pure blood reside here : the tribe of the <unk> <unk> constantly have their <unk> on the outskirts of the town .
( <unk> .
the hovels of the indians are thus called . )
the local government partly supplies them with provisions , by giving them all the old worn-out horses , and they earn a little by making <unk> and other articles of <unk> .
these indians are considered civilised ; but what their character may have gained by a lesser degree of ferocity , is almost counterbalanced by their entire immorality .
some of the younger men are , however , improving ; they are willing to labour , and a short time since a party went on a <unk> , and behaved very well .
they were now enjoying the fruits of their labour , by being dressed in very <name> , clean clothes , and by being very idle .
the taste they showed in their dress was admirable ; if you could have turned one of these young indians into a statue of bronze , his drapery would have been perfectly graceful .
one day i rode to a large <unk> , or <name> , which is distant fifteen miles from the town .
during the <name> it consists of a shallow lake of brine , which in summer is converted into a field of snow-white salt .
the layer near the margin is from four to five inches thick , but towards the centre its thickness increases .
this lake was two and a half miles long , and one broad .
others occur in the neighbourhood many times larger , and with a floor of salt , two and three feet in thickness , even when under water during the <name> .
one of these brilliantly white and level expanses , in the midst of the brown and desolate plain , offers an extraordinary spectacle .
a large quantity of salt is annually drawn from the <name> : and great piles , some hundred tons in weight , were lying ready for <unk> .
the season for working the salinas forms the harvest of <unk> ; for on it the prosperity of the place depends .
nearly the whole population <unk> on the bank of the river , and the people are employed in drawing out the salt in <unk> .
this salt is crystallised in great cubes , and is remarkably pure : mr. <unk> reeks has kindly <unk> some for me , and he finds in it only <unk> of gypsum and <unk> of earthy matter .
it is a singular fact that it does not serve so well for preserving meat as <unk> from the cape de verd islands ; and a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per cent less valuable .
hence the cape de verd salt is constantly imported , and is mixed with that from these salinas .
the purity of the patagonian salt , or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all sea-water , is the only assignable cause for this inferiority : a conclusion which no one , i think , would have suspected , but which is supported by the fact lately ascertained , that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the <unk> chlorides .
( <unk> .
report of the agricultural chemistry association in the " agricultural gazette " 1845 <name> 93 . )
the border of the lake is formed of mud : and in this numerous large crystals of gypsum , some of which are three inches long , lie embedded ; whilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about .
the gauchos call the former the " padre <name> <name> , " and the latter the " <unk> ; " they state that these <unk> salts always occur on the borders of the salinas , when the water begins to <unk> .
the mud is black , and has a fetid odour .
i could not at first imagine the cause of this , but i afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind drifted on shore was coloured green , as if by <unk> ; i attempted to <name> home some of this green matter , but from an accident failed .
parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish colour , and this perhaps was owing to some <unk> <unk> .
the mud in many places was thrown up by <name> of some kind of worm , or <unk> animal .
how surprising it is that any creatures should be able to exist in brine , and that they should be crawling among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime !
and what becomes of these worms when , during the long summer , the surface is hardened into a solid layer of salt ?
<unk> in considerable <name> inhabit this lake , and breed here , throughout patagonia , in northern chile , and at the galapagos islands , i met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine .
i saw them here wading about in search of food  probably for the worms which burrow in the mud ; and these latter probably feed on infusoria or <unk> .
thus we have a little living world within itself , adapted to these inland lakes of brine .
a minute <unk> animal ( cancer <unk> ) is said to live in countless <name> in the <unk> at <unk> : but only in those in which the fluid has attained , from evaporation , considerable strength  namely , about a quarter of a pound of salt to a pint of water .
( <unk> .
" <unk> transactions " volume 11 <name> 205 .
it is remarkable how all the circumstances connected with the <unk> in siberia and patagonia are similar .
siberia , like patagonia , appears to have been recently elevated above the waters of the sea .
in both countries the <unk> occupy shallow depressions in the plains ; in both the mud on the borders is black and fetid ; beneath the crust of common salt , sulphate of soda or of magnesia occurs , imperfectly crystallised ; and in both , the muddy sand is mixed with <unk> of gypsum .
the siberian <unk> are inhabited by small <unk> animals ; and <unk> ( " edinburgh new <unk> journal " <name> 1830 ) likewise frequent them .
as these circumstances , apparently so trifling , occur in two distant continents , we may feel sure that they are the necessary results of common <unk>  see " pallas 's travels " 1793 to 1794 pages 129 to 134 . )
well may we affirm that every part of the world is habitable !
whether lakes of brine , or those subterranean ones hidden beneath volcanic mountains  warm mineral springs  the wide expanse and depths of the ocean  the upper regions of the atmosphere , and even the surface of perpetual snow  all support organic beings .
to the northward of the rio negro , between it and the inhabited country near buenos ayres , the spaniards have only one small settlement , recently established at bahia <name> .
the distance in a straight line to buenos ayres is very nearly five hundred british miles .
the wandering tribes of horse indians , which have always occupied the greater part of this country , having of late much harassed the outlying <unk> , the government at buenos ayres equipped some time since an army under the command of general rosas for the purpose of <unk> them .
the troops were now encamped on the banks of the colorado ; a river lying about eighty miles northward of the rio negro .
when general rosas left buenos ayres he struck in a direct line across the unexplored plains : and as the country was thus pretty well cleared of indians , he left behind him , at wide intervals , a small party of soldiers with a troop of horses ( a posta ) , so as to be enabled to keep up a communication with the capital .
as the " beagle " intended to call at bahia <name> , i determined to proceed there by land ; and ultimately i extended my plan to travel the whole way by the <unk> to buenos ayres .
<name> 11 , 1833 .
mr. <name> , an englishman residing at <unk> , a guide , and five gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business , were my companions on the journey .
the colorado , as i have already said , is nearly eighty miles distant : and as we travelled slowly , we were two days and a half on the road .
the whole line of country deserves scarcely a better name than that of a desert .
water is found only in two small wells ; it is called fresh ; but even at this time of the year , during the rainy season , it was quite brackish .
in the summer this must be a distressing passage ; for now it was sufficiently desolate .
the valley of the rio negro , broad as it is , has merely been excavated out of the sandstone plain ; for immediately above the bank on which the town stands , a level country commences , which is interrupted only by a few trifling valleys and depressions .
everywhere the landscape wears the same sterile aspect ; a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown withered grass , and low scattered bushes , armed with thorns .
shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous tree , which the indians reverence as the altar of <unk> .
it is situated on a high part of the plain ; and hence is a landmark visible at a great distance .
as soon as a tribe of indians come in sight of it , they offer their <unk> by loud shouts .
the tree itself is low , much branched , and thorny : just above the root it has a diameter of about three feet .
it stands by itself without any neighbour , and was indeed the first tree we saw ; afterwards we met with a few others of the same kind , but they were far from common .
being <name> the tree had no leaves , but in their place numberless threads , by which the various offerings , such as cigars , bread , meat , pieces of cloth , etc. , had been suspended .
poor indians , not having anything better , only pull a thread out of their <unk> , and fasten it to the tree .
richer indians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole , and likewise to smoke upwards , thinking thus to afford all possible gratification to <unk> .
to complete the scene , the tree was surrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered as sacrifices .
all indians of every age and sex make their offerings ; they then think that their horses <name> not tire , and that they themselves shall be prosperous .
the gaucho who told me this , said that in the time of peace he had witnessed this scene , and that he and others used to wait till the indians had passed by , for the sake of stealing from <unk> the offerings .
the gauchos think that the indians consider the tree as the god itself ; but it seems far more probable that they regard it as the altar .
the only cause which i can imagine for this choice , is its being a landmark in a dangerous passage .
the <name> de la ventana is visible at an immense distance ; and a gaucho told me that he was once riding with an indian a few miles to the north of the rio colorado , when the indian commenced making the same loud noise , which is usual at the first sight of the distant tree , putting his hand to his head , and then pointing in the direction of the <name> .
upon being asked the reason of this , the indian said in broken spanish , " first see the <name> . "
about two leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night : at this instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the <unk> gauchos , who set off in full <name> , and in a few minutes dragged her in with their <unk> , and slaughtered her .
we here had the four necessaries of life " en el <unk> , "  pasture for the horses , water ( only a muddy puddle ) , meat and firewood .
the gauchos were in high spirits at finding all these luxuries ; and we soon set to work at the poor cow .
this was the first night which i passed under the open sky , with the gear of the <unk> for my bed .
there is high enjoyment in the independence of the gaucho life  to be able at any moment to pull up your horse , and say , " here we <name> pass the night . "
the <unk> stillness of the plain , the dogs keeping watch , the <unk> of gauchos making their beds round the fire , have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this first night , which <name> never be forgotten .
the next day the country continued similar to that above described .
it is inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind .
occasionally a deer , or a guanaco ( wild <unk> ) may be seen ; but the agouti ( <unk> patagonica ) is the commonest quadruped .
this animal here represents our hares .
it differs , however , from that genus in many essential respects ; for instance , it has only three toes behind .
it is also nearly twice the size , weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds .
the agouti is a true friend of the desert ; it is a common feature of the landscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a straight line across these wild plains .
they are found as far north as the <name> tapalguen ( latitude 37 degrees 30 ' ) , where the plain rather suddenly becomes greener and more humid ; and their southern limit is between port <name> and st. <name> , where there is no change in the nature of the country .
it is a singular fact , that although the agouti is not now found as far south as port st. <name> , yet that captain wood , in his voyage in <unk> , talks of them as being numerous there .
what cause can have altered , in a wide , uninhabited , and <unk> country , the range of an animal like this ?
it appears also , from the number shot by captain wood in one day at port <name> , that they must have been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present .
where the bizcacha lives and makes its burrows , the agouti uses them ; but where , as at bahia <name> , the bizcacha is not found , the agouti burrows for itself .
the same thing occurs with the little owl of the pampas ( <unk> <unk> ) , which has so often been described as standing like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows ; for in banda oriental , owing to the absence of the bizcacha , it is obliged to hollow out its own habitation .
the next morning , as we approached the rio colorado , the appearance of the country changed ; we soon came on a plain covered with turf , which , from its flowers , tall clover , and little owls , resembled the pampas .
we passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent , which in summer dries , and becomes <unk> with various salts ; and hence is called a <unk> .
it was covered by low succulent plants , of the same kind with those growing on the sea-shore .
the colorado , at the pass where we crossed it , is only about sixty yards wide ; generally it must be nearly double that width .
its course is very tortuous , being marked by <unk> and beds of reeds : in a direct line the distance to the mouth of the river is said to be nine leagues , but by water twenty-five .
we were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense troops of mares , which were swimming the river in order to follow a division of troops into the interior .
a more ludicrous spectacle i never beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads , all directed one way , with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils , appearing just above the water like a great shoal of some <unk> animal .
mare 's flesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition .
this gives them a great facility of movement ; for the distance to which horses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising : i have been assured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for many days successively .
the encampment of general rosas was close to the river .
it consisted of a square formed by <unk> , artillery , straw huts , etc .
the soldiers were nearly all cavalry ; and i should think such a villainous , <unk> army was never before collected together .
the greater number of men were of a mixed breed , between negro , indian , and spaniard .
i know not the reason , but men of such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance .
i called on the secretary to show my passport .
he began to <unk> me in the most dignified and mysterious manner .
by good luck i had a letter of recommendation from the government of buenos ayres to the commandant of <unk> .
( <unk> .
i am bound to express , in the strongest terms , my obligation to the government of buenos ayres for the obliging manner in which passports to all parts of the country were given me , as naturalist of the " beagle . " )
this was taken to general rosas , who sent me a very obliging message ; and the secretary returned all smiles and <unk> .
we took up our residence in the <unk> , or hovel , of a curious old spaniard , who had served with <name> in the expedition against russia .
we stayed two days at the colorado ; i had little to do , for the surrounding country was a swamp , which in summer ( december ) , when the snow melts on the cordillera , is overflowed by the river .
my chief amusement was watching the indian families as they came to buy little articles at the <unk> where we stayed .
it was supposed that general rosas had about six hundred indian allies .
the men were a tall , fine race , yet it was afterwards easy to see in the fuegian savage the same countenance rendered hideous by cold , want of food , and less civilisation .
some authors , in defining the primary races of mankind , have separated these indians into two classes ; but this is certainly incorrect .
among the young women or <unk> , some deserve to be called even beautiful .
their hair was coarse , but bright and black ; and they wore it in two <unk> hanging down to the waist .
they had a high colour , and eyes that glistened with brilliancy ; their legs , feet , and arms were small and elegantly formed ; their ankles , and sometimes their waists , were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads .
nothing could be more interesting than some of the family groups .
a mother with one or two daughters would often come to our <unk> , mounted on the same horse .
they ride like men , but with their knees tucked up much higher .
this habit , perhaps , arises from their being accustomed , when travelling , to ride the loaded horses .
the duty of the women is to load and unload the horses ; to make the tents for the night ; in short to be , like the wives of all savages , useful slaves .
the men fight , hunt , take care of the horses , and make the riding gear .
one of their chief <unk> occupations is to knock two stones together till they become round , in order to make the bolas .
with this important weapon the indian catches his game , and also his horse , which <unk> free over the plain .
in fighting , his first attempt is to throw down the horse of his adversary with the bolas , and when entangled by the fall to kill him with the <unk> .
if the balls only catch the neck or body of an animal , they are often carried away and lost .
as the making the stones round is the labour of two days , the manufacture of the balls is a very common employment .
several of the men and women had their faces painted red , but i never saw the horizontal bands which are so common among the fuegians .
their chief pride consists in having everything made of silver ; i have seen a <unk> with his spurs , stirrups , handle of his knife , and bridle made of this metal : the <unk> and reins being of wire , were not thicker than <unk> ; and to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a chain , gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance .
( plate 19 .
brazilian whips , <unk> , and spurs . )
general rosas intimated a wish to see me ; a circumstance which i was afterwards very glad of .
he is a man of an extraordinary character , and has a most predominant influence in the country , which it seems probable he <name> use to its prosperity and advancement .
( <unk> .
this prophecy has turned out entirely and miserably wrong .
1845 . )
he is said to be the owner of seventy-four square leagues of land , and to have about three hundred thousand head of cattle .
his estates are admirably managed , and are far more productive of corn than those of others .
he first gained his celebrity by his laws for his own <unk> , and by <unk> several hundred men , so as to resist with success the attacks of the indians .
there are many stories current about the rigid manner in which his laws were enforced .
one of these was , that no man , on penalty of being put into the stocks , should <name> his knife on a <name> : this being the principal day for gambling and drinking , many quarrels arose , which from the general manner of fighting with the knife often proved fatal .
one <name> the governor came in great form to pay the estancia a visit , and general rosas , in his hurry , walked out to receive him with his knife , as usual , stuck in his belt .
the steward touched his arm , and reminded him of the law ; upon which turning to the governor , he said he was extremely sorry , but that he must go into the stocks , and that till let out , he possessed no power even in his own house .
after a little time the steward was persuaded to open the stocks , and to let him out , but no sooner was this done , than he turned to the steward and said , " you now have broken the laws , so you must take my place in the stocks . "
such actions as these delighted the gauchos , who all possess high notions of their own equality and dignity .
general rosas is also a perfect horseman  an accomplishment of no small consequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by the following trial : a troop of unbroken horses being driven into a corral , were let out through a gateway , above which was a <unk> : it was agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild animals , as it rushed out , and should be able , without saddle or bridle , not only to ride it , but also to bring it back to the door of the corral , should be their general .
the person who succeeded was accordingly elected ; and doubtless made a fit general for such an army .
this extraordinary feat has also been performed by rosas .
by these means , and by <unk> to the dress and habits of the gauchos , he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country , and in consequence a despotic power .
i was assured by an english merchant , that a man who had murdered another , when arrested and questioned concerning his motive , answered , " he spoke <unk> of general rosas , so i killed him . "
at the end of a week the murderer was at <name> .
this doubtless was the act of the general 's party , and not of the general himself .
in conversation he is enthusiastic , sensible , and very grave .
his gravity is carried to a high pitch : i heard one of his mad <unk> ( for he keeps two , like the barons of old ) relate the following anecdote .
" i wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music , so i went to the general two or three times to ask him ; he said to me , 'go about your business , for i am engaged . '
i went a second time ; he said , 'if you come again i <name> punish you . '
a third time i asked , and he laughed .
i rushed out of the tent , but it was too late  he ordered two soldiers to catch and stake me .
i begged by all the saints in heaven he would let me off ; but it would not do ,  when the general laughs he spares neither mad man nor sound . "
the poor <unk> gentleman looked quite <unk> , at the very recollection of the <unk> .
this is a very severe punishment ; four posts are driven into the ground , and the man is extended by his arms and legs horizontally , and there left to stretch for several hours .
the idea is evidently taken from the usual method of drying hides .
my interview passed away without a smile , and i obtained a passport and order for the government <unk> , and this he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner .
in the morning we started for bahia <name> , which we reached in two days .
leaving the regular encampment , we passed by the <unk> of the indians .
these are round like <unk> , and covered with hides ; by the mouth of each , a tapering <unk> was stuck in the ground .
the <unk> were divided into separate groups , which belonged to the different <unk> ' tribes , and the groups were again divided into smaller ones , according to the relationship of the owners .
for several miles we travelled along the valley of the colorado .
the alluvial plains on the side appeared fertile , and it is supposed that they are well adapted to the growth of corn .
turning northward from the river , we soon entered on a country , differing from the plains south of the river .
the land still continued dry and sterile : but it supported many different kinds of plants , and the grass , though brown and withered , was more abundant , as the thorny bushes were less so .
these latter in a short space entirely disappeared , and the plains were left without a thicket to cover their nakedness .
this change in the vegetation marks the commencement of the grand <unk> deposit , which forms the wide extent of the pampas , and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental .
from the strait of magellan to the colorado , a distance of about eight hundred miles , the face of the country is everywhere composed of shingle : the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry , and probably owe their origin to the rocks of the cordillera .
north of the colorado this bed <unk> out , and the pebbles become exceedingly small , and here the characteristic vegetation of patagonia ceases .
having ridden about twenty-five miles , we came to a broad belt of sand-dunes , which stretches , as far as the eye can reach , to the east and west .
the <unk> resting on the <name> , allow small pools of water to collect , and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable supply of fresh water .
the great advantage arising from depressions and elevations of the soil , is not often brought home to the mind .
the two miserable springs in the long passage between the rio negro and colorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain , without them not a drop of water would have been found .
the belt of sand-dunes is about eight miles wide ; at some former period , it probably formed the margin of a grand estuary , where the colorado now flows .
in this district , where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land occur , such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one , although merely considering the physical geography of the country .
having crossed the <name> tract , we arrived in the evening at one of the <unk> ; and , as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we determined to pass the night there .
the house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two hundred feet high  a most remarkable feature in this country .
this posta was commanded by a negro lieutenant , born in africa : to his credit be it said , there was not a <unk> between the colorado and buenos ayres in nearly such neat order as his .
he had a little room for strangers , and a small corral for the horses , all made of sticks and reeds ; he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case of being attacked .
this would , however , have been of little avail , if the indians had come ; but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the thought of selling his life dearly .
a short time before , a body of indians had travelled past in the night ; if they had been aware of the posta , our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been slaughtered .
i did not anywhere meet a more civil and obliging man than this negro ; it was therefore the more painful to see that he would not sit down and eat with us .
in the morning we sent for the horses very early , and started for another exhilarating gallop .
we passed the <unk> <name> <unk> , an old name given to the head of a large marsh , which extends from bahia <name> .
here we changed horses , and passed through some leagues of swamps and saline marshes .
changing horses for the last time , we again began wading through the mud .
my animal fell , and i was well <unk> in black mire  a very disagreeable accident , when one does not possess a change of clothes .
some miles from the fort we met a man , who told us that a great gun had been fired , which is a signal that indians are near .
we immediately left the road , and followed the edge of a marsh , which when chased offers the best mode of escape .
we were glad to arrive within the walls , when we found all the alarm was about nothing , for the indians turned out to be friendly ones , who wished to join general rosas .
bahia <name> scarcely deserves the name of a village .
a few houses and the barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified wall .
the settlement is only of recent standing ( since 1828 ) ; and its growth has been one of trouble .
the government of buenos ayres unjustly occupied it by force , instead of following the wise example of the spanish viceroys , who purchased the land near the older settlement of the rio negro , from the indians .
hence the need of the fortifications ; hence the few houses and little cultivated land without the limits of the walls ; even the cattle are not safe from the attacks of the indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the fortress stands .
the part of the harbour where the " beagle " intended to anchor being distant twenty-five miles , i obtained from the commandant a guide and horses , to take me to see whether she had arrived .
leaving the plain of green turf , which extended along the course of a little <name> , we soon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand , saline marshes , or bare mud .
some parts were clothed by low thickets , and others with those succulent plants which <unk> only where salt abounds .
bad as the country was , ostriches , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were abundant .
my guide told me , that two months before he had a most narrow escape of his life : he was out hunting with two other men , at no great distance from this part of the country , when they were suddenly met by a party of indians , who giving <name> , soon overtook and killed his two friends .
his own horse 's legs were also caught by the bolas , but he jumped off , and with his knife cut them free : while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse , and received two severe wounds from their <unk> .
springing on the saddle , he managed , by a most wonderful exertion , just to keep ahead of the long spears of his pursuers , who followed him to within sight of the fort .
from that time there was an order that no one should stray far from the settlement .
i did not know of this when i started , and was surprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer , which appeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter .
we found the " beagle " had not arrived , and consequently set out on our return , but the horses soon tiring , we were obliged to bivouac on the plain .
in the morning we had caught an <unk> , which , although a most excellent dish when roasted in its shell , did not make a very substantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men .
the ground at the place where we stopped for the night was <unk> with a layer of sulphate of soda , and hence , of course , was without water .
yet many of the smaller rodents managed to exist even here , and the <unk> was making its odd little grunt beneath my head , during half the night .
our horses were very poor ones , and in the morning they were soon exhausted from not having had anything to drink , so that we were obliged to walk .
about noon the dogs killed a kid , which we roasted .
i ate some of it , but it made me intolerably thirsty .
this was the more distressing as the road , from some recent rain , was full of little puddles of clear water , yet not a drop was <unk> .
i had scarcely been twenty hours without water , and only part of the time under a hot sun , yet the thirst rendered me very weak .
how people survive two or three days under such circumstances , i can not imagine : at the same time , i must confess that my guide did not suffer at all , and was astonished that one day 's deprivation should be so troublesome to me .
i have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being <unk> with salt .
this phenomenon is quite different from that of the salinas , and more extraordinary .
in many parts of south <name> , wherever the climate is moderately dry , these incrustations occur ; but i have nowhere seen them so abundant as near bahia <name> .
the salt here , and in other parts of patagonia , consists chiefly of sulphate of soda with some common salt .
as long as the ground remains moist in the <unk> ( as the spaniards <unk> call them , mistaking this substance for <unk> ) , nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain composed of a black , muddy soil , supporting scattered tufts of succulent plants .
on returning through one of these tracts , after a week 's hot weather , one is surprised to see square miles of the plain white , as if from a slight fall of snow , here and there heaped up by the wind into little drifts .
this latter appearance is chiefly caused by the salts being drawn up , during the slow evaporation of the moisture , round blades of dead grass , stumps of wood , and pieces of broken earth , instead of being crystallised at the bottoms of the puddles of water .
the <unk> occur either on level tracts elevated only a few feet above the level of the sea , or on alluvial land bordering rivers .
m. <unk> found that the saline incrustation on the plain , at the distance of some miles from the sea , consisted chiefly of sulphate of soda , with only seven per cent of common salt ; whilst nearer to the coast , the common salt increased to 37 parts in a hundred .
( <unk> .

this circumstance would tempt one to believe that the sulphate of soda is generated in the soil , from the muriate left on the surface during the slow and recent elevation of this dry country .
the whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists .
have the succulent , <unk> plants , which are well known to contain much soda , the power of decomposing the muriate ?
does the black fetid mud , abounding with organic matter , yield the sulphur and ultimately the sulphuric acid ?
two days afterwards i again rode to the harbour : when not far from our destination , my companion , the same man as before , spied three people hunting on horseback .
he immediately dismounted , and watching them intently , said , " they do n't ride like christians , and nobody can leave the fort . "
the three hunters joined company , and likewise dismounted from their horses .
at last one mounted again and rode over the hill out of sight .
my companion said , " we must now get on our horses : load your pistol ; " and he looked to his own sword .
i asked , " are they indians ? "
 " <unk> <unk> ?
( who knows ? )
if there are no more than three , it does not signify . "
it then struck me , that the one man had gone over the hill to fetch the rest of his tribe .
i suggested this ; but all the answer i could extort was , " <unk> <unk> ? "
his head and eye never for a minute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon .
i thought his uncommon coolness too good a joke , and asked him why he did not return home .
i was startled when he answered , " we are returning , but in a line so as to pass near a swamp , into which we can gallop the horses as far as they can go , and then trust to our own legs ; so that there is no danger . "
i did not feel quite so confident of this , and wanted to increase our pace .
he said , " no , not until they do . "
when any little inequality concealed us , we galloped ; but when in sight , continued walking .
at last we reached a valley , and turning to the left , galloped quickly to the foot of a hill ; he gave me his horse to hold , made the dogs lie down , and then crawled on his hands and knees to reconnoitre .
he remained in this position for some time , and at last , bursting out in laughter , exclaimed , " <unk> ! "
( women ! )
he knew them to be the wife and sister-in-law of the <name> 's son , hunting for ostrich 's eggs .
i have described this man 's conduct , because he acted under the full impression that they were indians .
as soon , however , as the absurd mistake was found out , he gave me a hundred reasons why they could not have been indians ; but all these were forgotten at the time .
we then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called punta <name> , whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of bahia <name> .
the wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great <unk> , which the inhabitants call <unk> , or <unk> , from the number of small crabs .
the mud is so soft that it is impossible to walk over them , even for the shortest distance .
many of the banks have their surfaces covered with long rushes , the tops of which alone are visible at high water .
on one occasion , when in a boat , we were so entangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way .
nothing was visible but the flat beds of mud ; the day was not very clear , and there was much <unk> , or , as the sailors expressed it , " things loomed high . "
the only object within our view which was not level was the horizon ; rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air , and water like <unk> , and <unk> like water .
we passed the night in punta <name> , and i employed myself in searching for fossil bones ; this point being a perfect <unk> for monsters of extinct races .
the evening was perfectly calm and clear ; the extreme monotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of <unk> and gulls , <unk> and solitary vultures .
in riding back in the morning we came across a very fresh track of a puma , but did not succeed in finding it .
we saw also a couple of <unk> , or <unk> ,  odious animals , which are far from uncommon .
in general appearance the <unk> resembles a <unk> , but it is rather larger , and much thicker in proportion .
conscious of its power , it <unk> by day about the open plain , and fears neither dog nor man .
if a dog is urged to the attack , its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the fetid oil , which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose .
whatever is once polluted by it , is for ever useless .
azara says the smell can be perceived at a league distant ; more than once , when entering the harbour of <name> video , the wind being off shore , we have perceived the odour on board the " beagle . "
certain it is , that every animal most willingly makes room for the <unk> .

bahia <name> .
the " beagle " arrived here on the 24th of <name> , and a week afterwards sailed for the plata .
with captain fitz <name> 's consent i was left behind , to travel by land to buenos ayres .
i <name> here add some observations , which were made during this visit and on a previous occasion , when the " beagle " was employed in surveying the harbour .
the plain , at the distance of a few miles from the coast , belongs to the great pampean formation , which consists in part of a reddish <name> , and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock .
nearer the coast there are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain , and from mud , gravel , and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow elevation of the land , of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent shells , and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country .
at punta <name> we have a section of one of these <unk> little plains , which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary character of the remains of gigantic <unk> embedded in it .
these have been fully described by professor <name> , in the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle , ' " and are deposited in the college of surgeons .
i <name> here give only a brief outline of their nature .
first , parts of three heads and other bones of the megatherium , the huge dimensions of which are expressed by its name .
secondly , the <unk> , a great allied animal .
thirdly , the <unk> , also an allied animal , of which i obtained a nearly perfect skeleton .
it must have been as large as a rhinoceros : in the structure of its head it comes , according to mr. <name> , nearest to the cape <unk> , but in some other respects it approaches to the <unk> .
fourthly , the mylodon darwinii , a closely related genus of little inferior size .
fifthly , another gigantic <unk> quadruped .
<unk> , a large animal , with an <unk> coat in compartments , very like that of an <unk> .
<unk> , an extinct kind of horse , to which i shall have again to refer .
<unk> , a tooth of a <unk> animal , probably the same with the macrauchenia , a huge beast with a long neck like a camel , which i shall also refer to again .
lastly , the toxodon , perhaps one of the strangest animals ever discovered : in size it equalled an elephant or megatherium , but the structure of its teeth , as mr. <name> states , proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the <unk> , the order which , at the present day , includes most of the smallest quadrupeds : in many details it is allied to the <unk> : judging from the position of its eyes , ears , and nostrils , it was probably aquatic , like the dugong and <unk> , to which it is also allied .
how wonderfully are the different orders , at the present time so well separated , blended together in different points of the structure of the toxodon !
the remains of these nine great quadrupeds and many detached bones were found embedded on the beach , within the space of about 200 yards square .
it is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species should be found together ; and it proves how numerous in kind the ancient inhabitants of this country must have been .
at the distance of about thirty miles from punta <name> , in a <name> of red earth , i found several fragments of bones , some of large size .
among them were the teeth of a <unk> , equalling in size and closely resembling those of the capybara , whose habits have been described ; and therefore , probably , an aquatic animal .
there was also part of the head of a ctenomys ; the species being different from the <unk> , but with a close general resemblance .
the red earth , like that of the pampas , in which these remains were embedded , contains , according to professor ehrenberg , eight fresh-water and one salt-water <unk> <unk> ; therefore , probably , it was an estuary deposit .
the remains at punta <name> were embedded in stratified gravel and reddish mud , just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank .
they were associated with twenty-three species of shells , of which thirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent forms .
( <unk> .
since this was written , m. <unk> d'orbigny has examined these shells , and <unk> them all to be recent . )
from the bones of the <unk> , including even the <unk> , being entombed in their proper relative positions , and from the <unk> armour of the great <unk> animal being so well preserved , together with the bones of one of its legs , we may feel assured that these remains were fresh and united by their <unk> , when deposited in the gravel together with the shells .
( <unk> .
m. aug. <unk> has described , in a spanish work " <unk> <unk> " 1857 , this district , and he believes that the bones of the extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying pampean deposit , and subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells ; but i am not convinced by his remarks .
m. <unk> believes that the whole enormous pampean deposit is a <unk> formation , like sand-dunes : this seems to me to be an untenable doctrine . )
hence we have good evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds , more different from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary quadrupeds of europe , lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its present inhabitants ; and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often insisted on by mr. lyell , namely , that the " longevity of the species in the mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the <unk> . "
( <unk> .
" principles of geology " volume 4 <name> 40 . )
the great size of the bones of the <unk> animals , including the megatherium , <unk> , <unk> , and mylodon , is truly wonderful .
the habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle to naturalists , until professor <name> solved the problem with remarkable ingenuity .
( <unk> .
this theory was first developed in the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle , ' " and subsequently in professor <name> 's " memoir on mylodon <unk> . " )
the teeth indicate , by their simple structure , that these <unk> animals lived on vegetable food , and probably on the leaves and small twigs of trees ; their ponderous forms and great strong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion , that some eminent naturalists have actually believed that , like the <unk> , to which they are intimately related , they subsisted by climbing back downwards on trees , and feeding on the leaves .
it was a bold , not to say preposterous , idea to conceive even <unk> trees , with branches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants .
professor <name> , with far more probability , believes that , instead of climbing on the trees , they pulled the branches down to them , and tore up the smaller ones by the roots , and so fed on the leaves .
the colossal breadth and weight of their hinder quarters , which can hardly be imagined without having been seen , become , on this view , of obvious service , instead of being an <unk> : their apparent <unk> disappears .
with their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed like a tripod on the ground , they could freely exert the full force of their most powerful arms and great claws .
strongly rooted , indeed , must that tree have been , which could have resisted such force !
the mylodon , moreover , was furnished with a long <unk> tongue like that of the giraffe , which , by one of those beautiful provisions of nature , thus reaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food .
i may remark , that in abyssinia the elephant , according to <name> , when it can not reach with its proboscis the branches , deeply scores with its tusks the trunk of the tree , up and down and all round , till it is sufficiently weakened to be broken down .
the beds including the above fossil remains stand only from fifteen to twenty feet above the level of high water ; and hence the elevation of the land has been small ( without there has been an intercalated period of subsidence , of which we have no evidence ) since the great quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding plains ; and the external features of the country must then have been very nearly the same as now .
what , it may naturally be asked , was the character of the vegetation at that period ; was the country as <unk> sterile as it now is ?
as so many of the <unk> shells are the same with those now living in the bay , i was at first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably similar to the existing one ; but this would have been an erroneous inference , for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of brazil ; and generally , the characters of the inhabitants of the sea are useless as guides to judge of those on the land .
nevertheless , from the following considerations , i do not believe that the simple fact of many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round bahia <name> , is any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant vegetation : i have no doubt that the sterile country a little southward , near the rio negro , with its scattered thorny trees , would support many and large quadrupeds .
that large animals require a luxuriant vegetation , has been a general assumption which has passed from one work to another ; but i do not hesitate to say that it is completely false , and that it has vitiated the reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the ancient history of the world .
the prejudice has probably been derived from <name> , and the indian islands , where troops of elephants , <name> forests , and impenetrable jungles , are associated together in every one 's mind .
if , however , we refer to any work of travels through the southern parts of africa , we shall find allusions in almost every <name> either to the desert character of the country , or to the <name> of large animals inhabiting it .
the same thing is rendered evident by the many engravings which have been published of various parts of the interior .
when the " beagle " was at cape town , i made an excursion of some days ' length into the country , which at least was sufficient to render that which i had read more fully intelligible .
dr. <name> smith , who , at the head of his adventurous party , has lately succeeded in passing the tropic of <unk> , informs me that , taking into consideration the whole of the southern part of africa , there can be no doubt of its being a sterile country .
on the southern and south-eastern coasts there are some fine forests , but with these exceptions , the traveller may pass for days together through open plains , covered by a poor and scanty vegetation .
it is difficult to convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility ; but it may be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one time by great britain , exceeds , perhaps even tenfold , the quantity on an equal area in the interior parts of southern africa .
( <unk> .
i mean by this to exclude the total amount which may have been successively produced and consumed during a given period . )
the fact that <unk> can travel in any direction , excepting near the coast , without more than occasionally half an hour 's delay in cutting down bushes , gives , perhaps , a more definite notion of the <unk> of the vegetation .
now , if we look to the animals inhabiting these wide plains , we shall find their <name> extraordinarily great , and their bulk immense .
we must enumerate the elephant , three species of rhinoceros , and probably , according to dr. smith , two others , the hippopotamus , the giraffe , the bos <unk>  as large as a full-grown bull , and the <unk>  but little less , two <unk> , and the <unk> , two <unk> , and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals .
it may be supposed that although the species are numerous , the individuals of each kind are few .
by the kindness of dr. smith , i am enabled to show that the case is very different .
he informs me , that in latitude 24 degrees , in one day 's march with the <unk> , he saw , without wandering to any great distance on either side , between one hundred and one hundred and fifty <unk> , which belonged to three species : the same day he saw several herds of <unk> , amounting together to nearly a hundred ; and that , although no elephant was observed , yet they are found in this district .
at the distance of a little more than one hour 's march from their place of encampment on the previous night , his party actually killed at one spot eight <unk> , and saw many more .
in this same river there were likewise crocodiles .
of course it was a case quite extraordinary , to see so many great animals crowded together , but it evidently proves that they must exist in great <name> .
dr. smith describes the country passed through that day , as " being thinly covered with grass , and bushes about four feet high , and still more thinly with <unk> . "
the <unk> were not prevented travelling in a nearly straight line .
besides these large animals , every one the least acquainted with the natural history of the cape has read of the herds of antelopes , which can be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds .
the <name> indeed of the lion , panther , and <unk> , and the multitude of birds of prey , plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds : one evening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round dr. smith 's encampment .
as this able naturalist remarked to me , the carnage each day in southern africa must indeed be terrific !
i confess it is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in a country producing so little food .
the larger quadrupeds no doubt roam over wide tracts in search of it ; and their food chiefly consists of <unk> , which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk .
dr. smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth ; no sooner is a part consumed , than its place is supplied by a fresh stock .
there can be no doubt , however , that our ideas respecting the apparent amount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much exaggerated : it should have been remembered that the camel , an animal of no mean bulk , has always been considered as the emblem of the desert .
the belief that where large quadrupeds exist , the vegetation must necessarily be luxuriant , is the more remarkable , because the converse is far from true .
mr. burchell observed to me that when entering brazil , nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the south american vegetation contrasted with that of south africa , together with the absence of all large quadrupeds .
in his " travels , " he has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights ( if there were sufficient data ) of an equal number of the largest <unk> quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious .
( <unk> .
" travels in the interior of south africa " volume 2 <name> 207 . )
if we take on the one side , the elephant , hippopotamus , giraffe , bos <unk> , <unk> , certainly three , and probably five species of rhinoceros ; and on the american side , two <unk> , the guanaco , three deer , the <unk> , <unk> , capybara ( after which we must choose from the monkeys to complete the number ) , and then place these two groups alongside each other , it is not easy to conceive ranks more <unk> in size .
( <unk> .
the elephant which was killed at exeter change was estimated ( being partly weighed ) at five tons and a half .
the elephant actress , as i was informed , weighed one ton less ; so that we may take five as the average of a full-grown elephant .
i was told at the <unk> gardens , that a hippopotamus which was sent to england cut up into pieces was estimated at three tons and a half ; we <name> call it three .
from these premises we may give three tons and a half to each of the five <unk> ; perhaps a ton to the giraffe , and half to the bos <unk> as well as to the <unk> ( a large ox weighs from 1200 to 1500 pounds ) .
this <name> give an average ( from the above estimates ) of <unk> of a ton for the ten largest <unk> animals of southern africa .
in south <name> , allowing 1200 pounds for the two <unk> together , 550 for the guanaco and <unk> , 500 for three deer , 300 for the capybara , <unk> , and a monkey , we shall have an average of 250 pounds , which i believe is <unk> the result .
the ratio <name> therefore be as <unk> to 250 , or 24 to 1 , for the ten largest animals from the two continents . )
after the above facts , we are compelled to conclude , against anterior probability , that among the mammalia there exists no close relation between the bulk of the species and the quantity of the vegetation in the countries which they inhabit .
( 5/8 .
if we suppose the case of the discovery of a skeleton of a greenland whale in a fossil state , not a single <unk> animal being known to exist , what naturalist would have ventured conjecture on the possibility of a carcass so gigantic being supported on the minute crustacea and mollusca living in the frozen seas of the extreme north ? )
with regard to the number of large quadrupeds , there certainly exists no quarter of the globe which <name> bear comparison with southern africa .
after the different statements which have been given , the extremely desert character of that region <name> not be disputed .
in the european division of the world , we must look back to the tertiary epochs , to find a condition of things among the mammalia , resembling that now existing at the cape of good <name> .
those tertiary epochs , which we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with large animals , because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at certain spots , could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than southern africa does at present .
if we speculate on the condition of the vegetation during those epochs , we are at least bound so far to consider existing analogies , as not to urge as absolutely necessary a luxuriant vegetation , when we see a state of things so totally different at the cape of good <name> .
we know that the extreme regions of north <name> many degrees beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains perpetually <unk> , are covered by forests of large and tall trees .
( <unk> .
see " zoological remarks to captain <unk> expedition " by dr. richardson .
he says , " the <unk> north of latitude 56 degrees is perpetually frozen , the thaw on the coast not penetrating above three feet , and at bear lake , in latitude 64 degrees , not more than twenty inches .
the frozen <unk> does not of itself destroy vegetation , for forests flourish on the surface , at a distance from the coast . " )
in a like manner , in siberia , we have woods of birch , fir , <unk> , and <unk> , growing in a latitude ( 64 degrees ) where the mean temperature of the air falls below the freezing point , and where the earth is so completely frozen , that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is perfectly preserved .
( <unk> .
see humboldt " <unk> <unk> " <name> 386 : <name> 's " geography of plants " ; and <unk> <unk> .
in the latter work it is said that the limit of the growth of trees in siberia may be drawn under the parallel of 70 degrees . )
with these facts we must <name> , as far as quantity alone of vegetation is concerned , that the great quadrupeds of the later tertiary epochs might , in most parts of northern europe and <name> , have lived on the spots where their remains are now found .
i do not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their support ; because , as there is evidence of physical changes , and as the animals have become extinct , so may we suppose that the species of plants have likewise been changed .
these remarks , i may be permitted to add , directly bear on the case of the siberian animals preserved in ice .
the firm conviction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical luxuriance , to support such large animals , and the impossibility of <unk> this with the proximity of perpetual <unk> , was one chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate , and of overwhelming <unk> , which were invented to account for their <unk> .
i am far from supposing that the climate has not changed since the period when those animals lived , which now lie buried in the ice .
at present i only wish to show , that as far as quantity of food alone is concerned , the ancient <unk> might have roamed over the <unk> of central siberia ( the northern parts probably being under water ) even in their present condition , as well as the living <unk> and elephants over the <unk> of southern africa .
i <name> now give an account of the habits of some of the more interesting birds which are common on the wild plains of northern patagonia : and first for the largest , or south american ostrich .
the ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one .
they live on vegetable matter , such as roots and grass ; but at bahia <name> i have repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive <unk> which are then dry , for the sake , as the gauchos say , of feeding on small fish .
although the ostrich in its habits is so shy , wary , and solitary , and although so fleet in its pace , it is caught without much difficulty by the indian or gaucho armed with the bolas .
when several horsemen appear in a semicircle , it becomes confounded , and does not know which way to escape .
they generally prefer running against the wind ; yet at the first start they expand their wings , and like a vessel make all sail .
on one fine hot day i saw several ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes , where they squatted concealed , till quite closely approached .
it is not generally known that ostriches readily take to the water .
mr. king informs me that at the bay of san blas , and at port <unk> in patagonia , he saw these birds swimming several times from island to island .
they ran into the water both when driven down to a point , and likewise of their own accord when not frightened : the distance crossed was about two hundred yards .
when swimming , very little of their bodies appear above water ; their necks are extended a little forward , and their progress is slow .
on two occasions i saw some ostriches swimming across the <name> <name> river , where its course was about four hundred yards wide , and the stream rapid .
captain <unk> , when descending the <unk> , in australia , saw two <unk> in the act of swimming .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's travels , volume 2 <name> 74 . )
the inhabitants of the country readily distinguish , even at a distance , the cock bird from the hen .
the former is larger and <unk> , and has a bigger head .
( <unk> .
a <unk> assured me that he had once seen a snow-white or albino variety , and that it was a most beautiful bird . )
the ostrich , i believe the cock , emits a singular , <unk> , hissing note : when first i heard it , standing in the midst of some <unk> , i thought it was made by some wild beast , for it is a sound that one can not tell whence it comes , or from how far distant .
when we were at bahia <name> in the months of <name> and october , the eggs , in extraordinary <name> , were found all over the country .
they lie either scattered and single , in which case they are never hatched , and are called by the spaniards <unk> ; or they are collected together into a shallow excavation , which forms the nest .
out of the four nests which i saw , three contained twenty-two eggs each , and the fourth twenty-seven .
in one day 's hunting on horseback sixty-four eggs were found ; forty-four of these were in two nests , and the remaining twenty , scattered <unk> .
the gauchos unanimously affirm , and there is no reason to doubt their statement , that the male bird alone hatches the eggs , and for some time afterwards accompanies the young .
the cock when on the nest lies very close ; i have myself almost ridden over one .
it is asserted that at such times they are occasionally fierce , and even dangerous , and that they have been known to attack a man on horseback , trying to kick and leap on him .
my <unk> pointed out to me an old man , whom he had seen much terrified by one chasing him .
i observe in <unk> " travels in south africa " that he remarks , " having killed a male ostrich , and the feathers being dirty , it was said by the <unk> to be a nest bird . "
i understand that the male <unk> in the zoological gardens takes charge of the nest : this habit , therefore , is common to the family .
the gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest .
i have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched to go in the middle of the day , one after the other , to the same nest .
i may add , also , that it is believed in africa that two or more females lay in one nest .
( <unk> .
<unk> " travels " volume 1 <name> 280 . )
although this habit at first appears very strange , i think the cause may be explained in a simple manner .
the number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty , and even to fifty ; and according to azara , sometimes to seventy or eighty .
now although it is most probable , from the number of eggs found in one district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the parent birds , and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen , that she may in the course of the season lay a large number , yet the time required must be very long .
azara states that a female in a state of domestication laid seventeen eggs , each at the interval of three days one from another .
( <unk> .
azara volume 4 <name> 173 . )
if the hen was obliged to hatch her own eggs , before the last was laid the first probably would be <unk> ; but if each laid a few eggs at successive periods , in different nests , and several hens , as is stated to be the case , combined together , then the eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age .
if the number of eggs in one of these nests is , as i believe , not greater on an average than the number laid by one female in the season , then there must be as many nests as females , and each cock bird <name> have its fair share of the labour of incubation ; and that during a period when the females probably could not sit , from not having finished laying .
( <unk> .
<unk> , however , asserts " travels " volume 2 <name> 25 , that the hens begin sitting when they have laid ten or twelve eggs ; and that they continue laying , i presume in another nest .
this appears to me very improbable .
he asserts that four or five hens associate for incubation with one cock , who sits only at night . )
i have before mentioned the great <name> of <unk> , or deserted eggs ; so that in one day 's hunting twenty were found in this state .
it appears odd that so many should be wasted .
does it not arise from the difficulty of several females associating together , and finding a male ready to undertake the office of incubation ?
it is evident that there must at first be some degree of association between at least two females ; otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plains , at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into one nest : some authors have believed that the scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to feed on .
this can hardly be the case in <name> , because the <unk> , although often found <unk> and putrid , are generally whole .
when at the rio negro in northern patagonia , i repeatedly heard the gauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called <unk> <unk> .
they described it as being less than the common ostrich ( which is there abundant ) , but with a very close general resemblance .
they said its colour was dark and mottled , and that its legs were shorter , and feathered lower down than those of the common ostrich .
it is more easily caught by the bolas than the other species .
the few inhabitants who had seen both kinds , affirmed they could distinguish them apart from a long distance .
the eggs of the small species appeared , however , more generally known ; and it was remarked , with surprise , that they were very little less than those of the <name> but of a slightly different form , and with a tinge of pale blue .
this species occurs most rarely on the plains bordering the rio negro ; but about a degree and a half farther south they are tolerably abundant .
when at port <name> , in patagonia ( latitude 48 degrees ) , mr. <unk> shot an ostrich ; and i looked at it , forgetting at the moment , in the most unaccountable manner , the whole subject of the <unk> , and thought it was a not full-grown bird of the common sort .
it was cooked and eaten before my memory returned .
fortunately the head , neck , legs , wings , many of the larger feathers , and a large part of the skin , had been preserved ; and from these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together , and is now exhibited in the museum of the zoological society .
mr. gould , in describing this new species , has done me the honour of calling it after my name .
among the patagonian indians in the strait of magellan , we found a half indian , who had lived some years with the tribe , but had been born in the northern provinces .
i asked him if he had ever heard of the <unk> <unk> .
he answered by saying , " why , there are none others in these southern countries . "
he informed me that the number of eggs in the nest of the <unk> is considerably less than in that of the other kind , namely , not more than fifteen on an average , but he asserted that more than one female deposited them .
at <name> <name> we saw several of these birds .
they were excessively wary : i think they could see a person approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves .
in ascending the river few were seen ; but in our quiet and rapid descent many , in pairs and by fours or <unk> , were observed .
it was remarked that this bird did not expand its wings , when first starting at full speed , after the manner of the northern kind .
in conclusion i may observe that the <unk> <name> inhabits the country of la plata as far as a little south of the rio negro in latitude 41 degrees , and that the <unk> darwinii takes its place in southern patagonia ; the part about the rio negro being neutral territory .
m. a. d'orbigny , when at the rio negro , made great exertions to procure this bird , but never had the good fortune to succeed .
( <unk> .
when at the rio negro , we heard much of the indefatigable labours of this naturalist .
m. <unk> d'orbigny , during the years 1825 to 1833 , traversed several large portions of south <name> , and has made a collection , and is now publishing the results on a scale of magnificence , which at once places himself in the list of american travellers second only to humboldt . )
<unk> long ago was aware of there being two kinds of ostriches , he says , " you must know , moreover , that <unk> differ in size and habits in different tracts of land ; for those that inhabit the plains of buenos ayres and <unk> are larger , and have black , white and grey feathers ; those near to the strait of magellan are smaller and more beautiful , for their white feathers are tipped with black at the extremity , and their black ones in like manner terminate in white . "
( <unk> .
" account of the <unk> " a.d. <unk> volume 1 english translation <name> 314 . )
a very singular little bird , <unk> <unk> , is here common : in its habits and general appearance it nearly equally partakes of the characters , different as they are , of the quail and snipe .
the <unk> is found in the whole of southern south <name> , wherever there are sterile plains , or open dry pasture land .
it <unk> in pairs or small flocks the most desolate places , where scarcely another living creature can exist .
upon being approached they squat close , and then are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground .
when feeding they walk rather slowly , with their legs wide apart .
they dust themselves in roads and <name> places , and frequent particular spots , where they may be found day after day : like partridges , they take wing in a flock .
in all these respects , in the muscular gizzard adapted for vegetable food , in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils , short legs and form of foot , the <unk> has a close affinity with quails .
but as soon as the bird is seen flying , its whole appearance changes ; the long pointed wings , so different from those in the gallinaceous order , the irregular manner of flight , and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of rising , recall the idea of a snipe .
the sportsmen of the " beagle " unanimously called it the <unk> snipe .
to this genus , or rather to the family of the waders , its skeleton shows that it is really related .
the <unk> is closely related to some other south american birds .
two species of the genus <unk> are in almost every respect <unk> in their habits ; one lives in <name> <name> fuego , above the limits of the forest land ; and the other just beneath the snow-line on the cordillera of central chile .
a bird of another closely allied genus , <unk> <name> , is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions ; it feeds on seaweed and shells on the tidal rocks .
although not <unk> , from some unaccountable habit it is frequently met with far out at sea .
this small family of birds is one of those which , from its varied relations to other families , although at present offering only difficulties to the systematic naturalist , ultimately may assist in revealing the grand scheme , common to the present and past ages , on which organised beings have been created .
the genus <unk> contains several species , all small birds , living on the ground , and inhabiting open dry countries .
in structure they can not be compared to any european form .
ornithologists have generally included them among the creepers , although opposed to that family in every habit .
the best known species is the common <unk> of la plata , the <unk> or <unk> of the spaniards .
the nest , whence it takes its name , is placed in the most exposed situations , as on the top of a post , a bare rock , or on a cactus .
it is composed of mud and bits of straw , and has strong thick walls : in shape it precisely resembles an oven , or depressed <unk> .
the opening is large and arched , and directly in front , within the nest , there is a partition , which reaches nearly to the roof , thus forming a passage or <unk> to the true nest .
another and smaller species of <unk> ( f. <unk> ) , resembles the <unk> in the general reddish tint of its plumage , in a peculiar shrill reiterated cry , and in an odd manner of running by starts .
from its affinity , the spaniards call it <unk> ( or little <unk> ) , although its nidification is quite different .
the <unk> builds its nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole , which is said to extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground .
several of the country people told me , that when boys , they had attempted to dig out the nest , but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the passage .
the bird chooses any low bank of firm <name> soil by the side of a road or stream .
here ( at bahia <name> ) the walls round the houses are built of hardened mud , and i noticed that one , which enclosed a courtyard where i lodged , was bored through by round holes in a score of places .
on asking the owner the cause of this , he bitterly complained of the little <unk> , several of which i afterwards observed at work .
it is rather curious to find how incapable these birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness , for although they were constantly flitting over the low wall , they continued vainly to bore through it , thinking it an excellent bank for their nests .
i do not doubt that each bird , as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side , was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact .
i have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this country .
of <unk> three species occur , namely , the <unk> <unk> or <unk> , the d. <unk> or <unk> , and the <unk> .
the first extends ten degrees farther south than any other kind ; a fourth species , the <unk> , does not come as far south as bahia <name> .
the four species have nearly similar habits ; the <unk> , however , is nocturnal , while the others wander by day over the open plains , feeding on beetles , larvae , roots , and even small snakes .
the <unk> , commonly called <unk> , is remarkable by having only three movable bands ; the rest of its <unk> covering being nearly inflexible .
it has the power of rolling itself into a perfect sphere , like one kind of english woodlouse .
in this state it is safe from the attack of dogs ; for the dog not being able to take the whole in its mouth , tries to bite one side , and the ball slips away .
the smooth hard covering of the <unk> offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog .
the <unk> prefers a very dry soil ; and the sand-dunes near the coast , where for many months it can never taste water , is its favourite resort : it often tries to escape notice , by squatting close to the ground .
in the course of a day 's ride , near bahia <name> , several were generally met with .
the instant one was perceived , it was necessary , in order to catch it , almost to tumble off one 's horse ; for in soft soil the animal burrowed so quickly , that its hinder quarters would almost disappear before one could alight .
it seems almost a pity to kill such nice little animals , for as a gaucho said , while sharpening his knife on the back of one , " son tan <unk> " ( they are so quiet ) .
of reptiles there are many kinds : one snake ( a <unk> , or <unk> , subsequently called by m. <unk> t. <unk> ) , from the size of the poison channel in its fangs , must be very deadly .
cuvier , in opposition to some other naturalists , makes this a <unk> of the rattlesnake , and intermediate between it and the viper .
in confirmation of this opinion , i observed a fact , which appears to me very curious and instructive , as showing how every character , even though it may be in some degree independent of structure , has a tendency to vary by slow degrees .
the extremity of the tail of this snake is terminated by a point , which is very slightly enlarged ; and as the animal glides along , it constantly <unk> the last inch ; and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood , produces a rattling noise , which can be distinctly heard at the distance of six feet .
as often as the animal was irritated or surprised , its tail was shaken ; and the vibrations were extremely rapid .
even as long as the body retained its irritability , a tendency to this habitual movement was evident .
this <unk> has , therefore , in some respects the structure of a viper , with the habits of a rattlesnake : the noise , however , being produced by a simpler device .
the expression of this <unk> face was hideous and fierce ; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and <unk> <name> ; the jaws were broad at the base , and the nose terminated in a triangular projection .
i do not think i ever saw anything more ugly , excepting , perhaps , some of the <unk> bats .
i imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions , with respect to each other , somewhat proportional to those of the human face ; and thus we obtain a scale of <unk> .
amongst the <unk> reptiles , i found only one little toad ( <unk> <unk> ) , which was most singular from its colour .
if we imagine , first , that it had been steeped in the blackest ink , and then , when dry , allowed to crawl over a board , freshly painted with the brightest vermilion , so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of its stomach , a good idea of its appearance <name> be gained .
if it had been an unnamed species , surely it ought to have been called <unk> , for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of <name> .
instead of being nocturnal in its habits , as other toads are , and living in damp obscure recesses , it crawls during the heat of the day about the dry <unk> and arid plains , where not a single drop of water can be found .
it must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture ; and this probably is absorbed by the skin , for it is known that these reptiles possess great powers of <unk> absorption .
at maldonado , i found one in a situation nearly as dry as at bahia <name> , and thinking to give it a great treat , carried it to a pool of water ; not only was the little animal unable to swim , but i think without help it would soon have been drowned .
of lizards there were many kinds , but only one ( <unk> <unk> ) remarkable from its habits .
it lives on the bare sand near the sea-coast , and from its mottled colour , the brownish scales being speckled with white , yellowish red , and dirty blue , can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface .
when frightened , it attempts to avoid discovery by <unk> death , with outstretched legs , depressed body , and closed eyes : if further molested , it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand .
this lizard , from its flattened body and short legs , can not run quickly .
i <name> here add a few remarks on the <unk> of animals in this part of south <name> .
when we first arrived at bahia <name> , <name> 7th , 1832 , we thought nature had granted scarcely a living creature to this <name> and dry country .
by digging , however , in the ground , several insects , large spiders , and lizards were found in a <unk> state .
on the 15th , a few animals began to appear , and by the 18th ( three days from the <unk> ) , everything announced the commencement of spring .
the plains were ornamented by the flowers of a pink <unk> , wild peas , <unk> , and geraniums ; and the birds began to lay their eggs .
numerous lamellicorn and <unk> insects , the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies , were slowly crawling about ; while the lizard tribe , the constant inhabitants of a <name> soil , darted about in every direction .
during the first eleven days , whilst nature was dormant , the mean temperature taken from observations made every two hours on board the " beagle , " was 51 degrees ; and in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 55 degrees .
on the eleven succeeding days , in which all living things became so animated , the mean was 58 degrees , and the range in the middle of the day between sixty and seventy .
here then an increase of seven degrees in mean temperature , but a greater one of extreme heat , was sufficient to awake the functions of life .
at <name> video , from which we had just before sailed , in the twenty-three days included between the 26th of july and the 19th of <name> , the mean temperature from 276 observations was <unk> degrees ; the mean hottest day being <unk> degrees , and the coldest 46 degrees .
the lowest point to which the thermometer fell was <unk> degrees , and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to 69 or 70 degrees .
yet with this high temperature , almost every beetle , several genera of spiders , <unk> , and land-shells , toads and lizards , were all lying torpid beneath stones .
but we have seen that at bahia <name> , which is four degrees southward , and therefore with a climate only a very little colder , this same temperature , with a rather less extreme heat , was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings .
this shows how nicely the stimulus required to arouse <unk> animals is governed by the usual climate of the district , and not by the absolute heat .
it is well known that within the tropics the <unk> , or more properly <unk> , of animals is determined not by the temperature , but by the times of drought .
near rio de janeiro , i was at first surprised to observe that , a few days after some little depressions had been filled with water , they were peopled by numerous full-grown shells and beetles , which must have been lying dormant .
humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened mud .
he adds , " the indians often find enormous <unk> , which they call <unk> , or water serpents , in the same <unk> state .
to <unk> them , they must be irritated or wetted with water . "
i <name> only mention one other animal , a <unk> ( i believe <unk> patagonica ) , a kind of <unk> .
it consists of a thin , straight , fleshy stem , with alternate rows of <unk> on each side , and surrounding an elastic stony axis , varying in length from eight inches to two feet .
the stem at one extremity is <unk> , but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage .
the stony axis which gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter .
at low water hundreds of these <unk> might be seen , projecting like stubble , with the <unk> end upwards , a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand .
when touched or pulled they suddenly <name> themselves in with force , so as nearly or quite to disappear .
by this action , the highly elastic axis must be bent at the lower extremity , where it is naturally slightly curved ; and i imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the <unk> is enabled to rise again through the mud .
each <unk> , though closely united to its brethren , has a distinct mouth , body , and <unk> .
of these <unk> , in a large specimen , there must be many thousands ; yet we see that they act by one movement : they have also one central axis connected with a system of obscure circulation , and the ova are produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals .
( <unk> .
the cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter , which , examined under a microscope , presented an extraordinary appearance .
the mass consisted of rounded , <unk> , irregular grains , aggregated together into particles of various sizes .
all such particles , and the separate grains , possessed the power of rapid movement ; generally revolving around different axes , but sometimes progressive .
the movement was visible with a very weak power , but even with the highest its cause could not be perceived .
it was very different from the circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag , containing the thin extremity of the axis .
on other occasions , when <unk> small <name> animals beneath the microscope , i have seen particles of pulpy matter , some of large size , as soon as they were disengaged , commence revolving .
i have imagined , i know not with how much truth , that this <unk> matter was in process of being converted into ova .
certainly in this <unk> such appeared to be the case . )
well may one be allowed to ask , what is an individual ?
it is always interesting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old voyagers ; and i have no doubt but that the habits of this <unk> explain one such case .
captain lancaster , in his voyage in 1601 , <unk> that on the <unk> of the island of <unk> , in the east indies , he " found a small twig growing up like a young tree , and on offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground , and sinks , unless held very hard .
on being plucked up , a great worm is found to be its root , and as the tree <unk> in greatness , so doth the worm diminish , and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it <unk> in the earth , and so becomes great .
this transformation is one of the strangest wonders that i saw in all my travels : for if this tree is plucked up , while young , and the leaves and bark stripped off , it becomes a hard stone when dry , much like white <name> : thus is this worm twice transformed into different natures .
of these we gathered and brought home many . "

during my stay at bahia <name> , while waiting for the " beagle , " the place was in a constant state of excitement , from rumours of wars and victories , between the troops of rosas and the wild indians .
one day an account came that a small party forming one of the <unk> on the line to buenos ayres had been found all murdered .
the next day three hundred men arrived from the colorado , under the command of commandant <name> .
a large portion of these men were indians ( <unk> , or tame ) , belonging to the tribe of the <unk> <unk> .
they passed the night here ; and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage than the scene of their bivouac .
some drank till they were intoxicated ; others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle slaughtered for their suppers , and then , being sick from drunkenness , they cast it up again , and were <unk> with filth and gore .
in the morning they started for the scene of the murder , with orders to follow the <unk> , or track , even if it led them to chile .
we subsequently heard that the wild indians had escaped into the great pampas , and from some cause the track had been missed .
one glance at the <unk> tells these people a whole history .
supposing they examine the track of a thousand horses , they <name> soon guess the number of mounted ones by seeing how many have cantered ; by the depth of the other impressions , whether any horses were loaded with cargoes ; by the irregularity of the footsteps , how far tired ; by the manner in which the food has been cooked , whether the pursued travelled in haste ; by the general appearance , how long it has been since they passed .
they consider a <unk> of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be hunted out .
we also heard that <name> struck from the west end of the <name> ventana , in a direct line to the island of <unk> , situated seventy leagues up the rio negro .
this is a distance of between two and three hundred miles , through a country completely unknown .
what other troops in the world are so independent ?
with the sun for their guide , <unk> flesh for food , their <unk> for beds ,  as long as there is a little water , these men would penetrate to the end of the world .
a few days afterwards i saw another troop of these <unk> soldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of indians at the small salinas , who had been betrayed by a prisoner <unk> .
the spaniard who brought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man .
he gave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present .
some indians , who had been taken prisoners , gave information of a tribe living north of the colorado .
two hundred soldiers were sent ; and they first discovered the indians by a cloud of dust from their horses ' feet as they chanced to be travelling .
the country was mountainous and wild , and it must have been far in the interior , for the cordillera were in sight .
the indians , men , women , and children , were about one hundred and ten in number , and they were nearly all taken or killed , for the soldiers sabre every man .
the indians are now so terrified that they offer no resistance in a body , but each flies , neglecting even his wife and children ; but when overtaken , like wild animals , they fight against any number to the last moment .
one dying indian seized with his teeth the thumb of his adversary , and allowed his own eye to be forced out sooner than relinquish his hold .
another , who was wounded , feigned death , keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal blow .
my <unk> said , when he was pursuing an indian , the man cried out for <name> , at the same time that he was covertly <unk> the bolas from his waist , meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his pursuer .
" i however struck him with my sabre to the ground , and then got off my horse , and cut his throat with my knife . "
this is a dark picture ; but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact , that all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold blood ?
when i exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman , he answered , " why , what can be done ?
they breed so ! "
every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war , because it is against barbarians .
who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a <name> civilised country ?
the children of the indians are saved , to be sold or given away as servants , or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make them believe themselves slaves ; but i believe in their treatment there is little to complain of .
in the battle four men ran away together .
they were pursued , one was killed , and the other three were taken alive .
they turned out to be messengers or ambassadors from a large body of indians , united in the common cause of defence , near the cordillera .
the tribe to which they had been sent was on the point of holding a grand council , the feast of mare 's flesh was ready , and the dance prepared : in the morning the ambassadors were to have returned to the cordillera .
they were remarkably fine men , very fair , above six feet high , and all under thirty years of age .
the three survivors of course possessed very valuable information and to extort this they were placed in a line .
the two first being questioned , answered , " no <unk> " ( i do not know ) , and were one after the other shot .
the third also said " no <unk> ; " adding , " fire , i am a man , and can die ! "
not one syllable would they breathe to injure the united cause of their country !
the conduct of the above-mentioned <unk> was very different ; he saved his life by betraying the intended plan of warfare , and the point of union in the andes .
it was believed that there were already six or seven hundred indians together , and that in summer their <name> would be doubled .
ambassadors were to have been sent to the indians at the small salinas , near bahia <name> , whom i have mentioned that this same <unk> had betrayed .
the communication , therefore , between the indians , extends from the cordillera to the coast of the atlantic .
general rosas 's plan is to kill all stragglers , and having driven the remainder to a common point , to attack them in a body , in the summer , with the assistance of the <unk> .
this operation is to be repeated for three successive years .
i imagine the summer is chosen as the time for the main attack , because the plains are then without water , and the indians can only travel in particular directions .
the escape of the indians to the south of the rio negro , where in such a vast unknown country they would be safe , is prevented by a treaty with the <unk> to this effect ;  that rosas pays them so much to slaughter every indian who passes to the south of the river , but if they fail in so doing , they themselves are to be exterminated .
the war is waged chiefly against the indians near the cordillera ; for many of the tribes on this eastern side are fighting with rosas .
the general , however , like lord chesterfield , thinking that his friends may in a future day become his enemies , always places them in the front ranks , so that their <name> may be thinned .
since leaving south <name> we have heard that this war of extermination completely failed .
among the captive girls taken in the same engagement , there were two very pretty spanish ones , who had been carried away by the indians when young , and could now only speak the indian tongue .
from their account they must have come from <unk> , a distance in a straight line of nearly one thousand miles .
this gives one a grand idea of the immense territory over which the indians roam : yet , great as it is , i think there <name> not , in another <unk> , be a wild indian northward of the rio negro .
the warfare is too bloody to last ; the christians killing every indian , and the indians doing the same by the christians .
it is melancholy to trace how the indians have given way before the spanish invaders .
<unk> says that in <unk> , when buenos ayres was founded , there were villages containing two and three thousand inhabitants .
( <unk> .
<unk> " collection of voyages . "
i believe the date was really <unk> . )
even in falconer 's time ( <unk> ) the indians made inroads as far as luxan , <unk> , and <unk> , but now they are driven beyond the salado .
not only have whole tribes been exterminated , but the remaining indians have become more barbarous : instead of living in large villages , and being employed in the arts of fishing , as well as of the <name> , they now wander about the open plains , without home or fixed occupation .
i heard also some account of an engagement which took place , a few weeks previously to the one mentioned , at <unk> .
this is a very important station on account of being a pass for horses ; and it was , in consequence , for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army .
when the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of indians , of whom they killed twenty or thirty .
the <unk> escaped in a manner which astonished every one .
the chief indians always have one or two picked horses , which they keep ready for any urgent occasion .
on one of these , an old white horse , the <unk> sprung , taking with him his little son .
the horse had neither saddle nor bridle .
to avoid the shots , the indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation ; namely , with an arm round the horse 's neck , and one leg only on its back .
thus hanging on one side , he was seen patting the horse 's head , and talking to him .
the pursuers urged every effort in the <name> ; the commandant three times changed his horse , but all in vain .
the old indian father and his son escaped , and were free .
what a fine picture one can form in one 's mind ,  the naked , <unk> figure of the old man with his little boy , riding like a mazeppa on the white horse , thus leaving far behind him the host of his pursuers !
i saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint , which i immediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow .
he told me it was found near the island of <unk> , and that they are frequently picked up there .
it was between two and three inches long , and therefore twice as large as those now used in <name> <name> fuego : it was made of opaque cream-coloured flint , but the point and barbs had been intentionally broken off .
it is well known that no pampas indians now use bows and arrows .
i believe a small tribe in banda oriental must be excepted ; but they are widely separated from the pampas indians , and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest , and live on foot .
it appears , therefore , that these arrow-heads are <unk> relics of the indians , before the great change in habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into south <name> .
( <unk> .
azara has even doubted whether the pampas indians ever used bows .
[ several similar agate arrow-heads have since been dug up at <unk> , and two were given to me , on the occasion of my visit there , by the <unk>  <unk> .

<name> 8 , 1833 .
i hired a gaucho to accompany me on my ride to buenos ayres , though with some difficulty , as the father of one man was afraid to let him go , and another who seemed willing , was described to me as so fearful that i was afraid to take him , for i was told that even if he saw an ostrich at a distance , he would mistake it for an indian , and would fly like the wind away .
the distance to buenos ayres is about four hundred miles , and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited country .
we started early in the morning ; ascending a few hundred feet from the basin of green turf on which bahia <name> stands , we entered on a wide desolate plain .
it consists of a crumbling <unk> rock , which , from the dry nature of the climate , supports only scattered tufts of withered grass , without a single bush or tree to break the monotonous uniformity .
the weather was fine , but the atmosphere remarkably hazy ; i thought the appearance <unk> a <name> , but the gauchos said it was owing to the plain , at some great distance in the interior , being on fire .
after a long gallop , having changed horses twice , we reached the rio sauce : it is a deep , rapid , little stream , not above twenty-five feet wide .
the second posta on the road to buenos ayres stands on its banks , a little above there is a ford for horses , where the water does not reach to the horses ' belly ; but from that point , in its course to the sea , it is quite impassable , and hence makes a most useful barrier against the indians .
insignificant as this stream is , the jesuit falconer , whose information is generally so very correct , figures it as a considerable river , rising at the foot of the cordillera .
with respect to its source , i do not doubt that this is the case ; for the gauchos assured me , that in the middle of the dry summer this stream , at the same time with the colorado , has periodical floods , which can only originate in the snow melting on the andes .
it is extremely improbable that a stream so small as the sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the continent ; and indeed , if it were the residue of a large river , its waters , as in other ascertained cases , would be saline .
during the <name> we must look to the springs round the <name> ventana as the source of its pure and limpid stream .
i suspect the plains of patagonia , like those of australia , are traversed by many <unk> , which only perform their proper parts at certain periods .
probably this is the case with the water which flows into the head of port <name> , and likewise with the rio <unk> , on the banks of which masses of highly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the survey .
as it was early in the afternoon when we arrived , we took fresh horses and a soldier for a guide , and started for the <name> de la ventana .
this mountain is visible from the anchorage at bahia <name> ; and captain fitz <name> <unk> its height to be <unk> feet  an altitude very remarkable on this eastern side of the continent .
i am not aware that any foreigner , previous to my visit , had ascended this mountain ; and indeed very few of the soldiers at bahia <name> knew anything about it .
hence we heard of beds of coal , of gold and silver , of caves , and of forests , all of which inflamed my curiosity , only to disappoint it .
the distance from the posta was about six leagues , over a level plain of the same character as before .
the ride was , however , interesting , as the mountain began to show its true form .
when we reached the foot of the main ridge , we had much difficulty in finding any water , and we thought we should have been obliged to have passed the night without any .
at last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain , for at the distance even of a few hundred yards , the <unk> were buried and entirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus .
i do not think nature ever made a more solitary , desolate pile of rock ;  it well deserves its name of <unk> , or separated .
the mountain is steep , extremely rugged , and broken , and so entirely destitute of trees , and even bushes , that we actually could not make a <unk> to stretch out our meat over the fire of <unk> .
( <unk> .
i call these <unk> for the want of a more correct name .
i believe it is a species of <unk> . )
the strange aspect of this mountain is contrasted by the <unk> plain , which not only <unk> against its steep sides , but likewise separates the parallel ranges .
the uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to the view ;  the whitish grey of the quartz rock , and the light brown of the withered grass of the plain , being <unk> by any brighter tint .
from custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and bold mountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments .
here nature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is changed into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity .
under these circumstances i was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any pebbles could be found .
on the shores of bahia <name> , and near the settlement , there were some of quartz , which certainly must have come from this source : the distance is forty-five miles .
the dew , which in the early part of the night wetted the <unk> under which we slept , was in the morning frozen .
the plain , though appearing horizontal , had insensibly sloped up to a height of between 800 and 900 feet above the sea .
in the morning ( 9th of <name> ) the guide told me to ascend the nearest ridge , which he thought would lead me to the four peaks that crown the summit .
the climbing up such rough rocks was very fatiguing ; the sides were so indented , that what was gained in one five minutes was often lost in the next .
at last , when i reached the ridge , my disappointment was extreme in finding a precipitous valley as deep as the plain , which cut the chain <unk> in two , and separated me from the four points .
this valley is very narrow , but flat-bottomed , and it forms a fine <unk> for the indians , as it connects the plains on the northern and southern sides of the range .
having descended , and while crossing it , i saw two horses grazing : i immediately hid myself in the long grass , and began to reconnoitre ; but as i could see no signs of indians i proceeded cautiously on my second ascent .
it was late in the day , and this part of the mountain , like the other , was steep and rugged .
i was on the top of the second peak by two o'clock , but got there with extreme difficulty ; every twenty yards i had the cramp in the upper part of both thighs , so that i was afraid i should not have been able to have got down again .
it was also necessary to return by another road , as it was out of the question to pass over the <unk> .
i was therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks .
their altitude was but little greater , and every purpose of geology had been answered ; so that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion .
i presume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of muscular action , from that of hard riding to that of still harder climbing .
it is a lesson worth remembering , as in some cases it might cause much difficulty .
i have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock , and with it a little glossy clay-slate is associated .
at the height of a few hundred feet above the plain , patches of conglomerate adhered in several places to the solid rock .
they resembled in hardness , and in the nature of the cement , the masses which may be seen daily forming on some coasts .
i do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner aggregated , at a period when the great calcareous formation was depositing beneath the surrounding sea .
we may believe that the jagged and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves of an open ocean .
i was , on the whole , disappointed with this ascent .
even the view was insignificant ;  a plain like the sea , but without its beautiful colour and defined outline .
the scene , however , was novel , and a little danger , like salt to meat , gave it a relish .
that the danger was very little was certain , for my two companions made a good fire  a thing which is never done when it is suspected that indians are near .
i reached the place of our bivouac by sunset , and drinking much <unk> , and smoking several <unk> , soon made up my bed for the night .
the wind was very strong and cold , but i never slept more comfortably .
<name> 10 , 1833 .
in the morning , having fairly <unk> before the <name> , we arrived by the middle of the day at the sauce posta .
on the road we saw great <name> of deer , and near the mountain a guanaco .
the plain , which <unk> against the <name> , is traversed by some curious <unk> , of which one was about twenty feet wide , and at least thirty deep ; we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we could find a pass .
we stayed the night at the posta , the conversation , as was generally the case , being about the indians .
the <name> ventana was formerly a great place of resort ; and three or four years ago there was much fighting there .
my guide had been present when many indians were killed : the women escaped to the top of the ridge , and fought most desperately with great stones ; many thus saving themselves .
<name> 11 , 1833 .
proceeded to the third posta in company with the lieutenant who commanded it .
the distance is called fifteen leagues ; but it is only <unk> , and is generally <unk> .
the road was uninteresting , over a dry grassy plain ; and on our left hand at a greater or less distance there were some low hills ; a continuation of which we crossed close to the posta .
before our arrival we met a large herd of cattle and horses , guarded by fifteen soldiers ; but we were told many had been lost .
it is very difficult to drive animals across the plains ; for if in the night a puma , or even a fox , approaches , nothing can prevent the horses <unk> in every direction ; and a storm <name> have the same effect .
a short time since , an officer left buenos ayres with five hundred horses , and when he arrived at the army he had under twenty .
soon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust , that a party of horsemen were coming towards us ; when far distant my companions knew them to be indians , by their long hair streaming behind their backs .
the indians generally have a <unk> round their heads , but never any covering ; and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces , <unk> to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance .
they turned out to be a party of <unk> friendly tribe , going to a <name> for salt .
the indians eat much salt , their children sucking it like sugar .
this habit is very different from that of the spanish gauchos , who , leading the same kind of life , eat scarcely any : according to mungo park , it is people who live on vegetable food who have an <unk> <name> for salt .
( <unk> .
" travels in africa " <name> 233 . )
the indians gave us <unk> nods as they passed at full gallop , driving before them a troop of horses , and followed by a train of lanky dogs .
<name> 12 and 13 , 1833 .
i stayed at this posta two days , waiting for a troop of soldiers , which general rosas had the kindness to send to inform me would shortly travel to buenos ayres ; and he advised me to take the opportunity of the escort .
in the morning we rode to some neighbouring hills to view the country , and to examine the geology .
after dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a trial of skill with the bolas .
two spears were stuck in the ground twenty-five yards apart , but they were struck and entangled only once in four or five times .
the balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards , but with little certainty .
this , however , does not apply to a man on horseback ; for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the arm , it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance of eighty yards .
as a proof of their force , i may mention , that at the falkland islands , when the spaniards murdered some of their own countrymen and all the englishmen , a young friendly spaniard was running away , when a great tall man , by name <name> , came at full gallop after him , shouting to him to stop , and saying that he only wanted to speak to him .
just as the spaniard was on the point of reaching the boat , <name> threw the balls : they struck him on the legs with such a jerk , as to throw him down and to render him for some time insensible .
the man , after <name> had had his talk , was allowed to escape .
he told us that his legs were marked by great <unk> , where the thong had wound round , as if he had been flogged with a whip .
in the middle of the day two men arrived , who brought a parcel from the next posta to be forwarded to the general : so that besides these two , our party consisted this evening of my guide and self , the lieutenant , and his four soldiers .
the latter were strange beings ; the first a fine young negro ; the second half indian and negro ; and the two others <unk> ; namely , an old chilian miner , the colour of mahogany , and another partly a mulatto ; but two such mongrels , with such detestable expressions , i never saw before .
at night , when they were sitting round the fire , and playing at cards , i retired to view such a <unk> <name> scene .
they were seated under a low <name> , so that i could look down upon them ; around the party were lying dogs , arms , remnants of deer and ostriches ; and their long spears were stuck in the turf .
farther in the dark background their horses were tied up , ready for any sudden danger .
if the stillness of the desolate plain was broken by one of the dogs barking , a soldier , leaving the fire , would place his head close to the ground , and thus slowly scan the horizon .
even if the noisy <unk> uttered its scream , there would be a pause in the conversation , and every head , for a moment , a little inclined .
what a life of misery these men appear to us to lead !
they were at least ten leagues from the sauce posta , and since the murder committed by the indians , twenty from another .
the indians are supposed to have made their attack in the middle of the night ; for very early in the morning after the murder , they were luckily seen approaching this posta .
the whole party here , however , escaped , together with the troop of horses ; each one taking a line for himself , and driving with him as many animals as he was able to manage .
the little hovel , built of <unk> , in which they slept , neither kept out the wind nor rain ; indeed in the latter case the only effect the roof had , was to condense it into larger drops .
they had nothing to eat excepting what they could catch , such as ostriches , deer , <unk> , etc. , and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small plant , somewhat resembling an <unk> .
the sole luxury which these men enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars , and sucking <unk> .
i used to think that the carrion vultures , man's constant attendants on these dreary plains , while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs , seemed by their very <name> to say , " ah !
when the indians come we shall have a feast . "
( plate 25 .
<unk> pots and <unk> . )
in the morning we all sallied forth to hunt , and although we had not much success , there were some animated <unk> .
soon after starting the party separated , and so arranged their plans , that at a certain time of the day ( in guessing which they show much skill ) they should all meet from different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground , and thus drive together the wild animals .
one day i went out hunting at bahia <name> , but the men there merely rode in a crescent , each being about a quarter of a mile apart from the other .
a fine male ostrich being turned by the <unk> riders , tried to escape on one side .
the gauchos pursued at a reckless pace , twisting their horses about with the most admirable command , and each man whirling the balls round his head .
at length the foremost threw them , revolving through the air : in an instant the ostrich rolled over and over , its legs fairly lashed together by the thong .
the plains abound with three kinds of partridge , two of which are as large as hen pheasants .
( <unk> .
two species of <unk> and <unk> elegans of a. d'orbigny , which can only be called a partridge with regard to its habits . )
their destroyer , a small and pretty fox , was also singularly numerous ; in the course of the day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty .
they were generally near their <unk> , but the dogs killed one .
when we returned to the posta , we found two of the party returned who had been hunting by themselves .
they had killed a puma , and had found an ostrich 's nest with twenty-seven eggs in it .
each of these is said to equal in weight eleven hens ' eggs ; so that we obtained from this one nest as much food as 297 hens ' eggs would have given .
<name> 14 , 1833 .
as the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to return , and we should together make a party of five , and all armed , i determined not to wait for the expected troops .
my host , the lieutenant , pressed me much to stop .
as he had been very obliging  not only providing me with food , but lending me his private horses  i wanted to make him some <unk> .
i asked my guide whether i might do so , but he told me certainly not ; that the only answer i should receive probably would be , " we have meat for the dogs in our country , and therefore do not grudge it to a <name> . "
it must not be supposed that the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the acceptance of payment : it was only the high sense of hospitality , which every traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout these provinces .
after galloping some leagues , we came to a low swampy country , which extends for nearly eighty miles northward , as far as the <name> tapalguen .
in some parts there were fine damp plains , covered with grass , while others had a soft , black , and peaty soil .
there were also many extensive but shallow lakes , and large beds of reeds .
the country on the whole resembled the better parts of the <unk> fens .
at night we had some difficulty in finding , amidst the swamps , a dry place for our bivouac .
<name> 15 , 1833 .
rose very early in the morning , and shortly after passed the posta where the indians had murdered the five soldiers .
the officer had eighteen <unk> wounds in his body .
by the middle of the day , after a hard gallop , we reached the fifth posta : on account of some difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night .
as this point was the most exposed on the whole line , twenty-one soldiers were stationed here ; at sunset they returned from hunting , bringing with them seven deer , three ostriches , and many <unk> and partridges .
when riding through the country , it is a common practice to set fire to the plain ; and hence at night , as on this occasion , the horizon was illuminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations .
this is done partly for the sake of puzzling any stray indians , but chiefly for improving the pasture .
in grassy plains unoccupied by the larger <unk> quadrupeds , it seems necessary to remove the superfluous vegetation by fire , so as to render the new year 's growth serviceable .
the <unk> at this place did not boast even of a roof , but merely consisted of a ring of <unk> , to break the force of the wind .
it was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake , swarming with wild fowl , among which the <unk> swan was conspicuous .
the kind of <unk> which appears as if mounted on stilts ( <unk> <unk> ) , is here common in flocks of considerable size .
it has been <unk> accused of <unk> ; when wading about in shallow water , which is its favourite resort , its gait is far from awkward .
these birds in a flock utter a noise , that singularly resembles the cry of a pack of small dogs in full <name> : waking in the night , i have more than once been for a moment startled at the distant sound .
the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) is another bird which often disturbs the stillness of the night .
in appearance and habits it resembles in many respects our <unk> ; its wings , however , are armed with sharp spurs , like those on the legs of the common cock .
as our <unk> takes its name from the sound of its voice , so does the <unk> .
while riding over the grassy plains , one is constantly pursued by these birds , which appear to hate mankind , and i am sure deserve to be hated for their <unk> , <unk> , harsh screams .
to the sportsman they are most annoying , by telling every other bird and animal of his approach : to the traveller in the country they may possibly , as <unk> says , do good , by warning him of the midnight robber .
during the breeding season , they attempt , like our <unk> , by <unk> to be wounded , to draw away from their nests dogs and other enemies .
the eggs of this bird are esteemed a great delicacy .
<name> 16 , 1833 .
to the seventh posta at the foot of the <name> tapalguen .
the country was quite level , with a coarse herbage and a soft peaty soil .
the hovel was here remarkably neat , the posts and rafters being made of about a dozen dry <unk> bound together with thongs of hide ; and by the support of these <unk> columns , the roof and sides were thatched with reeds .
we were here told a fact , which i would not have credited , if i had not had partly <unk> proof of it ; namely , that , during the previous night , hail as large as small apples , and extremely hard , had fallen with such violence as to kill the greater number of the wild animals .
one of the men had already found thirteen deer ( cervus campestris ) lying dead , and i saw their fresh hides ; another of the party , a few minutes after my arrival , brought in seven more .
now i well know , that one man without dogs could hardly have killed seven deer in a week .
the men believed they had seen about fifteen dead ostriches ( part of one of which we had for dinner ) ; and they said that several were running about evidently blind in one eye .
<name> of smaller birds , as ducks , hawks , and partridges , were killed .
i saw one of the latter with a black <name> on its back , as if it had been struck with a <unk> .
a fence of <unk> round the hovel was nearly broken down , and my <unk> , putting his head out to see what was the matter , received a severe cut , and now wore a bandage .
the storm was said to have been of limited extent : we certainly saw from our last night 's bivouac a dense cloud and lightning in this direction .
it is marvellous how such strong animals as deer could thus have been killed ; but i have no doubt , from the evidence i have given , that the story is not in the least exaggerated .
i am glad , however , to have its <unk> supported by the jesuit <unk> , who , speaking of a country much to the northward , says , hail fell of an enormous size and killed vast <name> of cattle ( <unk> .
" history of the <unk> " volume 2 <name> 6 .
) : the indians hence called the place <unk> , meaning " the little white things . "
dr. <unk> , also , informs me that he witnessed in 1831 in <name> a <unk> , which killed <name> of large birds and much injured the cattle .
these <unk> were flat , and one was ten inches in circumference , and another weighed two ounces .
they ploughed up a <unk> like <unk> , and passed through <unk> , making round holes , but not cracking them .
having finished our dinner of <unk> meat , we crossed the <name> tapalguen ; a low range of hills , a few hundred feet in height , which commences at cape <unk> .
the rock in this part is pure quartz ; farther eastward i understand it is granitic .
the hills are of a remarkable form ; they consist of flat patches of table-land , surrounded by low perpendicular cliffs , like the <unk> of a sedimentary deposit .
the hill which i ascended was very small , not above a couple of hundred yards in diameter ; but i saw others larger .
one which goes by the name of the " corral , " is said to be two or three miles in diameter , and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs between thirty and forty feet high , excepting at one spot , where the entrance lies .
falconer gives a curious account of the indians driving troops of wild horses into it , and then by guarding the entrance keeping them secure .
( <unk> .
<unk> " patagonia " <name> 70 . )
i have never heard of any other instance of table-land in a formation of quartz , and which , in the hill i examined , had neither cleavage nor stratification .
i was told that the rock of the " corral " was white , and would strike fire .
we did not reach the posta on the rio tapalguen till after it was dark .
at supper , from something which was said , i was suddenly struck with horror at thinking that i was eating one of the favourite dishes of the country , namely , a half formed calf , long before its proper time of birth .
it turned out to be puma ; the meat is very white , and remarkably like <unk> in taste .
dr. shaw was laughed at for stating that " the flesh of the lion is in great esteem , having no small affinity with <unk> , both in colour , taste , and flavour . "
such certainly is the case with the puma .
the gauchos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar is good eating , but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent .
<name> 17 , 1833 .
we followed the course of the rio tapalguen , through a very fertile country , to the ninth posta .
tapalguen itself , or the town of tapalguen , if it may be so called , consists of a perfectly level plain , studded over , as far as the eye can reach , with the <unk> , or <unk> huts of the indians .
the families of the friendly indians , who were fighting on the side of rosas , resided here .
we met and passed many young indian women , riding by two or three together on the same horse : they , as well as many of the young men , were strikingly handsome ,  their fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health .
besides the <unk> , there were three <unk> ; one inhabited by the commandant , and the two others by spaniards with small shops .
we were here able to buy some biscuit .
i had now been several days without tasting anything besides meat : i did not at all dislike this new <unk> ; but i felt as if it would only have agreed with me with hard exercise .
i have heard that patients in england , when desired to confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet , even with the <name> of life before their eyes , have hardly been able to endure it .
yet the gaucho in the pampas , for months together , touches nothing but beef .
but they eat , i observe , a very large proportion of fat , which is of a less <unk> nature ; and they particularly dislike dry meat , such as that of the agouti .
dr. richardson , also , has remarked , " that when people have fed for a long time solely upon <name> animal food , the <name> for fat becomes so insatiable , that they can consume a large quantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea " ( <unk> .
" fauna <unk> " volume 1 <name> 35 .
) : this appears to me a curious physiological fact .
it is , perhaps , from their meat <unk> that the gauchos , like other carnivorous animals , can abstain long from food .
i was told that at <unk> some troops voluntarily pursued a party of indians for three days , without eating or drinking .
we saw in the shops many articles , such as <unk> , belts , and <unk> , woven by the indian women .
the patterns were very pretty , and the colours brilliant ; the workmanship of the <unk> was so good that an english merchant at buenos ayres maintained they must have been manufactured in england , till he found the tassels had been fastened by split sinew .
<name> 18 , 1833 .
we had a very long ride this day .
at the twelfth posta , which is seven leagues south of the rio salado , we came to the first estancia with cattle and white women .
afterwards we had to ride for many miles through a country flooded with water above our <unk> knees .
by crossing the stirrups , and riding <unk> with our legs bent up , we contrived to keep tolerably dry .
it was nearly dark when we arrived at the salado ; the stream was deep , and about forty yards wide ; in summer , however , its bed becomes almost dry , and the little remaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea .
we slept at one of the great <unk> of general rosas .
it was fortified , and of such an extent , that arriving in the dark i thought it was a town and fortress .
in the morning we saw immense herds of cattle , the general here having seventy-four square leagues of land .
formerly nearly three hundred men were employed about this estate , and they defied all the attacks of the indians .
<name> 19 , 1833 .
passed the <unk> <name> <name> .
this is a nice scattered little town , with many gardens , full of peach and quince trees .
the plain here looked like that around buenos ayres ; the turf being short and bright green , with beds of clover and thistles , and with bizcacha holes .
i was very much struck with the marked change in the aspect of the country after having crossed the salado .
from a coarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure .
i at first attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil , but the inhabitants assured me that here , as well as in banda oriental , where there is as great a difference between the country around <name> video and the <unk> <unk> of colonia , the whole was to be attributed to the <unk> and grazing of the cattle .
exactly the same fact has been observed in the prairies of north <name> , where coarse grass , between five and six feet high , when grazed by cattle , changes into common pasture land .
( <unk> .
see mr. <unk> 's " account of the prairies " in " silliman 's north american journal " volume 1 <name> 117 . )
i am not botanist enough to say whether the change here is owing to the introduction of new species , to the altered growth of the same , or to a difference in their proportional <name> .
azara has also observed with astonishment this change : he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of plants not occurring in the neighbourhood , on the borders of any track that leads to a <unk> hovel .
in another part he says , " ces <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> la <name> de <unk> <name> <unk> , et <name> <unk> des routes pour <unk> leurs <unk> , dont on <unk> des <unk> dans ces <unk> . "
( 6/8 .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 373 . )
does this not partly explain the circumstance ?
we thus have lines of richly manured land serving as channels of communication across wide districts .
( plate 26 .
giant thistle of pampas . )
( plate 27 .
<unk> <unk> or cardoon . )
near the <unk> we find the southern limit of two european plants , now become extraordinarily common .
the <unk> in great profusion covers the <unk> in the neighbourhood of buenos ayres , <name> video , and other towns .
but the cardoon ( <unk> <unk> ) has a far wider range : it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the cordillera , across the continent .
( <unk> .
m. a. d'orbigny volume 1 <name> <unk> , says that the cardoon and <unk> are both found wild .
dr. hooker " botanical magazine " volume 40 <name> <unk> , has described a variety of the <unk> from this part of south <name> under the name of <unk> .
he states that botanists are now generally agreed that the cardoon and the <unk> are varieties of one plant .
i may add , that an intelligent farmer assured me that he had observed in a deserted garden some <unk> changing into the common cardoon .
dr. hooker believes that head 's vivid description of the thistle of the pampas applies to the cardoon , but this is a mistake .
captain head referred to the plant which i have mentioned a few lines lower down under the title of giant thistle .
whether it is a true thistle , i do not know ; but it is quite different from the cardoon ; and more like a thistle properly so called . )
i saw it in unfrequented spots in chile , entre rios , and banda oriental .
in the latter country alone , very many ( probably several hundred ) square miles are covered by one mass of these prickly plants , and are impenetrable by man or beast .
over the undulating plains , where these great beds occur , nothing else can now live .
before their introduction , however , the surface must have supported , as in other parts , a rank herbage .
i doubt whether any case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over the aborigines .
as i have already said , i nowhere saw the cardoon south of the salado ; but it is probable that in proportion as that country becomes inhabited , the cardoon <name> extend its limits .
the case is different with the giant thistle ( with variegated leaves ) of the pampas , for i met with it in the valley of the sauce .
according to the principles so well laid down by mr. lyell , few countries have undergone more remarkable changes , since the year <unk> , when the first <unk> of la plata landed with seventy-two horses .
the countless herds of horses , cattle , and sheep , not only have altered the whole aspect of the vegetation , but they have almost banished the guanaco , deer , and ostrich .
numberless other changes must likewise have taken place ; the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the <unk> ; packs of wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the <unk> streams ; and the common cat , altered into a large and fierce animal , inhabits <name> hills .
as m. d'orbigny has remarked , the increase in <name> of the <unk> , since the introduction of the domestic animals , must have been infinitely great ; and we have given reasons for believing that they have extended their southern range .
no doubt many plants , besides the cardoon and <unk> , are naturalised ; thus the islands near the mouth of the parana are thickly clothed with peach and orange trees , springing from seeds carried there by the waters of the river .
while changing horses at the <unk> several people questioned us much about the army ,  i never saw anything like the enthusiasm for rosas , and for the success of the " most just of all wars , because against barbarians . "
this expression , it must be confessed , is very natural , for till lately , neither man , woman , nor horse was safe from the attacks of the indians .
we had a long day 's ride over the same <name> green plain , abounding with various flocks , and with here and there a solitary estancia , and its one <unk> tree .
in the evening it rained heavily : on arriving at a <unk> we were told by the owner that if we had not a regular passport we must pass on , for there were so many robbers he would trust no one .
when he read , however , my passport , which began with " el <unk> <name> <name> , " his respect and civility were as unbounded as his suspicions had been before .
what a naturalist might be , neither he nor his countrymen , i suspect , had any idea ; but probably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause .
<name> 20 , 1833 .
we arrived by the middle of the day at buenos ayres .
the outskirts of the city looked quite pretty , with the <unk> hedges , and groves of <name> , peach and <name> trees , all just throwing out their fresh green leaves .
i rode to the house of mr. <unk> , an english merchant , to whose kindness and hospitality , during my stay in the country , i was greatly indebted .
the city of buenos ayres is large ; and i should think one of the most regular in the world .
( <unk> .
it is said to contain 60,000 inhabitants .
<name> video , the second town of importance on the banks of the plata , has 15,000 . )
every street is at right angles to the one it crosses , and the parallel ones being equidistant , the houses are collected into solid squares of equal dimensions , which are called <unk> .
on the other hand , the houses themselves are hollow squares ; all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard .
they are generally only one story high , with flat roofs , which are fitted with seats , and are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer .
in the centre of the town is the plaza , where the public offices , fortress , cathedral , etc. , stand .
here also , the old viceroys , before the revolution , had their palaces .
the general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable architectural beauty , although none individually can boast of any .
the great corral , where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply food to this <unk> population , is one of the spectacles best worth seeing .
the strength of the horse as compared to that of the bullock is quite astonishing : a man on horseback having thrown his lazo round the horns of a beast , can drag it anywhere he chooses .
the animal ploughing up the ground with outstretched legs , in vain efforts to resist the force , generally dashes at full speed to one side ; but the horse , immediately turning to receive the shock , stands so firmly that the bullock is almost thrown down , and it is surprising that their necks are not broken .
the struggle is not , however , one of fair strength ; the horse 's girth being matched against the bullock 's extended neck .
in a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse , if caught with the lazo , just behind the ears .
when the bullock has been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered , the <unk> with great caution cuts the <unk> .
then is given the death bellow ; a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any i know .
i have often distinguished it from a long distance , and have always known that the struggle was then drawing to a close .
the whole sight is horrible and revolting : the ground is almost made of bones ; and the horses and riders are drenched with gore .

buenos ayres to st. fé .
<name> 27 , 1833 .
in the evening i set out on an excursion to st. fé , which is situated nearly three hundred english miles from buenos ayres , on the banks of the parana .
the roads in the neighbourhood of the city , after the rainy weather , were extraordinarily bad .
i should never have thought it possible for a bullock <unk> to have crawled along : as it was , they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour , and a man was kept ahead , to survey the best line for making the attempt .
the bullocks were terribly jaded : it is a great mistake to suppose that with improved roads , and an accelerated rate of travelling , the sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion .
we passed a train of <unk> and a troop of beasts on their road to mendoza .
the distance is about <unk> geographical miles , and the journey is generally performed in fifty days .
these <unk> are very long , narrow , and thatched with reeds ; they have only two wheels , the diameter of which in some cases is as much as ten feet .
each is drawn by six bullocks , which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long : this is suspended from within the roof ; for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is kept ; and for the intermediate pair , a point projects at right angles from the middle of the long one .
the whole apparatus looked like some implement of war .
<name> 28 , 1833 .
we passed the small town of luxan , where there is a wooden bridge over the river  a most unusual convenience in this country .
we passed also <unk> .
the plains appeared level , but were not so in fact ; for in various places the horizon was distant .
the <unk> are here wide apart ; for there is little good pasture , owing to the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover , or of the great thistle .
the latter , well known from the animated description given by sir f. head , were at this time of the year two-thirds grown ; in some parts they were as high as the horse 's back , but in others they had not yet sprung up , and the ground was bare and <name> as on a <unk> .
the clumps were of the most brilliant green , and they made a pleasing <unk> of broken forest land .
when the thistles are full grown , the great beds are impenetrable , except by a few tracks , as intricate as those in a labyrinth .
these are only known to the robbers , who at this season inhabit them , and <name> forth at night to <name> and cut throats with impunity .
upon asking at a house whether robbers were numerous , i was answered , " the thistles are not up yet ; "  the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious .
there is little interest in passing over these tracts , for they are inhabited by few animals or birds , excepting the bizcacha and its friend the little owl .
the bizcacha is well known to form a prominent feature in the zoology of the pampas .
( <unk> .
the bizcacha ( <unk> <unk> ) somewhat resembles a large rabbit , but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail ; it has , however , only three toes behind , like the agouti .
during the last three or four years the skins of these animals have been sent to england for the sake of the fur . )
it is found as far south as the rio negro , in latitude 41 degrees , but not beyond .
it can not , like the agouti , subsist on the gravelly and desert plains of patagonia , but prefers a <unk> or <name> soil , which produces a different and more abundant vegetation .
near mendoza , at the foot of the cordillera , it occurs in close neighbourhood with the allied alpine species .
it is a very curious circumstance in its geographical distribution , that it has never been seen , fortunately for the inhabitants of banda oriental , to the eastward of the river uruguay : yet in this province there are plains which appear admirably adapted to its habits .
the uruguay has formed an insuperable obstacle to its migration : although the broader barrier of the parana has been passed , and the bizcacha is common in entre rios , the province between these two great rivers .
near buenos ayres these animals are exceedingly common .
their most favourite resort appears to be those parts of the plain which during one-half of the year are covered with giant thistles , to the exclusion of other plants .
the gauchos affirm that it lives on roots ; which , from the great strength of its gnawing teeth , and the kind of places frequented by it , seems probable .
in the evening the <unk> come out in <name> , and quietly sit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches .
at such times they are very tame , and a man on horseback passing by seems only to present an object for their grave contemplation .
they run very awkwardly , and when running out of danger , from their elevated tails and short front legs , much resemble great rats .
their flesh , when cooked , is very white and good , but it is seldom used .
the bizcacha has one very singular habit ; namely , dragging every hard object to the mouth of its burrow : around each group of holes many bones of cattle , stones , <unk> , hard lumps of earth , dry <name> , etc. , are collected into an irregular heap , which frequently amounts to as much as a wheelbarrow would contain .
i was <unk> informed that a gentleman , when riding on a dark night , dropped his watch ; he returned in the morning , and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha hole on the line of road , as he expected , he soon found it .
this habit of picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its habitation must cost much trouble .
for what purpose it is done , i am quite unable to form even the most remote conjecture : it can not be for defence , because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the burrow , which enters the ground at a very small inclination .
no doubt there must exist some good reason ; but the inhabitants of the country are quite ignorant of it .
the only fact which i know analogous to it , is the habit of that extraordinary australian bird , the <unk> <unk> , which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing in , and which collects near the spot land and sea-shells , bones , and the feathers of birds , especially brightly coloured ones .
mr. gould , who has described these facts , informs me , that the natives , when they lose any hard object , search the playing passages , and he has known a <unk> thus recovered .
the little owl ( <unk> <unk> ) , which has been so often mentioned , on the plains of buenos ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the bizcacha ; but in banda oriental it is its own workman .
during the open day , but more especially in the evening , these birds may be seen in every direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their burrows .
if disturbed they either enter the hole , or , uttering a shrill harsh cry , move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short distance , and then turning round , steadily gaze at their pursuer .
occasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting .
i found in the stomachs of two which i opened the remains of mice , and i one day saw a small snake killed and carried away .
it is said that snakes are their common prey during the daytime .
i may here mention , as showing on what various kinds of food owls subsist , that a species killed among the islets of the chonos archipelago had its stomach full of good-sized crabs .
in <name> there is a fishing genus of owls , which likewise catches crabs .
( <unk> .

in the evening we crossed the rio <unk> on a simple raft made of barrels lashed together , and slept at the <unk> on the other side .
i this day paid <unk> for thirty-one leagues ; and although the sun was glaring hot i was but little fatigued .
when captain head talks of riding fifty leagues a day , i do not imagine the distance is equal to 150 english miles .
at all events , the thirty-one leagues was only 76 miles in a straight line , and in an open country i should think four additional miles for <unk> would be a sufficient allowance .
<name> 29 and 30 , 1833 .
( plate 30 .
parana river . )
we continued to ride over plains of the same character .
at san <name> i first saw the <name> river of the parana .
at the foot of the <name> on which the town stands , some large vessels were at anchor .
before arriving at <unk> , we crossed the <unk> , a stream of fine clear running water , but too saline to drink .
<unk> is a large town built on a dead level plain , which forms a <name> about sixty feet high over the parana .
the river here is very broad , with many islands , which are low and wooded , as is also the opposite shore .
the view would resemble that of a great lake , if it were not for the <unk> islets , which alone give the idea of running water .
the cliffs are the most picturesque part ; sometimes they are absolutely perpendicular , and of a red colour ; at other times in large broken masses , covered with <unk> and <unk> .
the real grandeur , however , of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how important a means of communication and commerce it forms between one nation and another ; to what a distance it travels , and from how vast a territory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your feet .
for many leagues north and south of san <name> and <unk> , the country is really level .
scarcely anything which travellers have written about its extreme flatness can be considered as exaggeration .
yet i could never find a spot where , by slowly turning round , objects were not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others ; and this manifestly proves inequality in the plain .
at sea , a person 's eye being six feet above the surface of the water , his horizon is two miles and four-fifths distant .
in like manner , the more level the plain , the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow limits ; and this , in my opinion , entirely destroys that grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed .

toxodon <unk> .
( found at <unk> . ) )
october 1 , 1833 .
we started by moonlight and arrived at the rio <unk> by sunrise .
this river is also called the <unk> , and it deserves the name , for the water is brackish .
i stayed here the greater part of the day , searching for fossil bones .
besides a perfect tooth of the toxodon , and many scattered bones , i found two immense skeletons near each other , projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular <name> of the parana .
they were , however , so completely decayed , that i could only bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth ; but these are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a mastodon , probably to the same species with that which formerly must have inhabited the cordillera in upper peru in such great <name> .
the men who took me in the canoe said they had long known of these skeletons , and had often wondered how they had got there : the necessity of a theory being felt , they came to the conclusion that , like the bizcacha , the mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal !
in the evening we rode another stage , and crossed the <unk> , another brackish stream , bearing the <unk> of the <unk> of the pampas .
october 2 , 1833 .
we passed through <unk> , which , from the luxuriance of its gardens , was one of the prettiest villages i saw .
from this point to st. fé the road is not very safe .
the western side of the parana northward ceases to be inhabited ; and hence the indians sometimes come down thus far , and <unk> travellers .
the nature of the country also favours this , for instead of a grassy plain , there is an open woodland , composed of low prickly <unk> .
we passed some houses that had been ransacked and since deserted ; we saw also a spectacle , which my guides viewed with high satisfaction ; it was the skeleton of an indian with the dried skin hanging on the bones , suspended to the branch of a tree .
in the morning we arrived at st. fé .
i was surprised to observe how great a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of latitude between this place and buenos ayres had caused .
this was evident from the dress and complexion of the men  from the increased size of the <unk>  the number of new <unk> and other plants  and especially from the birds .
in the course of an hour i remarked half-a-dozen birds , which i had never seen at buenos ayres .
considering that there is no natural boundary between the two places , and that the character of the country is nearly similar , the difference was much greater than i should have expected .
october 3 and 4 , 1833 .
i was confined for these two days to my bed by a headache .
a good-natured old woman , who attended me , wished me to try many odd remedies .
a common practice is , to bind an <unk> or a bit of black plaster to each <name> : and a still more general plan is , to split a bean into halves , <unk> them , and place one on each <name> , where they <name> easily adhere .
it is not thought proper ever to remove the beans or plaster , but to allow them to drop off , and sometimes , if a man , with patches on his head , is asked , what is the matter ?
he <name> answer , " i had a headache the day before yesterday . "
many of the remedies used by the people of the country are ludicrously strange , but too disgusting to be mentioned .
one of the least nasty is to kill and cut open two puppies and bind them on each side of a broken limb .
little hairless dogs are in great request to sleep at the feet of invalids .
st. fé is a quiet little town , and is kept clean and in good order .
the governor , <unk> , was a common soldier at the time of the revolution ; but has now been seventeen years in power .
this stability of government is owing to his tyrannical habits ; for tyranny seems as yet better adapted to these countries than <unk> .
the governor 's favourite occupation is hunting indians : a short time since he slaughtered forty-eight , and sold the children at the rate of three or four pounds apiece .
october 5 , 1833 .
we crossed the parana to st. fé bajada , a town on the opposite shore .
the passage took some hours , as the river here consisted of a labyrinth of small streams , separated by low wooded islands .
i had a letter of introduction to an old <unk> spaniard , who treated me with the most uncommon hospitality .
the bajada is the capital of entre rios .
in 1825 the town contained <unk> inhabitants , and the province <unk> ; yet , few as the inhabitants are , no province has suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions .
they boast here of representatives , ministers , a standing army , and governors : so it is no wonder that they have their revolutions .
at some future day this must be one of the richest countries of la plata .
the soil is varied and productive ; and its almost insular form gives it two grand lines of communication by the rivers parana and uruguay .
i was delayed here five days , and employed myself in examining the geology of the surrounding country , which was very interesting .
we here see at the bottom of the cliffs , beds containing sharks ' teeth and sea-shells of extinct species , passing above into an indurated marl , and from that into the red <unk> earth of the pampas , with its calcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds .
this vertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water , gradually <unk> on , and at last converted into the bed of a muddy estuary , into which floating carcasses were swept .
at punta gorda , in banda oriental , i found an alternation of the <unk> estuary deposit , with a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells ; and this shows either a change in the former currents , or more probably an oscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary .
until lately , my reasons for considering the <unk> formation to be an estuary deposit were , its general appearance , its position at the mouth of the existing great river the plata , and the presence of so many bones of terrestrial quadrupeds : but now professor ehrenberg has had the kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth , taken from low down in the deposit , close to the skeletons of the mastodon , and he finds in it many infusoria , partly salt-water and partly fresh-water forms , with the latter rather <unk> ; and therefore , as he remarks , the water must have been brackish .
m. a. d'orbigny found on the banks of the parana , at the height of a hundred feet , great beds of an estuary shell , now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea ; and i found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the uruguay ; this shows that just before the pampas was slowly elevated into dry land , the water covering it was brackish .
below buenos ayres there are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species , which also proves that the period of elevation of the pampas was within the recent period .
in the <unk> deposit at the bajada i found the <unk> armour of a gigantic <unk> animal , the inside of which , when the earth was removed , was like a great <unk> ; i found also teeth of the toxodon and mastodon , and one tooth of a horse , in the same stained and decayed state .
this latter tooth greatly interested me , and i took scrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded contemporaneously with the other remains ; for i was not then aware that amongst the fossils from bahia <name> there was a horse 's tooth hidden in the <unk> : nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of horses are common in north <name> .
( <unk> .
i need hardly state here that there is good evidence against any horse living in <name> at the time of <name> . )
mr. lyell has lately brought from the united states a tooth of a horse ; and it is an interesting fact , that professor <name> could find in no species , either fossil or recent , a slight but peculiar curvature <unk> it , until he thought of comparing it with my specimen found here : he has named this american horse equus <unk> .
certainly it is a marvellous fact in the history of the mammalia , that in south <name> a native horse should have lived and disappeared , to be succeeded in after ages by the countless herds descended from the few introduced with the spanish colonists !

cuvier " <unk> fossils " tome 1 <name> 158 .
) , and of a <unk> <unk> , discovered by mm .
lund and <unk> in the caves of brazil , are highly interesting facts with respect to the geographical distribution of animals .
at the present time , if we divide <name> , not by the isthmus of panama , but by the southern part of mexico in latitude 20 degrees , where the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of species , by affecting the climate , and by forming , with the exception of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast , a broad barrier ; we shall then have the two zoological provinces of north and south <name> strongly contrasted with each other .
( <unk> .
this is the geographical division followed by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and richardson .
the section from <name> <name> to <unk> , given by humboldt in the " <unk> .
essay on kingdom of n. spain " <name> show how immense a barrier the mexican table-land forms .
dr. richardson , in his admirable " report on the zoology of n. <name> " read before the british association 1836 <name> 157 , talking of the identification of a mexican animal with the <unk> <unk> , says , " we do not know with what propriety , but if correct , it is , if not a solitary instance , at least very nearly so , of a rodent animal being common to north and south <name> . " )
some few species alone have passed the barrier , and may be considered as wanderers from the south , such as the puma , opossum , <unk> , and <unk> .
south <name> is characterised by possessing many peculiar <unk> , a family of monkeys , the <unk> , <unk> , tapir , <unk> , and , especially , several genera of edentata , the order which includes the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
north <name> , on the other hand , is characterised ( putting on one side a few wandering species ) by numerous peculiar <unk> , and by four genera ( the ox , sheep , goat , and antelope ) of <unk> ruminants , of which great division south <name> is not known to possess a single species .
formerly , but within the period when most of the now existing shells were living , north <name> possessed , besides <unk> ruminants , the elephant , mastodon , horse , and three genera of edentata , namely , the megatherium , <unk> , and mylodon .
within nearly this same period ( as proved by the shells at bahia <name> ) south <name> possessed , as we have just seen , a mastodon , horse , <unk> <unk> , and the same three genera ( as well as several others ) of the edentata .
hence it is evident that north and south <name> , in having within a late geological period these several genera in common , were much more closely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than they now are .
the more i reflect on this case , the more interesting it appears : i know of no other instance where we can almost <name> the period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two <unk> zoological provinces .
the geologist , who is fully impressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the <unk> crust within late periods , <name> not fear to speculate on the recent elevation of the mexican platform , or , more probably , on the recent <unk> of land in the west indian archipelago , as the cause of the present zoological separation of north and south <name> .
the south american character of the west indian mammals seems to indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern continent , and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence .
( <unk> .
see dr. richardson 's " report " <name> 157 ; also " <unk> " 1837 <name> 253 .
cuvier says the <unk> is found in the larger <unk> , but this is doubtful .
m. gervais states that the <unk> <unk> is found there .
it is certain that the west indies possess some mammifers peculiar to themselves .

when <name> , and especially north <name> , possessed its elephants , <unk> , horse , and <unk> ruminants , it was much more closely related in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of europe and <name> than it now is .
as the remains of these genera are found on both sides of <unk> 's straits and on the plains of siberia , we are led to look to the north-western side of north <name> as the former point of communication between the old and so-called new world .
( <unk> .
see the admirable appendix by dr. buckland to beechey 's " voyage " ; also the writings of chamisso in kotzebue 's " voyage . " )
and as so many species , both living and extinct , of these same genera inhabit and have inhabited the old world , it seems most probable that the north american elephants , <unk> , horse , and <unk> ruminants migrated , on land since submerged near <unk> 's straits , from siberia into north <name> , and thence , on land since submerged in the west indies , into south <name> , where for a time they mingled with the forms characteristic of that southern continent , and have since become extinct .
while travelling through the country , i received several vivid descriptions of the effects of a late great drought ; and the account of this may throw some light on the cases where vast <name> of animals of all kinds have been embedded together .
the period included between the years 1827 and 1830 is called the " gran <unk> , " or the great drought .
during this time so little rain fell , that the vegetation , even to the thistles , failed ; the <name> were dried up , and the whole country assumed the appearance of a <name> <unk> .
this was especially the case in the northern part of the province of buenos ayres and the southern part of st. fé .
very great <name> of birds , wild animals , cattle , and horses perished from the want of food and water .
a man told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well , which he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water ; and that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued .
( 7/8 .
in captain <name> 's " surveying voyage " volume 2 <name> 274 , there is a curious account of the effects of a drought on the elephants , at <unk> ( west coast of africa ) .
" a number of these animals had some time since entered the town , in a body , to possess themselves of the wells , not being able to procure any water in the country .
the inhabitants mustered , when a desperate conflict ensued , which terminated in the ultimate discomfiture of the invaders , but not until they had killed one man , and wounded several others . "
the town is said to have a population of nearly three thousand !
dr. <unk> informs me , that during a great drought in <name> the wild animals entered the tents of some troops at <unk> , and that a hare drank out of a vessel held by the adjutant of the regiment . )
the lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of buenos ayres alone , was taken at one million head .
a proprietor at san <name> had previously to these years 20,000 cattle ; at the end not one remained .
san <name> is situated in the middle of the finest country ; and even now abounds again with animals ; yet during the latter part of the " gran <unk> , " live cattle were brought in vessels for the consumption of the inhabitants .
the animals roamed from their <unk> , and , wandering far southward , were mingled together in such multitudes , that a government commission was sent from buenos ayres to settle the disputes of the owners .
sir <unk> parish informed me of another and very curious source of dispute ; the ground being so long dry , such quantities of dust were blown about , that in this open country the landmarks became obliterated , and people could not tell the limits of their estates .
i was informed by an <unk> that the cattle in herds of thousands rushed into the parana , and being exhausted by hunger they were unable to crawl up the muddy banks , and thus were drowned .
the arm of the river which runs by san <name> was so full of putrid carcasses , that the master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable .
without doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the river : their bodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream ; and many in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the plata .
all the small rivers became highly saline , and this caused the death of vast <name> in particular spots ; for when an animal drinks of such water it does not recover .
azara describes the fury of the wild horses on a similar occasion , rushing into the marshes , those which arrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which followed .
( <unk> .
" travels " volume 1 <name> 374 . )
he adds that more than once he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a thousand wild horses thus destroyed .
i noticed that the smaller streams in the pampas were paved with a breccia of bones , but this probably is the effect of a gradual increase , rather than of the destruction at any one period .
subsequently to the drought of 1827 to 1832 , a very rainy season followed which caused great floods .
hence it is almost certain that some thousands of the skeletons were buried by the deposits of the very next year .
what would be the opinion of a geologist , viewing such an enormous collection of bones , of all kinds of animals and of all ages , thus embedded in one thick earthy mass ?
would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of the land , rather than to the common order of things ?
( <unk> .
these <unk> to a certain degree seem to be almost periodical ; i was told the dates of several others , and the intervals were about fifteen years . )
october 12 , 1833 .
i had intended to push my excursion farther , but not being quite well , i was compelled to return by a <unk> , or <unk> vessel of about a hundred tons ' burden , which was bound to buenos ayres .
as the weather was not fair , we moored early in the day to a branch of a tree on one of the islands .
the parana is full of islands , which undergo a constant round of decay and <unk> .
in the memory of the master several large ones had disappeared , and others again had been formed and protected by vegetation .
they are composed of muddy sand , without even the smallest pebble , and were then about four feet above the level of the river ; but during the periodical floods they are <unk> .
they all present one character ; numerous willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of creeping plants , thus forming a thick jungle .
these thickets afford a retreat for <unk> and <unk> .
the fear of the latter animal quite destroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods .
this evening i had not proceeded a hundred yards , before , finding <unk> signs of the recent presence of the tiger , i was obliged to come back .
on every island there were tracks ; and as on the former excursion " el <unk> de los <unk> " had been the subject of conversation , so in this was " el <unk> <name> <unk> . "
the wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be the favourite haunts of the jaguar ; but south of the plata , i was told that they frequented the reeds bordering lakes : wherever they are , they seem to require water .
their common prey is the capybara , so that it is generally said , where <unk> are numerous there is little danger from the jaguar .
falconer states that near the southern side of the mouth of the plata there are many <unk> , and that they chiefly live on fish ; this account i have heard repeated .
on the parana they have killed many <unk> , and have even entered vessels at night .
there is a man now living in the bajada , who , coming up from below when it was dark , was seized on the deck ; he escaped , however , with the loss of the use of one arm .
when the floods drive these animals from the islands , they are most dangerous .
i was told that a few years since a very large one found its way into a church at st. fé : two <unk> entering one after the other were killed , and a third , who came to see what was the matter , escaped with difficulty .
the beast was destroyed by being shot from a corner of the building which was <unk> .
they commit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses .
it is said that they kill their prey by breaking their necks .
if driven from the carcass , they seldom return to it .
the gauchos say that the jaguar , when wandering about at night , is much tormented by the foxes yelping as they follow him .
this is a curious coincidence with the fact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying , in a similarly <unk> manner , the east indian tiger .
the jaguar is a noisy animal , roaring much by night , and especially before bad weather .
one day , when hunting on the banks of the uruguay , i was shown certain trees , to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose , as it is said , of sharpening their claws .
i saw three well-known trees ; in front , the bark was worn smooth , as if by the breast of the animal , and on each side there were deep scratches , or rather grooves , extending in an oblique line , nearly a yard in length .
the scars were of different ages .
a common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the neighbourhood is to examine these trees .
i imagine this habit of the jaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the common cat , as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it <unk> the leg of a chair ; and i have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in england having been thus much injured .
some such habit must also be common to the puma , for on the bare hard soil of patagonia i have frequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made them .
the object of this practice is , i believe , to tear off the ragged points of their claws , and not , as the gauchos think , to sharpen them .
the jaguar is killed , without much difficulty , by the aid of dogs baying and driving him up a tree , where he is despatched with bullets .
owing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings .
our only amusement was catching fish for our dinner : there were several kinds , and all good eating .
a fish called the " <unk> " ( a <unk> ) is remarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by hook and line , and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is beneath the water .
this same fish has the power of firmly catching hold of any object , such as the blade of an oar or the <unk> , with the strong spine both of its <unk> and dorsal fin .
in the evening the weather was quite tropical , the thermometer standing at 79 degrees .
<name> of <unk> were hovering about , and the <unk> were very troublesome .
i exposed my hand for five minutes , and it was soon black with them ; i do not suppose there could have been less than fifty , all busy sucking .
october 15 , 1833 .
( plate 34 .
head of <unk> . )
( plate 35 .
<unk> nigra , or <unk> . )
we got under way and passed punta gorda , where there is a colony of tame indians from the province of <unk> .
we sailed rapidly down the current , but before sunset , from a silly fear of bad weather , we <unk> in a narrow arm of the river .
i took the boat and rowed some distance up this creek .
it was very narrow , winding , and deep ; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high , formed by trees <unk> with creepers , gave to the canal a singularly gloomy appearance .
i here saw a very extraordinary bird , called the <unk> ( <unk> nigra ) .
it has short legs , web feet , extremely <unk> wings , and is of about the size of a <unk> .
the beak is flattened laterally , that is , in a plane at right angles to that of a <unk> or duck .
it is as flat and elastic as an <name> <unk> , and the lower mandible , differently from every other bird , is an inch and a half longer than the upper .
in a lake near maldonado , from which the water had been nearly drained , and which , in consequence , swarmed with small fry , i saw several of these birds , generally in small flocks , flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake .
they kept their bills wide open , and the lower mandible half buried in the water .
thus skimming the surface , they ploughed it in their course : the water was quite smooth , and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock , each bird leaving its narrow wake on the <unk> surface .
in their flight they frequently twist about with extreme quickness , and <unk> manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough up small fish , which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their <unk> bills .
this fact i repeatedly saw , as , like swallows , they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before me .
occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild , irregular , and rapid ; they then uttered loud harsh cries .
when these birds are fishing , the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings , in keeping them dry , is very evident .
when thus employed , their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists represent <name> birds .
their tails are much used in steering their irregular course .
these birds are common far inland along the course of the rio parana ; it is said that they remain here during the whole year , and breed in the marshes .
during the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains , at some distance from the water .
being at anchor , as i have said , in one of the deep creeks between the islands of the parana , as the evening <name> to a close , one of these <unk> suddenly appeared .
the water was quite still , and many little fish were rising .
the bird continued for a long time to skim the surface , flying in its wild and irregular manner up and down the narrow canal , now dark with the growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees .
at <name> video , i observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the mud-banks at the head of the harbour , in the same manner as on the grassy plains near the parana ; and every evening they took flight seaward .
from these facts i suspect that the <unk> generally fishes by night , at which time many of the lower animals come most abundantly to the surface .
m. lesson states that he has seen these birds opening the shells of the <unk> buried in the <unk> on the coast of chile : from their weak bills , with the lower mandible so much projecting , their short legs and long wings , it is very improbable that this can be a general habit .
in our course down the parana , i observed only three other birds , whose habits are worth mentioning .
one is a small kingfisher ( <unk> americana ) ; it has a longer tail than the european species , and hence does not sit in so stiff and upright a position .
its flight also , instead of being direct and rapid , like the course of an arrow , is weak and undulatory , as among the <unk> birds .
it utters a low note , like the clicking together of two small stones .
a small green parrot ( <unk> <unk> ) , with a grey breast , appears to prefer the tall trees on the islands to any other situation for its <unk> .
a number of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of sticks .
these parrots always live in flocks , and commit great ravages on the <unk> .
i was told that near colonia <unk> were killed in the course of one year .
a bird with a forked tail , terminated by two long feathers ( <unk> <unk> ) , and named by the spaniards <unk> , is very common near buenos ayres : it commonly sits on a branch of the <unk> tree , near a house , and thence takes a short flight in pursuit of insects , and returns to the same spot .
when on the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a <unk> of the common swallow .
it has the power of turning very shortly in the air , and in so doing opens and shuts its tail , sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical direction , just like a pair of scissors .
october 16 , 1833 .
some leagues below <unk> , the western shore of the parana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs , which extend in a long line to below san <name> ; hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of a fresh-water river .
it is a great drawback to the scenery of the parana , that , from the soft nature of its banks , the water is very muddy .
the uruguay , flowing through a granitic country , is much clearer ; and where the two channels unite at the head of the plata , the waters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red colours .
in the evening , the wind being not quite fair , as usual we immediately moored , and the next day , as it blew rather freshly , though with a favouring current , the master was much too indolent to think of starting .
at bajada , he was described to me as " <unk> <unk> <unk> "  a man always miserable to get on ; but certainly he bore all delays with admirable resignation .
he was an old spaniard , and had been many years in this country .
he professed a great liking to the english , but stoutly maintained that the battle of <unk> was merely won by the spanish captains having been all bought over ; and that the only really gallant action on either side was performed by the spanish admiral .
it struck me as rather characteristic , that this man should prefer his countrymen being thought the worst of traitors , rather than <unk> or cowardly .
october 18 and 19 , 1833 .
we continued slowly to sail down the <name> stream : the current helped us but little .
we met , during our descent , very few vessels .
one of the best gifts of nature , in so grand a channel of communication , seems here wilfully thrown away  a river in which ships might navigate from a temperate country , as surprisingly abundant in certain productions as destitute of others , to another possessing a tropical climate , and a soil which , according to the best of judges , m. <unk> , is perhaps <unk> in fertility in any part of the world .
how different would have been the aspect of this river if english colonists had by good fortune first sailed up the plata !
what <name> towns would now have occupied its shores !
till the death of <unk> , the dictator of paraguay , these two countries must remain distinct , as if placed on opposite sides of the globe .
and when the old <unk> tyrant is gone to his long account , paraguay <name> be torn by revolutions , violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm .
that country <name> have to learn , like every other south american state , that a republic can not succeed till it contains a certain body of men imbued with the principles of justice and honour .
october 20 , 1833 .
being arrived at the mouth of the parana , and as i was very anxious to reach buenos ayres , i went on shore at las <unk> , with the intention of riding there .
upon landing , i found to my great surprise that i was to a certain degree a prisoner .
a violent revolution having broken out , all the ports were laid under an <unk> .
i could not return to my vessel , and as for going by land to the city , it was out of the question .
after a long conversation with the commandant , i obtained permission to go the next day to general <unk> , who commanded a division of the rebels on this side the capital .
in the morning i rode to the encampment .
the general , officers , and soldiers , all appeared , and i believe really were , great villains .
the general , the very evening before he left the city , voluntarily went to the governor , and with his hand to his heart , pledged his word of honour that he at least would remain faithful to the last .
the general told me that the city was in a state of close blockade , and that all he could do was to give me a passport to the commander-in-chief of the rebels at <unk> .
we had therefore to take a great sweep round the city , and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses .
my reception at the encampment was quite civil , but i was told it was impossible that i could be allowed to enter the city .
i was very anxious about this , as i anticipated the " beagle 's " departure from the rio plata earlier than it took place .
having mentioned , however , general rosas 's obliging kindness to me when at the colorado , magic itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this conversation .
i was instantly told that though they could not give me a passport , if i chose to leave my guide and horses , i might pass their sentinels .
i was too glad to accept of this , and an officer was sent with me to give directions that i should not be stopped at the bridge .
the road for the space of a league was quite deserted .
i met one party of soldiers , who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport : and at length i was not a little pleased to find myself within the city .
this revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances : but in a state which , in the course of nine months ( from february to october , 1820 ) , underwent fifteen changes in its government  each governor , according to the constitution , being elected for three years  it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts .
in this case , a party of men  who , being attached to rosas , were disgusted with the governor <unk>  to the number of seventy left the city , and with the cry of rosas the whole country took arms .
the city was then <unk> , no provisions , cattle or horses , were allowed to enter ; besides this , there was only a little <unk> , and a few men daily killed .
the outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of meat they would certainly be victorious .
general rosas could not have known of this rising ; but it appears to be quite <unk> with the plans of his party .
a year ago he was elected governor , but he refused it , unless the <unk> would also confer on him extraordinary powers .
this was refused , and since then his party have shown that no other governor can keep his place .
the warfare on both sides was <unk> protracted till it was possible to hear from rosas .
a note arrived a few days after i left buenos ayres , which stated that the general disapproved of peace having been broken , but that he thought the outside party had justice on their side .
on the bare reception of this the governor , ministers , and part of the military , to the number of some hundreds , fled from the city .
the rebels entered , elected a new governor , and were paid for their services to the number of <unk> men .
from these proceedings , it was clear that rosas ultimately would become the dictator : to the term king , the people in this , as in other republics , have a particular dislike .
since leaving south <name> , we have heard that rosas has been elected , with powers and for a time altogether opposed to the constitutional principles of the republic .

having been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city , i was glad to escape on board a packet bound for <name> video .
a town in a state of blockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence ; in this case moreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within .
the sentinels were the worst of all ; for , from their office and from having arms in their hands , they robbed with a degree of authority which other men could not imitate .
our passage was a very long and tedious one .
the plata looks like a <name> estuary on the map ; but is in truth a poor affair .
a wide expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty .
at one time of the day , the two shores , both of which are extremely low , could just be distinguished from the deck .
on arriving at <name> video i found that the " beagle " would not sail for some time , so i prepared for a short excursion in this part of banda oriental .
everything which i have said about the country near maldonado is applicable to <name> video ; but the land , with the one exception of the green mount , 450 feet high , from which it takes its name , is far more level .
very little of the undulating grassy plain is enclosed ; but near the town there are a few <unk> , covered with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
november 14 , 1833 .
we left <name> video in the afternoon .
i intended to proceed to colonia <name> <unk> , situated on the northern bank of the plata and opposite to buenos ayres , and thence , following up the uruguay , to the village of <name> on the rio negro ( one of the many rivers of this name in south <name> ) , and from this point to return direct to <name> video .
we slept at the house of my guide at <unk> .
in the morning we rose early , in the hopes of being able to ride a good distance ; but it was a vain attempt , for all the rivers were flooded .
we passed in boats the streams of <unk> , st. <name> , and san <unk> , and thus lost much time .
on a former excursion i crossed the <name> near its mouth , and i was surprised to observe how easily our horses , although not used to swim , passed over a width of at least six hundred yards .
on mentioning this at <name> video , i was told that a vessel containing some <unk> and their horses , being wrecked in the plata , one horse swam seven miles to the shore .
in the course of the day i was amused by the dexterity with which a gaucho forced a restive horse to swim a river .
he stripped off his clothes , and jumping on its back , rode into the water till it was out of its depth ; then slipping off over the <unk> , he caught hold of the tail , and as often as the horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its face .
as soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side , the man pulled himself on , and was firmly seated , bridle in hand , before the horse gained the bank .
a naked man on a naked horse is a fine spectacle ; i had no idea how well the two animals suited each other .
the tail of a horse is a very useful appendage ; i have passed a river in a boat with four people in it , which was <unk> across in the same way as the gaucho .
if a man and horse have to cross a broad river , the best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane , and help himself with the other arm .
we slept and stayed the following day at the post of <unk> .
in the evening the postman or <unk> arrived .
he was a day after his time , owing to the rio <unk> being flooded .
it would not , however , be of much consequence ; for , although he had passed through some of the principal towns in banda oriental , his luggage consisted of two letters !
the view from the house was pleasing ; an undulating green surface , with distant glimpses of the plata .
i find that i look at this province with very different eyes from what i did upon my first arrival .
i recollect i then thought it singularly level ; but now , after galloping over the pampas , my only surprise is , what could have induced me ever to have called it level .
the country is a series of undulations , in themselves perhaps not absolutely great , but , as compared to the plains of st. fé , real mountains .
from these inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets , and the turf is green and luxuriant .
november 17 , 1833 .
we crossed the <unk> , which was deep and rapid , and passing the village of <unk> , arrived at mid-day at colonia <name> <unk> .
the distance is twenty leagues , through a country covered with fine grass , but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants .
i was invited to sleep at colonia , and to accompany on the following day a gentleman to his estancia , where there were some limestone rocks .
the town is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at <name> video .
it is strongly fortified , but both fortifications and town suffered much in the brazilian war .
it is very ancient ; and the irregularity of the streets , and the surrounding groves of old orange and peach trees , gave it a pretty appearance .
the church is a curious ruin ; it was used as a <unk> , and was struck by lightning in one of the ten thousand <unk> of the rio plata .
two-thirds of the building were blown away to the very foundation ; and the rest stands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of lightning and gunpowder .
in the evening i wandered about the <unk> walls of the town .
it was the chief seat of the brazilian war  a war most injurious to this country , not so much in its immediate effects , as in being the origin of a multitude of generals and all other grades of officers .
more generals are numbered ( but not paid ) in the united provinces of la plata than in the united kingdom of great britain .
these gentlemen have learned to like power , and do not object to a little <unk> .
hence there are many always on the watch to create disturbance and to <unk> a government which as yet has never rested on any stable foundation .
i noticed , however , both here and in other places , a very general interest in the ensuing election for the president ; and this appears a good sign for the prosperity of this little country .
the inhabitants do not require much education in their representatives ; i heard some men discussing the merits of those for colonia ; and it was said that , " although they were not men of business , they could all sign their names : " with this they seemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied .
november 18 , 1833 .
rode with my host to his estancia , at the <unk> de san <name> .
in the evening we took a ride round the estate : it contained two square leagues and a half , and was situated in what is called a <unk> ; that is , one side was fronted by the plata , and the two others guarded by impassable <name> .
there was an excellent port for little vessels , and an abundance of small wood , which is valuable as supplying fuel to buenos ayres .
i was curious to know the value of so complete an estancia .
of cattle there were 3000 , and it would well support three or four times that number ; of mares 800 , together with 150 <unk> horses , and 600 sheep .
there was plenty of water and limestone , a rough house , excellent <unk> , and a peach orchard .
for all this he had been offered 2000 pounds <name> , and he only wanted 500 pounds <name> additional , and probably would sell it for less .
the chief trouble with an estancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot , in order to make them tame , and to count them .
this latter operation would be thought difficult , where there are ten or fifteen thousand head together .
it is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably divide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred .
each troop is recognised by a few peculiarly marked animals , and its number is known : so that , one being lost out of ten thousand , it is perceived by its absence from one of the <unk> .
during a <name> night the cattle all mingle together ; but the next morning the <unk> separate as before ; so that each animal must know its fellow out of ten thousand others .
on two occasions i met with in this province some oxen of a very curious breed , called <unk> or niata .
they appear externally to hold nearly the same relation to other cattle , which bull or <unk> dogs do to other dogs .
their forehead is very short and broad , with the nasal end turned up , and the upper lip much drawn back ; their lower jaws project beyond the upper , and have a corresponding upward curve ; hence their teeth are always exposed .
their nostrils are seated high up and are very open ; their eyes project outwards .
when walking they <name> their heads low , on a short neck ; and their hinder legs are rather longer compared with the front legs than is usual .
their bare teeth , their short heads , and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous <unk> air of defiance imaginable .
since my return , i have procured a skeleton head , through the kindness of my friend captain sulivan , r.n. , which is now deposited in the college of surgeons .
( <unk> .
mr. waterhouse has drawn up a detailed description of this head , which i <name> he <name> publish in some journal . )
<name> f. <unk> , of luxan , has kindly collected for me all the information which he could respecting this breed .
from his account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago , they were rare and kept as curiosities at buenos ayres .
the breed is universally believed to have originated amongst the indians southward of the plata ; and that it was with them the commonest kind .
even to this day , those reared in the provinces near the plata show their less civilised origin , in being fiercer than common cattle , and in the cow easily deserting her first calf , if visited too often or molested .
it is a singular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal one of the niata breed , <unk> , as i am informed by dr. falconer , that great extinct <unk> of <name> , the <unk> .
( <unk> .
a nearly similar abnormal , but i do not know whether hereditary , structure has been observed in the carp , and likewise in the crocodile of the ganges : " <unk> des anomalies " par m. isid .
geoffroy st. hilaire tome 1 <name> 244 . )
the breed is very true ; and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves .
a niata bull with a common cow , or the reverse cross , produces offspring having an intermediate character , but with the niata characters strongly displayed : according to <unk> <unk> , there is the clearest evidence , contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in analogous cases , that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when crossed with a common cow .
when the pasture is tolerably long , the niata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle ; but during the great <unk> , when so many animals perish , the niata breed is under a great disadvantage , and would be exterminated if not attended to ; for the common cattle , like horses , are able just to keep alive , by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds ; this the <unk> can not so well do , as their lips do not join , and hence they are found to perish before the common cattle .
this strikes me as a good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of life , on what circumstances , occurring only at long intervals , the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined .
november 19 , 1833 .
passing the valley of las <unk> , we slept at a house of a north american , who worked a <unk> on the <unk> de las <unk> .
in the morning we rode to a projecting headland on the banks of the river , called punta gorda .
on the way we tried to find a jaguar .
there were plenty of fresh tracks , and we visited the trees on which they are said to sharpen their claws ; but we did not succeed in disturbing one .
from this point the rio uruguay presented to our view a <name> volume of water .
from the clearness and rapidity of the stream , its appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the parana .
on the opposite coast , several branches from the latter river entered the uruguay .
as the sun was shining , the two colours of the waters could be seen quite distinct .
in the evening we proceeded on our road towards <name> on the rio negro .
at night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which we happened to arrive .
it was a very large estate , being ten leagues square , and the owner is one of the greatest <unk> in the country .
his nephew had charge of it , and with him there was a captain in the army , who the other day ran away from buenos ayres .
considering their station , their conversation was rather amusing .
they expressed , as was usual , unbounded astonishment at the globe being round , and could scarcely credit that a hole would , if deep enough , come out on the other side .
they had , however , heard of a country where there were six months of light and six of darkness , and where the inhabitants were very tall and thin !
they were curious about the price and condition of horses and cattle in england .
upon finding out we did not catch our animals with the lazo , they cried out , " ah , then , you use nothing but the bolas : " the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them .
the captain at last said , he had one question to ask me , which he should be very much obliged if i would answer with all truth .
i trembled to think how deeply scientific it would be : it was , " whether the ladies of buenos ayres were not the handsomest in the world . "
i replied , like a <unk> , " charmingly so . "
he added , " i have one other question : do ladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs ? "
i solemnly assured him that they did not .
they were absolutely delighted .
the captain exclaimed , " look there !
a man who has seen half the world says it is the case ; we always thought so , but now we know it . "
my excellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most hospitable reception ; the captain forced me to take his bed , and he would sleep on his <unk> .
november 21 , 1833 .
started at sunrise , and rode slowly during the whole day .
the geological nature of this part of the province was different from the rest , and closely resembled that of the pampas .
in consequence , there were immense beds of the thistle , as well as of the cardoon : the whole country , indeed , may be called one great bed of these plants .
the two sorts grow separate , each plant in company with its own kind .
the cardoon is as high as a horse 's back , but the pampas thistle is often higher than the crown of the rider 's head .
to leave the road for a yard is out of the question ; and the road itself is partly , and in some cases entirely , closed .
pasture , of course , there is none ; if cattle or horses once enter the bed , they are for the time completely lost .
hence it is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the year ; for when jaded enough to face the thistles , they rush among them , and are seen no more .
in these districts there are very few <unk> , and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys , where fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist .
as night came on before we arrived at our journey 's end , we slept at a miserable little hovel inhabited by the poorest people .
the extreme though rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess , considering their grade of life , was quite delightful .
november 22 , 1833 .
arrived at an estancia on the <unk> belonging to a very hospitable englishman , to whom i had a letter of introduction from my friend mr. <unk> .
i stayed here three days .
one morning i rode with my host to the <name> <name> <name> <unk> , about twenty miles up the rio negro .
nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse grass , which was as high as a horse 's belly ; yet there were square leagues without a single head of cattle .
the province of banda oriental , if well stocked , would support an astonishing number of animals , at present the annual export of hides from <name> video amounts to three hundred thousand ; and the home consumption , from waste , is very considerable .
an <unk> told me that he often had to send large herds of cattle a long journey to a <unk> establishment , and that the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned ; but that he could never persuade the gauchos to eat of them , and every evening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers !
the view of the rio negro from the <name> was more picturesque than any other which i saw in this province .
the river , broad , deep , and rapid , wound at the foot of a <name> precipitous <name> : a belt of wood followed its course , and the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the <unk> .
when in this neighbourhood , i several times heard of the <name> de las <unk> : a hill distant many miles to the northward .
the name signifies hill of beads .
i was assured that vast <name> of little round stones , of various colours , each with a small cylindrical hole , are found there .
formerly the indians used to collect them , for the purpose of making <unk> and bracelets  a taste , i may observe , which is common to all savage nations , as well as to the most polished .
i did not know what to understand from this story , but upon mentioning it at the cape of good <name> to dr. <name> smith , he told me that he recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of africa , about one hundred miles to the eastward of st. <name> 's river , some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from attrition , and mixed with gravel on the sea-beach .
each <name> was about five lines in diameter , and from an inch to an inch and a half in length .
many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to the other , perfectly cylindrical , and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine <unk> .
their colour was red or dull white .
the natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals .
i have mentioned these circumstances because , although no crystallised body is at present known to assume this form , it may lead some future traveller to investigate the real nature of such stones .
while staying at this estancia , i was amused with what i saw and heard of the <unk> of the country .
( <unk> .
m. a. d'orbigny has given nearly a similar account of these dogs , tome 1 <name> 175 . )
when riding , it is a common thing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs , at the distance of some miles from any house or man .
i often wondered how so firm a friendship had been established .
the method of education consists in separating the puppy , while very young , from the bitch , and in <unk> it to its future companions .
an <unk> is held three or four times a day for the little thing to suck , and a nest of wool is made for it in the <unk> ; at no time is it allowed to associate with other dogs , or with the children of the family .
the puppy is , moreover , generally castrated ; so that , when grown up , it can scarcely have any feelings in common with the rest of its kind .
from this education it has no wish to leave the flock , and just as another dog <name> defend its master , man , so <name> these the sheep .
it is amusing to observe , when approaching a flock , how the dog immediately advances barking , and the sheep all close in his rear , as if round the oldest ram .
these dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a certain hour in the evening .
their most troublesome fault , when young , is their <name> of playing with the sheep ; for in their sport they sometimes gallop their poor subjects most <unk> .
the <unk> comes to the house every day for some meat , and as soon as it is given him , he <unk> away as if ashamed of himself .
on these occasions the <unk> are very tyrannical , and the least of them <name> attack and pursue the stranger .
the minute , however , the latter has reached the flock , he turns round and begins to bark , and then all the <unk> take very quickly to their heels .
in a similar manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs <name> scarcely ever ( and i was told by some never ) venture to attack a flock guarded by even one of these faithful shepherds .
the whole account appears to me a curious instance of the <unk> of the affections in the dog ; and yet , whether wild or however educated , he has a feeling of respect or fear for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association .
for we can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the single one with its flock , except that they consider , from some confused notion , that the one thus associated gains power , as if in company with its own kind .
f. cuvier has observed that all animals that readily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their own society , and thus fulfil their instinct of association .
in the above case the <unk> ranks the sheep as its <unk> , and thus gains confidence ; and the wild dogs , though knowing that the individual sheep are not dogs , but are good to eat , yet partly consent to this view when seeing them in a flock with a <unk> at their head .
one evening a " <unk> " ( a <unk> of horses ) came for the purpose of <unk> some colts .
i <name> describe the preparatory steps , for i believe they have not been mentioned by other travellers .
a troop of wild young horses is driven into the corral , or large enclosure of stakes , and the door is shut .
we <name> suppose that one man alone has to catch and mount a horse , which as yet had never felt bridle or saddle .
i conceive , except by a gaucho , such a feat would be utterly impracticable .
the gaucho picks out a full-grown colt ; and as the beast rushes round the circus , he throws his lazo so as to catch both the front legs .
instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock , and whilst struggling on the ground , the gaucho , holding the lazo tight , makes a circle , so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the fetlock , and draws it close to the two front legs : he then <unk> the lazo , so that the three are bound together .
then sitting on the horse 's neck , he fixes a strong bridle , without a bit , to the lower jaw : this he does by passing a narrow thong through the <unk> at the end of the reins , and several times round both jaw and tongue .
the two front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern thong , fastened by a <unk> .
the lazo , which bound the three together , being then loosed , the horse rises with difficulty .
the gaucho , now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw , leads the horse outside the corral .
if a second man is present ( otherwise the trouble is much greater ) he holds the animal 's head , whilst the first puts on the <unk> and saddle , and <unk> the whole together .
during this operation , the horse , from dread and astonishment at thus being bound round the waist , throws himself over and over again on the ground , and , till beaten , is unwilling to rise .
at last , when the <unk> is finished , the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear , and is white with foam and sweat .
the man now prepares to mount by pressing heavily on the stirrup , so that the horse may not lose its balance ; and at the moment that he throws his leg over the <unk> back , he pulls the <unk> binding the front legs , and the beast is free .
some " <unk> " pull the knot while the animal is lying on the ground , and , standing over the saddle , allow him to rise beneath them .
the horse , wild with dread , gives a few most violent bounds , and then starts off at full gallop : when quite exhausted , the man , by <name> , brings him back to the corral , where , reeking hot and scarcely alive , the poor beast is let free .
those animals which <name> not gallop away , but obstinately throw themselves on the ground , are by far the most troublesome .
this process is tremendously severe , but in two or three trials the horse is tamed .
it is not , however , for some weeks that the animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring , for it must learn to associate the <name> of its rider with the feel of the rein , before the most powerful bridle can be of any service .
animals are so abundant in these countries , that humanity and self-interest are not closely united ; therefore i fear it is that the former is here scarcely known .
one day , riding in the pampas with a very respectable " <unk> , " my horse , being tired , <unk> behind .
the man often shouted to me to spur him .
when i remonstrated that it was a pity , for the horse was quite exhausted , he cried out , " why not ?  never mind  spur him  it is my horse . "
i had then some difficulty in making him comprehend that it was for the horse 's sake , and not on his account , that i did not choose to use my spurs .
he exclaimed , with a look of great surprise , " ah , <name> <name> , que <unk> ! "
it was clear that such an idea had never before entered his head .
the gauchos are well known to be perfect riders .
the idea of being thrown , let the horse do what it likes ; never enters their head .
their criterion of a good rider is , a man who can manage an <unk> colt , or who , if his horse falls , alights on his own feet , or can perform other such exploits .
i have heard of a man betting that he would throw his horse down twenty times , and that nineteen times he would not fall himself .
i recollect seeing a gaucho riding a very stubborn horse , which three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with great violence .
the man judged with uncommon coolness the proper moment for slipping off , not an instant before or after the right time ; and as soon as the horse got up , the man jumped on his back , and at last they started at a gallop .
the gaucho never appears to exert any muscular force .
i was one day watching a good rider , as we were galloping along at a rapid pace , and thought to myself , " surely if the horse starts , you appear so careless on your seat , you must fall . "
at this moment a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the horse 's nose : the young colt bounded on one side like a stag ; but as for the man , all that could be said was , that he started and took fright with his horse .
in chile and peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than in la plata , and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate nature of the country .
in chile a horse is not considered perfectly broken till he can be brought up standing , in the midst of his full speed , on any particular spot ,  for instance , on a cloak thrown on the ground : or , again , he <name> charge a wall , and rearing , scrape the surface with his hoofs .
i have seen an animal bounding with spirit , yet merely reined by a forefinger and thumb , taken at full gallop across a courtyard , and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda with great speed , but at so equal a distance , that the rider , with outstretched arm , all the while kept one finger rubbing the post .
then making a <unk> in the air , with the other arm outstretched in a like manner , he wheeled round , with astonishing force , in an opposite direction .
such a horse is well broken ; and although this at first may appear useless , it is far otherwise .
it is only carrying that which is daily necessary into perfection .
when a bullock is checked and caught by the lazo , it <name> sometimes gallop round and round in a circle , and the horse being alarmed at the great strain , if not well broken , <name> not readily turn like the pivot of a wheel .
in consequence many men have been killed ; for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man 's body , it <name> instantly , from the power of the two opposed animals , almost cut him in twain .
on the same principle the races are managed ; the course is only two or three hundred yards long , the wish being to have horses that can make a rapid dash .
the racehorses are trained not only to stand with their hoofs touching a line , but to draw all four feet together , so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action of the <unk> .
in chile i was told an anecdote , which i believe was true ; and it offers a good illustration of the use of a <unk> animal .
a respectable man riding one day met two others , one of whom was mounted on a horse , which he knew to have been stolen from himself .
he challenged them ; they answered him by drawing their sabres and giving <name> .
the man , on his good and fleet beast , kept just ahead : as he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it , and brought up his horse to a dead check .
the pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and ahead .
then instantly dashing on , right behind them , he buried his knife in the back of one , wounded the other , recovered his horse from the dying robber , and rode home .
for these feats of horsemanship two things are necessary : a most severe bit , like the <unk> , the power of which , though seldom used , the horse knows full well ; and large blunt spurs , that can be applied either as a mere touch , or as an instrument of extreme pain .
i conceive that with english spurs , the slightest touch of which <unk> the skin , it would be impossible to break in a horse after the south american fashion .
at an estancia near las <unk> large <name> of mares are weekly slaughtered for the sake of their hides , although worth only five paper dollars , or about half a crown apiece .
it seems at first strange that it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle ; but as it is thought ridiculous in this country ever to break in or ride a mare , they are of no value except for breeding .
the only thing for which i ever saw mares used , was to tread out wheat from the ear , for which purpose they were driven round a circular enclosure , where the <unk> were strewed .
the man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo .
standing at the distance of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral , he has laid a wager that he would catch by the legs every animal , without missing one , as it rushed past him .
there was another man who said he would enter the corral on foot , catch a mare , fasten her front legs together , drive her out , throw her down , kill , skin , and stake the hide for drying ( which latter is a tedious job ) ; and he engaged that he would perform this whole operation on twenty-two animals in one day .
or he would kill and take the skin off fifty in the same time .
this would have been a prodigious task , for it is considered a good day 's work to skin and stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals .
november 26 , 1833 .
i set out on my return in a direct line for <name> video .
having heard of some giant 's bones at a neighbouring farmhouse on the <unk> , a small stream entering the rio negro , i rode there accompanied by my host , and purchased for the value of <unk> the head of the toxodon .
( <unk> .
i must express my obligation to mr. <unk> , at whose house i was staying on the <unk> , and to mr. <unk> at buenos ayres , for without their assistance these valuable remains would never have reached england . )
when found it was quite perfect ; but the boys knocked out some of the teeth with stones , and then set up the head as a <name> to throw at .
by a most fortunate chance i found a perfect tooth , which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull , embedded by itself on the banks of the rio <unk> , at the distance of about 180 miles from this place .
i found remains of this extraordinary animal at two other places , so that it must formerly have been common .
i found here , also , some large portions of the armour of a gigantic <unk> animal , and part of the great head of a mylodon .
the bones of this head are so fresh , that they contain , according to the analysis by mr. t. reeks , seven per cent of animal matter ; and when placed in a spirit-lamp , they burn with a small flame .
the number of the remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental , must be extraordinarily great .
i believe a straight line drawn in any direction through the pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones .
besides those which i found during my short excursions , i heard of many others , and the origin of such names as " the stream of the animal , " " the hill of the giant , " is obvious .
at other times i heard of the marvellous property of certain rivers , which had the power of changing small bones into large ; or , as some maintained , the bones themselves grew .
as far as i am aware , not one of these animals perished , as was formerly supposed , in the marshes or muddy <unk> of the present land , but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the <unk> deposit in which they were originally embedded .
we may conclude that the whole area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic quadrupeds .
by the middle of the day , on the 28th , we arrived at <name> video , having been two days and a half on the road .
the country for the whole way was of a very uniform character , some parts being rather more <name> and hilly than near the plata .
not far from <name> video we passed through the village of las <unk> , so named from some large rounded masses of syenite .
its appearance was rather pretty .
in this country a few <unk> round a group of houses , and a site elevated a hundred feet above the general level , ought always to be called picturesque .
during the last six months i have had an opportunity of seeing a little of the character of the inhabitants of these provinces .
the gauchos , or countrymen , are very superior to those who reside in the towns .
the gaucho is invariably most obliging , polite , and hospitable : i did not meet with even one instance of rudeness or <unk> .
he is modest , both respecting himself and country , but at the same time a spirited , bold fellow .
on the other hand , many robberies are committed , and there is much bloodshed : the habit of constantly wearing the knife is the chief cause of the latter .
it is lamentable to hear how many lives are lost in trifling quarrels .
in fighting , each party tries to <name> the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes ; as is often attested by deep and <unk> scars .
robberies are a natural consequence of universal gambling , much drinking , and extreme indolence .
at <name> i asked two men why they did not work .
one gravely said the days were too long ; the other that he was too poor .
the number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of all industry .
moreover , there are so many <unk> ; and again , nothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on the increase ; so that half the month is lost from these two causes .
police and justice are quite inefficient .
if a man who is poor commits murder and is taken , he <name> be imprisoned , and perhaps even shot ; but if he is <name> and has friends , he may rely on it no very severe consequence <name> ensue .
it is curious that the most respectable inhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape : they seem to think that the individual sins against the government , and not against the people .
a traveller has no protection besides his firearms ; and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to more frequent robberies .
the character of the higher and more educated classes who reside in the towns , partakes , but perhaps in a lesser degree , of the good parts of the gaucho , but is , i fear , stained by many vices of which he is free .
<unk> , mockery of all religion , and the <unk> corruption , are far from uncommon .
nearly every public officer can be bribed .
the head man in the post-office sold forged government <unk> .
the governor and prime minister openly combined to plunder the state .
justice , where gold came into play , was hardly expected by any one .
i knew an englishman who went to the chief justice ( he told me that , not then understanding the ways of the place , he trembled as he entered the room ) , and said , " sir , i have come to offer you two hundred ( paper ) dollars ( value about five pounds <name> ) if you <name> arrest before a certain time a man who has cheated me .
i know it is against the law , but my lawyer ( naming him ) recommended me to take this step . "
the chief justice smiled acquiescence , thanked him , and the man before night was safe in prison .
with this entire want of principle in many of the leading men , with the country full of <unk> turbulent officers , the people yet <name> that a democratic form of government can succeed !
on first entering society in these countries , two or three features strike one as particularly remarkable .
the polite and dignified manners pervading every rank of life , the excellent taste displayed by the women in their dresses , and the equality amongst all ranks .
at the rio colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with general rosas .
a son of a <name> at bahia <name> gained his livelihood by making paper cigars , and he wished to accompany me , as guide or servant , to buenos ayres , but his father objected on the score of the danger alone .
many officers in the army can neither read nor write , yet all meet in society as equals .
in entre rios , the <unk> consisted of only six representatives .
one of them kept a common shop , and evidently was not degraded by the office .
all this is what would be expected in a new country ; nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by profession appears to an englishman something strange .
when speaking of these countries , the manner in which they have been brought up by their unnatural parent , spain , should always be borne in mind .
on the whole , perhaps , more credit is due for what has been done , than blame for that which may be deficient .
it is impossible to doubt but that the extreme <unk> of these countries must ultimately lead to good results .
the very general toleration of foreign religions , the regard paid to the means of education , the freedom of the press , the facilities offered to all foreigners , and especially , as i am bound to add , to every one professing the humblest pretensions to science , should be recollected with gratitude by those who have visited spanish south <name> .
december 6 , 1833 .
the " beagle " sailed from the rio plata , never again to enter its muddy stream .
our course was directed to port <name> , on the coast of patagonia .
before proceeding any farther , i <name> here put together a few observations made at sea .
several times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the plata , and at other times when off the shores of northern patagonia , we have been surrounded by insects .
one evening , when we were about ten miles from the bay of san blas , vast <name> of butterflies , in bands or flocks of countless myriads , extended as far as the eye could range .
even by the aid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free from butterflies .
the seamen cried out " it was snowing butterflies , " and such in fact was the appearance .
more species than one were present , but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to , but not identical with , the common english <unk> <unk> .
some moths and hymenoptera accompanied the butterflies ; and a fine beetle ( <unk> ) flew on board .
other instances are known of this beetle having been caught far out at sea ; and this is the more remarkable , as the greater number of the <unk> seldom or never take wing .
the day had been fine and calm , and the one previous to it equally so , with light and variable airs .
hence we can not suppose that the insects were blown off the land , but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight .
the great bands of the <unk> seem at first to afford an instance like those on record of the migrations of another butterfly , <name> <unk> ( <unk> .
lyell 's " principles of geology " volume 3 <name> 63 .
) ; but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct , and even less intelligible .
before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the north , and this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies and other insects to have perished .
on another occasion , when seventeen miles off cape <unk> , i had a net overboard to catch pelagic animals .
upon drawing it up , to my surprise i found a considerable number of beetles in it , and although in the open sea , they did not appear much injured by the salt water .
i lost some of the specimens , but those which i preserved belonged to the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( two species ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
at first i thought that these insects had been blown from the shore ; but upon reflecting that out of the eight species four were aquatic , and two others partly so in their habits , it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the sea by a small stream which drains a lake near cape <unk> .
on any supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects swimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of land .
there are several accounts of insects having been blown off the patagonian shore .
captain cook observed it , as did more lately captain king of the " adventure . "
the cause probably is due to the want of shelter , both of trees and hills , so that an insect on the wing with an <unk> breeze , would be very apt to be blown out to sea .
the most remarkable instance i have known of an insect being caught far from the land , was that of a large grasshopper ( <unk> ) , which flew on board , when the " beagle " was to windward of the cape de verd islands , and when the nearest point of land , not directly opposed to the trade-wind , was cape blanco on the coast of africa , 370 miles distant .
( <unk> .
the flies which frequently accompany a ship for some days on its passage from harbour to harbour , wandering from the vessel , are soon lost , and all disappear . )
on several occasions , when the " beagle " has been within the mouth of the plata , the rigging has been coated with the web of the gossamer spider .
one day ( november 1st , 1832 ) i paid particular attention to this subject .
the weather had been fine and clear , and in the morning the air was full of patches of the <unk> web , as on an autumnal day in england .
the ship was sixty miles distant from the land , in the direction of a steady though light breeze .
vast <name> of a small spider , about one-tenth of an inch in length , and of a dusky red colour , were attached to the webs .
there must have been , i should suppose , some thousands on the ship .
the little spider , when first coming in contact with the rigging , was always seated on a single thread , and not on the <unk> mass .
this latter seems merely to be produced by the <unk> of the single threads .
the spiders were all of one species , but of both sexes , together with young ones .
these latter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour .
i <name> not give the description of this spider , but merely state that it does not appear to me to be included in any of <unk> 's genera .
the little <unk> as soon as it arrived on board was very active , running about , sometimes letting itself fall , and then <unk> the same thread ; sometimes employing itself in making a small and very irregular <unk> in the corners between the ropes .
it could run with facility on the surface of water .
when disturbed it lifted up its front legs , in the attitude of attention .
on its first arrival it appeared very thirsty , and with exserted <unk> drank eagerly of drops of water ; this same circumstance has been observed by <unk> : may it not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a dry and rarefied atmosphere ?
its stock of web seemed inexhaustible .
while watching some that were suspended by a single thread , i several times observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of sight , in a horizontal line .
on another occasion ( 25th ) under similar circumstances , i repeatedly observed the same kind of small spider , either when placed or having crawled on some little eminence , elevate its abdomen , send forth a thread , and then sail away horizontally , but with a rapidity which was quite unaccountable .
i thought i could perceive that the spider , before performing the above preparatory steps , connected its legs together with the most delicate threads , but i am not sure whether this observation was correct .
one day , at st. fé , i had a better opportunity of observing some similar facts .
a spider which was about <unk> of an inch in length , and which in its general appearance resembled a <unk> ( therefore quite different from the gossamer ) , while standing on the summit of a post , darted forth four or five threads from its <unk> .
these , glittering in the <name> , might be compared to diverging rays of light ; they were not , however , straight , but in undulations like films of silk blown by the wind .
they were more than a yard in length , and diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices .
the spider then suddenly let go its hold of the post , and was quickly borne out of sight .
the day was hot and apparently quite calm ; yet under such circumstances , the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect a vane so delicate as the thread of a spider 's web .
if during a warm day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank , or over a level plain at a distant landmark , the effect of an ascending current of heated air is almost always evident : such upward currents , it has been remarked , are also shown by the ascent of <unk> , which <name> not rise in an indoors room .
hence i think there is not much difficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider 's <unk> , and afterwards of the spider itself ; the divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained , i believe by mr. <name> , by their similar electrical condition .
the circumstance of spiders of the same species , but of different sexes and ages , being found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the land , attached in vast <name> to the lines , renders it probable that the habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this tribe , as that of diving is of the <unk> .
we may then reject <unk> 's supposition , that the gossamer owes its origin indifferently to the young of several genera of spiders : although , as we have seen , the young of other spiders do possess the power of performing aerial voyages .
( <unk> .
mr. blackwall in his " researches in zoology " has many excellent observations on the habits of spiders . )
during our different passages south of the plata , i often towed astern a net made of bunting , and thus caught many curious animals .
of crustacea there were many strange and <unk> genera .
one , which in some respects is allied to the <unk> ( or those crabs which have their posterior legs placed almost on their backs , for the purpose of adhering to the under side of rocks ) , is very remarkable from the structure of its hind pair of legs .
the penultimate joint , instead of terminating in a simple claw , ends in three <unk> appendages of dissimilar lengths  the longest equalling that of the entire leg .
these claws are very thin , and are serrated with the finest teeth , directed backwards : their curved extremities are flattened , and on this part five most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner as the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish .
as the animal lives in the open sea , and probably wants a place of rest , i suppose this beautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of floating <name> animals .
in deep water , far from the land , the number of living creatures is extremely small : south of the latitude 35 degrees , i never succeeded in catching anything besides some <unk> , and a few species of minute <unk> crustacea .
in <unk> water , at the distance of a few miles from the coast , very many kinds of crustacea and some other animals are numerous , but only during the night .
between latitudes 56 and 57 degrees south of cape horn , the net was put astern several times ; it never , however , brought up anything besides a few of two extremely minute species of <unk> .
yet whales and seals , petrels and albatross , are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean .
it has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross , which lives far from the shore , can subsist ; i presume that , like the condor , it is able to fast long ; and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid whale lasts for a long time .
the central and intertropical parts of the atlantic swarm with <unk> , crustacea , and <unk> , and with their <unk> the flying-fish , and again with their <unk> the <unk> and <unk> ; i presume that the numerous lower pelagic animals feed on the infusoria , which are now known , from the researches of ehrenberg , to abound in the open ocean : but on what , in the clear blue water , do these infusoria subsist ?
while sailing a little south of the plata on one very dark night , the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle .
there was a fresh breeze , and every part of the surface , which during the day is seen as foam , now glowed with a pale light .
the vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus , and in her wake she was followed by a milky train .
as far as the eye reached , the crest of every wave was bright , and the sky above the horizon , from the reflected glare of these livid flames , was not so utterly obscure as over the vault of the heavens .
as we proceed farther southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent ; and off cape horn i do not recollect more than once having seen it so , and then it was far from being brilliant .
this circumstance probably has a close connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of the ocean .
after the elaborate paper by ehrenberg , on the <unk> of the sea , it is almost superfluous on my part to make any observations on the subject .
( <unk> .
an abstract is given in no .
4 of the " magazine of zoology and botany . " )
i may however add , that the same torn and irregular particles of gelatinous matter , described by ehrenberg , seem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the common cause of this phenomenon .
the particles were so minute as easily to pass through fine gauze ; yet many were distinctly visible by the naked eye .
the water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave out sparks , but a small portion in a <unk> scarcely ever was luminous .
ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain degree of irritability .
my observations , some of which were made directly after taking up the water , gave a different result .
i may also mention , that having used the net during one night , i allowed it to become partially dry , and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to employ it again , i found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when first taken out of the water .
it does not appear probable in this case that the particles could have remained so long alive .
on one occasion having kept a <unk> of the genus <unk> till it was dead , the water in which it was placed became luminous .
when the waves <unk> with bright green sparks , i believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea .
but there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals , when alive , are phosphorescent .
on two occasions i have observed the sea luminous at considerable depths beneath the surface .
near the mouth of the plata some circular and oval patches , from two to four yards in diameter , and with defined outlines , shone with a steady but pale light ; while the surrounding water only gave out a few sparks .
the appearance resembled the reflection of the moon , or some luminous body ; for the edges were sinuous from the undulations of the surface .
the ship , which <name> thirteen feet water , passed over , without disturbing these patches .
therefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together at a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel .
near <name> noronha the sea gave out light in flashes .
the appearance was very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish moving rapidly through a luminous fluid .
to this cause the sailors attributed it ; at the time , however , i entertained some doubts , on account of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes .
i have already remarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in cold countries ; and i have sometimes imagined that a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its production .
certainly i think the sea is most luminous after a few days of more calm weather than ordinary , during which time it has swarmed with various animals .
observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in an impure state , and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the fluid in contact with the atmosphere , i am inclined to consider that the <unk> is the result of the decomposition of the organic particles , by which process ( one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration ) the ocean becomes purified .
december 23 , 1833 .
we arrived at port <name> , situated in latitude 47 degrees , on the coast of patagonia .
the creek runs for about twenty miles inland , with an irregular width .
the " beagle " anchored a few miles within the entrance , in front of the ruins of an old spanish settlement .
the same evening i went on shore .
the first landing in any new country is very interesting , and especially when , as in this case , the whole aspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character .
at the height of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of porphyry a wide plain extends , which is truly characteristic of patagonia .
the surface is quite level , and is composed of well-rounded shingle mixed with a whitish earth .
here and there scattered tufts of brown wiry grass are supported , and still more rarely , some low thorny bushes .
the weather is dry and pleasant , and the fine blue sky is but seldom obscured .
when standing in the middle of one of these desert plains and looking towards the interior , the view is generally bounded by the escarpment of another plain , rather higher , but equally level and desolate ; and in every other direction the horizon is indistinct from the trembling <unk> which seems to rise from the heated surface .
in such a country the fate of the spanish settlement was soon decided ; the dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year , and the occasional hostile attacks of the wandering indians , compelled the colonists to desert their half-finished buildings .
the style , however , in which they were commenced shows the strong and liberal hand of spain in the old time .
the result of all the attempts to <unk> this side of <name> south of 41 degrees has been miserable .
port famine expresses by its name the lingering and extreme sufferings of several hundred wretched people , of whom one alone survived to relate their misfortunes .
at st. <name> 's bay , on the coast of patagonia , a small settlement was made ; but during one <name> the indians made an attack and massacred the whole party , excepting two men , who remained captives during many years .
at the rio negro i conversed with one of these men , now in extreme old age .
( plate 38 .
<unk> darwinii . )
the zoology of patagonia is as limited as its <name> .
( <unk> .
i found here a species of cactus , described by professor henslow , under the name of <unk> darwinii " magazine of zoology and botany " volume 1 <name> 466 , which was remarkable for the irritability of the stamens , when i inserted either a piece of stick or the end of my finger in the flower .
the segments of the <unk> also closed on the pistil , but more slowly than the stamens .
plants of this family , generally considered as tropical , occur in north <name> " <name> and <unk> travels " <name> 221 , in the same high latitude as here , namely , in both cases , in 47 degrees . )
on the arid plains a few black beetles ( <unk> ) might be seen slowly crawling about , and occasionally a lizard darted from side to side .
of birds we have three carrion hawks , and in the valleys a few finches and <unk> .
an ibis ( <unk> <unk>  a species said to be found in central africa ) is not uncommon on the most desert parts : in their stomachs i found grasshoppers , <unk> , small lizards , and even scorpions .
( <unk> .
these insects were not uncommon beneath stones .
i found one <unk> scorpion quietly devouring another . )
at one time of the year these birds go in flocks , at another in pairs , their cry is very loud and singular , like the neighing of the guanaco .
the guanaco , or wild <unk> , is the characteristic quadruped of the plains of patagonia ; it is the south american representative of the camel of the east .
it is an elegant animal in a state of nature , with a long slender neck and fine legs .
it is very common over the whole of the temperate parts of the continent , as far south as the islands near cape horn .
it generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to thirty in each ; but on the banks of the st. <name> we saw one herd which must have contained at least five hundred .
they are generally wild and extremely wary .
mr. stokes told me that he one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals which evidently had been frightened , and were running away at full speed , although their distance was so great that he could not distinguish them with his naked eye .
the sportsman frequently receives the first notice of their presence , by hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill neighing note of alarm .
if he then looks attentively , he <name> probably see the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill .
on approaching nearer , a few more squeals are given , and off they set at an apparently slow , but really quick canter , along some narrow beaten track to a neighbouring hill .
if , however , by chance he abruptly meets a single animal , or several together , they <name> generally stand motionless and intently gaze at him ; then perhaps move on a few yards , turn round , and look again .
what is the cause of this difference in their shyness ?
do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief enemy the puma ?
or does curiosity overcome their timidity ?
that they are curious is certain ; for if a person lies on the ground , and plays strange antics , such as throwing up his feet in the air , they <name> almost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him .
it was an artifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success , and it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be fired , which were all taken as parts of the performance .
on the mountains of <name> <name> fuego , i have more than once seen a guanaco , on being approached , not only <unk> and squeal , but prance and leap about in the most ridiculous manner , apparently in defiance as a challenge .
these animals are very easily domesticated , and i have seen some thus kept in northern patagonia near a house , though not under any restraint .
they are in this state very bold , and readily attack a man by striking him from behind with both knees .
it is asserted that the motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their females .
the wild guanacos , however , have no idea of defence ; even a single dog <name> secure one of these large animals , till the huntsman can come up .
in many of their habits they are like sheep in a flock .
thus when they see men approaching in several directions on horseback , they soon become bewildered , and know not which way to run .
this greatly <unk> the indian method of hunting , for they are thus easily driven to a central point , and are encompassed .
the guanacos readily take to the water : several times at port <unk> they were seen swimming from island to island .
<name> , in his voyage , says he saw them drinking salt water .
some of our officers likewise saw a herd apparently drinking the <unk> fluid from a <name> near cape blanco .
i imagine in several parts of the country , if they do not drink salt water , they drink none at all .
in the middle of the day they frequently roll in the dust , in <unk> hollows .
the males fight together ; two one day passed quite close to me , squealing and trying to bite each other ; and several were shot with their hides deeply scored .
herds sometimes appear to set out on exploring parties : at bahia <name> , where , within thirty miles of the coast , these animals are extremely <unk> , i one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty , which had come in a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek .
they then must have perceived that they were approaching the sea , for they had wheeled with the regularity of cavalry , and had returned back in as straight a line as they had advanced .
the guanacos have one singular habit , which is to me quite inexplicable ; namely , that on successive days they drop their <name> in the same defined heap .
i saw one of these heaps which was eight feet in diameter , and was composed of a large quantity .
this habit , according to m. a. d'orbigny , is common to all the species of the genus ; it is very useful to the peruvian indians , who use the <name> for fuel , and are thus saved the trouble of collecting it .
the guanacos appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die .
on the banks of the st. <name> , in certain circumscribed spaces , which were generally bushy and all near the river , the ground was actually white with bones .
on one such spot i counted between ten and twenty heads .
i particularly examined the bones ; they did not appear , as some scattered ones which i had seen , gnawed or broken , as if dragged together by beasts of prey .
the animals in most cases must have crawled , before dying , beneath and amongst the bushes .
mr. <unk> informs me that during a former voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks of the rio <unk> .
i do not at all understand the reason of this , but i may observe , that the wounded guanacos at the st. <name> invariably walked towards the river .
at st. jago in the cape de verd islands , i remember having seen in a ravine a retired corner covered with bones of the goat ; we at the time exclaimed that it was the <unk> of all the goats in the island .
i mention these trifling circumstances , because in certain cases they might explain the occurrence of a number of uninjured bones in a cave , or buried under alluvial accumulations ; and likewise the cause why certain animals are more commonly embedded than others in sedimentary deposits .
" none can reply  all seems eternal now .
the wilderness has a mysterious tongue , which teaches awful doubt . "

one day the yawl was sent under the command of mr. <unk> with three days ' provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour .
in the morning we searched for some <unk> mentioned in an old spanish chart .
we found one creek , at the head of which there was a trickling rill ( the first we had seen ) of brackish water .
here the tide compelled us to wait several hours ; and in the interval i walked some miles into the interior .
the plain as usual consisted of gravel , mingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance , but very different from it in nature .
from the softness of these materials it was worn into many <unk> .
there was not a tree , and , excepting the guanaco , which stood on the hilltop a watchful sentinel over its herd , scarcely an animal or a bird .
all was stillness and desolation .
yet in passing over these scenes , without one bright object near , an ill-defined but strong sense of pleasure is vividly excited .
one asked how many ages the plain had thus lasted , and how many more it was doomed thus to continue .
in the evening we sailed a few miles farther up , and then pitched the tents for the night .
by the middle of the next day the yawl was aground , and from the <unk> of the water could not proceed any higher .
the water being found partly fresh , mr. <unk> took the <unk> and went up two or three miles farther , where she also grounded , but in a fresh-water river .
the water was muddy , and though the stream was most insignificant in size , it would be difficult to account for its origin , except from the melting snow on the cordillera .
at the spot where we <unk> , we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep pinnacles of porphyry .
i do not think i ever saw a spot which appeared more secluded from the rest of the world than this <name> crevice in the wide plain .
the second day after our return to the anchorage , a party of officers and myself went to ransack an old indian grave , which i had found on the summit of a neighbouring hill .
two immense stones , each probably weighing at least a couple of tons , had been placed in front of a ledge of rock about six feet high .
at the bottom of the grave on the hard rock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep , which must have been brought up from the plain below .
above it a pavement of flat stones was placed , on which others were piled , so as to fill up the space between the ledge and the two great blocks .
to complete the grave , the indians had contrived to detach from the ledge a huge fragment , and to throw it over the pile so as to rest on the two blocks .
we undermined the grave on both sides , but could not find any relics , or even bones .
the latter probably had decayed long since ( in which case the grave must have been of extreme antiquity ) , for i found in another place some smaller heaps , beneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be distinguished as having belonged to a man .
falconer states , that where an indian dies he is buried , but that subsequently his bones are carefully taken up and carried , let the distance be ever so great , to be deposited near the sea-coast .
this custom , i think , may be accounted for by <unk> that , before the introduction of horses , these indians must have led nearly the same life as the fuegians now do , and therefore generally have resided in the neighbourhood of the sea .
the common prejudice of lying where one 's ancestors have lain , would make the now roaming indians bring the less perishable part of their dead to their ancient <unk> on the coast .
<name> 9 , 1834 .
before it was dark the " beagle " anchored in the fine spacious harbour of port st. <name> , situated about one hundred and ten miles to the south of port <name> .
we remained here eight days .
the country is nearly similar to that of port <name> , but perhaps rather more sterile .
one day a party accompanied captain fitz <name> on a long walk round the head of the harbour .
we were eleven hours without tasting any water , and some of the party were quite exhausted .
from the summit of a hill ( since well named thirsty hill ) a fine lake was spied , and two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show whether it was fresh water .
what was our disappointment to find a snow-white expanse of salt , crystallised in great cubes !
we attributed our extreme thirst to the dryness of the atmosphere ; but whatever the cause might be , we were exceedingly glad late in the evening to get back to the boats .
although we could nowhere find , during our whole visit , a single drop of fresh water , yet some must exist ; for by an odd chance i found on the surface of the salt water , near the head of the bay , a <unk> not quite dead , which must have lived in some not far distant pool .
three other insects ( a <unk> , like <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> , which all live on muddy flats occasionally overflowed by the sea ) , and one other found dead on the plain , complete the list of the beetles .
a good-sized fly ( <unk> ) was extremely numerous , and tormented us by its painful bite .
the common <unk> , which is so troublesome in the shady lanes of england , belongs to this same genus .
we here have the puzzle that so frequently occurs in the case of <unk>  on the blood of what animals do these insects commonly feed ?
the guanaco is nearly the only <unk> quadruped , and it is found in quite inconsiderable <name> compared with the multitude of flies .
the geology of patagonia is interesting .
differently from europe , where the tertiary formations appear to have accumulated in bays , here along hundreds of miles of coast we have one great deposit , including many tertiary shells , all apparently extinct .
the most common shell is a massive gigantic oyster , sometimes even a foot in diameter .
these beds are covered by others of a peculiar soft white stone , including much gypsum , and resembling chalk , but really of a pumiceous nature .
it is highly remarkable , from being composed , to at least one-tenth part of its bulk , of infusoria : professor ehrenberg has already ascertained in it thirty oceanic forms .
this bed extends for 500 miles along the coast , and probably for a considerably greater distance .
at port st. <name> its thickness is more than 800 feet !
these white beds are everywhere capped by a mass of gravel , forming probably one of the largest beds of shingle in the world : it certainly extends from near the rio colorado to between 600 and 700 nautical miles southward , at <name> <name> ( a river a little south of st. <name> ) it reaches to the foot of the cordillera ; half way up the river its thickness is more than 200 feet ; it probably everywhere extends to this great chain , whence the well-rounded pebbles of porphyry have been derived : we may consider its average breadth as 200 miles , and its average thickness as about 50 feet .
if this great bed of pebbles , without including the mud necessarily derived from their attrition , was piled into a mound , it would form a great mountain chain !
when we consider that all these pebbles , countless as the grains of sand in the desert , have been derived from the slow falling of masses of rock on the old <unk> and banks of rivers , and that these fragments have been dashed into smaller pieces , and that each of them has since been slowly rolled , rounded , and far transported , the mind is stupefied in thinking over the long , absolutely necessary , lapse of years .
yet all this gravel has been transported , and probably rounded , subsequently to the deposition of the white beds , and long subsequently to the underlying beds with the tertiary shells .
everything in this southern continent has been effected on a grand scale : the land , from the rio plata to <name> <name> fuego , a distance of 1200 miles , has been raised in mass ( and in patagonia to a height of between 300 and 400 feet ) , within the period of the now existing sea-shells .
the old and weathered shells left on the surface of the upraised plain still partially retain their colours .
the uprising movement has been interrupted by at least eight long periods of rest , during which the sea ate deeply back into the land , forming at successive levels the long lines of cliffs or escarpments , which separate the different plains as they rise like steps one behind the other .
the elevatory movement , and the <unk> power of the sea during the periods of rest , have been equable over long lines of coast ; for i was astonished to find that the <unk> plains stand at nearly corresponding heights at far distant points .
the lowest plain is 90 feet high ; and the highest , which i ascended near the coast , is <unk> feet ; and of this only relics are left in the form of flat gravel-capped hills .
the upper plain of <name> <name> slopes up to a height of 3000 feet at the foot of the cordillera .
i have said that within the period of existing sea-shells , patagonia has been upraised 300 to 400 feet : i may add , that within the period when icebergs transported boulders over the upper plain of <name> <name> , the elevation has been at least 1500 feet .
nor has patagonia been affected only by upward movements : the extinct tertiary shells from port st. <name> and <name> <name> can not have lived , according to professor e. forbes , in a greater depth of water than from 40 to 250 feet ; but they are now covered with <unk> strata from 800 to 1000 feet in thickness : hence the bed of the sea , on which these shells once lived , must have sunk downwards several hundred feet , to allow of the accumulation of the superincumbent strata .
what a history of geological changes does the <unk> coast of patagonia reveal !
( plate 39 .
raised beaches , patagonia . )
at port st. <name> , in some red mud capping the gravel on the <unk> plain , i found half the skeleton of the macrauchenia <unk> , a remarkable quadruped , full as large as a camel .
( <unk> .
i have lately heard that captain sulivan , r.n. , has found numerous fossil bones , embedded in regular strata , on the banks of the r. <unk> , in latitude 51 degrees 4 ' .
some of the bones are large ; others are small , and appear to have belonged to an <unk> .
this is a most interesting and important discovery . )
it belongs to the same division of the <unk> with the rhinoceros , tapir , and <unk> ; but in the structure of the bones of its long neck it shows a clear relation to the camel , or rather to the guanaco and <unk> .
from recent sea-shells being found on two of the higher step-formed plains , which must have been modelled and upraised before the mud was deposited in which the macrauchenia was <unk> , it is certain that this curious quadruped lived long after the sea was inhabited by its present shells .
i was at first much surprised how a large quadruped could so lately have subsisted , in latitude 49 degrees 15 ' , on these wretched gravel plains with their stunted vegetation ; but the relationship of the macrauchenia to the guanaco , now an inhabitant of the most sterile parts , partly explains this difficulty .
the relationship , though distant , between the macrauchenia and the guanaco , between the toxodon and the capybara ,  the closer relationship between the many extinct edentata and the living <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , now so eminently characteristic of south american zoology ,  and the still closer relationship between the fossil and living species of ctenomys and <unk> , are most interesting facts .
this relationship is shown wonderfully  as wonderfully as between the fossil and extinct marsupial animals of australia  by the great collection lately brought to europe from the caves of brazil by mm .
lund and <unk> .
in this collection there are extinct species of all the thirty-two genera , excepting four , of the terrestrial quadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur ; and the extinct species are much more numerous than those now living : there are fossil <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , guanacos , <unk> , and numerous south american <unk> and monkeys , and other animals .
this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living , <name> , i do not doubt , hereafter throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth , and their disappearance from it , than any other class of facts .
it is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the american continent without the deepest astonishment .
formerly it must have swarmed with great monsters : now we find mere <unk> , compared with the <unk> allied races .
if buffon had known of the gigantic sloth and <unk> animals , and of the lost <unk> , he might have said with a greater semblance of truth that the creative force in <name> had lost its power , rather than that it had never possessed great vigour .
the greater number , if not all , of these extinct quadrupeds lived at a late period , and were the contemporaries of most of the existing sea-shells .
since they lived , no very great change in the form of the land can have taken place .
what , then , has exterminated so many species and whole genera ?
the mind at first is irresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe ; but thus to destroy animals , both large and small , in southern patagonia , in brazil , on the cordillera of peru , in north <name> up to <unk> 's straits , we must shake the entire framework of the globe .
an examination , moreover , of the geology of la plata and patagonia , leads to the belief that all the features of the land result from slow and gradual changes .
it appears from the character of the fossils in europe , <name> , australia , and in north and south <name> , that those conditions which favour the life of the larger quadrupeds were lately <unk> with the world : what those conditions were , no one has yet even conjectured .
it could hardly have been a change of temperature , which at about the same time destroyed the inhabitants of tropical , temperate , and arctic latitudes on both sides of the globe .
in north <name> we positively know from mr. lyell that the large quadrupeds lived subsequently to that period , when boulders were brought into latitudes at which icebergs now never arrive : from conclusive but indirect reasons we may feel sure , that in the southern hemisphere the macrauchenia , also , lived long subsequently to the <unk> <unk> .
did man , after his first <unk> into south <name> , destroy , as has been suggested , the unwieldy megatherium and the other edentata ?
we must at least look to some other cause for the destruction of the little <unk> at bahia <name> , and of the many fossil mice and other small quadrupeds in brazil .
no one <name> imagine that a drought , even far severer than those which cause such losses in the provinces of la plata , could destroy every individual of every species from southern patagonia to <unk> 's straits .
what shall we say of the extinction of the horse ?
did those plains fail of pasture , which have since been overrun by thousands and hundreds of thousands of the descendants of the stock introduced by the spaniards ?
have the subsequently introduced species consumed the food of the great <unk> races ?
can we believe that the capybara has taken the food of the toxodon , the guanaco of the macrauchenia , the existing small edentata of their numerous gigantic prototypes ?
certainly , no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated <unk> of its inhabitants .
nevertheless , if we consider the subject under another point of view , it <name> appear less perplexing .
we do not steadily bear in mind how profoundly ignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every animal ; nor do we always remember that some check is constantly preventing the too rapid increase of every organised being left in a state of nature .
the supply of food , on an average , remains constant , yet the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation is geometrical ; and its surprising effects have nowhere been more astonishingly shown , than in the case of the european animals run wild during the last few centuries in <name> .
every animal in a state of nature regularly breeds ; yet in a species long established , any great increase in <name> is obviously impossible , and must be checked by some means .
we are , nevertheless , seldom able with certainty to tell in any given species , at what period of life , or at what period of the year , or whether only at long intervals , the check falls ; or , again , what is the precise nature of the check .
hence probably it is that we feel so little surprise at one , of two species closely allied in habits , being rare and the other abundant in the same district ; or , again , that one should be abundant in one district , and another , filling the same place in the economy of nature , should be abundant in a neighbouring district , differing very little in its conditions .
if asked how this is , one immediately replies that it is determined by some slight difference in climate , food , or the number of enemies : yet how rarely , if ever , we can point out the precise cause and manner of action of the check !
we are therefore , driven to the conclusion that causes generally quite inappreciable by us , determine whether a given species shall be abundant or scanty in <name> .
in the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through man , either wholly or in one limited district , we know that it becomes rarer and rarer , and is then lost : it would be difficult to point out any just distinction between a species destroyed by man or by the increase of its natural enemies .
( <unk> .
see the excellent remarks on this subject by mr. lyell in his " principles of geology . " )
the evidence of rarity preceding extinction is more striking in the successive tertiary strata , as remarked by several able observers ; it has often been found that a shell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare , and has even long been thought to be extinct .
if then , as appears probable , species first become rare and then extinct  if the too rapid increase of every species , even the most favoured , is steadily checked , as we must admit , though how and when it is hard to say  and if we see , without the smallest surprise , though unable to assign the precise reason , one species abundant and another closely-allied species rare in the same district  why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity being carried a step farther to extinction ?
an action going on , on every side of us , and yet barely appreciable , might surely be carried a little farther without exciting our observation .
who would feel any great surprise at hearing that the <unk> was formerly rare compared with the megatherium , or that one of the fossil monkeys was few in number compared with one of the now living monkeys ?
and yet in this comparative rarity , we should have the plainest evidence of less favourable conditions for their existence .
to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct  to feel no surprise at the comparative rarity of one species with another , and yet to call in some extraordinary agent and to <name> greatly when a species ceases to exist , appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the prelude to death  to feel no surprise at sickness  but when the sick man dies to wonder , and to believe that he died through violence .

the " beagle " anchored within the mouth of the <name> <name> .
this river is situated about sixty miles south of port st. <name> .
during the last voyage captain stokes proceeded thirty miles up it , but then , from the want of provisions , was obliged to return .
excepting what was discovered at that time , scarcely anything was known about this large river .
captain fitz <name> now determined to follow its course as far as time would allow .
on the 18th three whale-boats started , carrying three weeks ' provisions ; and the party consisted of twenty-five souls  a force which would have been sufficient to have defied a host of indians .
with a strong <unk> and a fine day we made a good run , soon drank some of the fresh water , and were at night nearly above the tidal influence .
the river here assumed a size and appearance which , even at the highest point we ultimately reached , was scarcely diminished .
it was generally from three to four hundred yards broad , and in the middle about seventeen feet deep .
the rapidity of the current , which in its whole course runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour , is perhaps its most remarkable feature .
the water is of a fine blue colour , but with a slight milky tinge , and not so transparent as at first sight would have been expected .
it flows over a bed of pebbles , like those which compose the beach and the surrounding plains .
it runs in a winding course through a valley , which extends in a direct line westward .
this valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth ; it is bounded by step-formed terraces , which rise in most parts , one above the other , to the height of five hundred feet , and have on the opposite sides a remarkable correspondence .
<name> 19 , 1834 .
against so strong a current it was , of course , quite impossible to row or sail : consequently the three boats were fastened together head and stern , two hands left in each , and the rest came on shore to track .
as the general arrangements made by captain fitz <name> were very good for <unk> the work of all , and as all had a share in it , i <name> describe the system .
the party , including every one , was divided into two spells , each of which hauled at the tracking line alternately for an hour and a half .
the officers of each boat lived with , ate the same food , and slept in the same tent with their crew , so that each boat was quite independent of the others .
after sunset the first level spot where any bushes were growing was chosen for our night 's lodging .
each of the crew took it in turns to be cook .
immediately the boat was hauled up , the cook made his fire ; two others pitched the tent ; the <unk> handed the things out of the boat ; the rest carried them up to the tents and collected firewood .
by this order , in half an hour everything was ready for the night .
a watch of two men and an officer was always kept , whose duty it was to look after the boats , keep up the fire , and guard against indians .
each in the party had his one hour every night .
during this day we tracked but a short distance , for there were many islets , covered by thorny bushes , and the channels between them were shallow .
<name> 20 , 1834 .
we passed the islands and set to work .
our regular day 's march , although it was hard enough , carried us on an average only ten miles in a straight line , and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether .
beyond the place where we slept last night , the country is completely <name> <unk> , for it was there that captain stokes turned back .
we saw in the distance a great smoke , and found the skeleton of a horse , so we knew that indians were in the neighbourhood .
on the next morning ( 21st ) tracks of a party of horse , and marks left by the trailing of the <unk> , or long spears , were observed on the ground .
it was generally thought that the indians had <unk> us during the night .
shortly afterwards we came to a spot where , from the fresh footsteps of men , children , and horses , it was evident that the party had crossed the river .
<name> 22 , 1834 .
the country remained the same , and was extremely uninteresting .
the complete similarity of the productions throughout patagonia is one of its most striking characters .
the level plains of arid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants ; and in the valleys the same <unk> bushes grow .
everywhere we see the same birds and insects .
even the very banks of the river and of the clear <unk> which entered it , were scarcely <unk> by a brighter tint of green .
the curse of sterility is on the land , and the water flowing over a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse .
hence the number of <unk> is very scanty ; for there is nothing to support life in the stream of this barren river .
patagonia , poor as she is in some respects , can however boast of a greater stock of small rodents than perhaps any other country in the world .
( <unk> .
the <unk> of syria are characterised , according to volney tome 1 <name> 351 , by woody bushes , numerous rats , <unk> and hares .
in the landscape of patagonia the guanaco replaces the <unk> , and the agouti the hare . )
several species of mice are externally characterised by large thin ears and a very fine fur .
these little animals swarm amongst the thickets in the valleys , where they can not for months together taste a drop of water excepting the dew .
they all seem to be cannibals ; for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my traps than it was devoured by others .
a small and <unk> fox , which is likewise very abundant , probably derives its entire support from these small animals .
the guanaco is also in his proper district , herds of fifty or a hundred were common ; and , as i have stated , we saw one which must have contained at least five hundred .
the puma , with the condor and other <unk> in its train , follows and preys upon these animals .
the footsteps of the puma were to be seen almost everywhere on the banks of the river ; and the remains of several guanacos , with their necks dislocated and bones broken , showed how they had met their death .
<name> 24 , 1834 .
like the navigators of old when approaching an unknown land , we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change .
the drifted trunk of a tree , or a boulder of primitive rock , was hailed with <name> , as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the cordillera .
the top , however , of a heavy bank of clouds , which remained almost constantly in one position , was the most promising sign , and eventually turned out a true <unk> .
at first the clouds were mistaken for the mountains themselves , instead of the masses of vapour condensed by their icy summits .
<name> 26 , 1834 .
we this day met with a marked change in the geological structure of the plains .
from the first starting i had carefully examined the gravel in the river , and for the two last days had noticed the presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt .
these gradually increased in number and in size , but none were as large as a man 's head .
this morning , however , pebbles of the same rock , but more compact , suddenly became abundant , and in the course of half an hour we saw , at the distance of five or six miles , the angular edge of a great basaltic platform .
when we arrived at its base we found the stream bubbling among the fallen blocks .
for the next twenty-eight miles the <unk> was encumbered with these basaltic masses .
above that limit immense fragments of primitive rocks , derived from the surrounding <unk> , were equally numerous .
none of the fragments of any considerable size had been washed more than three or four miles down the river below their <unk> : considering the singular rapidity of the great body of water in the <name> <name> , and that no still reaches occur in any part , this example is a most striking one , of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting even <unk> fragments .
the basalt is only lava which has flowed beneath the sea ; but the eruptions must have been on the grandest scale .
at the point where we first met this formation it was 120 feet in thickness ; following up the <unk> , the surface imperceptibly rose and the mass became thicker , so that at forty miles above the first station it was 320 feet thick .
what the thickness may be close to the cordillera , i have no means of knowing , but the platform there attains a height of about three thousand feet above the level of the sea : we must therefore look to the mountains of that great chain for its source ; and worthy of such a source are streams that have flowed over the gently inclined bed of the sea to a distance of one hundred miles .
at the first glance of the basaltic cliffs on the opposite sides of the valley it was evident that the strata once were united .
what power , then , has removed along a whole line of country a solid mass of very hard rock , which had an average thickness of nearly three hundred feet , and a breadth varying from rather less than two miles to four miles ?
the river , though it has so little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments , yet in the lapse of ages might produce by its gradual <unk> an effect , of which it is difficult to judge the amount .
but in this case , independently of the insignificance of such an agency , good reasons can be assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an arm of the sea .
it is needless in this work to detail the arguments leading to this conclusion , derived from the form and the nature of the step-formed terraces on both sides of the valley , from the manner in which the bottom of the valley near the andes expands into a great <unk> plain with <unk> on it , and from the occurrence of a few sea-shells lying in the bed of the river .
if i had space i could prove that south <name> was formerly here cut off by a strait , joining the atlantic and pacific oceans , like that of magellan .
but it may yet be asked , how has the solid basalt been removed ?
geologists formerly would have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming <unk> ; but in this case such a supposition would have been quite <unk> ; because , the same <unk> plains with existing sea-shells lying on their surface , which front the long line of the patagonian coast , sweep up on each side of the valley of <name> <name> .
no possible action of any flood could thus have modelled the land , either within the valley or along the open coast ; and by the formation of such <unk> plains or terraces the valley itself has been hollowed out .
although we know that there are tides which run within the narrows of the strait of magellan at the rate of eight knots an hour , yet we must confess that it makes the head almost giddy to reflect on the number of years , century after century , which the tides , unaided by a heavy surf , must have required to have corroded so vast an area and thickness of solid basaltic lava .
nevertheless , we must believe that the strata undermined by the waters of this ancient strait were broken up into huge fragments , and these lying scattered on the beach were reduced first to smaller blocks , then to pebbles , and lastly to the most impalpable mud , which the tides drifted far into the eastern or western ocean .
with the change in the geological structure of the plains the character of the landscape likewise altered .
while rambling up some of the narrow and <name> defiles , i could almost have fancied myself transported back again to the barren valleys of the island of st. jago .
among the basaltic cliffs i found some plants which i had seen nowhere else , but others i recognised as being wanderers from <name> <name> fuego .
these porous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rain-water ; and consequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations unite , some small springs ( most rare occurrences in patagonia ) burst forth ; and they could be distinguished at a distance by the circumscribed patches of bright green herbage .
( plate 42 .
basaltic <name> , <name> <name> ( rio negro ) .
<name> 27 , 1834 .
the bed of the river became rather narrower , and hence the stream more rapid .
it here ran at the rate of six knots an hour .
from this cause , and from the many great angular fragments , tracking the boats became both dangerous and laborious .
this day i shot a condor .
it measured from tip to tip of the wings eight and a half feet , and from beak to tail four feet .
this bird is known to have a wide geographical range , being found on the west coast of south <name> , from the strait of magellan along the cordillera as far as eight degrees north of the equator .
the steep <name> near the mouth of the rio negro is its northern limit on the patagonian coast ; and they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great central line of their habitation in the andes .
further south , among the bold precipices at the head of port <name> , the condor is not uncommon ; yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the sea-coast .
a line of <name> near the mouth of the <name> <name> is frequented by these birds , and about eighty miles up the river , where the sides of the valley are formed by steep basaltic precipices , the condor reappears .
from these facts , it seems that the <unk> require perpendicular cliffs .
in chile , they haunt , during the greater part of the year , the lower country near the shores of the pacific , and at night several roost together in one tree ; but in the early part of summer they retire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner cordillera , there to breed in peace .
with respect to their propagation , i was told by the country people in chile that the condor makes no sort of nest , but in the months of november and december lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock .
it is said that the young <unk> can not fly for an entire year ; and long after they are able , they continue to roost by night , an hunt by day with their parents .
the old birds generally live in pairs ; but among the inland basaltic cliffs of the <name> <name> i found a spot where scores must usually haunt .
on coming suddenly to the brow of the precipice , it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of these great birds start heavily from their resting-place , and wheel away in majestic circles .
from the quantity of <name> on the rocks , they must long have frequented this <name> for roosting and breeding .
having gorged themselves with carrion on the plains below , they retire to these favourite ledges to digest their food .
from these facts , the condor , like the <unk> must to a certain degree be considered as a gregarious bird .
in this part of the country they live altogether on the guanacos which have died a natural death , or as more commonly happens , have been killed by the <unk> .
i believe , from what i saw in patagonia , that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily excursions to any great distance from their regular <unk> .
the <unk> may <unk> be seen at a great height , soaring over a certain spot in the most graceful circles .
on some occasions i am sure that they do this only for pleasure , but on others , the <unk> countryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal , or the puma devouring its prey .
if the <unk> glide down , and then suddenly all rise together , the <unk> knows that it is the puma which , watching the carcass , has sprung out to drive away the robbers .
besides feeding on carrion , the <unk> frequently attack young goats and lambs ; and the <unk> are trained , whenever they pass over , to run out , and looking upwards to bark violently .
the <unk> destroy and catch <name> .
two methods are used ; one is to place a carcass on a level piece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with an opening , and when the <unk> are gorged , to gallop up on horseback to the entrance , and thus enclose them : for when this bird has not space to run , it can not give its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground .
the second method is to <name> the trees in which , frequently to the number of five or six together , they roost , and then at night to climb up and noose them .
they are such heavy sleepers , as i have myself witnessed , that this is not a difficult task .
at valparaiso i have seen a living condor sold for sixpence , but the common price is eight or ten shillings .
one which i saw brought in , had been tied with rope , and was much injured ; yet , the moment the line was cut by which its <name> was secured , although surrounded by people , it began <unk> to tear a piece of carrion .
in a garden at the same place , between twenty and thirty were kept alive .
they were fed only once a week , but they appeared in pretty good health .
the <unk> countrymen assert that the condor <name> live , and retain its vigour , between five and six weeks without eating : i can not answer for the truth of this , but it is a cruel experiment , which very likely has been tried .
( <unk> .
i noticed that several hours before any one of the <unk> died , all the lice , with which it was infested , crawled to the outside feathers .
i was assured that this always happens . )
when an animal is killed in the country , it is well known that the <unk> , like other <unk> , soon gain intelligence of it , and congregate in an inexplicable manner .
in most cases it must not be overlooked , that the birds have discovered their prey , and have picked the skeleton clean , before the flesh is in the least degree tainted .
remembering the experiments of m. audubon , on the little smelling powers of <unk> , i tried in the above-mentioned garden the following experiment : the <unk> were tied , each by a rope , in a long row at the bottom of a wall ; and having folded up a piece of meat in white paper , i walked backwards and forwards , carrying it in my hand at the distance of about three yards from them , but no notice whatever was taken .
i then threw it on the ground , within one yard of an old male bird ; he looked at it for a moment with attention , but then regarded it no more .
with a stick i pushed it closer and closer , until at last he touched it with his beak ; the paper was then instantly torn off with fury , and at the same moment , every bird in the long row began struggling and flapping its wings .
under the same circumstances it would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog .
the evidence in favour of and against the acute smelling powers of <unk> is singularly balanced .
professor <name> has demonstrated that the olfactory nerves of the <unk> ( <unk> <name> ) are highly developed , and on the evening when mr. <name> 's paper was read at the zoological society , it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen the <unk> in the west indies on two occasions collect on the roof of a house , when a corpse had become offensive from not having been buried : in this case , the intelligence could hardly have been acquired by sight .
on the other hand , besides the experiments of audubon and that one by myself , mr. bachman has tried in the united states many varied plans , showing that neither the <unk> ( the species dissected by professor <name> ) nor the <unk> find their food by smell .
he covered portions of <unk> offal with a thin canvas cloth , and strewed pieces of meat on it : these the <unk> ate up , and then remained quietly standing , with their beaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass , without discovering it .
a small rent was made in the canvas , and the offal was immediately discovered ; the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece , and meat again put on it , and was again devoured by the vultures without their discovering the hidden mass on which they were trampling .
these facts are attested by the signatures of six gentlemen , besides that of mr. bachman .
( <unk> .
loudon 's " magazine of natural history " volume 7 . )
often when lying down to rest on the open plains , on looking upwards , i have seen <unk> sailing through the air at a great height .
where the country is level i do not believe a space of the heavens , of more than fifteen degrees above the horizon , is commonly viewed with any attention by a person either walking or on horseback .
if such be the case , and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three and four thousand feet , before it could come within the range of vision , its distance in a straight line from the beholder 's eye would be rather more than two british miles .
might it not thus readily be overlooked ?
when an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely valley , may he not all the while be watched from above by the <unk> bird ?
and <name> not the manner of its descent proclaim throughout the district to the whole family of <unk> , that their prey is at hand ?
when the <unk> are wheeling in a flock round an round any spot , their flight is beautiful .
except when rising from the ground , i do not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings .
near lima , i watched several for nearly half an hour , without once taking off my eyes : they moved in large curves , sweeping in circles , descending and ascending without giving a single flap .
as they glided close over my head , i intently watched from an oblique position the outlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing ; and these separate feathers , if there had been the least vibratory movement , would have appeared as if blended together ; but they were seen distinct against the blue sky .
the head and neck were moved frequently , and apparently with force ; and the extended wings seemed to form the <unk> on which the movements of the neck , body and tail acted .
if the bird wished to descend , the wings were for a moment collapsed ; and when again expanded with an altered inclination , the momentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards with the even and steady movement of a paper kite .
in the case of any bird soaring , its motion must be sufficiently rapid , so that the action of the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may <unk> its gravity .
the force to keep up the momentum of a body moving in a horizontal plane in the air ( in which there is so little friction ) can not be great , and this force is all that is wanted .
the movement of the neck and body of the condor , we must suppose is sufficient for this .
however this may be , it is truly wonderful and beautiful to see so great a bird , hour after hour , without any apparent exertion , wheeling and gliding over mountain and river .
<name> 29 , 1834 .
from some high land we hailed with <name> the white summits of the cordillera , as they were seen occasionally peeping through their dusky envelope of clouds .
during the few succeeding days we continued to get on slowly , for we found the <unk> very tortuous , and strewed with immense fragments of various ancient slaty rocks , and of granite .
the plain bordering the valley had here attained an elevation of about <unk> feet above the river , and its character was much altered .
the well-rounded pebbles of porphyry were mingled with many immense angular fragments of basalt and of primary rocks .
the first of these erratic boulders which i noticed was sixty-seven miles distant from the nearest mountain ; another which i measured was five yards square , and projected five feet above the gravel .
its edges were so angular , and its size so great , that i at first mistook it for a rock in <unk> , and took out my compass to observe the direction of its cleavage .
the plain here was not quite so level as that nearer the coast , but yet it betrayed no signs of any great violence .
under these circumstances it is , i believe , quite impossible to explain the transportal of these gigantic masses of rock so many miles from their <unk> , on any theory except by that of floating icebergs .
during the two last days we met with signs of horses , and with several small articles which had belonged to the indians  such as parts of a mantle and a bunch of ostrich feathers  but they appeared to have been lying long on the ground .
between the place where the indians had so lately crossed the river and this neighbourhood , though so many miles apart , the country appears to be quite unfrequented .
at first , considering the abundance of the guanacos , i was surprised at this ; but it is explained by the stony nature of the plains , which would soon <unk> an <unk> horse from taking part in the <name> .
nevertheless , in two places in this very central region , i found small heaps of stones , which i do not think could have been accidentally thrown together .
they were placed on points projecting over the edge of the highest lava <name> , and they resembled , but on a small scale , those near port <name> .
may 4 , 1834 .
captain fitz <name> determined to take the boats no higher .
the river had a winding course , and was very rapid ; and the appearance of the country offered no temptation to proceed any farther .
everywhere we met with the same productions , and the same dreary landscape .
we were now one hundred and forty miles distant from the atlantic , and about sixty from the nearest arm of the pacific .
the valley in this upper part expanded into a wide basin , bounded on the north and south by the basaltic platforms , and fronted by the long range of the snow-clad cordillera .
but we viewed these grand mountains with regret , for we were obliged to imagine their nature and productions , instead of standing , as we had hoped , on their summits .
besides the useless loss of time which an attempt to ascend the river any higher would have cost us , we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread .
this , although really enough for reasonable men , was , after a hard day 's march , rather scanty food : a light stomach and an easy digestion are good things to talk about , but very unpleasant in practice .
may 5 , 1834 .
before sunrise we commenced our descent .
we shot down the stream with great rapidity , generally at the rate of ten knots an hour .
in this one day we effected what had cost us five and a half hard days ' labour in ascending .
on the 8th we reached the " beagle " after our twenty-one days ' expedition .
every one , excepting myself , had cause to be dissatisfied ; but to me the ascent afforded a most interesting section of the great tertiary formation of patagonia .
on march 1st , 1833 , and again on march 16th , 1834 , the " beagle " anchored in berkeley sound , in east falkland island .
this archipelago is situated in nearly the same latitude with the mouth of the strait of magellan ; it covers a space of one hundred and twenty by sixty geographical miles , and is a little more than half the size of ireland .
after the possession of these miserable islands had been <unk> by <name> , spain , and england , they were left uninhabited .
the government of buenos ayres then sold them to a private individual , but likewise used them , as old spain had done before , for a penal settlement .
england claimed her right an seized them .
the englishman who was left in charge of the flag was consequently murdered .
a british officer was next sent , unsupported by any power : and when we arrived , we found him in charge of a population , of which rather more than half were runaway rebels and murderers .
the theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it .
an undulating land , with a desolate and wretched aspect , is everywhere covered by a peaty soil and wiry grass , of one monotonous brown colour .
here and there a peak or ridge of grey quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface .
every one has heard of the climate of these regions ; it may be compared to that which is experienced at the height of between one and two thousand feet , on the mountains of north wales ; having however less <name> and less frost , but more wind and rain .
( <unk> .
from accounts published since our voyage , and more especially from several interesting letters from captain sulivan , r.n. , employed on the survey , it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the <unk> of the climate on these islands .
but when i reflect on the almost universal covering of peat , and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening here , i can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and dry as it has lately been represented . )
may 16 , 1834 .
i <name> now describe a short excursion which i made round a part of this island .
in the morning i started with six horses and two gauchos : the latter were capital men for the purpose , and well accustomed to living on their own resources .
the weather was very boisterous and cold , with heavy <unk> .
we got on , however , pretty well , but , except the geology , nothing could be less interesting than our day 's ride .
the country is uniformly the same undulating <unk> ; the surface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very small shrubs , all springing out of an elastic peaty soil .
in the valleys here and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese , and everywhere the ground was so soft that the snipe were able to feed .
besides these two birds there were few others .
there is one main range of hills , nearly two thousand feet in height , and composed of quartz rock , the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to cross .
on the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle ; we met , however , no great number , for they had been lately much harassed .
in the evening we came across a small herd .
one of my companions , st. jago by name , soon separated a fat cow ; he threw the bolas , and it struck her legs , but failed in becoming entangled .
then dropping his hat to <name> the spot where the balls were left , while at full gallop he <unk> his lazo , and after a most severe <name> again came up to the cow , and caught her round the horns .
the other gaucho had gone on ahead with the spare horses , so that st. jago had some difficulty in killing the furious beast .
he managed to get her on a level piece of ground , by taking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him ; and when she would not move , my horse , from having been trained , would canter up , and with his chest give her a violent push .
but when on level ground it does not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast mad with terror .
nor would it be so if the horse , when left to itself without its rider , did not soon learn , for its own safety , to keep the lazo tight ; so that , if the cow or ox moves forward , the horse moves just as quickly forward ; otherwise , it stands motionless leaning on one side .
this horse , however , was a young one , and would not stand still , but gave in to the cow as she struggled .
it was admirable to see with what dexterity st. jago dodged behind the beast , till at last he contrived to give the fatal touch to the main <unk> of the hind leg ; after which , without much difficulty , he drove his knife into the head of the spinal marrow , and the cow dropped as if struck by lightning .
he cut off pieces of flesh with the skin to it , but without any bones , sufficient for our expedition .
we then rode on to our <unk> , and had for supper " <unk> con <unk> , " or meat roasted with the skin on it .
this is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton .
a large circular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with the hide downwards and in the form of a saucer , so that none of the gravy is lost .
if any worthy alderman had <unk> with us that evening , " <unk> con <unk> , " without doubt , would soon have been celebrated in london .
during the night it rained , and the next day ( 17th ) was very <name> , with much hail and snow .
we rode across the island to the neck of land which joins the <unk> <name> <unk> ( the great peninsula at the south-west extremity ) to the rest of the island .
from the great number of cows which have been killed , there is a large proportion of bulls .
these wander about single , or two and three together , and are very savage .
i never saw such magnificent beasts ; they equalled in the size of their huge heads and necks the grecian marble sculptures .
captain sulivan informs me that the hide of an <unk> bull weighs forty-seven pounds , whereas a hide of this weight , less thoroughly dried , is considered as a very heavy one at <name> video .
the young bulls generally run away for a short distance ; but the old ones do not stir a step , except to rush at man and horse ; and many horses have been thus killed .
an old bull crossed a <unk> stream , and took his stand on the opposite side to us ; we in vain tried to drive him away , and failing , were obliged to make a large circuit .
the gauchos in revenge determined to <unk> him and render him for the future harmless .
it was very interesting to see how <name> completely mastered force .
one lazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse , and another round his hind legs : in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on the ground .
after the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns of a furious animal , it does not at first appear an easy thing to <unk> it again without killing the beast : nor , i apprehend , would it be so if the man was by himself .
by the aid , however , of a second person throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs , it is quickly managed : for the animal , as long as its hind legs are kept outstretched , is quite helpless , and the first man can with his hands loosen his lazo from the horns , and then quietly mount his horse ; but the moment the second man , by backing ever so little , <unk> the strain , the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast which then rises free , shakes himself , and vainly rushes at his antagonist .
during our whole ride we saw only one troop of wild horses .
these animals , as well as the cattle , were introduced by the french in <unk> , since which time both have greatly increased .
it is a curious fact that the horses have never left the eastern end of the island , although there is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming , and that part of the island is not more tempting than the rest .
the gauchos whom i asked , though asserting this to be the case , were unable to account for it , except from the strong attachment which horses have to any locality to which they are accustomed .
considering that the island does not appear fully stocked , and that there are no beasts of prey , i was particularly curious to know what has checked their originally rapid increase .
that in a limited island some check would sooner or later <unk> , is inevitable ; but why has the increase of the horse been checked sooner than that of the cattle ?
captain sulivan has taken much pains for me in this inquiry .
the gauchos employed here attribute it chiefly to the stallions constantly roaming from place to place , and compelling the mares to accompany them , whether or not the young foals are able to follow .
one gaucho told captain sulivan that he had watched a stallion for a whole hour , violently kicking and biting a mare till he forced her to leave her foal to its fate .
captain sulivan can so far <unk> this curious account , that he has several times found young foals dead , whereas he has never found a dead calf .
moreover , the dead bodies of full-grown horses are more frequently found , as if more subject to disease or accidents than those of the cattle .
from the softness of the ground their hoofs often grow irregularly to a great length , and this causes <unk> .
the predominant colours are roan and <unk> .
all the horses bred here , both tame and wild , are rather <unk> , though generally in good condition ; and they have lost so much strength , that they are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle with the lazo : in consequence , it is necessary to go to the great expense of importing fresh horses from the plata .
at some future period the southern hemisphere probably <name> have its breed of falkland ponies , as the northern has its shetland breed .
the cattle , instead of having <unk> like the horses , seem , as before remarked , to have increased in size ; and they are much more numerous than the horses .
captain sulivan informs me that they vary much less in the general form of their bodies and in the shape of their horns than english cattle .
in colour they differ much ; and it is a remarkable circumstance , that in different parts of this one small island , different colours <unk> .
round mount <unk> , at a height of from 1000 to 1500 feet above the sea , about half of some of the herds are mouse or lead coloured , a tint which is not common in other parts of the island .
near port pleasant dark brown prevails , whereas south of <unk> sound ( which almost divides the island into two parts ) white beasts with black heads and feet are the most common : in all parts black , and some spotted animals may be observed .
captain sulivan remarks that the difference in the prevailing colours was so obvious , that in looking for the herds near port pleasant , they appeared from a long distance like black spots , whilst south of <unk> sound they appeared like white spots on the hill-sides .
captain sulivan thinks that the herds do not mingle ; and it is a singular fact , that the <unk> cattle , though living on the high land , <unk> about a month earlier in the season than the other coloured beasts on the lower land .
it is interesting thus to find the once domesticated cattle breaking into three colours , of which some one colour would in all probability ultimately prevail over the others , if the herd were left undisturbed for the next several centuries .
the rabbit is another animal which has been introduced , and has succeeded very well ; so that they abound over large parts of the island .
yet , like the horses , they are confined within certain limits ; for they have not crossed the central chain of hills , nor would they have extended even so far as its base , if , as the gauchos informed me , small colonies had not been carried there .
i should not have supposed that these animals , natives of northern africa , could have existed in a climate so humid as this , and which enjoys so little <name> that even wheat ripens only occasionally .
it is asserted that in sweden , which any one would have thought a more favourable climate , the rabbit can not live out of doors .
the first few pairs , moreover , had here to contend against pre-existing enemies , in the fox and some large hawks .
the french naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct species , and called it <unk> magellanicus .
( <unk> .
lesson 's " zoology of the voyage of the <unk> " tome 1 <name> 168 .
all the early voyagers , and especially <unk> , distinctly state that the <unk> fox was the only native animal on the island .
the distinction of the rabbit as a species is taken from peculiarities in the fur , from the shape of the head , and from the shortness of the ears .
i may here observe that the difference between the <name> and english hare rests upon nearly similar characters , only more strongly marked . )
they imagined that magellan , when talking of an animal under the name of " <unk> " in the strait of magellan , referred to this species ; but he was alluding to a small <unk> , which to this day is thus called by the spaniards .
the gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the grey , and they said that at all events it had not extended its range any farther than the grey kind ; that the two were never found separate ; and that they readily bred together , and produced piebald offspring .
of the latter i now possess a specimen , and it is marked about the head differently from the french specific description .
this circumstance shows how cautious naturalists should be in making species ; for even cuvier , on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits , thought it was probably distinct !
the only quadruped native to the island is a large <unk> fox ( canis <unk> ) , which is common to both east and west falkland .
( <unk> .
i have reason , however , to suspect that there is a <unk> .
the common european rat and mouse have roamed far from the habitations of the settlers .
the common hog has also run wild on one islet ; all are of a black colour : the boars are very fierce , and have great tusks . )
i have no doubt it is a peculiar species , and confined to this archipelago ; because many sealers , gauchos , and indians , who have visited these islands , all maintain that no such animal is found in any part of south <name> .
<unk> , from a similarity in habits , thought that this was the same with his " <unk> " ( <unk> .
the " <unk> " is the canis magellanicus brought home by captain king from the strait of magellan .
it is common in chile .
) ; but i have seen both , and they are quite distinct .
these wolves are well known from <name> 's account of their tameness and curiosity , which the sailors , who ran into the water to avoid them , mistook for fierceness .
to this day their manners remain the same .
they have been observed to enter a tent , and actually pull some meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman .
the gauchos also have frequently in the evening killed them , by holding out a piece of meat in one hand , and in the other a knife ready to stick them .
as far as i am aware , there is no other instance in any part of the world , of so small a mass of broken land , distant from a continent , possessing so large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself .
their <name> have rapidly decreased ; they are already banished from that half of the island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between st. <name> bay and berkeley sound .
within a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly settled , in all probability this fox <name> be classed with the dodo , as an animal which has perished from the face of the earth .
at night ( 17th ) we slept on the neck of land at the head of <unk> sound , which forms the south-west peninsula .
the valley was pretty well sheltered from the cold wind ; but there was very little brushwood for fuel .
the gauchos , however , soon found what , to my great surprise , made nearly as hot a fire as coals ; this was the skeleton of a bullock lately killed , from which the flesh had been picked by the <unk> .
they told me that in <name> they often killed a beast , cleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives and then with these same bones roasted the meat for their suppers .
may 18 , 1834 .
it rained during nearly the whole day .
at night we managed , however , with our <unk> to keep ourselves pretty well dry and warm ; but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in the state of a bog , and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after our day 's ride .
i have in another part stated how singular it is that there should be absolutely no trees on these islands , although <name> <name> fuego is covered by one large forest .
the largest bush in the island ( belonging to the family of compositae ) is scarcely so tall as our gorse .
the best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the size of common <name> , which has the useful property of burning while fresh and green .
it was very surprising to see the gauchos , in the midst of rain and everything soaking wet , with nothing more than a <unk> and a piece of rag , immediately make a fire .
they sought beneath the tufts of grass and bushes for a few dry twigs , and these they rubbed into fibres ; then surrounding them with coarser twigs , something like a bird 's nest , they put the rag with its spark of fire in the middle and covered it up .
the nest being then held up to the wind , by degrees it smoked more and more , and at last burst out in flames .
i do not think any other method would have had a chance of succeeding with such damp materials .
may 19 , 1834 .
each morning , from not having ridden for some time previously , i was very stiff .
i was surprised to hear the gauchos , who have from infancy almost lived on horseback , say that , under similar circumstances , they always suffer .
st. jago told me , that having been confined for three months by illness , he went out hunting wild cattle , and in consequence , for the next two days , his thighs were so stiff that he was obliged to lie in bed .
this shows that the gauchos , although they do not appear to do so , yet really must exert much muscular effort in riding .
the hunting wild cattle , in a country so difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground , must be very hard work .
the gauchos say they often pass at full speed over ground which would be impassable at a slower pace ; in the same manner as a man is able to skate over thin ice .
when hunting , the party endeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being discovered .
each man carries four or five pair of the bolas ; these he throws one after the other at as many cattle , which , when once entangled , are left for some days , till they become a little exhausted by hunger and struggling .
they are then let free and driven towards a small herd of tame animals , which have been brought to the spot on purpose .
from their previous treatment , being too much terrified to leave the herd , they are easily driven , if their strength last out , to the settlement .
the weather continued so very bad that we determine to make a push , and try to reach the vessel before night .
from the quantity of rain which had fallen , the surface of the whole country was swampy .
i suppose my horse fell at least a dozen times , and sometimes the whole six horses were floundering in the mud together .
all the little streams are bordered by soft peat , which makes it very difficult for the horses to leap them without falling .
to complete our discomforts we were obliged to cross the head of a creek of the sea , in which the water was as high as our horses ' backs ; and the little waves , owing to the violence of the wind , broke over us , and made us very wet and cold .
even the <unk> gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the settlement , after our little excursion .
the geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple .
the lower country consists of clay-slate and sandstone , containing fossils , very closely related to , but not identical with , those found in the silurian formations of europe ; the hills are formed of white granular quartz rock .
the strata of the latter are frequently arched with perfect symmetry , and the appearance of some of the masses is in consequence most singular .
<unk> has devoted several pages to the description of a hill of ruins , the successive strata of which he has justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre .
( <unk> .
<unk> " voyage aux isles <unk> " <name> 526 . )
the quartz rock must have been quite <name> when it underwent such remarkable <unk> without being shattered into fragments .
as the quartz insensibly passes into the sandstone , it seems probable that the former owes its origin to the sandstone having been heated to such a degree that it became viscid , and upon cooling crystallised .
while in the soft state it must have been pushed up through the overlying beds .
in many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in an extraordinary manner by myriads of great loose angular fragments of the quartz rock , forming " streams of stones . "
these have been mentioned with surprise by every voyager since the time of <unk> .
the blocks are not <unk> , their angles being only a little blunted ; they vary in size from one or two feet in diameter to ten , or even more than twenty times as much .
they are not thrown together into irregular piles , but are spread out into level sheets or great streams .
it is not possible to ascertain their thickness , but the water of small <unk> can be heard trickling through the stones many feet below the surface .
the actual depth is probably great , because the crevices between the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with sand .
the width of these sheets of stones varies from a few hundred feet to a mile ; but the peaty soil daily <unk> on the borders , and even forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close together .
in a valley south of berkeley sound , which some of our party called the " great valley of fragments , " it was necessary to cross an uninterrupted band half a mile wide , by jumping from one pointed stone to another .
so large were the fragments , that being overtaken by a shower of rain , i readily found shelter beneath one of them .
their little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these " streams of stones . "
on the hill-sides i have seen them sloping at an <name> of ten degrees with the horizon ; but in some of the level , <unk> valleys , the inclination is only just sufficient to be clearly perceived .
on so rugged a surface there was no means of measuring the <name> ; but to give a common illustration , i may say that the slope would not have checked the speed of an english <unk> .
in some places a continuous stream of these fragments followed up the course of a valley , and even extended to the very crest of the hill .
on these crests huge masses , exceeding in dimensions any small building , seemed to stand arrested in their headlong course : there , also , the curved strata of the <unk> lay piled on each other , like the ruins of some vast and ancient cathedral .
in endeavouring to describe these scenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one simile to another .
we may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed from many parts of the mountains into the lower country , and that when solidified they had been rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads of fragments .
the expression " streams of stones , " which immediately occurred to every one , conveys the same idea .
these scenes are on the spot rendered more striking by the contrast of the low , rounded forms of the neighbouring hills .
i was interested by finding on the highest peak of one range ( about 700 feet above the sea ) a great arched fragment , lying on its convex side , or back downwards .
must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in the air , and thus turned ?
or , with more probability , that there existed formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point on which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies .
as the fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices filled up with sand , we must infer that the period of violence was subsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea .
in a transverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly level , or rises but very little towards either side .
hence the fragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley ; but in reality it seems more probable that they have been hurled down from the nearest slopes ; and that since , by a vibratory movement of overwhelming force , the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet .

if during the earthquake which in 1835 <unk> <name> , in chile , it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been pitched a few inches from the ground , what must we say to a movement which has caused fragments many tons in weight to move onwards like so much sand on a vibrating board , and find their level ?
( <unk> .
an inhabitant of mendoza , and hence well capable of judging , assured me that , during the several years he had resided on these islands , he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake . )
i have seen , in the cordillera of the andes , the evident marks where stupendous mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust , and the strata thrown on their vertical edges ; but never did any scene , like these " streams of stones , " so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a convulsion , of which in historical records we might in vain seek for any counterpart : yet the progress of knowledge <name> probably some day give a simple explanation of this phenomenon , as it already has of the so long thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders which are strewed over the plains of europe .
i have little to remark on the zoology of these islands .
i have before described the <unk> of <unk> .
there are some other hawks , owls , and a few small land-birds .
the <unk> are particularly numerous , and they must formerly , from the accounts of the old navigators , have been much more so .
one day i observed a <unk> playing with a fish which it had caught .
eight times successively the bird let its prey go , then dived after it , and although in deep water , brought it each time to the surface .
in the zoological gardens i have seen the otter treat a fish in the same manner , much as a cat does a mouse : i do not know of any other instance where dame nature appears so wilfully cruel .
another day , having placed myself between a penguin ( <unk> <unk> ) and the water , i was much amused by watching its habits .
it was a brave bird ; and till reaching the sea , it regularly fought and drove me backwards .
nothing less than heavy blows would have stopped him ; every inch he gained he firmly kept , standing close before me erect and determined .
when thus opposed he continually rolled his head from side to side , in a very odd manner , as if the power of distinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of each eye .
this bird is commonly called the jackass penguin , from its habit , while on shore , of throwing its head backwards , and making a loud strange noise , very like the braying of an ass ; but while at sea , and undisturbed , its note is very deep and solemn , and is often heard in the <unk> .
in diving , its little wings are used as fins ; but on the land , as front legs .
when crawling , it may be said on four legs , through the <unk> or on the side of a grassy <name> , it moves so very quickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped .
when at sea and fishing , it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with such a spring , and dives again so instantaneously , that i defy any one at first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport .
two kinds of geese frequent the falklands .
the upland species ( anas <unk> ) is common , in pairs and in small flocks , throughout the island .
they do not migrate , but build on the small outlying islets .
this is supposed to be from fear of the foxes : and it is perhaps from the same cause that these birds , though very tame by day , are shy and wild in the dusk of the evening .
they live entirely on vegetable matter .
the <unk> , so called from living exclusively on the sea-beach ( anas <unk> ) , is common both here and on the west coast of <name> , as far north as chile .
in the deep and retired channels of <name> <name> fuego , the snow-white gander , invariably accompanied by his darker consort , and standing close by each other on some distant <name> point , is a common feature in the landscape .
in these islands a great <unk> duck or goose ( anas <unk> ) , which sometimes weighs twenty-two pounds , is very abundant .
these birds were in former days called , from their extraordinary manner of paddling and splashing upon the water , racehorses ; but now they are named , much more appropriately , steamers .
their wings are too small and weak to allow of flight , but by their aid , partly swimming and partly flapping the surface of the water , they move very quickly .
the manner is something like that by which the common <unk> escapes when pursued by a dog ; but i am nearly sure that the steamer moves its wings alternately , instead of both together , as in other birds .
these clumsy , <unk> ducks make such a noise and splashing , that the effect is exceedingly curious .
thus we find in south <name> three birds which use their wings for other purposes besides flight ; the penguin as fins , the steamer as paddles , and the ostrich as sails : and the <unk> of new zealand , as well as its gigantic extinct prototype the <unk> , possess only rudimentary representatives of wings .
the steamer is able to dive only to a very short distance .
it feeds entirely on <unk> from the <unk> and tidal rocks ; hence the beak and head , for the purpose of breaking them , are surprisingly heavy and strong : the head is so strong that i have scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological hammer ; and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds were of life .
when in the evening <unk> themselves in a flock , they make the same odd mixture of sounds which <unk> do within the tropics .
in <name> <name> fuego , as well as in the falkland islands , i made many observations on the lower <name> animals , but they are of little general interest .
( <unk> .
i was surprised to find , on counting the eggs of a large white <name> ( this <unk> was three and a half inches long ) , how extraordinarily numerous they were .
from two to five eggs ( each <unk> of an inch in diameter ) were contained in spherical little case .
these were arranged two deep in transverse rows forming a ribbon .
the ribbon adhered by its edge to the rock in an oval spire .
one which i found measured nearly twenty inches in length and half in breadth .
by counting how many balls were contained in a tenth of an inch in the row , and how many rows in an equal length of the ribbon , on the most moderate <unk> there were six hundred thousand eggs .
yet this <name> was certainly not very common : although i was often searching under the stones , i saw only seven individuals .
no fallacy is more common with naturalists , than that the <name> of an individual species depend on its powers of propagation . )
i <name> mention only one class of facts , relating to certain <unk> in the more highly organised division of that class .
several genera ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others ) agree in having singular movable organs ( like those of <unk> <unk> , found in the european seas ) attached to their cells .
the organ , in the greater number of cases , very closely resembles the head of a vulture ; but the lower mandible can be opened much wider than in a real bird 's beak .
the head itself possesses considerable powers of movement , by means of a short neck .
in one <unk> the head itself was fixed , but the lower jaw free : in another it was replaced by a triangular hood , with a <unk> trap-door , which evidently answered to the lower mandible .
in the greater number of species , each cell was provided with one head , but in others each cell had two .
the young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain quite immature <unk> , yet the <unk> attached to them , though small , are in every respect perfect .
when the <unk> was removed by a needle from any of the cells , these organs did not appear in the least affected .
when one of the <unk> heads was cut off from the cell , the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing .
perhaps the most singular part of their structure is , that when there were more than two rows of cells on a branch , the central cells were furnished with these appendages , of only one-fourth the size of the outside ones .
their movements varied according to the species ; but in some i never saw the least motion ; while others , with the lower mandible generally wide open , <unk> backwards and forwards at the rate of about five seconds each turn ; others moved rapidly and by starts .
when touched with a needle , the beak generally seized the point so firmly that the whole branch might be shaken .
these bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the eggs or gemmules , as they are formed before the young <unk> appear in the cells at the end of the growing branches ; as they move independently of the <unk> , and do not appear to be in any way connected with them ; and as they differ in size on the outer and inner rows of cells , i have little doubt that in their functions they are related rather to the horny axis of the branches than to the <unk> in the cells .
the fleshy appendage at the lower extremity of the <unk> ( described at bahia <name> ) also forms part of the <unk> , as a whole , in the same manner as the roots of a tree form part of the whole tree , and not of the individual leaf or flower-buds .
in another elegant little coralline ( <unk> ? )
each cell was furnished with a <unk> bristle , which had the power of moving quickly .
each of these bristles and each of the <unk> heads generally moved quite independently of the others , but sometimes all on both sides of a branch , sometimes only those on one side , moved together <unk> ; sometimes each moved in regular order one after another .
in these actions we apparently behold as perfect a transmission of <name> in the <unk> , though composed of thousands of distinct <unk> , as in any single animal .
the case , indeed , is not different from that of the <unk> , which , when touched , <name> themselves into the sand on the coast of bahia <name> .
i <name> state one other instance of uniform action , though of a very different nature , in a <unk> closely allied to <unk> , and therefore very simply organised .
having kept a large tuft of it in a basin of salt-water , when it was dark i found that as often as i rubbed any part of a branch , the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a green light : i do not think i ever saw any object more beautifully so .
but the remarkable circumstance was , that the flashes of light always proceeded up the branches , from the base towards the extremities .
the examination of these compound animals was always very interesting to me .
what can be more remarkable than to see a <unk> body producing an egg , capable of swimming about and of choosing a proper place to adhere to , which then sprouts into branches , each crowded with innumerable distinct animals , often of complicated <unk> .
the branches , moreover , as we have just seen , sometimes possess organs capable of movement and independent of the <unk> .
surprising as this union of separate individuals in a common stock must always appear , every tree displays the same fact , for buds must be considered as individual plants .
it is , however , natural to consider a <unk> , furnished with a mouth , intestines , and other organs , as a distinct individual , whereas the individuality of a <unk> is not easily realised ; so that the union of separate individuals in a common body is more striking in a coralline than in a tree .
our <name> of a compound animal , where in some respects the individuality of each is not completed , may be aided , by reflecting on the production of two distinct creatures by <unk> a single one with a knife , or where nature herself performs the task of <unk> .
we may consider the <unk> in a <unk> , or the buds in a tree , as cases where the division of the individual has not been completely effected .
certainly in the case of trees , and judging from analogy in that of corallines , the individuals propagated by buds seem more intimately related to each other , than eggs or seeds are to their parents .
it seems now pretty well established that plants propagated by buds all partake of a common duration of life ; and it is familiar to every one , what singular and numerous peculiarities are transmitted with certainty , by buds , layers , and grafts , which by seminal propagation never or only casually reappear .

<name> <name> fuego .
december 17 , 1832 .
having now finished with patagonia and the falkland islands , i <name> describe our first arrival in <name> <name> fuego .
a little after noon we doubled cape st. <name> , and entered the famous strait of <name> <name> .
we kept close to the fuegian shore , but the outline of the rugged , inhospitable <unk> was visible amidst the clouds .
in the afternoon we anchored in the bay of good success .
while entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this savage land .
a group of fuegians partly concealed by the entangled forest , were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea ; and as we passed by , they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a loud and sonorous shout .
the savages followed the ship , and just before dark we saw their fire , and again heard their wild cry .
the harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low rounded mountains of clay-slate , which are covered to the water 's edge by one dense gloomy forest .
a single glance at the landscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything i had ever beheld .
at night it blew a <name> of wind , and heavy squalls from the mountains swept past us .
it would have been a bad time out at sea , and we , as well as others , may call this good success bay .
in the morning the captain sent a party to communicate with the fuegians .
when we came within hail , one of the four natives who were present advanced to receive us , and began to shout most vehemently , wishing to direct us where to land .
when we were on shore the party looked rather alarmed , but continued talking and making gestures with great rapidity .
it was without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle i ever beheld : i could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man : it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal , inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement .
the chief spokesman was old , and appeared to be the head of the family ; the three others were powerful young men , about six feet high .
the women and children had been sent away .
these fuegians are a very different race from the stunted , miserable wretches farther westward ; and they seem closely allied to the famous <unk> of the strait of magellan .
their only garment consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin , with the wool outside : this they wear just thrown over their shoulders , leaving their persons as often exposed as covered .
their skin is of a dirty <unk> colour .
the old man had a <unk> of white feathers tied round his head , which partly confined his black , coarse , and entangled hair .
his face was crossed by two broad transverse bars ; one , painted bright red , reached from ear to ear and included the upper lip ; the other , white like chalk , extended above and parallel to the first , so that even his eyelids were thus coloured .
the other two men were ornamented by streaks of black powder , made of charcoal .
the party altogether closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like der <unk> .
their very attitudes were abject , and the expression of their countenances <unk> , surprised , and startled .
after we had presented them with some <name> cloth , which they immediately tied round their necks , they became good friends .
this was shown by the old man patting our breasts , and making a chuckling kind of noise , as people do when feeding chickens .
i walked with the old man , and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several times ; it was concluded by three hard <unk> , which were given me on the breast and back at the same time .
he then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment , which being done , he seemed highly pleased .
the language of these people , according to our notions , scarcely deserves to be called articulate .
captain cook has compared it to a man clearing his throat , but certainly no european ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse , guttural , and clicking sounds .
they are excellent <unk> : as often as we coughed or yawned , or made any odd motion , they immediately imitated us .
some of our party began to <unk> and look awry ; but one of the young fuegians ( whose whole face was painted black , excepting a white band across his eyes ) succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces .
they could repeat with perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them , and they remembered such words for some time .
yet we europeans all know how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language .
which of us , for instance , could follow an american indian through a sentence of more than three words ?
all savages appear to possess , to an uncommon degree , this power of mimicry .
i was told , almost in the same words , of the same ludicrous habit among the <unk> ; the australians , likewise , have long been notorious for being able to imitate and describe the gait of any man , so that he may be recognised .
how can this faculty be explained ?
is it a consequence of the more practised habits of perception and keener senses , common to all men in a savage state , as compared with those long civilised ?
when a song was struck up by our party , i thought the fuegians would have fallen down with astonishment .
with equal surprise they viewed our dancing ; but one of the young men , when asked , had no objection to a little waltzing .
little accustomed to europeans as they appeared to be , yet they knew and dreaded our firearms ; nothing would tempt them to take a gun in their hands .
they begged for knives , calling them by the spanish word " <unk> . "
they explained also what they wanted , by acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth , and then pretending to cut instead of tear it .
i have not as yet noticed the fuegians whom we had on board .
during the former voyage of the " adventure " and " beagle " in 1826 to 1830 , captain fitz <name> seized on a party of natives , as hostages for the loss of a boat , which had been stolen , to the great <unk> of a party employed on the survey ; and some of these natives , as well as a child whom he bought for a <unk> , he took with him to england , determining to educate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense .
to settle these natives in their own country was one chief inducement to captain fitz <name> to undertake our present voyage ; and before the admiralty had resolved to send out this expedition , captain fitz <name> had generously chartered a vessel , and would himself have taken them back .
the natives were accompanied by a missionary , r. matthews ; of whom and of the natives , captain fitz <name> has published a full and excellent account .
two men , one of whom died in england of the smallpox , a boy and a little girl , were originally taken ; and we had now on board , york minster , jemmy button ( whose name expresses his <unk> ) , and <unk> basket .
york minster was a full-grown , short , thick , powerful man : his disposition was reserved , <unk> , morose , and when excited violently passionate ; his affections were very strong towards a few friends on board ; his intellect good .
jemmy button was a universal favourite , but likewise passionate ; the expression of his face at once showed his nice disposition .
he was <name> and often laughed , and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in pain : when the water was rough , i was often a little <unk> , and he used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice , " poor , poor fellow ! "
but the notion , after his aquatic life , of a man being <unk> , was too ludicrous , and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide a smile or laugh , and then he would repeat his " poor , poor fellow ! "
he was of a patriotic disposition ; and he liked to praise his own tribe and country , in which he truly said there were " plenty of trees , " and he abused all the other tribes : he stoutly declared that there was no devil in his land .
jemmy was short , thick , and fat , but vain of his personal appearance ; he used always to wear gloves , his hair was neatly cut , and he was distressed if his <unk> shoes were <unk> .
he was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass ; and a <unk> little indian boy from the rio negro , whom we had for some months on board , soon perceived this , and used to mock him : jemmy , who was always rather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy , did not at all like this , and used to say , with rather a contemptuous twist of his head , " too much <unk> . "
it seems yet wonderful to me , when i think over all his many good qualities , that he should have been of the same race , and doubtless partaken of the same character , with the miserable , degraded savages whom we first met here .
lastly , <unk> basket was a nice , modest , reserved young girl , with a rather pleasing but sometimes sullen expression , and very quick in learning anything , especially languages .
this she showed in picking up some portuguese and spanish , when left on shore for only a short time at rio de janeiro and <name> video , and in her knowledge of english .
york minster was very jealous of any attention paid to her ; for it was clear he determined to marry her as soon as they were settled on shore .
although all three could both speak and understand a good deal of english , it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from them concerning the habits of their countrymen ; this was partly owing to their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative .
every one accustomed to very young children knows how seldom one can get an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black or white ; the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their minds .
so it was with these fuegians , and hence it was generally impossible to find out , by <unk> , whether one had rightly understood anything which they had asserted .
their sight was remarkably acute ; it is well known that sailors , from long practice , can make out a distant object much better than a landsman ; but both york and jemmy were much superior to any sailor on board : several times they have declared what some distant object has been , and though doubted by every one , they have proved right when it has been examined through a telescope .
they were quite conscious of this power ; and jemmy , when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch , would say , " me see ship , me no tell . "
it was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages , when we landed , towards jemmy button : they immediately perceived the difference between him and ourselves , and held much conversation one with another on the subject .
the old man addressed a long harangue to jemmy , which it seems was to invite him to stay with them .
but jemmy understood very little of their language , and was , moreover , thoroughly ashamed of his countrymen .
when york minster afterwards came on shore , they noticed him in the same way , and told him he ought to shave ; yet he had not twenty dwarf hairs on his face , whilst we all wore our <unk> beards .
they examined the colour of his skin , and compared it with ours .
one of our arms being bared , they expressed the liveliest surprise and admiration at its whiteness , just in the same way in which i have seen the ourang-outang do at the zoological gardens .
we thought that they mistook two or three of the officers , who were rather shorter and fairer , though adorned with large beards , for the ladies of our party .
the tallest amongst the fuegians was evidently much pleased at his height being noticed .
when placed back to back with the tallest of the boat 's crew , he tried his best to edge on higher ground , and to stand on tiptoe .
he opened his mouth to show his teeth , and turned his face for a side view ; and all this was done with such alacrity , that i daresay he thought himself the handsomest man in <name> <name> fuego .
after our first feeling of grave astonishment was over , nothing could be more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which these savages every moment exhibited .
the next day i attempted to penetrate some way into the country .
<name> <name> fuego may be described as a mountainous land , partly submerged in the sea , so that deep <unk> and bays occupy the place where valleys should exist .
the mountain sides , except on the exposed western coast , are covered from the water 's edge upwards by one great forest .
the trees reach to an elevation of between 1000 and 1500 feet , and are succeeded by a band of peat , with minute alpine plants ; and this again is succeeded by the line of perpetual snow , which , according to captain king , in the strait of magellan descends to between 3000 and <unk> feet .
to find an acre of level land in any part of the country is most rare .
i recollect only one little flat piece near port famine , and another of rather larger extent near <unk> road .
in both places , and everywhere else , the surface is covered by a thick bed of swampy peat .
even within the forest , the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly <unk> vegetable matter , which , from being soaked with water , yields to the foot .
finding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood , i followed the course of a mountain torrent .
at first , from the waterfalls and number of dead trees , i could hardly crawl along ; but the bed of the stream soon became a little more open , from the floods having swept the sides .
i continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and <name> banks , and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene .
the gloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of violence .
on every side were lying irregular masses of rock and <unk> trees ; other trees , though still erect , were decayed to the heart and ready to fall .
the entangled mass of the thriving and the fallen reminded me of the forests within the tropics  yet there was a difference : for in these still solitudes , death , instead of life , seemed the predominant spirit .
i followed the watercourse till i came to a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the mountain side .
by this road i ascended to a considerable elevation , and obtained a good view of the surrounding woods .
the trees all belong to one kind , the <unk> <unk> ; for the number of the other species of <unk> and of the <name> 's bark is quite inconsiderable .
this beech keeps its leaves throughout the year ; but its foliage is of a peculiar <unk> colour , with a tinge of yellow .
as the whole landscape is thus coloured , it has a sombre , dull appearance ; nor is it often <unk> by the rays of the sun .
december 20 , 1832 .
one side of the harbour is formed by a hill about 1500 feet high , which captain fitz <name> has called after sir j .
banks , in commemoration of his disastrous excursion which proved fatal to two men of his party , and nearly so to dr. <unk> .
the snow-storm , which was the cause of their misfortune , happened in the middle of <name> , corresponding to our july , and in the latitude of <unk> !
i was anxious to reach the summit of this mountain to collect alpine plants ; for flowers of any kind in the lower parts are few in number .
we followed the same watercourse as on the previous day , till it dwindled away , and we were then compelled to crawl blindly among the trees .
these , from the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds , were low , thick and crooked .
at length we reached that which from a distance appeared like a carpet of fine green turf , but which , to our vexation , turned out to be a compact mass of little <unk> about four or five feet high .
they were as thick together as box in the border of a garden , and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous surface .
after a little more trouble we gained the peat , and then the bare slate rock .
a ridge connected this hill with another , distant some miles , and more lofty , so that patches of snow were lying on it .
as the day was not far advanced , i determined to walk there and collect plants along the road .
it would have been very hard work , had it not been for a <unk> and straight path made by the guanacos ; for these animals , like sheep , always follow the same line .
when we reached the hill we found it the highest in the immediate neighbourhood , and the waters flowed to the sea in opposite directions .
we obtained a wide view over the surrounding country : to the north a swampy <unk> extended , but to the south we had a scene of savage magnificence , well becoming <name> <name> fuego .
there was a degree of mysterious grandeur in mountain behind mountain , with the deep intervening valleys , all covered by one thick , dusky mass of forest .
the atmosphere , likewise , in this climate , where <name> succeeds <name> , with rain , hail , and sleet , seems blacker than anywhere else .
in the strait of magellan , looking due southward from port famine , the distant channels between the mountains appeared from their <unk> to lead beyond the confines of this world .

the " beagle " got under way : and on the succeeding day , favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze , we closed in with the <unk> , and running past cape deceit with its stony peaks , about three o'clock doubled the weather-beaten cape horn .
the evening was calm and bright , and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding isles .
cape horn , however , demanded his tribute , and before night sent us a <name> of wind directly in our teeth .
we stood out to sea , and on the second day again made the land , when we saw on our <unk> this notorious promontory in its proper form  veiled in a mist , and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water .
great black clouds were rolling across the heavens , and squalls of rain , with hail , swept by us with such extreme violence , that the captain determined to run into wigwam cove .
this is a snug little harbour , not far from cape horn ; and here , at <unk> , we anchored in smooth water .
the only thing which reminded us of the <name> outside was every now and then a puff from the mountains , which made the ship surge at her anchors .
december 25 , 1832 .
close by the cove , a pointed hill , called <unk> 's peak , rises to the height of <unk> feet .
the surrounding islands all consist of conical masses of greenstone , associated sometimes with less regular hills of baked and altered clay-slate .
this part of <name> <name> fuego may be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of mountains already alluded to .
the cove takes its name of " wigwam " from some of the fuegian habitations ; but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so called with equal propriety .
the inhabitants , living chiefly upon <unk> , are obliged constantly to change their place of residence ; but they return at intervals to the same spots , as is evident from the piles of old shells , which must often amount to many tons in weight .
these heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green colour of certain plants , which invariably grow on them .
among these may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass , two very serviceable plants , the use of which has not been discovered by the natives .
the fuegian wigwam resembles , in size and dimensions , a <unk> .
it merely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground , and very imperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes .
the whole can not be the work of an hour , and it is only used for a few days .
at <unk> roads i saw a place where one of these naked men had slept , which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare .
the man was evidently living by himself , and york minster said he was " very bad man , " and that probably he had stolen something .
on the west coast , however , the wigwams are rather better , for they are covered with <unk> .
we were detained here several days by the bad weather .
the climate is certainly wretched : the summer <unk> was now past , yet every day snow fell on the hills , and in the valleys there was rain , accompanied by sleet .
the thermometer generally stood about 45 degrees , but in the night fell to 38 or 40 degrees .
from the damp and boisterous state of the atmosphere , not cheered by a gleam of <name> , one fancied the climate even worse than it really was .
while going one day on shore near wollaston island , we pulled alongside a canoe with six fuegians .
these were the most abject and miserable creatures i anywhere beheld .
on the east coast the natives , as we have seen , have guanaco cloaks , and on the west they possess <unk> .
amongst these central tribes the men generally have an <unk> , or some small scrap about as large as a pocket-handkerchief , which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins .
it is laced across the breast by strings , and according as the wind blows , it is shifted from side to side .
but these fuegians in the canoe were quite naked , and even one full-grown woman was absolutely so .
it was raining heavily , and the fresh water , together with the spray , trickled down her body .
in another harbour not far distant , a woman , who was suckling a <unk> child , came one day alongside the vessel , and remained there out of mere curiosity , whilst the sleet fell and thawed on her naked bosom , and on the skin of her naked baby !
these poor wretches were stunted in their growth , their hideous faces <unk> with white paint , their skins filthy and greasy , their hair entangled , their voices discordant , and their gestures violent .
viewing such men , one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow-creatures , and inhabitants of the same world .
it is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy : how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to these barbarians !
at night five or six human beings , naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate , sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals .
whenever it is low water , <name> or summer , night or day , they must rise to pick <unk> from the rocks ; and the women either dive to collect <unk> , or sit patiently in their canoes , and with a baited <unk> without any hook , jerk out little fish .
if a seal is killed , or the floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered , it is a feast ; and such miserable food is assisted by a few <unk> berries and <unk> .
they often suffer from famine : i heard mr. low , a <unk> intimately acquainted with the natives of this country , give a curious account of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the west coast , who were very thin and in great distress .
a succession of gales prevented the women from getting <unk> on the rocks , and they could not go out in their canoes to catch seal .
a small party of these men one morning set out , and the other indians explained to him that they were going a four days ' journey for food : on their return , low went to meet them , and he found them excessively tired , each man carrying a great square piece of putrid <unk> with a hole in the middle , through which they put their heads , like the gauchos do through their <unk> or cloaks .
as soon as the blubber was brought into a wigwam , an old man cut off thin slices , and muttering over them , broiled them for a minute , and distributed them to the famished party , who during this time preserved a profound silence .
mr. low believes that whenever a whale is cast on shore , the natives bury large pieces of it in the sand , as a resource in time of famine ; and a native boy , whom he had on board , once found a stock thus buried .
the different tribes when at war are cannibals .
from the <unk> , but quite independent evidence of the boy taken by mr. low , and of jemmy button , it is certainly true , that when pressed in <name> by hunger they kill and devour their old women before they kill their dogs : the boy , being asked by mr. low why they did this , answered , " <unk> catch <unk> , old women no . "
this boy described the manner in which they are killed by being held over smoke and thus choked ; he imitated their screams as a joke , and described the parts of their bodies which are considered best to eat .
horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and relatives must be , the fears of the old women , when hunger begins to press , are more painful to think of ; we were told that they then often run away into the mountains , but that they are pursued by the men and brought back to the <unk> at their own <unk> !
captain fitz <name> could never ascertain that the fuegians have any distinct belief in a future life .
they sometimes bury their dead in caves , and sometimes in the mountain forests ; we do not know what ceremonies they perform .
jemmy button would not eat land-birds , because " eat dead men " ; they are unwilling even to mention their dead friends .
we have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious worship ; though perhaps the muttering of the old man before he distributed the putrid blubber to his famished party may be of this nature .
each family or tribe has a wizard or <unk> doctor , whose office we could never clearly ascertain .
jemmy believed in dreams , though not , as i have said , in the devil : i do not think that our fuegians were much more superstitious than some of the sailors ; for an old quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy gales , which we encountered off cape horn , were caused by our having the fuegians on board .
the nearest approach to a religious feeling which i heard of , was shown by york minster , who , when mr. <unk> shot some very young <unk> as specimens , declared in the most solemn manner , " oh , mr. <unk> , much rain , snow , blow much . "
this was evidently a <unk> punishment for wasting human food .
in a wild and excited manner he also related that his brother one day , whilst returning to pick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast , observed some feathers blown by the wind .
his brother said ( york imitating his manner ) , " what that ? "
and crawling onwards , he peeped over the <name> , and saw " wild man " picking his birds ; he crawled a little nearer , and then hurled down a great stone and killed him .
york declared for a long time afterwards storms raged , and much rain and snow fell .
as far as we could make out , he seemed to consider the elements themselves as the avenging agents : it is evident in this case , how naturally , in a race a little more advanced in culture , the elements would become <unk> .
what the " bad wild men " were , has always appeared to me most mysterious : from what york said , when we found the place like the form of a hare , where a single man had slept the night before , i should have thought that they were thieves who had been driven from their tribes ; but other obscure speeches made me doubt this ; i have sometimes imagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane .
the different tribes have no government or chief ; yet each is surrounded by other hostile tribes , speaking different dialects , and separated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral territory : the cause of their warfare appears to be the means of subsistence .
their country is a broken mass of wild rocks , lofty hills , and useless forests : and these are viewed through mists and endless storms .
the habitable land is reduced to the stones on the beach ; in search of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from spot to spot , and so steep is the coast , that they can only move about in their wretched canoes .
they can not know the feeling of having a home , and still less that of domestic affection ; for the husband is to the wife a brutal master to a laborious slave .
was a more horrid deed ever perpetrated , than that witnessed on the west coast by <name> , who saw a wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying <unk> , whom her husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of <unk> !
how little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into play : what is there for imagination to picture , for reason to compare , for judgment to decide upon ?
to knock a <unk> from the rock does not require even cunning , that lowest power of the mind .
their skill in some respects may be compared to the instinct of animals ; for it is not improved by experience : the canoe , their most ingenious work , poor as it is , has remained the same , as we know from drake , for the last two hundred and fifty years .
whilst beholding these savages , one asks , whence have they come ?
what could have tempted , or what change compelled , a tribe of men , to leave the fine regions of the north , to travel down the cordillera or backbone of <name> , to invent and build canoes , which are not used by the tribes of chile , peru , and brazil , and then to enter on one of the most inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe ?
although such reflections must at first seize on the mind , yet we may feel sure that they are partly erroneous .
there is no reason to believe that the fuegians decrease in number ; therefore we must suppose that they enjoy a sufficient share of happiness , of whatever kind it may be , to render life worth having .
nature by making habit omnipotent , and its effects hereditary , has fitted the fuegian to the climate and the productions of his miserable country .

after having been detained six days in wigwam cove by very bad weather , we put to sea on the 30th of december .
captain fitz <name> wished to get westward to land york and <unk> in their own country .
when at sea we had a constant succession of gales , and the current was against us : we drifted to 57 degrees 23 ' south .
on the 11th of <name> , 1833 , by carrying a press of sail , we fetched within a few miles of the great rugged mountain of york minster ( so called by captain cook , and the origin of the name of the elder fuegian ) , when a violent squall compelled us to shorten sail and stand out to sea .
the surf was breaking fearfully on the coast , and the spray was carried over a <name> estimated at 200 feet in height .
on the 12th the <name> was very heavy , and we did not know exactly where we were : it was a most unpleasant sound to hear constantly repeated , " keep a good lookout to leeward . "
on the 13th the storm raged with its full fury : our horizon was narrowly limited by the sheets of spray borne by the wind .
the sea looked ominous , like a dreary waving plain with patches of drifted snow : whilst the ship laboured heavily , the albatross glided with its expanded wings right up the wind .
at noon a great sea broke over us , and filled one of the whale-boats , which was obliged to be instantly cut away .
the poor " beagle " trembled at the shock , and for a few minutes would not obey her helm ; but soon , like a good ship that she was , she righted and came up to the wind again .
had another sea followed the first , our fate would have been decided soon , and for ever .
we had now been twenty-four days trying in vain to get westward ; the men were worn out with fatigue , and they had not had for many nights or days a dry thing to put on .
captain fitz <name> gave up the attempt to get westward by the outside coast .
in the evening we ran in behind false cape horn , and dropped our anchor in forty-seven fathoms , fire flashing from the windlass as the chain rushed round it .
how delightful was that still night , after having been so long involved in the din of the warring elements !

<name> 15 , 1833 .
the " beagle " anchored in <unk> roads .
captain fitz <name> having resolved to settle the fuegians , according to their wishes , in <unk> sound , four boats were equipped to <name> them there through the beagle channel .
this channel , which was discovered by captain fitz <name> during the last voyage , is a most remarkable feature in the geography of this , or indeed of any other country : it may be compared to the valley of loch ness in scotland , with its chain of lakes and <unk> .
it is about one hundred and twenty miles long , with an average breadth , not subject to any very great variation , of about two miles ; and is throughout the greater part so perfectly straight , that the view , bounded on each side by a line of mountains , gradually becomes indistinct in the long distance .
it crosses the southern part of <name> <name> fuego in an east and west line , and in the middle is joined at right angles on the south side by an irregular channel , which has been called <unk> sound .
this is the residence of jemmy button 's tribe and family .
<name> 19 , 1833 .
three whale-boats and the yawl , with a party of twenty-eight , started under the command of captain fitz <name> .
in the afternoon we entered the eastern mouth of the channel , and shortly afterwards found a snug little cove concealed by some surrounding islets .
here we pitched our tents and lighted our fires .
nothing could look more comfortable than this scene .
the glassy water of the little harbour , with the branches of the trees hanging over the <name> beach , the boats at anchor , the tents supported by the crossed oars , and the smoke curling up the wooded valley , formed a picture of quiet retirement .
the next day ( 20th ) we smoothly glided onwards in our little fleet , and came to a more inhabited district .
few if any of these natives could ever have seen a white man ; certainly nothing could exceed their astonishment at the apparition of the four boats .
fires were lighted on every point ( hence the name of <name> <name> fuego , or the land of fire ) , both to attract our attention and to spread far and wide the news .
some of the men ran for miles along the shore .
i shall never forget how wild and savage one group appeared : suddenly four or five men came to the edge of an overhanging <name> ; they were absolutely naked , and their long hair streamed about their faces ; they held rugged <unk> in their hands , and , springing from the ground , they waved their arms round their heads , and sent forth the most hideous yells .
at dinner-time we landed among a party of fuegians .
at first they were not inclined to be friendly ; for until the captain pulled in ahead of the other boats , they kept their slings in their hands .
we soon , however , delighted them by trifling presents , such as tying red tape round their heads .
they liked our biscuit : but one of the savages touched with his finger some of the meat preserved in tin cases which i was eating , and feeling it soft and cold , showed as much disgust at it , as i should have done at putrid blubber .
jemmy was thoroughly ashamed of his countrymen , and declared his own tribe were quite different , in which he was <unk> mistaken .
it was as easy to please as it was difficult to satisfy these savages .
young and old , men and children , never ceased repeating the word " <unk> , " which means " give me . "
after pointing to almost every object , one after the other , even to the buttons on our coats , and saying their favourite word in as many <unk> as possible , they would then use it in a neuter sense , and vacantly repeat " <unk> . "
after <unk> for any article very eagerly , they would by a simple artifice point to their young women or little children , as much as to say , " if you <name> not give it me , surely you <name> to such as these . "
at night we endeavoured in vain to find an uninhabited cove ; and at last were obliged to bivouac not far from a party of natives .
they were very inoffensive as long as they were few in <name> , but in the morning ( 21st ) being joined by others they showed symptoms of hostility , and we thought that we should have come to a skirmish .
an european labours under great disadvantages when treating with savages like these who have not the least idea of the power of firearms .
in the very act of <unk> his musket he appears to the savage far inferior to a man armed with a bow and arrow , a spear , or even a sling .
nor is it easy to teach them our superiority except by striking a fatal blow .
like wild beasts , they do not appear to compare <name> ; for each individual , if attacked , instead of retiring , <name> endeavour to dash your brains out with a stone , as certainly as a tiger under similar circumstances would tear you .
captain fitz <name> , on one occasion being very anxious , from good reasons , to frighten away a small party , first flourished a cutlass near them , at which they only laughed ; he then twice fired his pistol close to a native .
the man both times looked astounded , and carefully but quickly rubbed his head ; he then stared awhile , and <unk> to his companions , but he never seemed to think of running away .
we can hardly put ourselves in the position of these savages , and understand their actions .
in the case of this fuegian , the possibility of such a sound as the report of a gun close to his ear could never have entered his mind .
he perhaps literally did not for a second know whether it was a sound or a blow , and therefore very naturally rubbed his head .
in a similar manner , when a savage sees a <name> struck by a bullet , it may be some time before he is able at all to understand how it is effected ; for the fact of a body being invisible from its velocity would perhaps be to him an idea totally inconceivable .
moreover , the extreme force of a bullet that penetrates a hard substance without tearing it , may convince the savage that it has no force at all .
certainly i believe that many savages of the lowest grade , such as these of <name> <name> fuego , have seen objects struck , and even small animals killed by the musket , without being in the least aware how deadly an instrument it is .
<name> 22 , 1833 .
after having passed an unmolested night , in what would appear to be neutral territory between jemmy 's tribe and the people whom we saw yesterday , we sailed pleasantly along .
i do not know anything which shows more clearly the hostile state of the different tribes , than these wide border or neutral tracts .
although jemmy button well knew the force of our party , he was , at first , unwilling to land amidst the hostile tribe nearest to his own .
he often told us how the savage <unk> men " when the leaf red , " crossed the mountains from the eastern coast of <name> <name> fuego , and made inroads on the natives of this part of the country .
it was most curious to watch him when thus talking , and see his eyes gleaming and his whole face assume a new and wild expression .
as we proceeded along the beagle channel , the scenery assumed a peculiar and very magnificent character ; but the effect was much lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat , and from looking along the valley , and thus losing all the beauty of a succession of ridges .
the mountains were here about three thousand feet high , and terminated in sharp and jagged points .
they rose in one unbroken sweep from the <unk> edge , and were covered to the height of fourteen or fifteen hundred feet by the <unk> forest .
it was most curious to observe , as far as the eye could range , how level and truly horizontal the line on the mountain side was , at which trees ceased to grow : it precisely resembled the high-water <name> of <unk> on a sea-beach .
at night we slept close to the junction of <unk> sound with the beagle channel .
a small family of fuegians , who were living in the cove , were quiet and inoffensive , and soon joined our party round a blazing fire .
we were well clothed , and though sitting close to the fire were far from too warm ; yet these naked savages , though farther off , were observed , to our great surprise , to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting .
they seemed , however , very well pleased , and all joined in the chorus of the seamen 's songs : but the manner in which they were invariably a little <unk> was quite ludicrous .
during the night the news had spread , and early in the morning ( 23rd ) a fresh party arrived , belonging to the <unk> , or <unk> tribe .
several of them had run so fast that their noses were bleeding , and their mouths <unk> from the rapidity with which they talked ; and with their naked bodies all <unk> with black , white , and red , they looked like so many <unk> who had been fighting .
( <unk> .
this substance , when dry , is tolerably compact , and of little specific gravity : professor ehrenberg has examined it : he states " <unk> akad .
der <unk> " berlin february 1845 , that it is composed of infusoria , including fourteen <unk> and four <unk> .
he says that they are all inhabitants of fresh water ; this is a beautiful example of the results <unk> through professor ehrenberg 's microscopic researches ; for jemmy button told me that it is always collected at the bottoms of <unk> .
it is , moreover , a striking fact in the geographical distribution of the infusoria , which are well known to have very wide ranges , that all the species in this substance , although brought from the extreme southern point of <name> <name> fuego , are old , known forms . )
we then proceeded ( accompanied by twelve canoes , each holding four or five people ) down <unk> sound to the spot where poor jemmy expected to find his mother and relatives .
he had already heard that his father was dead ; but as he had had a " dream in his head " to that effect , he did not seem to care much about it , and repeatedly comforted himself with the very natural reflection  " me no help it . "
he was not able to learn any particulars regarding his father 's death , as his relations would not speak about it .
jemmy was now in a district well known to him , and guided the boats to a quiet pretty cove named <unk> , surrounded by islets , every one of which and every point had its proper native name .
we found here a family of jemmy 's tribe , but not his relations : we made friends with them ; and in the evening they sent a canoe to inform jemmy 's mother and brothers .
the cove was bordered by some acres of good sloping land , not covered ( as elsewhere ) either by peat or by <unk> .
captain fitz <name> originally intended , as before stated , to have taken york minster and <unk> to their own tribe on the west coast ; but as they expressed a wish to remain here , and as the spot was singularly favourable , captain fitz <name> determined to settle here the whole party , including matthews , the missionary .
five days were spent in building for them three large wigwams , in landing their goods , in digging two gardens , and sowing seeds .
the next morning after our arrival ( the 24th ) the fuegians began to pour in , and jemmy 's mother and brothers arrived .
jemmy recognised the <unk> voice of one of his brothers at a prodigious distance .
the meeting was less interesting than that between a horse , turned out into a field , when he joins an old companion .
there was no demonstration of affection ; they simply stared for a short time at each other ; and the mother immediately went to look after her canoe .
we heard , however , through york that the mother had been <unk> for the loss of jemmy , and had searched everywhere for him , thinking that he might have been left after having been taken in the boat .
the women took much notice of and were very kind to <unk> .
we had already perceived that jemmy had almost forgotten his own language .
i should think there was scarcely another human being with so small a stock of language , for his english was very imperfect .
it was laughable , but almost pitiable , to hear him speak to his wild brother in english , and then ask him in spanish ( " no <unk> ? " )
whether he did not understand him .
everything went on peaceably during the three next days , whilst the gardens were digging and wigwams building .
we estimated the number of natives at about one hundred and twenty .
the women worked hard , whilst the men lounged about all day long , watching us .
they asked for everything they saw , and stole what they could .
they were delighted at our dancing and singing , and were particularly interested at seeing us wash in a neighbouring <name> ; they did not pay much attention to anything else , not even to our boats .
of all the things which york saw , during his absence from his country , nothing seems more to have astonished him than an ostrich , near maldonado : breathless with astonishment he came running to mr. <unk> , with whom he was out walking  " oh , mr. <unk> , oh , bird all same horse ! "
much as our white skins surprised the natives , by mr. low 's account a <unk> to a <unk> vessel did so more effectually , and the poor fellow was so mobbed and shouted at that he would never go on shore again .
everything went on so quietly , that some of the officers and myself took long walks in the surrounding hills and woods .
suddenly , however , on the 27th , every woman and child disappeared .
we were all uneasy at this , as neither york nor jemmy could make out the cause .
it was thought by some that they had been frightened by our cleaning and firing off our muskets on the previous evening : by others , that it was owing to offence taken by an old savage , who , when told to keep farther off , had coolly spit in the sentry 's face , and had then , by gestures acted over a sleeping fuegian , plainly showed , as it was said , that he should like to cut up and eat our man .
captain fitz <name> , to avoid the chance of an encounter , which would have been fatal to so many of the fuegians , thought it advisable for us to sleep at a cove a few miles distant .
matthews , with his usual quiet fortitude ( remarkable in a man apparently possessing little energy of character ) , determined to stay with the fuegians , who evinced no alarm for themselves ; and so we left them to pass their first awful night .
on our return in the morning ( 28th ) we were delighted to find all quiet , and the men employed in their canoes <unk> fish .
captain fitz <name> determined to send the yawl and one <unk> back to the ship ; and to proceed with the two other boats , one under his own command ( in which he most kindly allowed me to accompany him ) , and one under mr. hammond , to survey the western parts of the beagle channel , and afterwards to return and visit the settlement .
the day to our astonishment was <unk> hot , so that our skins were scorched ; with this beautiful weather , the view in the middle of the beagle channel was very remarkable .
looking towards either hand , no object intercepted the vanishing points of this long canal between the mountains .
the circumstance of its being an arm of the sea was rendered very evident by several huge whales spouting in different directions .
( <unk> .
one day , off the east coast of <name> <name> fuego , we saw a grand sight in several spermaceti whales jumping upright quite out of the water , with the exception of their <unk> .
as they fell down sideways , they splashed the water high up , and the sound <unk> like a distant broadside . )
on one occasion i saw two of these monsters , probably male and female , slowly swimming one after the other , within less than a <unk> throw of the shore , over which the <unk> extended its branches .
we sailed on till it was dark , and then pitched our tents in a quiet creek .
the greatest luxury was to find for our beds a beach of pebbles , for they were dry and yielded to the body .
peaty soil is damp ; rock is uneven and hard ; sand gets into one 's meat , when cooked and eaten <unk> ; but when lying in our <unk> , on a good bed of smooth pebbles , we passed most comfortable nights .
it was my watch till one o'clock .
there is something very solemn in these scenes .
at no time does the consciousness in what a remote corner of the world you are then standing come so strongly before the mind .
everything tends to this effect ; the stillness of the night is interrupted only by the heavy breathing of the seamen beneath the tents , and sometimes by the cry of a <unk> .
the occasional barking of a dog , heard in the distance , reminds one that it is the land of the savage .
<name> 29 , 1833 .
early in the morning we arrived at the point where the beagle channel divides into two arms ; and we entered the northern one .
the scenery here becomes even grander than before .
the lofty mountains on the north side compose the granitic axis , or backbone of the country , and boldly rise to a height of between three and four thousand feet , with one peak above six thousand feet .
they are covered by a wide mantle of perpetual snow , and numerous cascades pour their waters , through the woods , into the narrow channel below .
in many parts , magnificent glaciers extend from the mountain side to the water 's edge .
it is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the <unk> blue of these glaciers , and especially as contrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow .
the fragments which had fallen from the glacier into the water were floating away , and the channel with its icebergs presented , for the space of a mile , a miniature likeness of the polar sea .
the boats being hauled on shore at our <unk> , we were admiring from the distance of half a mile a perpendicular <name> of ice , and were wishing that some more fragments would fall .
at last , down came a mass with a roaring noise , and immediately we saw the smooth outline of a wave travelling towards us .
the men ran down as quickly as they could to the boats ; for the chance of their being dashed to pieces was evident .
one of the seamen just caught hold of the bows , as the curling <unk> reached it : he was knocked over and over , but not hurt , and the boats , though thrice lifted on high and let fall again , received no damage .
this was most fortunate for us , for we were a hundred miles distant from the ship , and we should have been left without provisions or firearms .
i had previously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach had been lately displaced ; but until seeing this wave i did not understand the cause .
one side of the creek was formed by a spur of mica-slate ; the head by a <name> of ice about forty feet high ; and the other side by a promontory fifty feet high , built up of huge rounded fragments of granite and mica-slate , out of which old trees were growing .
this promontory was evidently a moraine , heaped up at a period when the glacier had greater dimensions .
when we reached the western mouth of this northern branch of the beagle channel , we sailed amongst many unknown desolate islands , and the weather was <unk> bad .
we met with no natives .
the coast was almost everywhere so steep that we had several times to pull many miles before we could find space enough to pitch our two tents : one night we slept on large round boulders , with <unk> sea-weed between them ; and when the tide rose , we had to get up and move our <unk> .
the farthest point westward which we reached was <name> island , a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles from our ship .
we returned into the beagle channel by the southern arm , and thence proceeded , with no adventure , back to <unk> sound .
february 6 , 1833 .
we arrived at <unk> .
matthews gave so bad an account of the conduct of the fuegians , that captain fitz <name> determined to take him back to the " beagle " ; and ultimately he was left at new zealand , where his brother was a missionary .
from the time of our leaving , a regular system of plunder commenced ; fresh parties of the natives kept arriving : york and jemmy lost many things , and matthews almost everything which had not been concealed underground .
every article seemed to have been torn up and divided by the natives .
matthews described the watch he was obliged always to keep as most harassing ; night and day he was surrounded by the natives , who tried to tire him out by making an incessant noise close to his head .
one day an old man , whom matthews asked to leave his wigwam , immediately returned with a large stone in his hand : another day a whole party came armed with stones and stakes , and some of the younger men and jemmy 's brother were crying : matthews met them with presents .
another party showed by signs that they wished to strip him naked and pluck all the hairs out of his face and body .
i think we arrived just in time to save his life .
<unk> relatives had been so vain and foolish , that they had showed to strangers their plunder , and their manner of obtaining it .
it was quite melancholy leaving the three fuegians with their savage countrymen ; but it was a great comfort that they had no personal fears .
york , being a powerful resolute man , was pretty sure to get on well , together with his wife <unk> .
poor jemmy looked rather disconsolate , and would then , i have little doubt , have been glad to have returned with us .
his own brother had stolen many things from him ; and as he remarked , " what fashion call that : " he abused his countrymen , " all bad men , no <unk> ( know ) nothing " and , though i never heard him swear before , " damned fools . "
our three fuegians , though they had been only three years with civilised men , would , i am sure , have been glad to have retained their new habits ; but this was obviously impossible .
i fear it is more than doubtful whether their visit <name> have been of any use to them .
in the evening , with matthews on board , we made sail back to the ship , not by the beagle channel , but by the southern coast .
the boats were heavily laden and the sea rough , and we had a dangerous passage .
by the evening of the 7th we were on board the " beagle " after an absence of twenty days , during which time we had gone three hundred miles in the open boats .
on the 11th captain fitz <name> paid a visit by himself to the fuegians and found them going on well ; and that they had lost very few more things .
on the last day of february in the succeeding year ( 1834 ) the " beagle " anchored in a beautiful little cove at the eastern entrance of the beagle channel .
captain fitz <name> determined on the bold , and as it proved successful , attempt to beat against the westerly winds by the same route which we had followed in the boats to the settlement at <unk> .
we did not see many natives until we were near <unk> sound , where we were followed by ten or twelve canoes .
the natives did not at all understand the reason of our <unk> , and , instead of meeting us at each tack , vainly strove to follow us in our zigzag course .
i was amused at finding what a difference the circumstance of being quite superior in force made , in the interest of beholding these savages .
while in the boats i got to hate the very sound of their voices , so much trouble did they give us .
the first and last word was " <unk> . "
when , entering some quiet little cove , we have looked round and thought to pass a quiet night , the odious word " <unk> " has shrilly sounded from some gloomy nook , and then the little <unk> has curled up to spread the news far and wide .
on leaving some place we have said to each other , " thank heaven , we have at last fairly left these wretches ! "
when one more faint halloo from an all-powerful voice , heard at a prodigious distance , would reach our ears , and clearly could we distinguish  " <unk> . "
but now , the more fuegians the <unk> ; and very <name> work it was .
both parties laughing , wondering , gaping at each other ; we pitying them , for giving us good fish and crabs for rags , etc .
; they grasping at the chance of finding people so foolish as to exchange such splendid ornaments for a good supper .
it was most amusing to see the undisguised smile of satisfaction with which one young woman with her face painted black , tied several bits of <name> cloth round her head with rushes .
her husband , who enjoyed the very universal privilege in this country of possessing two wives , evidently became jealous of all the attention paid to his young wife ; and , after a consultation with his naked beauties , was paddled away by them .
some of the fuegians plainly showed that they had a fair notion of barter .
i gave one man a large nail ( a most valuable present ) without making any signs for a return ; but he immediately picked out two fish , and handed them up on the point of his spear .
if any present was designed for one canoe , and it fell near another , it was invariably given to the right owner .
the fuegian boy , whom mr. low had on board , showed , by going into the most violent passion , that he quite understood the reproach of being called a liar , which in truth he was .
we were this time , as on all former occasions , much surprised at the little notice , or rather none whatever , which was taken of many things , the use of which must have been evident to the natives .
simple circumstances  such as the beauty of <name> cloth or blue beads , the absence of women , our care in washing ourselves ,  excited their admiration far more than any grand or complicated object , such as our ship .
<unk> has well remarked concerning these people , that they treat the " <unk> <unk> de <unk> humaine , comme ils <unk> <name> <unk> de la nature et ses <unk> . "
on the 5th of march we anchored in a cove at <unk> , but we saw not a soul there .
we were alarmed at this , for the natives in <unk> sound showed by gestures that there had been fighting ; and we afterwards heard that the dreaded <unk> men had made a descent .
soon a canoe , with a little flag flying , was seen approaching , with one of the men in it washing the paint off his face .
this man was poor jemmy ,  now a thin , haggard savage , with long disordered hair , and naked , except a bit of blanket round his waist .
we did not recognize him till he was close to us , for he was ashamed of himself , and turned his back to the ship .
we had left him plump , fat , clean , and well-dressed ;  i never saw so complete and grievous a change .
as soon however as he was clothed , and the first flurry was over , things wore a good appearance .
he dined with captain fitz <name> , and ate his dinner as <unk> as formerly .
he told us that he had " too much " ( meaning enough ) to eat , that he was not cold , that his relations were very good people , and that he did not wish to go back to england : in the evening we found out the cause of this great change in jemmy 's feelings , in the arrival of his young and <unk> wife .
with his usual good feeling , he brought two beautiful <unk> for two of his best friends , and some <unk> and arrows made with his own hands for the captain .
he said he had built a canoe for himself , and he boasted that he could talk a little of his own language !
but it is a most singular fact , that he appears to have taught all his tribe some english : an old man spontaneously announced " jemmy button 's wife . "
jemmy had lost all his property .
he told us that york minster had built a large canoe , and with his wife <unk> , had several months since gone to his own country , and had taken farewell by an act of consummate villainy ; he persuaded jemmy and his mother to come with him , and then on the way deserted them by night , stealing every article of their property .
( <unk> .
captain sulivan , who , since his voyage in the " beagle , " has been employed on the survey of the falkland islands , heard from a <unk> in ( 1842 ?
) , that when in the western part of the strait of magellan , he was astonished by a native woman coming on board , who could talk some english .
without doubt this was <unk> basket .
she lived ( i fear the term probably bears a double interpretation ) some days on board . )
jemmy went to sleep on shore , and in the morning returned , and remained on board till the ship got under weigh , which frightened his wife , who continued crying violently till he got into his canoe .
he returned loaded with valuable property .
every soul on board was heartily sorry to shake hands with him for the last time .
i do not now doubt that he <name> be as happy as , perhaps happier than , if he had never left his own country .
every one must sincerely <name> that captain fitz <name> 's <name> <name> may be fulfilled , of being rewarded for the many generous sacrifices which he made for these fuegians , by some shipwrecked sailor being protected by the descendants of jemmy button and his tribe !
when jemmy reached the shore , he lighted a signal fire , and the smoke curled up , bidding us a last and long farewell , as the ship stood on her course into the open sea .
the perfect equality among the individuals composing the fuegian tribes must for a long time retard their civilisation .
as we see those animals , whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a chief , are most capable of improvement , so is it with the races of mankind .
whether we look at it as a cause or a consequence , the more civilised always have the most artificial governments .
for instance , the inhabitants of <unk> , who , when first discovered , were governed by hereditary kings , had arrived at a far higher grade than another branch of the same people , the new zealanders ,  who , although benefited by being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture , were republicans in the most absolute sense .
in <name> <name> fuego , until some chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired advantage , such as the domesticated animals , it seems scarcely possible that the political state of the country can be improved .
at present , even a piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and distributed ; and no one individual becomes richer than another .
on the other hand , it is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is property of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and increase his power .
i believe , in this extreme part of south <name> , man exists in a lower state of improvement than in any other part of the world .
the south sea islanders , of the two races inhabiting the pacific , are comparatively civilised .
the esquimaux , in his subterranean hut , enjoys some of the comforts of life , and in his canoe , when fully equipped , <unk> much skill .
some of the tribes of southern africa , prowling about in search of roots , and living concealed on the wild and arid plains , are sufficiently wretched .
the australian , in the simplicity of the arts of life , comes nearest the fuegian : he can , however , boast of his boomerang , his spear and <unk> , his method of climbing trees , of tracking animals , and of hunting .
although the australian may be superior in acquirements , it by no means follows that he is likewise superior in mental capacity : indeed , from what i saw of the fuegians when on board and from what i have read of the australians , i should think the case was exactly the reverse .

recapitulation .
strait of <unk>  climate of the southern coasts .
in the end of may 1834 we entered for a second time the eastern mouth of the strait of magellan .
the country on both sides of this part of the strait consists of nearly level plains , like those of patagonia .
cape negro , a little within the second narrows , may be considered as the point where the land begins to assume the marked features of <name> <name> fuego .
on the east coast , south of the strait , broken <unk> scenery in a like manner connects these two countries , which are opposed to each other in almost every feature .
it is truly surprising to find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape .
if we take a rather greater distance , as between port famine and <name> bay , that is about sixty miles , the difference is still more wonderful .
at the former place we have rounded mountains concealed by impervious forests , which are drenched with the rain brought by an endless succession of gales ; while at cape <name> there is a clear and bright blue sky over the dry and sterile plains .
the atmospheric currents , although rapid , turbulent , and <unk> by any apparent limits , yet seem to follow , like a river in its bed , a regularly determined course .
( <unk> .
the <unk> breezes are generally very dry .
<name> 29th , being at anchor under cape <name> : a very hard <name> from west by south , clear sky with few <unk> ; temperature 57 degrees , <unk> 36 degrees ,  difference 21 degrees .
on <name> 15th , at port st. <name> : in the morning light winds with much rain , followed by a very heavy squall with rain ,  settled into heavy <name> with large <unk> ,  cleared up , blowing very strong from <unk> .
temperature 60 degrees , <unk> 42 degrees ,  difference 18 degrees . )
during our previous visit ( in <name> ) , we had an interview at cape <name> with the famous so-called gigantic <unk> , who gave us a cordial reception .
their height appears greater than it really is , from their large guanaco <unk> , their long flowing hair , and general figure : on an average their height is about six feet , with some men taller and only a few shorter ; and the women are also tall ; altogether they are certainly the tallest race which we anywhere saw .
in features they strikingly resemble the more northern indians whom i saw with rosas , but they have a wilder and more formidable appearance : their faces were much painted with red and black , and one man was ringed and dotted with white like a fuegian .
captain fitz <name> offered to take any three of them on board , and all seemed determined to be of the three .
it was long before we could clear the boat ; at last we got on board with our three giants , who dined with the captain , and behaved quite like gentlemen , helping themselves with knives , forks , and spoons : nothing was so much <unk> as sugar .
this tribe has had so much communication with sealers and whalers , that most of the men can speak a little english and spanish ; and they are half civilised , and proportionally <unk> .
the next morning a large party went on shore , to barter for skins and <unk> ; <unk> being refused , tobacco was in greatest request , far more so than axes or tools .
the whole population of the <unk> , men , women , and children , were arranged on a bank .
it was an amusing scene , and it was impossible not to like the so-called giants , they were so thoroughly <unk> and unsuspecting : they asked us to come again .
they seem to like to have europeans to live with them ; and old <name> , an important woman in the tribe , once begged mr. low to leave any one of his sailors with them .
they spend the greater part of the year here ; but in summer they hunt along the foot of the cordillera : sometimes they travel as far as the rio negro , <unk> miles to the north .
they are well stocked with horses , each man having , according to mr. low , six or seven , and all the women , and even children , their one own horse .
in the time of <unk> ( <unk> ) these indians had bows and arrows , now long since disused ; they then also possessed some horses .
this is a very curious fact , showing the extraordinarily rapid multiplication of horses in south <name> .
the horse was first landed at buenos ayres in <unk> , and the colony being then for a time deserted , the horse ran wild ( <unk> .
rengger " natur .
der <unk> <name> paraguay " s .
334 .
) ; in <unk> , only forty-three years afterwards , we hear of them at the strait of magellan !
mr. low informs me , that a neighbouring tribe of <unk> is now changing into <unk> : the tribe at <name> bay giving them their worn-out horses , and sending in <name> a few of their best skilled men to hunt for them .
<name> 1 , 1834 .
( plate 52 .
port famine , magellan . )
we anchored in the fine bay of port famine .
it was now the beginning of <name> , and i never saw a more cheerless prospect ; the dusky woods , piebald with snow , could be only seen indistinctly through a <unk> hazy atmosphere .
we were , however , lucky in getting two fine days .
on one of these , mount <unk> , a distant mountain <unk> feet high , presented a very <name> spectacle .
i was frequently surprised , in the scenery of <name> <name> fuego , at the little apparent elevation of mountains really lofty .
i suspect it is owing to a cause which would not at first be imagined , namely , that the whole mass , from the summit to the water 's edge , is generally in full view .
i remember having seen a mountain , first from the beagle channel , where the whole sweep from the summit to the base was full in view , and then from <unk> sound across several successive ridges ; and it was curious to observe in the latter case , as each fresh ridge afforded fresh means of judging of the distance , how the mountain rose in height .
before reaching port famine , two men were seen running along the shore and hailing the ship .
a boat was sent for them .
they turned out to be two sailors who had run away from a <unk> , and had joined the <unk> .
these indians had treated them with their usual disinterested hospitality .
they had parted company through accident , and were then proceeding to port famine in hopes of finding some ship .
i daresay they were worthless vagabonds , but i never saw more <unk> ones .
they had been living for some days on <unk> and berries , and their tattered clothes had been burnt by sleeping so near their fires .
they had been exposed night and day , without any shelter , to the late incessant gales , with rain , sleet , and snow , and yet they were in good health .
( plate 53 .
patagonian bolas . )
( plate 54 .
patagonian spurs and pipe . )
during our stay at port famine , the fuegians twice came and plagued us .
as there were many instruments , clothes , and men on shore , it was thought necessary to frighten them away .
the first time a few great guns were fired , when they were far distant .
it was most ludicrous to watch through a glass the indians , as often as the shot struck the water , take up stones , and , as a bold defiance , throw them towards the ship , though about a mile and a half distant !
a boat was then sent with orders to fire a few <unk> wide of them .
the fuegians hid themselves behind the trees , and for every discharge of the muskets they fired their arrows ; all , however , fell short of the boat , and the officer as he pointed at them laughed .
this made the fuegians frantic with passion , and they shook their <unk> in vain rage .
at last , seeing the balls cut and strike the trees , they ran away , and we were left in peace and quietness .
during the former voyage the fuegians were here very troublesome , and to frighten them a rocket was fired at night over their wigwams ; it answered effectually , and one of the officers told me that the clamour first raised , and the barking of the dogs , was quite ludicrous in contrast with the profound silence which in a minute or two afterwards prevailed .
the next morning not a single fuegian was in the neighbourhood .
when the " beagle " was here in the month of february , i started one morning at four o'clock to ascend mount tarn , which is <unk> feet high , and is the most elevated point in this immediate district .
we went in a boat to the foot of the mountain ( but unluckily not to the best part ) , and then began our ascent .
the forest commences at the line of high-water <name> , and during the first two hours i gave over all hopes of reaching the summit .
so thick was the wood , that it was necessary to have constant recourse to the compass ; for every landmark , though in a mountainous country , was completely shut out .
in the deep ravines the <unk> scene of desolation exceeded all description ; outside it was blowing a <name> , but in these hollows not even a breath of wind stirred the leaves of the tallest trees .
so gloomy , cold , and wet was every part , that not even the <unk> , mosses , or ferns could flourish .
in the valleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along , they were so completely barricaded by great mouldering trunks , which had fallen down in every direction .
when passing over these natural bridges , one's course was often arrested by sinking knee deep into the rotten wood ; at other times , when attempting to <name> against a firm tree , one was startled by finding a mass of decayed matter ready to fall at the slightest touch .
we at last found ourselves among the stunted trees , and then soon reached the bare ridge , which conducted us to the summit .
here was a view characteristic of <name> <name> fuego ; irregular chains of hills , mottled with patches of snow , deep <unk> valleys , and arms of the sea intersecting the land in many directions .
the strong wind was <unk> cold , and the atmosphere rather hazy , so that we did not stay long on the top of the mountain .
our descent was not quite so laborious as our ascent , for the weight of the body forced a passage , and all the slips and falls were in the right direction .
i have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the evergreen forests , in which two or three species of trees grow , to the exclusion of all others .
( <unk> .
captain fitz <name> informs me that in <name> ( our october ) the leaves of those trees which grow near the base of the mountains change colour , but not those on the more elevated parts .
i remember having read some observations , showing that in england the leaves fall earlier in a warm and fine autumn than in a late and cold one .
the change in the colour being here retarded in the more elevated , and therefore colder situations , must be owing to the same general law of vegetation .
the trees of <name> <name> fuego during no part of the year entirely shed their leaves . )
above the forest land there are many dwarf alpine plants , which all spring from the mass of peat , and help to compose it : these plants are very remarkable from their close alliance with the species growing on the mountains of europe , though so many thousand miles distant .
the central part of <name> <name> fuego , where the clay-slate formation occurs , is most favourable to the growth of trees ; on the outer coast the poorer granitic soil , and a situation more exposed to the violent winds , do not allow of their attaining any great size .
near port famine i have seen more large trees than anywhere else : i measured a <name> 's bark which was four feet six inches in girth , and several of the beech were as much as thirteen feet .
captain king also mentions a beech which was seven feet in diameter seventeen feet above the roots .
( plate 55 .
<unk> darwinii . )
there is one vegetable production deserving notice from its importance as an article of food to the fuegians .
it is a globular , <unk> fungus , which grows in vast <name> on the <unk> .
when young it is elastic and <unk> , with a smooth surface ; but when mature , it shrinks , becomes <unk> , and has its entire surface deeply pitted or honeycombed , as represented in plate 55 .
this fungus belongs to a new and curious genus ( <unk> .
described from my specimens and notes by the reverend j.m .
berkeley in the " linnean transactions " volume 19 <name> 37 , under the name of <unk> darwinii : the <unk> species is the c. <unk> .
this genus is allied to <unk> .
) ; i found a second species on another species of beech in chile : and dr. hooker informs me that just lately a third species has been discovered on a third species of beech in van <unk> 's land .
how singular is this relationship between <unk> <unk> and the trees on which they grow , in distant parts of the world !
in <name> <name> fuego the fungus in its tough and mature state is collected in large quantities by the women and children , and is eaten <unk> .
it has a <unk> , slightly sweet taste , with a faint smell like that of a mushroom .
with the exception of a few berries , chiefly of a dwarf <unk> , the natives eat no vegetable food besides this fungus .
in new zealand , before the introduction of the potato , the roots of the <name> were largely consumed ; at the present time , i believe , <name> <name> fuego is the only country in the world where a <unk> plant affords a staple article of food .
the zoology of <name> <name> fuego , as might have been expected from the nature of its climate and vegetation , is very poor .
of mammalia , besides whales and seals , there is one bat , a kind of mouse ( <unk> <unk> ) , two true mice , a ctenomys allied to or identical with the <unk> , two foxes ( canis magellanicus and c. azarae ) , a <unk> , the guanaco , and a deer .
most of these animals inhabit only the <unk> eastern parts of the country ; and the deer has never been seen south of the strait of magellan .
observing the general correspondence of the cliffs of soft sandstone , mud , and shingle , on the opposite sides of the strait , and on some intervening islands , one is strongly tempted to believe that the land was once joined , and thus allowed animals so delicate and helpless as the <unk> and <unk> to pass over .
the correspondence of the cliffs is far from proving any junction ; because such cliffs generally are formed by the intersection of sloping deposits , which , before the elevation of the land , had been accumulated near the then existing shores .
it is , however , a remarkable coincidence , that in the two large islands cut off by the beagle channel from the rest of <name> <name> fuego , one has cliffs composed of matter that may be called stratified <unk> , which front similar ones on the opposite side of the channel ,  while the other is exclusively bordered by old crystalline rocks ; in the former , called <unk> island , both foxes and guanacos occur ; but in the latter , <unk> island , although similar in every respect , and only separated by a channel a little more than half a mile wide , i have the word of jemmy button for saying that neither of these animals is found .
the gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds : occasionally the plaintive note of a <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) may be heard , concealed near the summit of the most lofty trees ; and more rarely the loud strange cry of a black woodpecker , with a fine <name> crest on its head .
a little , <unk> wren ( <unk> magellanicus ) hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the fallen and decaying trunks .
but the creeper ( <unk> <unk> ) is the commonest bird in the country .
throughout the beech forests , high up and low down , in the most gloomy , wet , and impenetrable ravines , it may be met with .
this little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it really is , from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any person who enters these silent woods : continually uttering a harsh <unk> , it <unk> from tree to tree , within a few feet of the <unk> face .
it is far from wishing for the modest concealment of the true creeper ( <unk> <unk> ) ; nor does it , like that bird , run up the trunks of trees , but industriously , after the manner of a <unk> , hops about , and searches for insects on every twig and branch .
in the more open parts , three or four species of finches , a thrush , a starling ( or <unk> ) , two <unk> , and several hawks and owls occur .
the absence of any species whatever in the whole class of reptiles is a marked feature in the zoology of this country , as well as in that of the falkland islands .
i do not ground this statement merely on my own observation , but i heard it from the spanish inhabitants of the latter place , and from jemmy button with regard to <name> <name> fuego .
on the banks of the <name> <name> , in 50 degrees south , i saw a frog ; and it is not improbable that these animals , as well as lizards , may be found as far south as the strait of magellan , where the country retains the character of patagonia ; but within the damp and cold limit of <name> <name> fuego not one occurs .
that the climate would not have suited some of the orders , such as lizards , might have been foreseen ; but with respect to frogs , this was not so obvious .
beetles occur in very small <name> : it was long before i could believe that a country as large as scotland , covered with vegetable productions and with a variety of stations , could be so unproductive .
the few which i found were alpine species ( <unk> and <unk> ) living under stones .
the <unk> <unk> , so eminently characteristic of the tropics , are here almost entirely absent ( <unk> .
i believe i must except one alpine <unk> , and a single specimen of a <unk> .
mr. waterhouse informs me , that of the <unk> there are eight or nine species  the forms of the greater number being very peculiar ; of <unk> , four or five species ; of <unk> , six or seven ; and of the following families one species in each : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the species in the other orders are even fewer .
in all the orders , the scarcity of the individuals is even more remarkable than that of the species .
most of the coleoptera have been carefully described by mr. waterhouse in the " annals of natural history .
" ) ; i saw very few flies , butterflies , or bees , and no crickets or orthoptera .
in the pools of water i found but few aquatic beetles , and not any fresh-water shells : <unk> at first appears an exception ; but here it must be called a terrestrial shell , for it lives on the damp herbage far from water .
land-shells could be procured only in the same alpine situations with the beetles .
i have already contrasted the climate as well as the general appearance of <name> <name> fuego with that of patagonia ; and the difference is strongly exemplified in the entomology .
i do not believe they have one species in common ; certainly the general character of the insects is widely different .
if we turn from the land to the sea , we shall find the latter as abundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly so .
in all parts of the world a <name> and partially protected shore perhaps supports , in a given space , a greater number of individual animals than any other station .
there is one <name> production which , from its importance , is worthy of a particular history .
it is the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
this plant grows on every rock from <unk> <name> to a great depth , both on the outer coast and within the channels .
( <unk> .
its geographical range is remarkably wide ; it is found from the extreme southern islets near cape horn , as far north on the eastern coast ( according to information given me by mr. stokes ) as latitude 43 degrees ,  but on the western coast , as dr. hooker tells me , it extends to the r. san <name> in california , and perhaps even to <unk> .
we thus have an immense range in latitude ; and as cook , who must have been well acquainted with the species , found it at kerguelen land , no less than 140 degrees in longitude . )
i believe , during the voyages of the " adventure " and " beagle , " not one rock near the surface was discovered which was not buoyed by this floating weed .
the good service it thus affords to vessels <unk> near this <name> land is evident ; and it certainly has saved many a one from being wrecked .
i know few things more surprising than to see this plant growing and flourishing amidst those great breakers of the western ocean , which no mass of rock , let it be ever so hard , can long resist .
the stem is round , slimy , and smooth , and seldom has a diameter of so much as an inch .
a few taken together are sufficiently strong to support the weight of the large loose stones , to which in the inland channels they grow attached ; and yet some of these stones were so heavy that when drawn to the surface , they could scarcely be lifted into a boat by one person .
captain cook , in his second voyage , says that this plant at kerguelen land rises from a greater depth than twenty-four fathoms ; " and as it does not grow in a perpendicular direction , but makes a very acute <name> with the bottom , and much of it afterwards spreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea , i am well warranted to say that some of it grows to the length of sixty fathoms and upwards . "
i do not suppose the stem of any other plant attains so great a length as three hundred and sixty feet , as stated by captain cook .
captain fitz <name> , moreover , found it growing up from the greater depth of forty-five fathoms .
( <unk> .
" voyages of the <unk> ' and 'beagle ' " volume 1 <name> 363 .
it appears that seaweed grows extremely quick .
mr. stephenson found <name> 's " voyage round scotland " volume 2 <name> 228 , that a rock uncovered only at <unk> , which had been <unk> smooth in november , on the following may , that is , within six months afterwards , was thickly covered with <unk> <unk> two feet , and f. <unk> six feet , in length . )
the beds of this sea-weed , even when of not great breadth , make excellent natural floating <unk> .
it is quite curious to see , in an exposed harbour , how soon the waves from the open sea , as they travel through the straggling stems , sink in height , and pass into smooth water .
the number of living creatures of all orders , whose existence intimately depends on the <unk> , is wonderful .
a great volume might be written , describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of seaweed .
almost all the leaves , excepting those that float on the surface , are so thickly <unk> with corallines as to be of a white colour .
we find exquisitely delicate structures , some inhabited by simple <unk> <unk> , others by more organised kinds , and beautiful compound <unk> .
on the leaves , also , various <unk> shells , <unk> , uncovered molluscs , and some <unk> are attached .
innumerable crustacea frequent every part of the plant .
on shaking the great entangled roots , a pile of small fish , shells , <unk> , crabs of all orders , <unk> , <unk> , beautiful <unk> , <unk> , and crawling <unk> animals of a multitude of forms , all fall out together .
often as i recurred to a branch of the <unk> , i never failed to discover animals of new and curious structures .
in chiloe , where the <unk> does not thrive very well , the numerous shells , corallines , and crustacea are absent ; but there yet remain a few of the <unk> , and some compound <unk> ; the latter , however , are of different species from those in <name> <name> fuego ; we see here the <unk> possessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an abode .
i can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions .
yet if in any country a forest was destroyed , i do not believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as would here , from the destruction of the <unk> .
amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live , which nowhere else could find food or shelter ; with their destruction the many <unk> and other fishing birds , the <unk> , seals , and porpoises , would soon perish also ; and lastly , the fuegian savage , the miserable lord of this miserable land , would <unk> his <unk> feast , decrease in <name> , and perhaps cease to exist .
<name> 8 , 1834 .
we weighed anchor early in the morning and left port famine .
captain fitz <name> determined to leave the strait of magellan by the <name> channel , which had not long been discovered .
our course lay due south , down that gloomy passage which i have before alluded to as appearing to lead to another and worse world .
the wind was fair , but the atmosphere was very thick ; so that we missed much curious scenery .
the dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains , from their summits nearly down to their bases .
the glimpses which we caught through the dusky mass were highly interesting ; jagged points , cones of snow , blue glaciers , strong outlines , marked on a lurid sky , were seen at different distances and heights .
in the midst of such scenery we anchored at cape turn , close to mount <unk> , which was then hidden in the clouds .
at the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides of our little cove there was one deserted wigwam , and it alone reminded us that man sometimes wandered into these desolate regions .
but it would be difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer claims or less authority .
the inanimate works of nature  rock , ice , snow , wind , and water , all warring with each other , yet combined against man  here reigned in absolute sovereignty .
<name> 9 , 1834 .
in the morning we were delighted by seeing the veil of mist gradually rise from <unk> , and display it to our view .
this mountain , which is one of the highest in <name> <name> fuego , has an altitude of <unk> feet .
its base , for about an eighth of its total height , is clothed by dusky woods , and above this a field of snow extends to the summit .
these vast piles of snow , which never melt , and seem destined to last as long as the world holds together , present a <name> and even sublime spectacle .
the outline of the mountain was admirably clear and defined .
owing to the abundance of light reflected from the white and glittering surface , no shadows were cast on any part ; and those lines which intersected the sky could alone be distinguished : hence the mass stood out in the boldest relief .
several glaciers descended in a winding course from the upper great expanse of snow to the sea-coast : they may be likened to great frozen <unk> ; and perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are full as beautiful as the moving ones of water .
by night we reached the western part of the channel ; but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be found .
we were in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this narrow arm of the sea , during a pitch-dark night of fourteen hours long .
<name> 10 , 1834 .
in the morning we made the best of our way into the open pacific .
the western coast generally consists of low , rounded , quite barren hills of granite and greenstone .
sir j. <unk> called one part south desolation , because it is " so desolate a land to behold : " and well indeed might he say so .
outside the main islands there are numberless scattered rocks on which the long swell of the open ocean incessantly <unk> .
we passed out between the east and west furies ; and a little farther northward there are so many breakers that the sea is called the milky way .
one sight of such a coast is enough to make a landsman dream for a week about <unk> , peril , and death ; and with this sight we bade farewell for ever to <name> <name> fuego .
the following discussion on the climate of the southern parts of the continent with relation to its productions , on the snow-line , on the extraordinarily low descent of the glaciers , and on the zone of perpetual <unk> in the antarctic islands , may be passed over by any one not interested in these curious subjects , or the final recapitulation alone may be read .
i shall , however , here give only an abstract , and must refer for details to the thirteenth chapter and the appendix of the former edition of this work .
on the climate and productions of <name> <name> fuego and of the south-west coast .
the following table gives the mean temperature of <name> <name> fuego , the falkland islands , and , for comparison , that of dublin :  latitude summer <name> mean of summer degrees ' <unk> .

according to <name> buch the mean temperature of july ( not the hottest month in the year ) at <unk> in norway , is as high as <unk> degrees , and this place is actually 13 degrees nearer the pole than port famine !
( <unk> .
with respect to <name> <name> fuego , the results are deduced from the observations of captain king " geographical journal " 1830 , and those taken on board the " beagle . "
for the falkland islands , i am indebted to captain sulivan for the mean of the mean temperature ( reduced from careful observation at midnight , 8 a.m. , noon , and 8 p.m. ) of the three hottest months , namely , december , <name> , and february .
the temperature of dublin is taken from <name> . )
inhospitable as this climate appears to our feelings , evergreen trees flourish luxuriantly under it .
humming-birds may be seen sucking the flowers , and parrots feeding on the seeds of the <name> 's bark , in latitude 55 degrees south .
i have already remarked to what a degree the sea swarms with living creatures ; and the shells ( such as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and barnacles ) , according to mr. g.b .
sowerby , are of a much larger size , and of a more vigorous growth , than the analogous species in the northern hemisphere .
a large voluta is abundant in southern <name> <name> fuego and the falkland islands .
at bahia <name> , in latitude 39 degrees south , the most abundant shells were three species of <name> ( one of large size ) , one or two <unk> , and a <unk> .
now these are amongst the best characterised tropical forms .
it is doubtful whether even one small species of <name> exists on the southern shores of europe , and there are no species of the two other genera .
if a geologist were to find in latitude 39 degrees on the coast of portugal a bed containing numerous shells belonging to three species of <name> , to a voluta , and <unk> , he would probably assert that the climate at the period of their existence must have been tropical ; but , judging from south <name> , such an inference might be erroneous .
the equable , humid , and <name> climate of <name> <name> fuego extends , with only a small increase of heat , for many degrees along the west coast of the continent .
the forests for 600 miles northward of cape horn , have a very similar aspect .
as a proof of the equable climate , even for 300 or 400 miles still farther northward , i may mention that in chiloe ( corresponding in latitude with the northern parts of spain ) the peach seldom produces fruit , whilst strawberries and apples thrive to perfection .
even the crops of barley and wheat are often brought into the houses to be dried and ripened .

at valdivia ( in the same latitude of 40 degrees with madrid ) grapes and figs ripen , but are not common ; olives seldom ripen even partially , and oranges not at all .
these fruits , in corresponding latitudes in europe , are well known to succeed to perfection ; and even in this continent , at the rio negro , under nearly the same parallel with valdivia , sweet potatoes ( convolvulus ) are cultivated ; and grapes , figs , olives , oranges , water and musk melons , produce abundant fruit .
although the humid and equable climate of chiloe , and of the coast northward and southward of it , is so unfavourable to our fruits , yet the native forests , from latitude 45 to 38 degrees , almost rival in luxuriance those of the glowing intertropical regions .
stately trees of many kinds , with smooth and highly coloured barks , are loaded by <unk> <unk> plants ; large and elegant ferns are numerous , and <unk> grasses <unk> the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or forty feet above the ground .
palm-trees grow in latitude 37 degrees ; an <unk> grass , very like a bamboo , in 40 degrees ; and another closely allied kind , of great length , but not erect , flourishes even as far south as 45 degrees south .
on the height of the snow-line , and on the descent of the glaciers , in south <name> .
for the detailed authorities for the following table , i must refer to the former edition :  height in feet latitude of snow-line observer                                 equatorial region ; mean result <unk> humboldt .

an equable climate , evidently due to the large area of sea compared with the land , seems to extend over the greater part of the southern hemisphere ; and as a consequence , the vegetation partakes of a <unk> character .
<unk> thrive luxuriantly in van diemen 's land ( latitude 45 degrees ) , and i measured one trunk no less than six feet in circumference .
an <unk> <name> was found by forster in new zealand in 46 degrees , where <unk> plants are <unk> on the trees .
in the auckland islands , ferns , according to dr. <unk> have trunks so thick and high that they may be almost called <unk> ; and in these islands , and even as far south as latitude 55 degrees in the <unk> islands , parrots abound .
( <unk> .
see the <name> translation of this journal ; and for the other facts mr. brown 's appendix to <unk> " voyage . " )
as the height of the plane of perpetual snow seems chiefly to be determined by the extreme heat of the summer , rather than by the mean temperature of the year , we ought not to be surprised at its descent in the strait of magellan , where the summer is so cool , to only <unk> or <unk> feet above the level of the sea ; although in norway , we must travel to between latitude 67 and 70 degrees north , that is , about 14 degrees nearer the pole , to meet with perpetual snow at this low level .
the difference in height , namely , about <unk> feet , between the snow-line on the cordillera behind chiloe ( with its highest points ranging from only <unk> to <unk> feet ) and in central chile ( a distance of only 9 degrees of latitude ) , is truly wonderful .
( <unk> .
on the cordillera of central chile , i believe the snow-line varies exceedingly in height in different summers .
i was assured that during one very dry and long summer , all the snow disappeared from aconcagua , although it attains the prodigious height of <unk> feet .
it is probable that much of the snow at these great heights is evaporated , rather than thawed . )
the land from the southward of chiloe to near <name> ( latitude 37 degrees ) is hidden by one dense forest dripping with moisture .
the sky is cloudy , and we have seen how badly the fruits of southern europe succeed .
in central chile , on the other hand , a little northward of <name> , the sky is generally clear , rain does not fall for the seven summer months , and southern european fruits succeed admirably ; and even the sugar-cane has been cultivated .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " chile " volume 1 <name> 415 .
it is said that the sugar-cane grew at <unk> , latitude 32 to 33 degrees , but not in sufficient quantity to make the manufacture profitable .
in the valley of quillota , south of <unk> , i saw some large <unk> trees . )
no doubt the plane of perpetual snow undergoes the above remarkable flexure of <unk> feet , unparalleled in other parts of the world , not far from the latitude of <name> , where the land ceases to be covered with <unk> ; for trees in south <name> indicate a rainy climate , and rain a clouded sky and little heat in summer .
( plate 56 .
<unk> sound . )
the descent of glaciers to the sea must , i conceive , mainly depend ( subject , of course , to a proper supply of snow in the upper region ) on the lowness of the line of perpetual snow on steep mountains near the coast .
as the snow-line is so low in <name> <name> fuego , we might have expected that many of the glaciers would have reached the sea .
nevertheless i was astonished when i first saw a range , only from 3000 to <unk> feet in height , in the latitude of cumberland , with every valley filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast .
almost every arm of the sea , which penetrates to the interior higher chain , not only in <name> <name> fuego , but on the coast for <unk> miles northwards , is terminated by " tremendous and astonishing glaciers , " as described by one of the officers on the survey .
great masses of ice frequently fall from these icy cliffs , and the crash <unk> like the broadside of a man-of-war through the lonely channels .
these falls , as noticed in the last chapter , produce great waves which break on the adjoining coasts .
it is known that earthquakes frequently cause masses of earth to fall from <unk> : how terrific , then , would be the effect of a severe shock ( and such occur here ( <unk> .
<unk> 's and <unk> " faithful narrative of the loss of the wager . "
the earthquake happened <name> 25 , <unk> . ) )
on a body like a glacier , already in motion , and traversed by fissures !
i can readily believe that the water would be fairly beaten back out of the deepest channel , and then , returning with an overwhelming force , would whirl about huge masses of rock like so much chaff .
in <unk> 's sound , in the latitude of <name> , there are immense glaciers , and yet the loftiest neighbouring mountain is only <unk> feet high .
in this sound , about fifty icebergs were seen at one time floating outwards , and one of them must have been at least 168 feet in total height .
some of the icebergs were loaded with blocks of no inconsiderable size , of granite and other rocks , different from the clay-slate of the surrounding mountains .
( plate 57 .
glacier in gulf of <unk> . )
the glacier farthest from the pole , surveyed during the voyages of the " adventure " and " beagle , " is in latitude 46 degrees 50 ' , in the gulf of <unk> .
it is 15 miles long , and in one part 7 broad , and descends to the sea-coast .
but even a few miles northward of this glacier , in the laguna de san <name> , some spanish missionaries encountered " many icebergs , some great , some small , and others <unk> , " in a narrow arm of the sea , on the 22 of the month corresponding with our <name> , and in a latitude corresponding with that of the lake of <name> !
( <unk> .
<unk> " <unk> .
hist .
de <unk> " <name> 227 . )
in europe , the most southern glacier which comes down to the sea is met with , according to <name> buch , on the coast of norway , in latitude 67 degrees .
now , this is more than 20 degrees of latitude , or <unk> miles , nearer the pole than the laguna de san <name> .
the position of the glaciers at this place and in the gulf of <unk> may be put even in a more striking point of view , for they descend to the sea-coast within 7 1/2 degrees of latitude , or 450 miles , of a harbour , where three species of <name> , a voluta , and a <unk> , are the commonest shells , within less than 9 degrees from where palms grow , within 4 1/2 degrees of a region where the jaguar and puma range over the plains , less than 2 1/2 degrees from <unk> grasses , and ( looking to the westward in the same hemisphere ) less than 2 degrees from <unk> parasites , and within a single degree of <unk> !
these facts are of high geological interest with respect to the climate of the northern hemisphere , at the period when boulders were transported .
i <name> not here detail how simply the theory of icebergs being charged with fragments of rock explains the origin and position of the gigantic boulders of eastern <name> <name> fuego , on the high plain of <name> <name> , and on the island of chiloe .
in <name> <name> fuego the greater number of boulders lie on the lines of old <unk> , now converted into dry valleys by the elevation of the land .
they are associated with a great <unk> formation of mud and sand , containing rounded and angular fragments of all sizes , which has originated in the repeated ploughing up of the <unk> by the <unk> of icebergs , and by the matter transported on them .
( <unk> .
" geological transactions " volume 6 <name> 415 . )
few geologists now doubt that those erratic boulders which lie near lofty mountains have been pushed forward by the glaciers themselves , and that those distant from mountains , and embedded in <unk> deposits , have been conveyed thither either on icebergs , or frozen in <unk> .
the connection between the transportal of boulders and the presence of ice in some form , is strikingly shown by their geographical distribution over the earth .
in south <name> they are not found farther than 48 degrees of latitude , measured from the southern pole ; in north <name> it appears that the limit of their transportal extends to 53 1/2 degrees from the northern pole ; but in europe to not more than 40 degrees of latitude , measured from the same point .
on the other hand , in the intertropical parts of <name> , <name> , and africa , they have never been observed ; nor at the cape of good <name> , nor in australia .
( <unk> .
i have given details ( the first , i believe , published ) on this subject in the first edition , and in the appendix to it .
i have there shown that the apparent exceptions to the absence of erratic boulders in certain hot countries are due to erroneous observations ; several statements there given i have since found confirmed by various authors . )
on the climate and productions of the antarctic islands .
considering the <unk> of the vegetation in <name> <name> fuego , and on the coast northward of it , the condition of the islands south and south-west of <name> is truly surprising .
sandwich land , in the latitude of the north part of scotland , was found by cook , during the hottest month of the year , " covered many fathoms thick with everlasting snow ; " and there seems to be scarcely any vegetation .
<name> , an island 96 miles long and 10 broad , in the latitude of yorkshire , " in the very height of summer , is in a manner wholly covered with frozen snow . "
it can boast only of moss , some tufts of grass , and wild <unk> ; it has only one <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , yet iceland , which is 10 degrees nearer the pole , has , according to <name> , fifteen land-birds .
the south shetland islands , in the same latitude as the southern half of norway , possess only some lichens , moss , and a little grass ; and lieutenant <name> found the bay in which he was at anchor , beginning to freeze at a period corresponding with our 8th of <name> .
( <unk> .
" geographical journal " 1830 pages 65 , 66 . )
the soil here consists of ice and volcanic ashes interstratified ; and at a little depth beneath the surface it must remain perpetually <unk> , for lieutenant <name> found the body of a foreign sailor which had long been buried , with the flesh and all the features perfectly preserved .
it is a singular fact that on the two great continents in the northern hemisphere ( but not in the broken land of europe between them ) we have the zone of perpetually frozen <unk> in a low latitude  namely , in 56 degrees in north <name> at the depth of three feet ( <unk> .
richardson 's " append .
to back 's <unk> . "
and humboldt 's " <unk> .
<unk> . "
tome 2 <name> 386 .
) , and in 62 degrees in siberia at the depth of twelve to fifteen feet  as the result of a directly opposite condition of things to those of the southern hemisphere .
on the northern continents , the <name> is rendered excessively cold by the radiation from a large area of land into a clear sky , nor is it <unk> by the <unk> currents of the sea ; the short summer , on the other hand , is hot .
in the southern ocean the <name> is not so excessively cold , but the summer is far less hot , for the clouded sky seldom allows the sun to warm the ocean , itself a bad <unk> of heat : and hence the mean temperature of the year , which <unk> the zone of perpetually <unk> <unk> , is low .
it is evident that a rank vegetation , which does not so much require heat as it does protection from intense cold , would approach much nearer to this zone of perpetual <unk> under the equable climate of the southern hemisphere , than under the extreme climate of the northern continents .
the case of the sailor 's body perfectly preserved in the icy soil of the south shetland islands ( latitude 62 to 63 degrees south ) , in a rather lower latitude than that ( latitude 64 degrees north ) under which pallas found the frozen rhinoceros in siberia , is very interesting .
although it is a fallacy , as i have endeavoured to show in a former chapter , to suppose that the larger quadrupeds require a luxuriant vegetation for their support , nevertheless it is important to find in the south shetland islands a frozen <unk> within 360 miles of the <unk> islands near cape horn , where , as far as the bulk of vegetation is concerned , any number of great quadrupeds might be supported .
the perfect preservation of the carcasses of the siberian elephants and <unk> is certainly one of the most wonderful facts in geology ; but independently of the imagined difficulty of supplying them with food from the adjoining countries , the whole case is not , i think , so perplexing as it has generally been considered .
the plains of siberia , like those of the pampas , appear to have been formed under the sea , into which rivers brought down the bodies of many animals ; of the greater number of these only the skeletons have been preserved , but of others the perfect carcass .
now it is known that in the shallow sea on the arctic coast of <name> the bottom <unk> ( <unk> .
messrs. <unk> and simpson , in " geographical journal " volume 8 pages 218 and 220 .
) , and does not thaw in spring so soon as the surface of the land , moreover , at greater depths , where the bottom of the sea does not freeze , the mud a few feet beneath the top layer might remain even in summer below 32 degrees , as is the case on the land with the soil at the depth of a few feet .
at still greater depths the temperature of the mud and water would probably not be low enough to preserve the flesh ; and hence , carcasses drifted beyond the shallow parts near an arctic coast , would have only their skeletons preserved : now in the extreme northern parts of siberia bones are infinitely numerous , so that even islets are said to be almost composed of them ( <unk> .
cuvier " <unk> <unk> " tome 1 <name> 151 , from <unk> 's " voyage .
" ) ; and those islets lie no less than ten degrees of latitude north of the place where pallas found the frozen rhinoceros .
on the other hand , a carcass washed by a flood into a shallow part of the arctic sea , would be preserved for an indefinite period , if it were soon afterwards covered with mud sufficiently thick to prevent the heat of the summer water penetrating to it ; and if , when the <unk> was upraised into land , the covering was sufficiently thick to prevent the heat of the summer air and sun thawing and <unk> it .

recapitulation .
i <name> recapitulate the principal facts with regard to the climate , <unk> , and organic productions of the southern hemisphere , <unk> the places in imagination to europe , with which we are so much better acquainted .
then , near lisbon , the commonest sea-shells , namely , three species of <name> , a voluta , and a <unk> , would have a tropical character .
in the southern provinces of <name> , magnificent forests , <unk> by <unk> grasses and with the trees loaded with <unk> plants , would hide the face of the land .
the puma and the jaguar would haunt the pyrenees .
in the latitude of mont blanc , but on an island as far westward as central north <name> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> would thrive amidst the thick woods .
even as far north as central denmark humming-birds would be seen fluttering about delicate flowers , and parrots feeding amidst the evergreen woods ; and in the sea there we should have a voluta , and all the shells of large size and vigorous growth .
nevertheless , on some islands only 360 miles northward of our new cape horn in denmark , a carcass buried in the soil ( or if washed into a shallow sea , and covered up with mud ) would be preserved perpetually frozen .
if some bold navigator attempted to penetrate northward of these islands , he would run a thousand dangers amidst gigantic icebergs , on some of which he would see great blocks of rock borne far away from their original site .
another island of large size in the latitude of southern scotland , but twice as far to the west , would be " almost wholly covered with everlasting snow , " and would have each bay terminated by <unk> , whence great masses would be yearly detached : this island would boast only of a little moss , grass , and <unk> , and a <unk> would be its only land inhabitant .
from our new cape horn in denmark , a chain of mountains , scarcely half the height of the alps , would run in a straight line due southward ; and on its western flank every deep creek of the sea , or <unk> , would end in " bold and astonishing glaciers . "
these lonely channels would frequently <unk> with the falls of ice , and so often would great waves rush along their coasts ; numerous icebergs , some as tall as cathedrals , and occasionally loaded with " no inconsiderable blocks of rock , " would be stranded on the outlying islets ; at intervals violent earthquakes would shoot prodigious masses of ice into the waters below .
lastly , some missionaries attempting to penetrate a long arm of the sea , would behold the not lofty surrounding mountains , sending down their many grand icy streams to the sea-coast , and their progress in the boats would be checked by the innumerable floating icebergs , some small and some great ; and this would have occurred on our twenty-second of <name> , and where the lake of <name> is now spread out !
( <unk> .
in the former edition and appendix , i have given some facts on the transportal of erratic boulders and icebergs in the antarctic ocean .
this subject has lately been treated excellently by mr. hayes , in the " boston journal " volume 4 <name> 426 .
the author does not appear aware of a case published by me " geographical journal " volume 9 <name> <unk> , of a gigantic boulder embedded in an iceberg in the antarctic ocean , almost certainly one hundred miles distant from any land , and perhaps much more distant .
in the appendix i have discussed at length the probability ( at that time hardly thought of ) of icebergs , when stranded , <unk> and polishing rocks , like glaciers .
this is now a very commonly received opinion ; and i can not still avoid the suspicion that it is applicable even to such cases as that of the <unk> .
dr. richardson has assured me that the icebergs off north <name> push before them pebbles and sand , and leave the submarine <name> flats quite bare ; it is hardly possible to doubt that such ledges must be polished and scored in the direction of the set of the prevailing currents .
since writing that appendix i have seen in north wales " london philosophical magazine " volume 21 <name> 180 ) the adjoining action of glaciers and floating icebergs .

july 23 , 1834 .
the " beagle " anchored late at night in the bay of valparaiso , the chief seaport of chile .
when morning came , everything appeared delightful .
after <name> <name> fuego , the climate felt quite delicious  the atmosphere so dry , and the heavens so clear and blue with the sun shining brightly , that all nature seemed sparkling with life .
the view from the anchorage is very pretty .
the town is built at the very foot of a range of hills , about 1600 feet high , and rather steep .
from its position , it consists of one long , straggling street , which runs parallel to the beach , and wherever a ravine comes down , the houses are piled up on each side of it .
the rounded hills , being only partially protected by a very scanty vegetation , are worn into numberless little gullies , which expose a singularly bright red soil .
from this cause , and from the low whitewashed houses with tile roofs , the view reminded me of st. <name> in teneriffe .
in a <unk> direction there are some fine glimpses of the andes : but these mountains appear much grander when viewed from the neighbouring hills : the great distance at which they are situated can then more readily be perceived .
the volcano of aconcagua is particularly magnificent .
this huge and irregularly conical mass has an elevation greater than that of <unk> ; for , from measurements made by the officers in the " beagle , " its height is no less than <unk> feet .
the cordillera , however , viewed from this point , owe the greater part of their beauty to the atmosphere through which they are seen .
when the sun was setting in the pacific , it was admirable to watch how clearly their rugged outlines could be distinguished , yet how varied and how delicate were the shades of their colour .
i had the good fortune to find living here mr. <name> <unk> , an old <unk> and friend , to whose hospitality and kindness i was greatly indebted , in having afforded me a most pleasant residence during the " beagle 's " stay in chile .
the immediate neighbourhood of valparaiso is not very productive to the naturalist .
during the long summer the wind blows steadily from the southward , and a little off shore , so that rain never falls ; during the three <name> months , however , it is sufficiently abundant .
the vegetation in consequence is very scanty : except in some deep valleys there are no trees , and only a little grass and a few low bushes are scattered over the less steep parts of the hills .
when we reflect that at the distance of 350 miles to the south , this side of the andes is completely hidden by one impenetrable forest , the contrast is very remarkable .
i took several long walks while collecting objects of natural history .
the country is pleasant for exercise .
there are many very beautiful flowers ; and , as in most other dry climates , the plants and shrubs possess strong and peculiar odours  even one 's clothes by brushing through them became scented .
i did not cease from wonder at finding each succeeding day as fine as the foregoing .
what a difference does climate make in the enjoyment of life !
how opposite are the sensations when viewing black mountains <unk> in clouds , and seeing another range through the light blue haze of a fine day !
the one for a time may be very sublime ; the other is all gaiety and happy life .
<name> 14 , 1834 .
i set out on a riding excursion , for the purpose of <unk> the basal parts of the andes , which alone at this time of the year are not shut up by the <name> snow .
our first day 's ride was northward along the sea-coast .
after dark we reached the <unk> of <unk> , the estate which formerly belonged to lord <unk> .
my object in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which stand some yards above the level of the sea , and are burnt for lime .
the proofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal : at the height of a few hundred feet <unk> shells are numerous , and i found some at <unk> feet .
these shells either lie loose on the surface , or are embedded in a <unk> vegetable mould .
i was much surprised to find under the microscope that this vegetable mould is really <name> mud , full of minute particles of organic bodies .
<name> 15 , 1834 .
we returned towards the valley of quillota .
the country was exceedingly pleasant ; just such as poets would call pastoral : green open lawns , separated by small valleys with rivulets , and the cottages , we may suppose of the shepherds , scattered on the hill-sides .
we were obliged to cross the ridge of the <unk> .
at its base there were many fine evergreen <unk> , but these flourished only in the ravines , where there was running water .
any person who had seen only the country near valparaiso would never have imagined that there had been such picturesque spots in chile .
as soon as we reached the brow of the <name> , the valley of quillota was immediately under our feet .
the prospect was one of remarkable artificial luxuriance .
the valley is very broad and quite flat , and is thus easily irrigated in all parts .
the little square gardens are crowded with orange and <name> trees and every sort of vegetable .
on each side huge bare mountains rise , and this from the contrast renders the <unk> valley the more pleasing .
whoever called " valparaiso " the " valley of paradise , " must have been thinking of quillota .
we crossed over to the <unk> de san <name> , situated at the very foot of the <name> mountain .
( plate 61 .
<unk> , condor , cactus , etc . )
chile , as may be seen in the maps , is a narrow strip of land between the cordillera and the pacific ; and this strip is itself traversed by several <unk> , which in this part run parallel to the great range .
between these outer lines and the main cordillera , a succession of level basins , generally opening into each other by narrow passages , extend far to the southward : in these , the principal towns are situated , as san <name> , <name> , san <name> .
these basins or plains , together with the transverse flat valleys ( like that of quillota ) which connect them with the coast , i have no doubt are the bottoms of ancient <unk> and deep bays , such as at the present day intersect every part of <name> <name> fuego and the western coast .
chile must formerly have resembled the latter country in the <unk> of its land and water .
the resemblance was occasionally shown strikingly when a level <unk> covered , as with a mantle , all the lower parts of the country : the white vapour curling into the ravines , beautifully represented little <unk> and bays ; and here and there a solitary hillock peeping up showed that it had formerly stood there as an islet .
the contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the irregular mountains gave the scenery a character which to me was new and very interesting .
from the natural slope to seaward of these plains , they are very easily irrigated , and in consequence singularly fertile .
without this process the land would produce scarcely anything , for during the whole summer the sky is cloudless .
the mountains and hills are dotted over with bushes and low trees , and excepting these the vegetation is very scanty .
each <unk> in the valley possesses a certain portion of <unk> , where his half-wild cattle , in considerable <name> , manage to find sufficient pasture .
once every year there is a grand " <unk> , " when all the cattle are driven down , counted , and marked , and a certain number separated to be <unk> in the irrigated fields .
wheat is extensively cultivated , and a good deal of indian corn : a kind of bean is , however , the staple article of food for the common labourers .
the orchards produce an overflowing abundance of peaches , figs , and grapes .
with all these advantages the inhabitants of the country ought to be much more prosperous than they are .
<name> 16 , 1834 .
the <unk> of the <unk> was good enough to give me a guide and fresh horses ; and in the morning we set out to ascend the <unk> , or <name> mountain , which is <unk> feet high .
the paths were very bad , but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble .
we reached , by the evening , a spring called the <unk> <name> guanaco , which is situated at a great height .
this must be an old name , for it is very many years since a guanaco drank its waters .
during the ascent i noticed that nothing but bushes grew on the northern slope , whilst on the southern slope there was a bamboo about fifteen feet high .
in a few places there were palms , and i was surprised to see one at an elevation of at least <unk> feet .
these palms are , for their family , ugly trees .
their stem is very large , and of a curious form , being thicker in the middle than at the base or top .
they are excessively numerous in some parts of chile , and valuable on account of a sort of <unk> made from the sap .
on one estate near <unk> they tried to count them , but failed , after having numbered several hundred thousand .
every year in the early spring , in <name> , very many are cut down , and when the trunk is lying on the ground , the crown of leaves is <unk> off .
the sap then immediately begins to flow from the upper end , and continues so doing for some months : it is , however , necessary that a thin slice should be shaved off from that end every morning , so as to expose a fresh surface .
a good tree <name> give ninety gallons , and all this must have been contained in the vessels of the apparently dry trunk .
it is said that the sap flows much more quickly on those days when the sun is powerful ; and likewise , that it is absolutely necessary to take care , in cutting down the tree , that it should fall with its head upwards on the side of the hill ; for if it falls down the slope , scarcely any sap <name> flow ; although in that case one would have thought that the action would have been aided , instead of checked , by the force of gravity .
the sap is concentrated by boiling , and is then called <unk> , which it very much resembles in taste .
we <unk> our horses near the spring , and prepared to pass the night .
the evening was fine , and the atmosphere so clear that the masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of valparaiso , although no less than twenty-six geographical miles distant , could be distinguished clearly as little black streaks .
a ship doubling the point under sail appeared as a bright white speck .
<unk> expresses much surprise , in his voyage , at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from the coast ; but he did not sufficiently allow for the height of the land and the great transparency of the air .
the setting of the sun was glorious ; the valleys being black , whilst the snowy peaks of the andes yet retained a <name> tint .
when it was dark , we made a fire beneath a little <unk> of bamboos , fried our <unk> ( or dried slips of beef ) , took our <unk> , and were quite comfortable .
there is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open air .
the evening was calm and still ;  the shrill noise of the mountain bizcacha , and the faint cry of a <unk> , were occasionally to be heard .
besides these , few birds , or even insects , frequent these dry , parched mountains .
<name> 17 , 1834 .
in the morning we climbed up the rough mass of greenstone which crowns the summit .
this rock , as frequently happens , was much shattered and broken into huge angular fragments .
i observed , however , one remarkable circumstance , namely , that many of the surfaces presented every degree of freshness  some appearing as if broken the day before , whilst on others lichens had either just become , or had long grown , attached .
i so fully believed that this was owing to the frequent earthquakes , that i felt inclined to hurry from below each loose pile .
as one might very easily be deceived in a fact of this kind , i doubted its accuracy , until ascending mount wellington , in van diemen 's land , where earthquakes do not occur ; and there i saw the summit of the mountain similarly composed and similarly shattered , but all the blocks appeared as if they had been hurled into their present position thousands of years ago .
we spent the day on the summit , and i never enjoyed one more thoroughly .
chile , bounded by the andes and the pacific , was seen as in a map .
the pleasure from the scenery , in itself beautiful , was heightened by the many reflections which arose from the mere view of the <unk> range with its lesser parallel ones , and of the broad valley of quillota directly intersecting them .
who can avoid wondering at the force which has upheaved these mountains , and even more so at the countless ages which it must have required to have broken through , removed , and levelled whole masses of them ?
it is well in this case to call to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of patagonia , which , if heaped on the cordillera , would increase its height by so many thousand feet .
when in that country , i wondered how any <unk> could have supplied such masses , and not have been utterly obliterated .
we must not now reverse the wonder , and doubt whether all-powerful time can grind down mountains  even the gigantic cordillera  into gravel and mud .
the appearance of the andes was different from that which i had expected .
the lower line of the snow was of course horizontal , and to this line the even summits of the range seemed quite parallel .
only at long intervals a group of points or a single cone showed where a volcano had existed , or does now exist .
hence the range resembled a great solid wall , surmounted here and there by a tower , and making a most perfect barrier to the country .
almost every part of the hill had been drilled by attempts to open <unk> : the rage for mining has left scarcely a spot in chile <unk> .
i spent the evening as before , talking round the fire with my two companions .
the <unk> of chile , who correspond to the gauchos of the pampas , are , however , a very different set of beings .
chile is the more civilised of the two countries , and the inhabitants , in consequence , have lost much individual character .
gradations in rank are much more strongly marked : the <unk> does not by any means consider every man his equal ; and i was quite surprised to find that my companions did not like to eat at the same time with myself .
this feeling of inequality is a necessary consequence of the existence of an aristocracy of wealth .
it is said that some few of the greater <unk> possess from five to ten thousand pounds <name> per annum : an inequality of riches which i believe is not met with in any of the <unk> countries eastward of the andes .
a traveller does not here meet that unbounded hospitality which refuses all payment , but yet is so kindly offered that no scruples can be raised in accepting it .
almost every house in chile <name> receive you for the night , but a trifle is expected to be given in the morning ; even a <name> man <name> accept two or three shillings .
the gaucho , although he may be a <unk> , is a gentleman ; the <unk> is in few respects better , but at the same time a vulgar , ordinary fellow .
the two men , although employed much in the same manner , are different in their habits and attire ; and the peculiarities of each are universal in their respective countries .
the gaucho seems part of his horse , and <unk> to exert himself excepting when on its back ; the <unk> may be hired to work as a <unk> in the fields .
the former lives entirely on animal food ; the latter almost wholly on vegetable .
we do not here see the white boots , the broad drawers , and <name> <unk> ; the picturesque costume of the pampas .
here , common trousers are protected by black and green worsted leggings .
the <unk> , however , is common to both .
the chief pride of the <unk> lies in his spurs , which are absurdly large .
i measured one which was six inches in the diameter of the <unk> , and the <unk> itself contained upwards of thirty points .
the stirrups are on the same scale , each consisting of a square , carved block of wood , hollowed out , yet weighing three or four pounds .
the <unk> is perhaps more expert with the lazo than the gaucho ; but , from the nature of the country , he does not know the use of the bolas .
<name> 18 , 1834 .
we descended the mountain , and passed some beautiful little spots , with rivulets and fine trees .
having slept at the same <unk> as before , we rode during the two succeeding days up the valley , and passed through quillota , which is more like a collection of <unk> than a town .
the orchards were beautiful , presenting one mass of <unk> .
i saw , also , in one or two places the <unk> ; it is a most stately tree ; and i should think a group of them in their native asiatic or african deserts must be superb .
we passed likewise san <name> , a pretty straggling town like quillota .
the valley in this part expands into one of those great bays or plains , reaching to the foot of the cordillera , which have been mentioned as forming so curious a part of the scenery of chile .
in the evening we reached the mines of <unk> , situated in a ravine at the flank of the great chain .
i stayed here five days .
my host , the superintendent of the mine , was a shrewd but rather ignorant <unk> miner .
he had married a spanish woman , and did not mean to return home ; but his admiration for the mines of cornwall remained unbounded .
amongst many other questions , he asked me , " now that <name> <name> is dead , how many more of the family of <unk> are yet alive ? "
this <name> certainly must be a relation of the great author <unk> , who wrote all books !
these mines are of copper , and the ore is all shipped to <unk> , to be <unk> .
hence the mines have an aspect singularly quiet , as compared to those in england : here no smoke , furnaces , or great <unk> , disturb the solitude of the surrounding mountains .
the chilian government , or rather the old spanish law , encourages by every method the searching for mines .
the discoverer may work a mine on any ground , by paying five shillings ; and before paying this he may try , even in the garden of another man , for twenty days .
it is now well known that the chilian method of mining is the cheapest .
my host says that the two principal improvements introduced by foreigners have been , first , reducing by previous roasting the copper <unk>  which , being the common ore in cornwall , the english miners were astounded on their arrival to find thrown away as useless : secondly , stamping and washing the scoriae from the old furnaces  by which process particles of metal are recovered in abundance .
i have actually seen mules carrying to the coast , for transportation to england , a cargo of such cinders .
but the first case is much the most curious .
the chilian miners were so convinced that copper <unk> contained not a particle of copper , that they laughed at the englishmen for their ignorance , who laughed in turn , and bought their richest veins for a few dollars .
it is very odd that , in a country where mining had been extensively carried on for many years , so simple a process as gently roasting the ore to expel the sulphur previous to <unk> it , had never been discovered .
a few improvements have likewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery ; but even to the present day , water is removed from some mines by men carrying it up the shaft in leathern bags !
( plate 62 .
chilian miner . )
the labouring men work very hard .
they have little time allowed for their meals , and during summer and <name> they begin when it is light , and leave off at dark .
they are paid one pound <name> a month , and their food is given them : this for breakfast consists of sixteen figs and two small loaves of bread ; for dinner , boiled beans ; for supper , broken roasted wheat grain .
they scarcely ever taste meat ; as , with the twelve pounds per annum , they have to clothe themselves and support their families .
the miners who work in the mine itself have twenty-five shillings per month , and are allowed a little <unk> .
but these men come down from their bleak habitations only once in every fortnight or three weeks .
( plate 63 .
cactus ( <unk> <unk> ) . )
during my stay here i thoroughly enjoyed scrambling about these huge mountains .
the geology , as might have been expected , was very interesting .
the shattered and baked rocks , traversed by innumerable dikes of greenstone , showed what commotions had formerly taken place .
the scenery was much the same as that near the <name> of quillota  dry barren mountains , dotted at intervals by bushes with a scanty foliage .
the <unk> , or rather <unk> , were here very numerous .
i measured one of a spherical figure , which , including the spines , was six feet and four inches in circumference .
the height of the common cylindrical , branching kind , is from twelve to fifteen feet , and the girth ( with spines ) of the branches between three and four feet .
a heavy fall of snow on the mountains prevented me , during the last two days , from making some interesting excursions .
i attempted to reach a lake which the inhabitants , from some unaccountable reason , believe to be an arm of the sea .
during a very dry season , it was proposed to attempt cutting a channel from it for the sake of the water , but the padre , after a consultation , declared it was too dangerous , as all chile would be <unk> , if , as generally supposed , the lake was connected with the pacific .
we ascended to a great height , but becoming involved in the <unk> failed in reaching this wonderful lake , and had some difficulty in returning .
i thought we should have lost our horses ; for there was no means of guessing how deep the drifts were , and the animals , when led , could only move by jumping .
the black sky showed that a fresh snowstorm was gathering , and we therefore were not a little glad when we escaped .
by the time we reached the base the storm commenced , and it was lucky for us that this did not happen three hours earlier in the day .
<name> 26 , 1834 .
we left <unk> and again crossed the basin of san <name> .
the day was truly chilian : <unk> bright , and the atmosphere quite clear .
the thick and uniform covering of <unk> snow rendered the view of the volcano of aconcagua and the main chain quite glorious .
we were now on the road to <name> , the capital of chile .
we crossed the <unk> <name> <unk> , and slept at a little <unk> .
the host , talking about the state of chile as compared to other countries , was very humble : " some see with two eyes , and some with one , but for my part i do not think that chile sees with any . "
<name> 27 , 1834 .
after crossing many low hills we descended into the small <unk> plain of <unk> .
in the basins , such as this one , which are elevated from one thousand to two thousand feet above the sea , two species of <unk> , which are stunted in their forms , and stand wide apart from each other , grow in large <name> .
these trees are never found near the sea-coast ; and this gives another characteristic feature to the scenery of these basins .
we crossed a low ridge which separates <unk> from the great plain on which <name> stands .
the view was here <unk> striking : the dead level surface , covered in parts by woods of <unk> , and with the city in the distance , <unk> horizontally against the base of the andes , whose snowy peaks were bright with the evening sun .
at the first glance of this view , it was quite evident that the plain represented the extent of a former inland sea .
as soon as we gained the level road we pushed our horses into a gallop , and reached the city before it was dark .
i stayed a week in <name> and enjoyed myself very much .
in the morning i rode to various places on the plain , and in the evening dined with several of the english merchants , whose hospitality at this place is well known .
a <unk> source of pleasure was to ascend the little hillock of rock ( st. <name> ) which projects in the middle of the city .
the scenery certainly is most striking , and , as i have said , very peculiar .
i am informed that this same character is common to the cities on the great mexican platform .
of the town i have nothing to say in detail : it is not so fine or so large as buenos ayres , but is built after the same model .
i arrived here by a circuit to the north ; so i resolved to return to valparaiso by a rather longer excursion to the south of the direct road .
<name> 5 , 1834 .
by the middle of the day we arrived at one of the suspension bridges made of hide , which cross the <unk> , a large turbulent river a few leagues southward of <name> .
these bridges are very poor affairs .
the road , following the curvature of the <unk> ropes , is made of bundles of sticks placed close together .
it was full of holes , and <unk> rather fearfully , even with the weight of a man leading his horse .
in the evening we reached a comfortable farm-house , where there were several very pretty <unk> .
they were much horrified at my having entered one of their churches out of mere curiosity .
they asked me , " why do you not become a <name>  for our religion is certain ? "
i assured them i was a sort of <name> ; but they would not hear of it  appealing to my own words , " do not your <unk> , your very bishops , marry ? "
the absurdity of a bishop having a wife particularly struck them : they scarcely knew whether to be most amused or <unk> at such an enormity .
<name> 6 , 1834 .
we proceeded due south , and slept at <unk> .
the road passed over the level but narrow plain , bounded on one side by lofty hills , and on the other by the cordillera .
the next day we turned up the valley of the rio <unk> , in which the <unk> of cauquenes , long celebrated for their medicinal properties , are situated .
the suspension bridges , in the less frequented parts , are generally taken down during the <name> when the rivers are low .
such was the case in this valley , and we were therefore obliged to cross the stream on horseback .
this is rather disagreeable , for the foaming water , though not deep , rushes so quickly over the bed of large rounded stones , that one 's head becomes quite confused , and it is difficult even to perceive whether the horse is moving onward or standing still .
in summer , when the snow melts , the torrents are quite impassable ; their strength and fury are then extremely great , as might be plainly seen by the marks which they had left .
we reached the baths in the evening , and stayed there five days , being confined the two last by heavy rain .
the buildings consist of a square of miserable little hovels , each with a single table and bench .
they are situated in a narrow deep valley just without the central cordillera .
it is a quiet , solitary spot , with a good deal of wild beauty .
the mineral springs of cauquenes burst forth on a line of dislocation , crossing a mass of stratified rock , the whole of which betrays the action of heat .
a considerable quantity of gas is continually escaping from the same orifices with the water .
though the springs are only a few yards apart , they have very different temperatures ; and this appears to be the result of an unequal mixture of cold water : for those with the lowest temperature have scarcely any mineral taste .
after the great earthquake of 1822 the springs ceased , and the water did not return for nearly a year .
they were also much affected by the earthquake of 1835 ; the temperature being suddenly changed from 118 to 92 degrees .
( <unk> .
<unk> in " philosophical transactions " 1836 . )
it seems probable that mineral waters rising deep from the bowels of the earth would always be more deranged by subterranean disturbances than those nearer the surface .
the man who had charge of the baths assured me that in summer the water is hotter and more plentiful than in <name> .
the former circumstance i should have expected , from the less mixture , during the dry season , of cold water ; but the latter statement appears very strange and contradictory .
the periodical increase during the summer , when rain never falls , can , i think , only be accounted for by the melting of the snow : yet the mountains which are covered by snow during that season are three or four leagues distant from the springs .
i have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my <unk> , who , having lived on the spot for several years , ought to be well acquainted with the circumstance ,  which , if true , certainly is very curious : for we must suppose that the <unk> , being conducted through porous strata to the regions of heat , is again thrown up to the surface by the line of dislocated and injected rocks at cauquenes ; and the regularity of the phenomenon would seem to indicate that in this district heated rock occurred at a depth not very great .
one day i rode up the valley to the farthest inhabited spot .
shortly above that point , the <unk> divides into two deep tremendous ravines , which penetrate directly into the great range .
i scrambled up a peaked mountain , probably more than six thousand feet high .
here , as indeed everywhere else , scenes of the highest interest presented themselves .
it was by one of these ravines that <unk> entered chile and ravaged the neighbouring country .
this is the same man whose attack on an estancia at the rio negro i have described .
he was a <unk> half-caste spaniard , who collected a great body of indians together and established himself by a stream in the pampas , which place none of the forces sent after him could ever discover .
from this point he used to <name> forth , and crossing the cordillera by passes hitherto <unk> , he ravaged the farm-houses and drove the cattle to his secret rendezvous .
<unk> was a capital horseman , and he made all around him equally good , for he invariably shot any one who hesitated to follow him .
it was against this man , and other wandering indian tribes , that rosas waged the war of extermination .
<name> 13 , 1834 .
( plate 64 .
<unk> from <name> de chile . )
we left the baths of cauquenes , and , <unk> the main road , slept at the rio <unk> .
from this place we rode to the town of san <name> .
before arriving there , the last <unk> basin had expanded into a great plain , which extended so far to the south that the snowy summits of the more distant andes were seen as if above the horizon of the sea .
san <name> is forty leagues from <name> ; and it was my farthest point southward ; for we here turned at right angles towards the coast .
we slept at the <unk> of <unk> , which are worked by mr. nixon , an american gentleman , to whose kindness i was much indebted during the four days i stayed at his house .
the next morning we rode to the mines , which are situated at the distance of some leagues , near the summit of a lofty hill .
on the way we had a glimpse of the lake <unk> , celebrated for its floating islands , which have been described by m. <name> .
( <unk> .
" annales des sciences <unk> " march , 1833 .
m. <name> , a zealous and able naturalist , was then occupied in studying every branch of natural history throughout the kingdom of chile . )
they are composed of the stalks of various dead plants <unk> together , and on the surface of which other living ones take root .
their form is generally circular , and their thickness from four to six feet , of which the greater part is immersed in the water .
as the wind blows , they pass from one side of the lake to the other , and often <name> cattle and horses as passengers .
when we arrived at the mine , i was struck by the pale appearance of many of the men , and inquired from mr. nixon respecting their condition .
the mine is 450 feet deep , and each man brings up about 200 pounds weight of stone .
with this load they have to climb up the alternate notches cut in the trunks of trees , placed in a zigzag line up the shaft .
even beardless young men , eighteen and twenty years old , with little muscular development of their bodies ( they are quite naked excepting drawers ) ascend with this great load from nearly the same depth .
a strong man , who is not accustomed to this labour , <unk> most profusely , with merely carrying up his own body .
with this very severe labour , they live entirely on boiled beans and bread .
they would prefer having bread alone ; but their masters , finding that they can not work so hard upon this , treat them like horses , and make them eat the beans .
their pay is here rather more than at the mines of <unk> , being from 24 to 28 shillings per month .
they leave the mine only once in three weeks ; when they stay with their families for two days .
one of the rules of this mine sounds very harsh , but answers pretty well for the master .
the only method of stealing gold is to secrete pieces of the ore , and take them out as occasion may offer .
whenever the <unk> finds a lump thus hidden , its full value is stopped out of the wages of all the men ; who thus , without they all combine , are obliged to keep watch over each other .
when the ore is brought to the mill , it is ground into an impalpable powder ; the process of washing removes all the lighter particles , and <unk> finally secures the <unk> .
the washing , when described , sounds a very simple process ; but it is beautiful to see how the exact adaptation of the current of water to the specific gravity of the gold so easily separates the powdered <unk> from the metal .
the mud which passes from the mills is collected into pools , where it <unk> , and every now and then is cleared out , and thrown into a common heap .
a great deal of chemical action then commences , salts of various kinds <unk> on the surface , and the mass becomes hard .
after having been left for a year or two , and then <unk> , it yields gold ; and this process may be repeated even six or seven times ; but the gold each time becomes less in quantity , and the intervals required ( as the inhabitants say , to generate the metal ) are longer .
there can be no doubt that the chemical action , already mentioned , each time <unk> fresh gold from some combination .
the discovery of a method to effect this before the first grinding would without doubt raise the value of <unk> many fold .
it is curious to find how the minute particles of gold , being scattered about and not <unk> , at last accumulate in some quantity .
a short time since a few miners , being out of work , obtained permission to scrape the ground round the house and mill ; they washed the earth thus got together , and so procured thirty dollars worth of gold .
this is an exact counterpart of what takes place in nature .
mountains suffer degradation and wear away , and with them the metallic veins which they contain .
the hardest rock is worn into impalpable mud , the ordinary metals <unk> , and both are removed ; but gold , platina , and a few others are nearly indestructible , and from their weight , sinking to the bottom , are left behind .
after whole mountains have passed through this grinding mill , and have been washed by the hand of nature , the residue becomes metalliferous , and man finds it worth his while to complete the task of separation .
bad as the above treatment of the miners appears , it is gladly accepted of by them ; for the condition of the labouring agriculturists is much worse .
their wages are lower , and they live almost exclusively on beans .
this poverty must be chiefly owing to the <unk> system on which the land is tilled : the <unk> gives a small plot of ground to the <unk> , for building on and cultivating , and in return has his services ( or those of a proxy ) for every day of his life , without any wages .
until a father has a grown-up son , who can by his labour pay the rent , there is no one , except on occasional days , to take care of his own patch of ground .
hence extreme poverty is very common among the labouring classes in this country .
there are some old indian ruins in this neighbourhood , and i was shown one of the perforated stones , which <unk> mentions as being found in many places in considerable <name> .
they are of a circular flattened form , from five to six inches in diameter , with a hole passing quite through the centre .
it has generally been supposed that they were used as heads to clubs , although their form does not appear at all well adapted for that purpose .
burchell states that some of the tribes in southern africa dig up roots by the aid of a stick pointed at one end , the force and weight of which are increased by a round stone with a hole in it , into which the other end is firmly wedged .
( <unk> .
burchell 's " travels " volume 2 <name> 45 . )
it appears probable that the indians of chile formerly used some such rude agricultural instrument .
one day , a <name> collector in natural history , of the name of <unk> , called , and nearly at the same time an old spanish lawyer .
i was amused at being told the conversation which took place between them .
<unk> speaks spanish so well that the old lawyer mistook him for a chilian .
<unk> alluding to me , asked him what he thought of the king of england sending out a collector to their country , to pick up lizards and beetles , and to break stones ?
the old gentleman thought seriously for some time , and then said , " it is not well ,  hay <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( there is a cat shut up here ) .
no man is so <name> as to send out people to pick up such rubbish .
i do not like it : if one of us were to go and do such things in england , do not you think the king of england would very soon send us out of his country ? "
and this old gentleman , from his profession , belongs to the better informed and more intelligent classes !
<unk> himself , two or three years before , left in a house at san <name> some caterpillars , under charge of a girl to feed , that they might turn into butterflies .
this was <unk> through the town , and at last the <unk> and governor consulted together , and agreed it must be some heresy .
accordingly , when <unk> returned , he was arrested .
<name> 19 , 1834 .
we left <unk> , and followed the flat valley , formed like that of quillota , in which the rio <unk> flows .
even at these few miles south of <name> the climate is much damper ; in consequence there were fine tracts of pasturage which were not irrigated .
( 20th . )
we followed this valley till it expanded into a great plain , which reaches from the sea to the mountains west of <unk> .
we shortly lost all trees and even bushes ; so that the inhabitants are nearly as badly off for firewood as those in the pampas .
never having heard of these plains , i was much surprised at meeting with such scenery in chile .
the plains belong to more than one series of different elevations , and they are traversed by broad flat-bottomed valleys ; both of which circumstances , as in patagonia , <unk> the action of the sea on gently rising land .
in the steep cliffs bordering these valleys there are some large caves , which no doubt were originally formed by the waves : one of these is celebrated under the name of <unk> <name> <unk> ; having formerly been consecrated .
during the day i felt very unwell , and from that time till the end of october did not recover .
<name> 22 , 1834 .
we continued to pass over green plains without a tree .
the next day we arrived at a house near <unk> , on the sea-coast , where a <name> <unk> gave us lodgings .
i stayed here the two ensuing days , and although very unwell , managed to collect from the tertiary formation some <name> shells .
<name> 24 , 1834 .
our course was now directed towards valparaiso , which with great difficulty i reached on the 27th , and was there confined to my bed till the end of october .
during this time i was an inmate in mr. <unk> 's house , whose kindness to me i do not know how to express .
i <name> here add a few observations on some of the animals and birds of chile .
the puma , or south american lion , is not uncommon .
this animal has a wide geographical range ; being found from the equatorial forests , throughout the deserts of patagonia , as far south as the damp and cold latitudes ( 53 to 54 degrees ) of <name> <name> fuego .
i have seen its footsteps in the cordillera of central chile , at an elevation of at least 10,000 feet .
in la plata the puma preys chiefly on deer , ostriches , bizcacha , and other small quadrupeds ; it there seldom attacks cattle or horses , and most rarely man .
in chile , however , it destroys many young horses and cattle , owing probably to the scarcity of other quadrupeds : i heard , likewise , of two men and a woman who had been thus killed .
it is asserted that the puma always kills its prey by springing on the shoulders , and then drawing back the head with one of its paws , until the vertebrae break : i have seen in patagonia the skeletons of guanacos , with their necks thus dislocated .
the puma , after eating its fill , covers the carcass with many large bushes , and lies down to watch it .
this habit is often the cause of its being discovered ; for the <unk> wheeling in the air , every now and then descend to partake of the feast , and being angrily driven away , rise all together on the wing .
the <unk> <unk> then knows there is a lion watching his prey  the word is given  and men and dogs hurry to the <name> .
sir f. head says that a gaucho in the pampas , upon merely seeing some <unk> wheeling in the air , cried " a lion ! "
i could never myself meet with any one who pretended to such powers of discrimination .
it is asserted that if a puma has once been betrayed by thus watching the carcass , and has then been hunted , it never resumes this habit ; but that having gorged itself , it wanders far away .
the puma is easily killed .
in an open country it is first entangled with the bolas , then <unk> , and dragged along the ground till rendered insensible .
at <unk> ( south of the plata ) , i was told that within three months one hundred were thus destroyed .
in chile they are generally driven up bushes or trees , and are then either shot , or baited to death by dogs .
the dogs employed in this <name> belong to a particular breed , called <unk> : they are weak , slight animals , like long-legged terriers , but are born with a particular instinct for this sport .
the puma is described as being very crafty : when pursued , it often returns on its former track , and then suddenly making a spring on one side , waits there till the dogs have passed by .
it is a very silent animal , uttering no cry even when wounded , and only rarely during the breeding season .
of birds , two species of the genus <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> of <unk> ) are perhaps the most conspicuous .
the former , called by the <unk> " el <unk> , " is as large as a <unk> , to which bird it has some alliance ; but its legs are much longer , tail shorter , and beak stronger : its colour is a reddish brown .
the <unk> is not uncommon .
it lives on the ground , sheltered among the thickets which are scattered over the dry and sterile hills .
with its tail erect , and <unk> legs , it may be seen every now and then popping from one bush to another with uncommon quickness .
it really requires little imagination to believe that the bird is ashamed of itself , and is aware of its most ridiculous figure .
on first seeing it , one is tempted to exclaim , " a <unk> stuffed specimen has escaped from some museum , and has come to life again ! "
it can not be made to take flight without the greatest trouble , nor does it run , but only hops .
the various loud cries which it utters when concealed amongst the bushes are as strange as its appearance .
it is said to build its nest in a deep hole beneath the ground .
i dissected several specimens : the gizzard , which was very muscular , contained beetles , vegetable fibres , and pebbles .
from this character , from the length of its legs , scratching feet , membranous covering to the nostrils , short and arched wings , this bird seems in a certain degree to connect the thrushes with the gallinaceous order .
the second species ( or p. <unk> ) is allied to the first in its general form .
it is called <unk> , or " cover your posterior ; " and well does the shameless little bird deserve its name ; for it carries its tail more than erect , that is , inclined backwards towards its head .
it is very common , and <unk> the bottoms of <unk> , and the bushes scattered over the barren hills , where scarcely another bird can exist .
in its general manner of feeding , of quickly hopping out of the thickets and back again , in its <name> of concealment , unwillingness to take flight , and nidification , it bears a close resemblance to the <unk> ; but its appearance is not quite so ridiculous .
the <unk> is very crafty : when frightened by any person , it <name> remain motionless at the bottom of a bush , and <name> then , after a little while , try with much address to crawl away on the opposite side .
it is also an active bird , and continually making a noise : these noises are various and strangely odd ; some are like the cooing of doves , others like the bubbling of water , and many defy all <unk> .
the country people say it changes its cry five times in the year  according to some change of season , i suppose .
( <unk> .
it is a remarkable fact that <unk> , though describing in detail all the birds and animals of chile , never once mentions this genus , the species of which are so common , and so remarkable in their habits .
was he at a loss how to classify them , and did he consequently think that silence was the more prudent course ?
it is one more instance of the frequency of <unk> by authors on those very subjects where it might have been least expected . )
two species of humming-birds are common ; <unk> <unk> is found over a space of <unk> miles on the west coast , from the hot dry country of lima to the forests of <name> <name> fuego  where it may be seen flitting about in <unk> .
in the wooded island of chiloe , which has an extremely humid climate , this little bird , skipping from side to side amidst the dripping foliage , is perhaps more abundant than almost any other kind .
i opened the stomachs of several specimens , shot in different parts of the continent , and in all , remains of insects were as numerous as in the stomach of a creeper .
when this species <unk> in the summer southward , it is replaced by the arrival of another species coming from the north .
this second kind ( <unk> <unk> ) is a very large bird for the delicate family to which it belongs : when on the wing its appearance is singular .
like others of the genus , it moves from place to place with a rapidity which may be compared to that of <unk> amongst flies , and sphinx among moths ; but whilst hovering over a flower , it <unk> its wings with a very slow and powerful movement , totally different from that vibratory one common to most of the species , which produces the humming noise .
i never saw any other bird where the force of its wings appeared ( as in a butterfly ) so powerful in proportion to the weight of its body .
when hovering by a flower , its tail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan , the body being kept in a nearly vertical position .
this action appears to steady and support the bird , between the slow movements of its wings .
although flying from flower to flower in search of food , its stomach generally contained abundant remains of insects , which i suspect are much more the object of its search than <name> .
the note of this species , like that of nearly the whole family , is extremely shrill .

november 10 , 1834 .
the " beagle " sailed from valparaiso to the south , for the purpose of surveying the southern part of chile , the island of chiloe , and the broken land called the chonos archipelago , as far south as the peninsula of tres montes .
on the 21st we anchored in the bay of s. <name> , the capital of chiloe .
this island is about ninety miles long , with a breadth of rather less than thirty .
the land is hilly , but not mountainous , and is covered by one great forest , except where a few green patches have been cleared round the thatched cottages .
from a distance the view somewhat resembles that of <name> <name> fuego ; but the woods , when seen nearer , are incomparably more beautiful .
many kinds of fine evergreen trees , and plants with a tropical character , here take the place of the gloomy beech of the southern shores .
in <name> the climate is detestable , and in summer it is only a little better .
i should think there are few parts of the world , within the temperate regions , where so much rain falls .
the winds are very boisterous , and the sky almost always clouded : to have a week of fine weather is something wonderful .
it is even difficult to get a single glimpse of the cordillera : during our first visit , once only the volcano of <unk> stood out in bold relief , and that was before sunrise ; it was curious to watch , as the sun rose , the outline gradually fading away in the glare of the eastern sky .
the inhabitants , from their complexion and low stature , appear to have three-fourths of indian blood in their veins .
they are an humble , quiet , industrious set of men .
although the fertile soil , resulting from the decomposition of the volcanic rocks , supports a rank vegetation , yet the climate is not favourable to any production which requires much <name> to ripen it .
there is very little pasture for the larger quadrupeds ; and in consequence , the staple articles of food are pigs , potatoes , and fish .
the people all dress in strong woollen garments , which each family makes for itself , and <unk> with indigo of a dark blue colour .
the arts , however , are in the rudest state ;  as may be seen in their strange fashion of ploughing , their method of spinning , grinding corn , and in the construction of their boats .
the forests are so impenetrable that the land is nowhere cultivated except near the coast and on the adjoining islets .
even where paths exist , they are scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil .
the inhabitants , like those of <name> <name> fuego , move about chiefly on the beach or in boats .
although with plenty to eat , the people are very poor : there is no demand for labour , and consequently the lower orders can not scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the smallest luxuries .
there is also a great deficiency of a circulating medium .
i have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal , with which to buy some trifle , and another carrying a plank to exchange for a bottle of wine .
hence every <unk> must also be a merchant , and again sell the goods which he takes in exchange .
november 24 , 1834 .
the yawl and <unk> were sent under the command of mr. ( now captain ) sulivan to survey the eastern or inland coast of chiloe ; and with orders to meet the " beagle " at the southern extremity of the island ; to which point she would proceed by the outside , so as thus to <unk> the whole .
i accompanied this expedition , but instead of going in the boats the first day , i hired horses to take me to <unk> , at the northern extremity of the island .
the road followed the coast ; every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine forests .
in these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the whole road should be made of logs of wood , which are squared and placed by the side of each other .
from the rays of the sun never penetrating the evergreen foliage , the ground is so damp and soft , that except by this means neither man nor horse would be able to pass along .
i arrived at the village of <unk> shortly after the tents belonging to the boats were pitched for the night .
the land in this neighbourhood has been extensively cleared , and there were many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest .
<unk> was formerly the principal port in the island ; but many vessels having been lost , owing to the dangerous currents and rocks in the straits , the spanish government burnt the church , and thus arbitrarily compelled the greater number of inhabitants to migrate to s. <name> .
we had not long <unk> , before the barefooted son of the governor came down to reconnoitre us .
seeing the english flag hoisted at the yawl 's masthead , he asked with the utmost indifference , whether it was always to fly at <unk> .
in several places the inhabitants were much astonished at the appearance of men-of-war 's boats , and hoped and believed it was the forerunner of a spanish fleet , coming to recover the island from the patriot government of chile .
all the men in power , however , had been informed of our intended visit , and were exceedingly civil .
while we were eating our supper , the governor paid us a visit .
he had been a lieutenant-colonel in the spanish service , but now was miserably poor .
he gave us two sheep , and accepted in return two cotton handkerchiefs , some brass trinkets , and a little tobacco .
november 25 , 1834 .
torrents of rain : we managed , however , to run down the coast as far as <unk> .
the whole of this eastern side of chiloe has one aspect ; it is a plain , broken by valleys and divided into little islands , and the whole thickly covered with one impervious <unk> forest .
on the margins there are some cleared spaces , surrounding the <unk> cottages .
november 26 , 1834 .
the day rose splendidly clear .
the volcano of <unk> was spouting out volumes of smoke .
this most beautiful mountain , formed like a perfect cone , and white with snow , stands out in front of the cordillera .
another great volcano , with a <unk> summit , also emitted from its immense crater little jets of steam .
subsequently we saw the <unk> <unk>  well deserving the name of " el <unk> <unk> . "
thus we beheld , from one point of view , three great active volcanoes , each about seven thousand feet high .
in addition to this , far to the south there were other lofty cones covered with snow , which , although not known to be active , must be in their origin volcanic .
the line of the andes is not , in this neighbourhood , nearly so elevated as in chile ; neither does it appear to form so perfect a barrier between the regions of the earth .
this great range , although running in a straight north and south line , owing to an optical deception always appeared more or less curved ; for the lines drawn from each peak to the <unk> eye necessarily <unk> like the radii of a semicircle , and as it was not possible ( owing to the clearness of the atmosphere and the absence of all intermediate objects ) to judge how far distant the farthest peaks were off , they appeared to stand in a <unk> semicircle .
landing at midday , we saw a family of pure indian extraction .
the father was singularly like york minster ; and some of the younger boys , with their ruddy complexions , might have been mistaken for pampas indians .
everything i have seen convinces me of the close connexion of the different american tribes , who nevertheless speak distinct languages .
this party could muster but little spanish , and talked to each other in their own tongue .
it is a pleasant thing to see the aborigines advanced to the same degree of civilisation , however low that may be , which their white conquerors have attained .
more to the south we saw many pure indians : indeed , all the inhabitants of some of the islets retain their indian <unk> .
in the census of 1832 there were in chiloe and its <unk> forty-two thousand souls : the greater number of these appear to be of mixed blood .
eleven thousand retain their indian <unk> , but it is probable that not nearly all of these are of a pure breed .
their manner of life is the same with that of the other poor inhabitants , and they are all christians ; but it is said that they yet retain some strange superstitious ceremonies , and that they pretend to hold communication with the devil in certain caves .
formerly , every one convicted of this offence was sent to the inquisition at lima .
many of the inhabitants who are not included in the eleven thousand with indian <unk> , can not be distinguished by their appearance from indians .
<unk> , the governor of <unk> , is descended from noblemen of spain on both sides ; but by constant <unk> with the natives the present man is an indian .
on the other hand , the governor of <unk> boasts much of his purely kept spanish blood .
we reached at night a beautiful little cove , north of the island of <unk> .
the people here complained of want of land .
this is partly owing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods , and partly to restrictions by the government , which makes it necessary , before buying ever so small a piece , to pay two shillings to the surveyor for measuring each <unk> ( 150 yards square ) , together with whatever price he fixes for the value of the land .
after his <unk> the land must be put up three times to auction , and if no one bids more , the purchaser can have it at that rate .
all these exactions must be a serious check to clearing the ground , where the inhabitants are so extremely poor .
in most countries , forests are removed without much difficulty by the aid of fire ; but in chiloe , from the damp nature of the climate , and the sort of trees , it is necessary first to cut them down .
this is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of chiloe .
in the time of the spaniards the indians could not hold land ; and a family , after having cleared a piece of ground , might be driven away , and the property seized by the government .
the chilian authorities are now performing an act of justice by making retribution to these poor indians , giving to each man , according to his grade of life , a certain portion of land .
the value of <unk> ground is very little .
the government gave mr. <name> ( the present surveyor , who informed me of these circumstances ) eight and a half square miles of forest near s. <name> , in lieu of a debt ; and this he sold for 350 dollars , or about 70 pounds <name> .
the two succeeding days were fine , and at night we reached the island of <unk> .
this neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the archipelago ; for a broad strip of land on the coast of the main island , as well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones , is almost completely cleared .
some of the farmhouses seemed very comfortable .
i was curious to ascertain how <name> any of these people might be , but mr. <name> says that no one can be considered as possessing a regular income .
one of the richest <unk> might possibly accumulate , in a long industrious life , as much as 1000 pounds <name> ; but should this happen , it would all be stowed away in some secret corner , for it is the custom of almost every family to have a jar or <unk> buried in the ground .
november 30 , 1834 .
early on <name> morning we reached castro , the ancient capital of chiloe , but now a most forlorn and deserted place .
the usual <unk> arrangement of spanish towns could be traced , but the streets and plaza were coated with fine green turf , on which sheep were browsing .
the church , which stands in the middle , is entirely built of plank , and has a picturesque and venerable appearance .
the poverty of the place may be conceived from the fact , that although containing some hundreds of inhabitants , one of our party was unable anywhere to purchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife .
no individual possessed either a watch or a clock ; and an old man who was supposed to have a good idea of time , was employed to strike the church <name> by guess .
the arrival of our boats was a rare event in this quiet retired corner of the world ; and nearly all the inhabitants came down to the beach to see us pitch our tents .
they were very civil , and offered us a house ; and one man even sent us a cask of cider as a present .
in the afternoon we paid our respects to the governor  a quiet old man , who , in his appearance and manner of life , was scarcely superior to an english <unk> .
at night heavy rain set in , which was hardly sufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle of <unk> on .
an indian family , who had come to trade in a canoe from <unk> , <unk> near us .
they had no shelter during the rain .
in the morning i asked a young indian , who was wet to the skin , how he had passed the night .
he seemed perfectly content , and answered , " <unk> bien , señor . "
december 1 , 1834 .
we steered for the island of <unk> .
i was anxious to examine a reported <unk> which turned out to be lignite of little value , in the sandstone ( probably of an ancient tertiary epoch ) of which these islands are composed .
when we reached <unk> we had much difficulty in finding any place to pitch our tents , for it was <unk> , and the land was wooded down to the water 's edge .
in a short time we were surrounded by a large group of the nearly pure indian inhabitants .
they were much surprised at our arrival , and said one to the other , " this is the reason we have seen so many parrots lately ; the <unk> ( an odd <unk> little bird , which inhabits the thick forest , and utters very peculiar noises ) has not cried <unk> ' for nothing . "
they were soon anxious for barter .
money was scarcely worth anything , but their eagerness for tobacco was something quite extraordinary .
after tobacco , indigo came next in value ; then <unk> , old clothes , and gunpowder .
the latter article was required for a very innocent purpose : each parish has a public musket , and the gunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their saint or feast days .
the people here live chiefly on <unk> and potatoes .
at certain seasons they catch also , in " <unk> , " or hedges under water , many fish which are left on the mud-banks as the tide falls .
they occasionally possess fowls , sheep , goats , pigs , horses , and cattle ; the order in which they are here mentioned , expressing their respective <name> .
i never saw anything more obliging and humble than the manners of these people .
they generally began with stating that they were poor natives of the place , and not spaniards and that they were in sad want of tobacco and other comforts .
at <unk> , the most southern island , the sailors bought with a stick of tobacco , of the value of <unk> , two fowls , one of which , the indian stated , had skin between its toes , and turned out to be a fine duck ; and with some cotton handkerchiefs , worth three shillings , three sheep and a large bunch of onions were procured .
the yawl at this place was anchored some way from the shore , and we had fears for her safety from robbers during the night .
our pilot , mr. <name> , accordingly told the constable of the district that we always placed sentinels with loaded arms , and not understanding spanish , if we saw any person in the dark , we should assuredly shoot him .
the constable , with much humility , agreed to the perfect propriety of this arrangement , and promised us that no one should stir out of his house during that night .
during the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward .
the general features of the country remained the same , but it was much less thickly inhabited .
on the large island of <unk> there was scarcely one cleared spot , the trees on every side extending their branches over the sea-beach .
i one day noticed , growing on the sandstone cliffs , some very fine plants of the panke ( <unk> <unk> ) , which somewhat resembles the <unk> on a gigantic scale .
the inhabitants eat the stalks , which are <unk> , and tan leather with the roots , and prepare a black dye from them .
the leaf is nearly circular , but deeply indented on its margin .
i measured one which was nearly eight feet in diameter , and therefore no less than twenty-four in circumference !
the stalk is rather more than a yard high , and each plant sends out four or five of these enormous leaves , presenting together a very <name> appearance .
december 6 , 1834 .
we reached <unk> , called " el fin <name> <unk> . "
in the morning we stopped for a few minutes at a house on the northern end of <unk> , which was the extreme point of south american christendom , and a miserable hovel it was .
the latitude is 43 degrees 10 ' , which is two degrees farther south than the rio negro on the atlantic coast .
these extreme christians were very poor , and , under the plea of their situation , begged for some tobacco .
as a proof of the poverty of these indians , i may mention that shortly before this we had met a man , who had travelled three days and a half on foot , and had as many to return , for the sake of recovering the value of a small axe and a few fish .
how very difficult it must be to buy the smallest article , when such trouble is taken to recover so small a debt .
in the evening we reached the island of san <name> , where we found the " beagle " at anchor .
in doubling the point , two of the officers landed to take a round of angles with the <unk> .
a fox ( canis <unk> ) , of a kind said to be peculiar to the island , and very rare in it , and which is a new species , was sitting on the rocks .
he was so intently absorbed in watching the work of the officers , that i was able , by quietly walking up behind , to knock him on the head with my geological hammer .
this fox , more curious or more scientific , but less wise , than the generality of his brethren , is now mounted in the museum of the zoological society .
we stayed three days in this harbour , on one of which captain fitz <name> , with a party , attempted to ascend to the summit of san <name> .
the woods here had rather a different appearance from those on the northern part of the island .
the rock , also , being <unk> slate , there was no beach , but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water .
the general aspect in consequence was more like that of <name> <name> fuego than of chiloe .
in vain we tried to gain the summit : the forest was so impenetrable , that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so entangled a mass of dying and dead trunks .
i am sure that often , for more than ten minutes together , our feet never touched the ground , and we were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it , so that the seamen as a joke called out the soundings .
at other times we crept one after another , on our hands and knees , under the rotten trunks .
in the lower part of the mountain , <name> trees of the <name> 's bark , and a <name> like the <unk> with fragrant leaves , and others , the names of which i do not know , were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane .
here we were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal .
on the higher parts , brushwood takes the place of larger trees , with here and there a red cedar or an <unk> pine .
i was also pleased to see , at an elevation of a little less than 1000 feet , our old friend the southern beech .
they were , however , poor stunted trees , and i should think that this must be nearly their northern limit .
we ultimately gave up the attempt in despair .
december 10 , 1834 .
( plate 67 .
inside chonos archipelago . )
the yawl and <unk> , with mr. sulivan , proceeded on their survey , but i remained on board the " beagle , " which the next day left san <name> for the southward .
on the 13th we ran into an opening in the southern part of <unk> , or the chonos archipelago ; and it was fortunate we did so , for on the following day a storm , worthy of <name> <name> fuego , raged with great fury .
white massive clouds were piled up against a dark blue sky , and across them black ragged sheets of vapour were rapidly driven .
the successive mountain ranges appeared like dim shadows , and the setting sun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam , much like that produced by the flame of spirits of wine .
the water was white with the flying spray , and the wind lulled and roared again through the rigging : it was an ominous , sublime scene .
during a few minutes there was a bright rainbow , and it was curious to observe the effect of the spray , which , being carried along the surface of the water , changed the ordinary semicircle into a circle  a band of <unk> colours being continued , from both feet of the common arch across the bay , close to the vessel 's side : thus forming a distorted , but very nearly entire ring .
we stayed here three days .
the weather continued bad : but this did not much signify , for the surface of the land in all these islands is all but impassable .
the coast is so very rugged that to attempt to walk in that direction requires continued scrambling up and down over the sharp rocks of mica-slate ; and as for the woods , our faces , hands , and <unk> all bore witness to the <unk> we received , in merely attempting to penetrate their forbidden recesses .
december 18 , 1834 .
we stood out to sea .
on the 20th we bade farewell to the south , and with a fair wind turned the ship 's head northward .
from cape tres montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weather-beaten coast , which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills , and the thick covering of forest even on the almost precipitous flanks .
the next day a harbour was discovered , which on this dangerous coast might be of great service to a distressed vessel .
it can easily be recognised by a hill 1600 feet high , which is even more perfectly conical than the famous <unk> at rio de janeiro .
the next day , after <unk> , i succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill .
it was a laborious undertaking , for the sides were so steep that in some parts it was necessary to use the trees as ladders .
there were also several extensive brakes of the <unk> , covered with its beautiful drooping flowers , but very difficult to crawl through .
in these wild countries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain .
there is an indefinite expectation of seeing something very strange , which , however often it may be balked , never failed with me to recur on each successive attempt .
every one must know the feeling of triumph and pride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind .
in these little frequented countries there is also joined to it some vanity , that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this pinnacle or admired this view .
a strong <name> is always felt to ascertain whether any human being has previously visited an unfrequented spot .
a bit of wood with a nail in it is picked up and studied as if it were covered with hieroglyphics .
possessed with this feeling , i was much interested by finding , on a wild part of the coast , a bed made of grass beneath a ledge of rock .
close by it there had been a fire , and the man had used an axe .
the fire , bed , and situation showed the dexterity of an indian ; but he could scarcely have been an indian , for the race is in this part extinct , owing to the catholic <name> of making at one blow christians and slaves .
i had at the time some misgivings that the solitary man who had made his bed on this wild spot , must have been some poor shipwrecked sailor , who , in trying to travel up the coast , had here laid himself down for his dreary night .
december 28 , 1834 .
the weather continued very bad , but it at last permitted us to proceed with the survey .
the time <name> heavy on our hands , as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by successive gales of wind .
in the evening another harbour was discovered , where we anchored .
directly afterwards a man was seen waving his shirt , and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen .
a party of six had run away from an american whaling vessel , and had landed a little to the southward in a boat , which was shortly afterwards knocked to pieces by the surf .
they had now been wandering up and down the coast for fifteen months , without knowing which way to go , or where they were .
what a singular piece of good fortune it was that this harbour was now discovered !
had it not been for this one chance , they might have wandered till they had grown old men , and at last have perished on this wild coast .
their sufferings had been very great , and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the cliffs .
they were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food , and this explained the bed of the solitary man .
considering what they had undergone , i think they had kept a very good reckoning of time , for they had lost only four days .
december 30 , 1834 .
we anchored in a snug little cove at the foot of some high hills , near the northern extremity of tres montes .
after breakfast the next morning a party ascended one of these mountains , which was <unk> feet high .
the scenery was remarkable .
the chief part of the range was composed of grand , solid , abrupt masses of granite , which appeared as if they had been <unk> with the beginning of the world .
the granite was capped with mica-slate , and this in the lapse of ages had been worn into strange <unk> points .
these two formations , thus differing in their outlines , agree in being almost destitute of vegetation .
this barrenness had to our eyes a strange appearance , from having been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal forest of <unk> trees .
i took much delight in examining the structure of these mountains .
the complicated and lofty ranges bore a <name> aspect of <unk>  equally <unk> , however , to man and to all other animals .
granite to the geologist is classic ground : from its <unk> limits , and its beautiful and compact texture , few rocks have been more anciently recognised .
granite has given rise , perhaps , to more discussion concerning its origin than any other formation .
we generally see it constituting the fundamental rock , and , however formed , we know it is the deepest layer in the crust of this globe to which man has penetrated .
the limit of man's knowledge in any subject possesses a high interest , which is perhaps increased by its close neighbourhood to the realms of imagination .
<name> 1 , 1835 .
the new year is ushered in with the ceremonies proper to it in these regions .
she lays out no false hopes : a heavy north-western <name> , with steady rain , <unk> the rising year .
thank god , we are not destined here to see the end of it , but <name> then to be in the pacific ocean , where a blue sky tells one there is a heaven ,  a something beyond the clouds above our heads .
the north-west winds prevailing for the next four days , we only managed to cross a great bay , and then anchored in another secure harbour .
i accompanied the captain in a boat to the head of a deep creek .
on the way the number of seals which we saw was quite astonishing : every bit of flat rock and parts of the beach were covered with them .
they appeared to be of a loving disposition , and lay huddled together , fast asleep , like so many pigs ; but even pigs would have been ashamed of their dirt , and of the foul smell which came from them .
each herd was watched by the patient but <unk> eyes of the <unk> .
this disgusting bird , with its bald <name> head , formed to wallow in <unk> , is very common on the west coast , and their attendance on the seals shows on what they rely for their food .
we found the water ( probably only that of the surface ) nearly fresh : this was caused by the number of torrents which , in the form of cascades , came tumbling over the bold granite mountains into the sea .
the fresh water attracts the fish , and these bring many terns , gulls , and two kinds of <unk> .
we saw also a pair of the beautiful <unk> swans , and several small <unk> , the fur of which is held in such high estimation .
in returning , we were again amused by the impetuous manner in which the heap of seals , old and young , tumbled into the water as the boat passed .
they did not remain long under water , but rising , followed us with outstretched necks , expressing great wonder and curiosity .
<name> 7 , 1835 .
having run up the coast , we anchored near the northern end of the chonos archipelago , in low 's harbour , where we remained a week .
the islands were here , as in chiloe , composed of a stratified , soft , littoral deposit ; and the vegetation in consequence was beautifully luxuriant .
the woods came down to the sea-beach , just in the manner of an evergreen shrubbery over a gravel walk .
we also enjoyed from the anchorage a splendid view of four great snowy cones of the cordillera , including " el <unk> <unk> ; " the range itself had in this latitude so little height , that few parts of it appeared above the tops of the neighbouring islets .
we found here a party of five men from <unk> , " el fin <name> <unk> , " who had most <unk> crossed in their miserable <unk> , for the purpose of fishing , the open space of sea which separates chonos from chiloe .
these islands <name> , in all probability , in a short time become peopled like those adjoining the coast of chiloe .
the wild potato grows on these islands in great abundance , on the <name> , <name> soil near the sea-beach .
the tallest plant was four feet in height .
the tubers were generally small , but i found one , of an oval shape , two inches in diameter : they resembled in every respect , and had the same smell as english potatoes ; but when boiled they shrunk much , and were watery and insipid , without any bitter taste .
they are undoubtedly here indigenous : they grow as far south , according to mr. low , as latitude 50 degrees , and are called <unk> by the wild indians of that part : the <unk> indians have a different name for them .
professor henslow , who has examined the dried specimens which i brought home , says that they are the same with those described by mr. <name> from valparaiso , but that they form a variety which by some botanists has been considered as specifically distinct .
( <unk> .
" horticultural transactions " volume 5 <name> 249 .
mr. <unk> sent home two tubers , which , being well manured , even the first season produced numerous potatoes and an abundance of leaves .
see <unk> interesting discussion on this plant , which it appears was unknown in mexico ,  in " political essay on new spain " book 4 chapter 9 . )
it is remarkable that the same plant should be found on the sterile mountains of central chile , where a drop of rain does not fall for more than six months , and within the damp forests of these southern islands .
in the central parts of the chonos archipelago ( latitude 45 degrees ) , the forest has very much the same character with that along the whole west coast , for 600 miles southward to cape horn .
the <unk> grass of chiloe is not found here ; while the beech of <name> <name> fuego grows to a good size , and forms a considerable proportion of the wood ; not , however , in the same exclusive manner as it does farther southward .
<unk> plants here find a most congenial climate .
in the strait of magellan , as i have before remarked , the country appears too cold and wet to allow of their arriving at perfection ; but in these islands , within the forest , the number of species and great abundance of mosses , lichens , and small ferns , is quite extraordinary .
( <unk> .
by sweeping with my <unk> , i procured from these situations a considerable number of minute insects , of the family of <unk> , and others allied to <unk> , and minute hymenoptera .
but the most characteristic family in number , both of individuals and species , throughout the more open parts of chiloe and chonos is that of <unk> . )
in <name> <name> fuego trees grow only on the hillsides ; every level piece of land being invariably covered by a thick bed of peat ; but in chiloe flat land supports the most luxuriant forests .
here , within the chonos archipelago , the nature of the climate more closely approaches that of <name> <name> fuego than that of northern chiloe ; for every patch of level ground is covered by two species of plants ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) , which by their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic peat .
in <name> <name> fuego , above the region of woodland , the former of these eminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat .
fresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central <unk> , the lower ones soon decay , and in tracing a root downwards in the peat , the leaves , yet holding their place , can be observed passing through every stage of decomposition , till the whole becomes blended in one confused mass .
the <unk> is assisted by a few other plants ,  here and there a small creeping <unk> ( m. <unk> ) , with a woody stem like our <unk> and with a sweet <name> ,  an <unk> ( e. <unk> ) , like our <name> ,  a rush ( <unk> <unk> ) , are nearly the only ones that grow on the swampy surface .
these plants , though possessing a very close general resemblance to the english species of the same genera , are different .
in the more level parts of the country , the surface of the peat is broken up into little pools of water , which stand at different heights , and appear as if artificially excavated .
small streams of water , flowing underground , complete the <unk> of the vegetable matter , and <unk> the whole .
the climate of the southern part of <name> appears particularly favourable to the production of peat .
in the falkland islands almost every kind of plant , even the coarse grass which covers the whole surface of the land , becomes converted into this substance : scarcely any situation checks its growth ; some of the beds are as much as twelve feet thick , and the lower part becomes so solid when dry , that it <name> hardly burn .
although every plant lends its aid , yet in most parts the <unk> is the most efficient .
it is rather a singular circumstance , as being so very different from what occurs in europe , that i nowhere saw moss forming by its decay any portion of the peat in south <name> .
with respect to the northern limit at which the climate allows of that peculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for its production , i believe that in chiloe ( latitude 41 to 42 degrees ) , although there is much swampy ground , no <unk> peat occurs : but in the chonos islands , three degrees farther southward , we have seen that it is abundant .
on the eastern coast in la plata ( latitude 35 degrees ) i was told by a spanish resident who had visited ireland , that he had often sought for this substance , but had never been able to find any .
he showed me , as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered , a black peaty soil , so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely slow and imperfect combustion .
the zoology of these broken islets of the chonos archipelago is , as might have been expected , very poor .
of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds are common .
the <unk> <unk> ( like a beaver , but with a round tail ) is well known from its fine fur , which is an object of trade throughout the tributaries of la plata .
it here , however , exclusively <unk> salt water ; which same circumstance has been mentioned as sometimes occurring with the great rodent , the capybara .
a small <unk> is very numerous ; this animal does not feed exclusively on fish , but , like the seals , draws a large supply from a small red crab , which swims in shoals near the surface of the water .
mr. <unk> saw one in <name> <name> fuego eating a cuttle-fish ; and at low 's harbour , another was killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large <unk> shell .
at one place i caught in a trap a singular little mouse ( m. <unk> ) ; it appeared common on several of the islets , but the <unk> at low 's harbour said that it was not found in all .
what a succession of chances , or what changes of level must have been brought into play , thus to spread these small animals throughout this broken archipelago !
( <unk> .
it is said that some <unk> birds bring their prey alive to their nests .
if so , in the course of centuries , every now and then , one might escape from the young birds .
some such agency is necessary , to account for the distribution of the smaller gnawing animals on islands not very near each other . )
in all parts of chiloe and chonos , two very strange birds occur , which are allied to , and replace , the <unk> and <unk> of central chile .
one is called by the inhabitants " <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) : it <unk> the most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests .
sometimes , although its cry may be heard close at hand , let a person watch ever so attentively he <name> not see the <unk> ; at other times let him stand motionless and the <unk> little bird <name> approach within a few feet in the most familiar manner .
it then busily hops about the entangled mass of rotting canes and branches , with its little tail cocked upwards .
the <unk> is held in superstitious fear by the <unk> , on account of its strange and varied cries .
there are three very distinct cries : one is called " <unk> , " and is an omen of good ; another , " <unk> , " which is extremely unfavourable ; and a third , which i have forgotten .
these words are given in imitation of the noises ; and the natives are in some things absolutely governed by them .
the <unk> assuredly have chosen a most comical little creature for their prophet .
an allied species , but rather larger , is called by the natives " <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) , and by the english the <unk> .
this latter name is well given ; for i defy any one at first to feel certain that a small dog is not yelping somewhere in the forest .
just as with the <unk> , a person <name> sometimes hear the bark close by , but in vain may endeavour by watching , and with still less chance by beating the bushes , to see the bird ; yet at other times the <unk> fearlessly comes near .
its manner of feeding and its general habits are very similar to those of the <unk> .
on the coast , a small <unk> bird ( <unk> <unk> ) is very common .
( <unk> .
i may mention , as a proof of how great a difference there is between the seasons of the wooded and the open parts of this coast , that on <name> 20th , in latitude 34 degrees , these birds had young ones in the nest , while among the chonos islands , three months later in the summer , they were only laying , the difference in latitude between these two places being about 700 miles . )
it is remarkable from its quiet habits ; it lives entirely on the sea-beach , like a <unk> .
besides these birds only few others inhabit this broken land .
in my rough notes i describe the strange noises , which , although frequently heard within these gloomy forests , yet scarcely disturb the general silence .
the yelping of the <unk> , and the sudden <unk> of the <unk> , sometimes come from afar off , and sometimes from close at hand ; the little black wren of <name> <name> fuego occasionally adds its cry ; the creeper ( <unk> ) follows the intruder screaming and <unk> ; the humming-bird may be seen every now and then darting from side to side , and emitting , like an insect , its shrill chirp ; lastly , from the top of some lofty tree the indistinct but plaintive note of the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) may be noticed .
from the great preponderance in most countries of certain common genera of birds , such as the finches , one feels at first surprised at meeting with the peculiar forms above enumerated , as the commonest birds in any district .
in central chile two of them , namely , the <unk> and <unk> , occur , although most rarely .
when finding , as in this case , animals which seem to play so insignificant a part in the great scheme of nature , one is apt to wonder why they were created .
but it should always be recollected , that in some other country perhaps they are essential members of society , or at some former period may have been so .
if <name> south of 37 degrees were sunk beneath the waters of the ocean , these two birds might continue to exist in central chile for a long period , but it is very improbable that their <name> would increase .
we should then see a case which must inevitably have happened with very many animals .
these southern seas are frequented by several species of petrels : the largest kind , <unk> <unk> , or <name> ( <unk> , or <unk> , of the spaniards ) , is a common bird , both in the inland channels and on the open sea .
in its habits and manner of flight there is a very close resemblance with the albatross ; and as with the albatross , a person may watch it for hours together without seeing on what it feeds .
the " <unk> " is , however , a <unk> bird , for it was observed by some of the officers at port st. <name> chasing a <unk> , which tried to escape by diving and flying , but was continually struck down , and at last killed by a blow on its head .
at port st. <name> these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls .
a second species ( <unk> <unk> ) , which is common to europe , cape horn , and the coast of peru , is of a much smaller size than the p. <unk> , but , like it , of a dirty black colour .
it generally <unk> the inland sounds in very large flocks : i do not think i ever saw so many birds of any other sort together , as i once saw of these behind the island of chiloe .
hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular line for several hours in one direction .
when part of the flock settled on the water the surface was blackened , and a noise proceeded from them as of human beings talking in the distance .
there are several other species of petrels , but i <name> only mention one other kind , the <unk> <unk> , which offers an example of those extraordinary cases , of a bird evidently belonging to one well-marked family , yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct tribe .
this bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds .
when disturbed it dives to a distance , and on coming to the surface , with the same movement takes flight .
after flying by the rapid movement of its short wings for a space in a straight line , it drops , as if struck dead , and dives again .
the form of its beak and nostrils , length of foot , and even the colouring of its plumage , show that this bird is a petrel : on the other hand , its short wings and consequent little power of flight , its form of body and shape of tail , the absence of a hind toe to its foot , its habit of living , and its choice of situation , make it at first doubtful whether its relationship is not equally close with the <unk> .
it would undoubtedly be mistaken for an <unk> , when seen from a distance , either on the wing , or when diving and quietly swimming about the retired channels of <name> <name> fuego .

on <name> the 15th , 1835 we sailed from low 's harbour , and three days afterwards anchored a second time in the bay of s. <name> in chiloe .
on the night of the 19th the volcano of <unk> was in action .
at midnight the sentry observed something like a large <name> , which gradually increased in size till about three o'clock , when it presented a very magnificent spectacle .
by the aid of a glass , dark objects , in constant succession , were seen , in the midst of a great glare of red light , to be thrown up and to fall down .
the light was sufficient to cast on the water a long bright reflection .
large masses of molten matter seem very commonly to be cast out of the craters in this part of the cordillera .
i was assured that when the <unk> is in eruption , great masses are projected upwards and are seen to burst in the air , assuming many <unk> forms , such as trees : their size must be immense , for they can be distinguished from the high land behind s. <name> , which is no less than <unk> miles from the <unk> .
in the morning the volcano became tranquil .
i was surprised at hearing afterwards that aconcagua in chile , 480 miles northwards , was in action on the same night ; and still more surprised to hear that the great eruption of <unk> ( <unk> miles north of aconcagua ) , accompanied by an earthquake felt over 1000 miles , also occurred within six hours of this same time .
this coincidence is the more remarkable , as <unk> had been dormant for twenty-six years : and aconcagua most rarely shows any signs of action .
it is difficult even to conjecture whether this coincidence was accidental , or shows some subterranean connection .
if vesuvius , <unk> , and <unk> in iceland ( all three relatively nearer each other than the corresponding points in south <name> ) , suddenly burst forth in eruption on the same night , the coincidence would be thought remarkable ; but it is far more remarkable in this case , where the three vents fall on the same great <unk> , and where the vast plains along the entire eastern coast , and the upraised recent shells along more than 2000 miles on the western coast , show in how equable and connected a manner the elevatory forces have acted .
captain fitz <name> being anxious that some bearings should be taken on the outer coast of chiloe , it was planned that mr. king and myself should ride to castro , and thence across the island to the <unk> de <unk> , situated on the west coast .
having hired horses and a guide , we set out on the morning of the <unk> .
we had not proceeded far , before we were joined by a woman and two boys , who were bent on the same journey .
every one on this road acts on a " <unk> " fashion ; and one may here enjoy the privilege , so rare in south <name> , of travelling without firearms .
at first the country consisted of a succession of hills and valleys : nearer to castro it became very level .
the road itself is a curious affair ; it consists in its whole length , with the exception of very few parts , of great logs of wood , which are either broad and laid longitudinally , or narrow and placed transversely .
in summer the road is not very bad : but in <name> , when the wood is rendered slippery from rain , travelling is exceedingly difficult .
at that time of the year , the ground on each side becomes a morass , and is often overflowed : hence it is necessary that the longitudinal logs should be fastened down by transverse poles , which are pegged on each side into the earth .
these pegs render a fall from a horse dangerous , as the chance of alighting on one of them is not small .
it is remarkable , however , how active custom has made the <unk> horses .
in crossing bad parts , where the logs had been displaced , they skipped from one to the other , almost with the quickness and certainty of a dog .
on both hands the road is bordered by the lofty <unk> , with their bases matted together by canes .
when occasionally a long reach of this avenue could be beheld , it presented a curious scene of uniformity : the white line of logs , narrowing in perspective , became hidden by the gloomy forest , or terminated in a zigzag which ascended some steep hill .
although the distance from s. <name> to castro is only twelve leagues in a straight line , the formation of the road must have been a great labour .
i was told that several people had formerly lost their lives in attempting to cross the forest .
the first who succeeded was an indian , who cut his way through the canes in eight days , and reached s. <name> : he was rewarded by the spanish government with a <name> of land .
during the summer , many of the indians wander about the forests ( but chiefly in the higher parts , where the woods are not quite so thick ) , in search of the half-wild cattle which live on the leaves of the cane and certain trees .
it was one of these huntsmen who by chance discovered , a few years since , an english vessel , which had been wrecked on the outer coast .
the crew were beginning to fail in provisions , and it is not probable that , without the aid of this man , they would ever have extricated themselves from these scarcely <unk> woods .
as it was , one seaman died on the march , from fatigue .
the indians in these excursions steer by the sun ; so that if there is a continuance of cloudy weather , they can not travel .
the day was beautiful , and the number of trees which were in full flower perfumed the air ; yet even this could hardly <unk> the effect of the gloomy dampness of the forest .
moreover , the many dead trunks that stand like skeletons , never fail to give to these primeval woods a character of solemnity , absent in those of countries long civilised .
shortly after sunset we <unk> for the night .
our female companion , who was rather good-looking , belonged to one of the most respectable families in castro : she rode , however , astride , and without shoes or stockings .
i was surprised at the total want of pride shown by her and her brother .
they brought food with them , but at all our meals sat watching mr. king and myself whilst eating , till we were fairly shamed into feeding the whole party .
the night was cloudless ; and while lying in our beds , we enjoyed the sight ( and it is a high enjoyment ) of the multitude of stars which illumined the darkness of the forest .
<name> 23 , 1835 .
we rose early in the morning , and reached the pretty quiet town of castro by two o'clock .
the old governor had died since our last visit , and a <unk> was acting in his place .
we had a letter of introduction to <name> <name> , whom we found exceedingly hospitable and kind , and more disinterested than is usual on this side of the continent .
the next day <name> <name> procured us fresh horses , and offered to accompany us himself .
we proceeded to the south  generally following the coast , and passing through several hamlets , each with its large <unk> chapel built of wood .
at <unk> , <name> <name> asked the commandant to give us a guide to <unk> .
the old gentleman offered to come himself ; but for a long time nothing would persuade him that two englishmen really wished to go to such an out-of-the-way place as <unk> .
we were thus accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the country , as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer indians towards them .
at <unk> we struck across the island , following intricate winding paths , sometimes passing through magnificent forests , and sometimes through pretty cleared spots , abounding with corn and potato crops .
this undulating woody country , partially cultivated , reminded me of the wilder parts of england , and therefore had to my eye a most fascinating aspect .
at <unk> , which is situated on the borders of the lake of <unk> , only a few fields were cleared ; and all the inhabitants appeared to be indians .
this lake is twelve miles long , and runs in an east and west direction .
from local circumstances , the <unk> blows very regularly during the day , and during the night it falls calm : this has given rise to strange exaggerations , for the phenomenon , as described to us at s. <name> , was quite a prodigy .
the road to <unk> was so very bad that we determined to embark in a <unk> .
the commandant , in the most authoritative manner , ordered six indians to get ready to pull us over , without <unk> to tell them whether they would be paid .
the <unk> is a strange rough boat , but the crew were still stranger : i doubt if six <unk> little men ever got into a boat together .
they pulled , however , very well and cheerfully .
the <unk> <unk> indian , and uttered strange cries , much after the fashion of a <unk> driving his pigs .
we started with a light breeze against us , but yet reached the <unk> de <unk> before it was late .
the country on each side of the lake was one unbroken forest .
in the same <unk> with us a cow was embarked .
to get so large an animal into a small boat appears at first a difficulty , but the indians managed it in a minute .
they brought the cow alongside the boat , which was <unk> towards her ; then placing two oars under her belly , with their ends resting on the gunwale , by the aid of these levers they fairly tumbled the poor beast heels over head into the bottom of the boat , and then lashed her down with ropes .
at <unk> we found an uninhabited hovel ( which is the residence of the padre when he pays this <unk> a visit ) , where , lighting a fire , we cooked our supper , and were very comfortable .
the district of <unk> is the only inhabited part on the whole west coast of chiloe .
it contains about thirty or forty indian families , who are scattered along four or five miles of the shore .
they are very much secluded from the rest of chiloe , and have scarcely any sort of commerce , except sometimes in a little oil , which they get from <unk> .
they are tolerably dressed in clothes of their own manufacture , and they have plenty to eat .
they seemed , however , discontented , yet humble to a degree which it was quite painful to witness .
these feelings are , i think , chiefly to be attributed to the harsh and authoritative manner in which they are treated by their rulers .
our companions , although so very civil to us , behaved to the poor indians as if they had been slaves , rather than free men .
they ordered provisions and the use of their horses , without ever <unk> to say how much , or indeed whether the owners should be paid at all .
in the morning , being left alone with these poor people , we soon <unk> ourselves by presents of cigars and <unk> .
a lump of white sugar was divided between all present , and tasted with the greatest curiosity .
the indians ended all their complaints by saying , " and it is only because we are poor indians , and know nothing ; but it was not so when we had a king . "
the next day after breakfast we rode a few miles northward to punta <unk> .
the road lay along a very broad beach , on which , even after so many fine days , a terrible surf was breaking .
i was assured that after a heavy <name> , the roar can be heard at night even at castro , a distance of no less than twenty-one <unk> across a hilly and wooded country .
we had some difficulty in reaching the point , owing to the intolerably bad paths ; for everywhere in the shade the ground soon becomes a perfect quagmire .
the point itself is a bold <name> hill .
it is covered by a plant allied , i believe , to <unk> , and called by the inhabitants <unk> .
in scrambling through the beds , our hands were very much scratched .
i was amused by observing the precaution our indian guide took , in turning up his trousers , thinking that they were more delicate than his own hard skin .
this plant bears a fruit , in shape like an <unk> , in which a number of <unk> are packed : these contain a pleasant sweet pulp , here much esteemed .
i saw at low 's harbour the <unk> making <unk> , or cider , with this fruit : so true is it , as humboldt remarks , that almost everywhere man finds means of preparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom .
the savages , however , of <name> <name> fuego , and i believe of australia , have not advanced thus far in the arts .
the coast to the north of punta <unk> is exceedingly rugged and broken , and is fronted by many breakers , on which the sea is eternally roaring .
mr. king and myself were anxious to return , if it had been possible , on foot along this coast ; but even the indians said it was quite impracticable .
we were told that men have crossed by striking directly through the woods from <unk> to s. <name> , but never by the coast .
on these expeditions , the indians <name> with them only roasted corn , and of this they eat sparingly twice a day .
<name> 26 , 1835 .
<unk> in the <unk> , we returned across the lake , and then mounted our horses .
the whole of chiloe took advantage of this week of unusually fine weather , to clear the ground by burning .
in every direction volumes of smoke were curling upwards .
although the inhabitants were so <unk> in setting fire to every part of the wood , yet i did not see a single fire which they had succeeded in making extensive .
we dined with our friend the commandant , and did not reach castro till after dark .
the next morning we started very early .
after having ridden for some time , we obtained from the brow of a steep hill an extensive view ( and it is a rare thing on this road ) of the great forest .
over the horizon of trees , the volcano of <unk> , and the great flat-topped one to the north , stood out in proud <unk> : scarcely another peak in the long range showed its snowy summit .
i <name> it <name> be long before i forget this farewell view of the magnificent cordillera fronting chiloe .
at night we <unk> under a cloudless sky , and the next morning reached s. <name> .
we arrived on the right day , for before evening heavy rain commenced .
february 4 , 1835 .
sailed from chiloe .
during the last week i made several short excursions .
one was to examine a great bed of <unk> shells , elevated 350 feet above the level of the sea : from among these shells , large <unk> were growing .
another ride was to p. <unk> .
i had with me a guide who knew the country far too well ; for he would pertinaciously tell me endless indian names for every little point , rivulet , and creek .
in the same manner as in <name> <name> fuego , the indian language appears singularly well adapted for attaching names to the most trivial features of the land .
i believe every one was glad to say farewell to chiloe ; yet if we could forget the gloom and ceaseless rain of <name> , chiloe might pass for a charming island .
there is also something very attractive in the simplicity and humble politeness of the poor inhabitants .
we steered northward along shore , but owing to thick weather did not reach valdivia till the night of the 8th .
the next morning the boat proceeded to the town , which is distant about ten miles .
we followed the course of the river , occasionally passing a few hovels , and patches of ground cleared out of the otherwise unbroken forest ; and sometimes meeting a canoe with an indian family .
the town is situated on the low banks of the stream , and is so completely buried in a wood of <unk> that the streets are merely paths in an orchard .
i have never seen any country where <unk> appeared to thrive so well as in this damp part of south <name> : on the borders of the roads there were many young trees evidently <unk> .
in chiloe the inhabitants possess a marvellously short method of making an orchard .
at the lower part of almost every branch , small , conical , brown , wrinkled points project : these are always ready to change into roots , as may sometimes be seen , where any mud has been accidentally splashed against the tree .
a branch as thick as a man 's thigh is chosen in the early spring , and is cut off just beneath a group of these points , all the smaller branches are <unk> off , and it is then placed about two feet deep in the ground .
during the ensuing summer the stump throws out long shoots , and sometimes even bears fruit : i was shown one which had produced as many as twenty-three apples , but this was thought very unusual .
in the third season the stump is changed ( as i have myself seen ) into a <unk> tree , loaded with fruit .
an old man near valdivia illustrated his motto , " <unk> es la <unk> <name> <unk> , " by giving an account of the several useful things he manufactured from his apples .
after making cider , and likewise wine , he extracted from the refuse a white and finely <unk> spirit ; by another process he procured a sweet <unk> , or , as he called it , <name> .
his children and pigs seemed almost to live , during this season of the year , in his orchard .
february 11 , 1835 .
i set out with a guide on a short ride , in which , however , i managed to see singularly little , either of the geology of the country or of its inhabitants .
there is not much cleared land near valdivia : after crossing a river at the distance of a few miles , we entered the forest , and then passed only one miserable hovel , before reaching our <unk> for the night .
the short difference in latitude , of 150 miles , has given a new aspect to the forest compared with that of chiloe .
this is owing to a slightly different proportion in the kinds of trees .
the evergreens do not appear to be quite so numerous , and the forest in consequence has a brighter tint .
as in chiloe , the lower parts are matted together by canes : here also another kind ( resembling the bamboo of brazil and about twenty feet in height ) grows in clusters , and ornaments the banks of some of the streams in a very pretty manner .
it is with this plant that the indians make their <unk> , or long tapering spears .
our <unk> was so dirty that i preferred sleeping outside : on these journeys the first night is generally very uncomfortable , because one is not accustomed to the tickling and biting of the fleas .
i am sure , in the morning , there was not a space on my legs of the size of a shilling which had not its little red <name> where the flea had feasted .
february 12 , 1835 .
we continued to ride through the <unk> forest ; only occasionally meeting an indian on horseback , or a troop of fine mules bringing <unk> and corn from the southern plains .
in the afternoon one of the horses knocked up ; we were then on a brow of a hill , which commanded a fine view of the <unk> .
the view of these open plains was very refreshing , after being hemmed in and buried in the wilderness of trees .
the uniformity of a forest soon becomes very wearisome .
this west coast makes me remember with pleasure the free , unbounded plains of patagonia ; yet , with the true spirit of contradiction , i can not forget how sublime is the silence of the forest .
the <unk> are the most fertile and thickly peopled parts of the country , as they possess the immense advantage of being nearly free from trees .
before leaving the forest we crossed some flat little lawns , around which single trees stood , as in an english park : i have often noticed with surprise , in wooded undulatory districts , that the quite level parts have been destitute of trees .
on account of the tired horse , i determined to stop at the mission of <unk> , to the friar of which i had a letter of introduction .
<unk> is an intermediate district between the forest and the <unk> .
there are a good many cottages , with patches of corn and potatoes , nearly all belonging to indians .
the tribes dependent on valdivia are " <unk> y <unk> . "
the indians farther northward , about <unk> and imperial , are still very wild , and not converted ; but they have all much intercourse with the spaniards .
the padre said that the <name> indians did not much like coming to mass , but that otherwise they showed respect for religion .
the greatest difficulty is in making them observe the ceremonies of marriage .
the wild indians take as many wives as they can support , and a <unk> <name> sometimes have more than ten : on entering his house , the number may be told by that of the separate fires .
each wife lives a week in turn with the <unk> ; but all are employed in weaving <unk> , etc. , for his profit .
to be the wife of a <unk> is an honour much sought after by the indian women .
the men of all these tribes wear a coarse woolen <unk> : those south of valdivia wear short trousers , and those north of it a petticoat , like the <unk> of the gauchos .
all have their long hair bound by a <name> <unk> , but with no other covering on their heads .
these indians are good-sized men ; their cheek-bones are prominent , and in general appearance they resemble the great american family to which they belong ; but their physiognomy seemed to me to be slightly different from that of any other tribe which i had before seen .
their expression is generally grave , and even austere , and possesses much character : this may pass either for honest <unk> or fierce determination .
the long black hair , the grave and <unk> features , and the dark complexion , called to my mind old portraits of <name> i .
on the road we met with none of that humble politeness so universal in chiloe .
some gave their " <unk> " ( good morning ) with promptness , but the greater number did not seem inclined to offer any salute .
this independence of manners is probably a consequence of their long wars , and the repeated victories which they alone , of all the tribes in <name> , have gained over the spaniards .
i spent the evening very pleasantly , talking with the padre .
he was exceedingly kind and hospitable ; and coming from <name> , had contrived to surround himself with some few comforts .
being a man of some little education , he bitterly complained of the total want of society .
with no particular zeal for religion , no business or pursuit , how completely must this man 's life be wasted !
the next day , on our return , we met seven very <unk> indians , of whom some were <unk> that had just received from the chilian government their yearly small <unk> for having long remained faithful .
they were fine-looking men , and they rode one after the other , with most gloomy faces .
an old <unk> , who headed them , had been , i suppose , more excessively drunk than the rest , for he seemed both extremely grave and very <unk> .
shortly before this , two indians joined us , who were travelling from a distant mission to valdivia concerning some lawsuit .
one was a <unk> old man , but from his wrinkled beardless face looked more like an old woman than a man .
i frequently presented both of them with cigars ; and though ready to receive them , and i daresay grateful , they would hardly condescend to thank me .
a <unk> indian would have taken off his hat , and given his " <unk> <name> <name> ! "
the travelling was very tedious , both from the <unk> of the roads and from the number of great fallen trees , which it was necessary either to leap over or to avoid by making long <unk> .
we slept on the road , and next morning reached valdivia , whence i proceeded on board .
a few days afterwards i crossed the bay with a party of officers , and landed near the fort called <unk> .
the buildings were in a most ruinous state , and the <unk> quite rotten .
mr. <unk> remarked to the commanding officer , that with one discharge they would certainly all fall to pieces .
the poor man , trying to put a good face upon it , gravely replied , " no , i am sure , sir , they would stand two ! "
the spaniards must have intended to have made this place impregnable .
there is now lying in the middle of the courtyard a little mountain of mortar , which rivals in hardness the rock on which it is placed .
it was brought from chile , and cost <unk> dollars .
the revolution having broken out prevented its being applied to any purpose , and now it remains a monument of the fallen greatness of spain .
i wanted to go to a house about a mile and a half distant , but my guide said it was quite impossible to penetrate the wood in a straight line .
he offered , however , to lead me , by following obscure <unk> , the shortest way : the walk , nevertheless , took no less than three hours !
this man is employed in hunting strayed cattle ; yet , well as he must know the woods , he was not long since lost for two whole days , and had nothing to eat .
these facts convey a good idea of the <unk> of the forests of these countries .
a question often occurred to me  how long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain ?
this man showed me one which a party of fugitive <unk> had cut down fourteen years ago ; and taking this as a criterion , i should think a <unk> a foot and a half in diameter would in thirty years be changed into a heap of mould .
february 20 , , 1835 .
this day has been memorable in the annals of valdivia , for the most severe earthquake experienced by the oldest inhabitant .
i happened to be on shore , and was lying down in the wood to rest myself .
it came on suddenly , and lasted two minutes , but the time appeared much longer .
the rocking of the ground was very sensible .
the undulations appeared to my companion and myself to come from due east , whilst others thought they proceeded from south-west : this shows how difficult it sometimes is to perceive the direction of the vibrations .
there was no difficulty in standing upright , but the motion made me almost giddy : it was something like the movement of a vessel in a little <unk> , or still more like that felt by a person skating over thin ice , which bends under the weight of his body .
a bad earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations : the earth , the very emblem of solidity , has moved beneath our feet like a thin crust over a fluid ;  one second of time has created in the mind a strange idea of <unk> , which hours of reflection would not have produced .
in the forest , as a breeze moved the trees , i felt only the earth tremble , but saw no other effect .
captain fitz <name> and some officers were at the town during the shock , and there the scene was more striking ; for although the houses , from being built of wood , did not fall , they were violently shaken , and the boards creaked and rattled together .
the people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm .
it is these <unk> that create that perfect horror of earthquakes , experienced by all who have thus seen , as well as felt , their effects .
within the forest it was a deeply interesting , but by no means an <unk> phenomenon .
the tides were very curiously affected .
the great shock took place at the time of low water ; and an old woman who was on the beach told me that the water flowed very quickly , but not in great waves , to high-water <name> , and then as quickly returned to its proper level ; this was also evident by the line of wet sand .
the same kind of quick but quiet movement in the tide happened a few years since at chiloe , during a slight earthquake , and created much <unk> alarm .
in the course of the evening there were many weaker shocks , which seemed to produce in the harbour the most complicated currents , and some of great strength .
march 4 , 1835 .
we entered the harbour of <name> .
while the ship was beating up to the anchorage , i landed on the island of quiriquina .
the <unk> of the estate quickly rode down to tell me the terrible news of the great earthquake of the 20th :  " that not a house in <name> or <unk> ( the port ) was standing ; that seventy villages were destroyed ; and that a great wave had almost washed away the ruins of <unk> . "
of this latter statement i soon saw abundant proofs  the whole coast being strewed over with timber and furniture as if a thousand ships had been wrecked .
besides chairs , tables , <unk> , etc. , in great <name> , there were several roofs of cottages , which had been transported almost whole .
the <unk> at <unk> had been burst open , and great bags of cotton , <unk> , and other valuable merchandise were scattered on the shore .
during my walk round the island , i observed that numerous fragments of rock , which , from the <name> productions adhering to them , must recently have been lying in deep water , had been cast up high on the beach ; one of these was six feet long , three broad , and two thick .
the island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of the earthquake , as the beach did that of the consequent great wave .
the ground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines , perhaps caused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow island .
some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide .
many enormous masses had already fallen on the beach ; and the inhabitants thought that when the rains commenced far greater slips would happen .
the effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate , which <unk> the foundation of the island , was still more curious : the superficial parts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had been blasted by gunpowder .
this effect , which was rendered conspicuous by the fresh <unk> and displaced soil , must be confined to near the surface , for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock throughout chile ; nor is this improbable , as it is known that the surface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central part .
it is , perhaps , owing to this same reason that earthquakes do not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be expected .
i believe this convulsion has been more effectual in lessening the size of the island of quiriquina , than the ordinary <unk> of the sea and weather during the course of a whole century .
the next day i landed at <unk> , and afterwards rode to <name> .
both towns presented the most awful yet interesting spectacle i ever beheld .
to a person who had formerly known them , it possibly might have been still more impressive ; for the ruins were so mingled together , and the whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place , that it was scarcely possible to imagine its former condition .
the earthquake commenced at half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon .
if it had happened in the middle of the night , the greater number of the inhabitants ( which in this one province amount to many thousands ) must have perished , instead of less than a hundred : as it was , the invariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of the ground , alone saved them .
in <name> each house , or row of houses , stood by itself , a heap or line of ruins ; but in <unk> , owing to the great wave , little more than one layer of bricks , tiles , and timber , with here and there part of a wall left standing , could be distinguished .
from this circumstance <name> , although not so completely desolated , was a more terrible , and if i may so call it , picturesque sight .
the first shock was very sudden .
the <unk> at quiriquina told me that the first notice he received of it , was finding both the horse he rode and himself rolling together on the ground .
rising up , he was again thrown down .
he also told me that some cows which were standing on the steep side of the island were rolled into the sea .
the great wave caused the destruction of many cattle ; on one low island near the head of the bay , seventy animals were washed off and drowned .
it is generally thought that this has been the worst earthquake ever recorded in chile ; but as the very severe ones occur only after long intervals , this can not easily be known ; nor indeed would a much worse shock have made any great difference , for the ruin was now complete .
innumerable small <unk> followed the great earthquake , and within the first twelve days no less than three hundred were counted .
after viewing <name> , i can not understand how the greater number of inhabitants escaped unhurt .
the houses in many parts fell outwards ; thus forming in the middle of the streets little hillocks of brickwork and rubbish .
mr .
rouse , the english consul , told us that he was at breakfast when the first movement warned him to run out .
he had scarcely reached the middle of the courtyard , when one side of his house came thundering down .
he retained presence of mind to remember that , if he once got on the top of that part which had already fallen , he would be safe .
not being able from the motion of the ground to stand , he crawled up on his hands and knees ; and no sooner had he ascended this little eminence , than the other side of the house fell in , the great beams sweeping close in front of his head .
with his eyes blinded and his mouth choked with the cloud of dust which darkened the sky , at last he gained the street .
as shock succeeded shock , at the interval of a few minutes , no one dared approach the shattered ruins , and no one knew whether his dearest friends and relations were not perishing from the want of help .
those who had saved any property were obliged to keep a constant watch , for thieves <unk> about , and at each little trembling of the ground , with one hand they beat their breasts and cried " <unk> ! "
and then with the other <unk> what they could from the ruins .
the thatched roofs fell over the fires , and flames burst forth in all parts .
hundreds knew themselves ruined , and few had the means of providing food for the day .
earthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any country .
if beneath england the now inert subterranean forces should exert those powers which most assuredly in former geological ages they have exerted , how completely would the entire condition of the country be changed !
what would become of the lofty houses , thickly packed cities , great <unk> , the beautiful public and private edifices ?
if the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great earthquake in the dead of the night , how terrific would be the carnage !
england would at once be bankrupt ; all papers , records , and accounts would from that moment be lost .
government being unable to collect the taxes , and failing to maintain its authority , the hand of violence and <unk> would remain <unk> .
in every large town famine would go forth , pestilence and death following in its train .
shortly after the shock , a great wave was seen from the distance of three or four miles , approaching in the middle of the bay with a smooth outline ; but along the shore it tore up cottages and trees , as it swept onwards with irresistible force .
at the head of the bay it broke in a fearful line of white breakers , which rushed up to a height of 23 vertical feet above the highest <unk> .
their force must have been prodigious ; for at the fort a cannon with its carriage , estimated at four tons in weight , was moved 15 feet inwards .
a schooner was left in the midst of the ruins , 200 yards from the beach .
the first wave was followed by two others , which in their retreat carried away a vast wreck of floating objects .
in one part of the bay , a ship was pitched high and dry on shore , was carried off , again driven on shore , and again carried off .
in another part two large vessels anchored near together were whirled about , and their cables were thrice wound round each other : though anchored at a depth of 36 feet , they were for some minutes aground .
the great wave must have travelled slowly , for the inhabitants of <unk> had time to run up the hills behind the town ; and some sailors pulled out seaward , trusting successfully to their boat riding securely over the swell , if they could reach it before it broke .
one old woman with a little boy , four or five years old , ran into a boat , but there was nobody to row it out : the boat was consequently dashed against an anchor and cut in twain ; the old woman was drowned , but the child was picked up some hours afterwards clinging to the wreck .
pools of salt-water were still standing amidst the ruins of the houses , and children , making boats with old tables and chairs , appeared as happy as their parents were miserable .
it was , however , exceedingly interesting to observe , how much more active and cheerful all appeared than could have been expected .
it was remarked with much truth , that from the destruction being universal , no one individual was humbled more than another , or could suspect his friends of coldness  that most grievous result of the loss of wealth .
mr .
rouse , and a large party whom he kindly took under his protection , lived for the first week in a garden beneath some <unk> .
at first they were as <name> as if it had been a picnic ; but soon afterwards heavy rain caused much discomfort , for they were absolutely without shelter .
in captain fitz <name> 's excellent account of the earthquake it is said that two explosions , one like a column of smoke and another like the blowing of a great whale , were seen in the bay .
the water also appeared everywhere to be boiling ; and it " became black , and <unk> a most disagreeable <unk> smell . "
these latter circumstances were observed in the bay of valparaiso during the earthquake of 1822 ; they may , i think , be accounted for by the disturbance of the mud at the bottom of the sea containing organic matter in decay .
in the bay of callao , during a calm day , i noticed , that as the ship dragged her cable over the bottom , its course was marked by a line of bubbles .
the lower orders in <unk> thought that the earthquake was caused by some old indian women , who two years ago , being offended , stopped the volcano of <unk> .
this silly belief is curious , because it shows that experience has taught them to observe that there exists a relation between the suppressed action of the <unk> , and the trembling of the ground .
it was necessary to apply the witchcraft to the point where their perception of cause and effect failed ; and this was the closing of the volcanic vent .
this belief is the more singular in this particular instance because , according to captain fitz <name> , there is reason to believe that <unk> was <unk> affected .
the town of <name> was built in the usual spanish fashion , with all the streets running at right angles to each other ; one set ranging south-west by west , and the other set north-west by north .
the walls in the former direction certainly stood better than those in the latter ; the greater number of the masses of brickwork were thrown down towards the north-east .
both these circumstances perfectly agree with the general idea of the undulations having come from the south-west ; in which quarter subterranean noises were also heard ; for it is evident that the walls running south-west and north-east which presented their ends to the point whence the undulations came , would be much less likely to fall than those walls which , running north-west and south-east , must in their whole lengths have been at the same instant thrown out of the perpendicular ; for the undulations , coming from the south-west , must have extended in north-west and south-east waves , as they passed under the foundations .
this may be illustrated by placing books <unk> on a carpet , and then , after the manner suggested by <name> , imitating the undulations of an earthquake : it <name> be found that they fall with more or less readiness , according as their direction more or less nearly <unk> with the line of the waves .
the fissures in the ground generally , though not uniformly , extended in a south-east and north-west direction , and therefore corresponded to the lines of <unk> or of principal flexure .
bearing in mind all these circumstances , which so clearly point to the south-west as the chief focus of disturbance , it is a very interesting fact that the island of s. <name> , situated in that quarter , was , during the general uplifting of the land , raised to nearly three times the height of any other part of the coast .
the different resistance offered by the walls , according to their direction , was well exemplified in the case of the cathedral .
the side which fronted the north-east presented a grand pile of ruins , in the midst of which <unk> and masses of timber stood up , as if floating in a stream .
some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great dimensions ; and they were rolled to a distance on the level plaza , like fragments of rock at the base of some high mountain .
the side walls ( running south-west and north-east ) , though exceedingly fractured , yet remained standing ; but the vast buttresses ( at right angles to them , and therefore parallel to the walls that fell ) were in many cases cut clean off , as if by a chisel , and hurled to the ground .
some square ornaments on the coping of these same walls were moved by the earthquake into a diagonal position .
a similar circumstance was observed after an earthquake at valparaiso , <unk> , and other places , including some of the ancient greek temples .
( <unk> .
m. arago in " <unk> " 1839 <name> 337 .
see also <unk> 's " chile " volume 1 <name> 392 ; also lyell 's " principles of geology " chapter 15 book 2 . )
this twisting displacement at first appears to indicate a <unk> movement beneath each point thus affected ; but this is highly improbable .
may it not be caused by a tendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular position with respect to the lines of vibration ,  in a manner somewhat similar to pins on a sheet of paper when shaken ?
generally speaking , arched doorways or windows stood much better than any other part of the buildings .
nevertheless , a poor lame old man , who had been in the habit , during trifling shocks , of crawling to a certain doorway , was this time crushed to pieces .
i have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance of <name> , for i feel that it is quite impossible to convey the mingled feelings which i experienced .
several of the officers visited it before me , but their strongest language failed to give a just idea of the scene of desolation .
it is a bitter and humiliating thing to see works , which have cost man so much time and labour , overthrown in one minute ; yet compassion for the inhabitants was almost instantly banished , by the surprise in seeing a state of things produced in a moment of time , which one was accustomed to attribute to a succession of ages .
in my opinion , we have scarcely beheld , since leaving england , any sight so deeply interesting .
in almost every severe earthquake , the neighbouring waters of the sea are said to have been greatly agitated .
the disturbance seems generally , as in the case of <name> , to have been of two kinds : first , at the instant of the shock , the water swells high up on the beach with a gentle motion , and then as quietly retreats ; secondly , some time afterwards , the whole body of the sea retires from the coast , and then returns in waves of overwhelming force .
the first movement seems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting differently a fluid and a solid , so that their respective levels are slightly deranged : but the second case is a far more important phenomenon .
during most earthquakes , and especially during those on the west coast of <name> , it is certain that the first great movement of the waters has been a retirement .
some authors have attempted to explain this , by supposing that the water retains its level , whilst the land <unk> upwards ; but surely the water close to the land , even on a rather steep coast , would partake of the motion of the bottom : moreover , as urged by mr. lyell , similar movements of the sea have occurred at islands far distant from the chief line of disturbance , as was the case with <name> fernandez during this earthquake , and with madeira during the famous lisbon shock .
i suspect ( but the subject is a very obscure one ) that a wave , however produced , first draws the water from the shore , on which it is advancing to break : i have observed that this happens with the little waves from the paddles of a <unk> .
it is remarkable that whilst <unk> and callao ( near lima ) , both situated at the head of large shallow bays , have suffered during every severe earthquake from great waves , valparaiso , seated close to the edge of profoundly deep water , has never been overwhelmed , though so often shaken by the severest shocks .
from the great wave not immediately following the earthquake , but sometimes after the interval of even half an hour , and from distant islands being affected similarly with the coasts near the focus of the disturbance , it appears that the wave first rises in the offing ; and as this is of general occurrence , the cause must be general : i suspect we must look to the line where the less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the water nearer the coast , which has partaken of the movements of the land , as the place where the great wave is first generated ; it would also appear that the wave is larger or smaller , according to the extent of shoal water which has been agitated together with the bottom on which it rested .
the most remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent elevation of the land ; it would probably be far more correct to speak of it as the cause .
there can be no doubt that the land round the bay of <name> was upraised two or three feet ; but it deserves notice , that owing to the wave having obliterated the old lines of tidal action on the sloping <name> shores , i could discover no evidence of this fact , except in the united testimony of the inhabitants , that one little <name> shoal , now exposed , was formerly covered with water .
at the island of s. <name> ( about thirty miles distant ) the elevation was greater ; on one part , captain fitz <name> found beds of putrid <unk> still adhering to the rocks , ten feet above high-water <name> : the inhabitants had formerly dived at <unk> <unk> for these shells .
the elevation of this province is particularly interesting , from its having been the theatre of several other violent earthquakes , and from the vast <name> of sea-shells scattered over the land , up to a height of certainly 600 , and i believe , of 1000 feet .
at valparaiso , as i have remarked , similar shells are found at the height of <unk> feet : it is hardly possible to doubt that this great elevation has been effected by successive small <unk> , such as that which accompanied or caused the earthquake of this year , and likewise by an insensibly slow rise , which is certainly in progress on some parts of this coast .
the island of <name> fernandez , 360 miles to the north-east , was , at the time of the great shock of the 20th , violently shaken , so that the trees beat against each other , and a volcano burst forth under water close to the shore : these facts are remarkable because this island , during the earthquake of <unk> , was then also affected more violently than other places at an equal distance from <name> , and this seems to show some subterranean connexion between these two points .
chiloe , about 340 miles southward of <name> , appears to have been shaken more strongly than the intermediate district of valdivia , where the volcano of <unk> was <unk> affected , whilst in the cordillera in front of chiloe two of the <unk> burst forth at the same instant in violent action .
these two <unk> , and some neighbouring ones , continued for a long time in eruption , and ten months afterwards were again influenced by an earthquake at <name> .
some men cutting wood near the base of one of these <unk> , did not perceive the shock of the 20th , although the whole surrounding province was then trembling ; here we have an eruption relieving and taking the place of an earthquake , as would have happened at <name> , according to the belief of the lower orders , if the volcano at <unk> had not been closed by witchcraft .
two years and three-quarters afterwards valdivia and chiloe were again shaken , more violently than on the 20th , and an island in the chonos archipelago was permanently elevated more than eight feet .
it <name> give a better idea of the scale of these phenomena , if ( as in the case of the glaciers ) we suppose them to have taken place at corresponding distances in europe :  then would the land from the north sea to the mediterranean have been violently shaken , and at the same instant of time a large tract of the eastern coast of england would have been permanently elevated , together with some outlying islands ,  a train of <unk> on the coast of holland would have burst forth in action , and an eruption taken place at the bottom of the sea , near the northern extremity of ireland  and lastly , the ancient vents of <unk> , <unk> , and mont <unk> would each have sent up to the sky a dark column of smoke , and have long remained in fierce action .
two years and three-quarters afterwards , <name> , from its centre to the english channel , would have been again desolated by an earthquake , and an island permanently upraised in the mediterranean .
the space , from under which volcanic matter on the 20th was actually erupted , is <unk> miles in one line , and 400 miles in another line at right angles to the first : hence , in all probability , a subterranean lake of lava is here stretched out , of nearly double the area of the black sea .
from the intimate and complicated manner in which the elevatory and <unk> forces were shown to be connected during this train of phenomena , we may confidently come to the conclusion that the forces which slowly and by little starts uplift continents , and those which at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open orifices , are identical .
from many reasons , i believe that the frequent <unk> of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the rending of the strata , necessarily consequent on the tension of the land when upraised , and their injection by <unk> rock .
this rending and injection would , if repeated often enough ( and we know that earthquakes repeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner ) , form a chain of hills ;  and the linear island of st. <name> , which was upraised thrice the height of the neighbouring country , seems to be undergoing this process .
i believe that the solid axis of a mountain differs in its manner of formation from a volcanic hill , only in the molten stone having been repeatedly injected , instead of having been repeatedly ejected .
moreover , i believe that it is impossible to explain the structure of great <unk> , such as that of the cordillera , where the strata , capping the injected axis of plutonic rock , have been thrown on their edges along several parallel and neighbouring lines of elevation , except on this view of the rock of the axis having been repeatedly injected , after intervals sufficiently long to allow the upper parts or wedges to cool and become solid ;  for if the strata had been thrown into their present <unk> , vertical , and even inverted positions , by a single blow , the very bowels of the earth would have gushed out ; and instead of beholding abrupt <unk> of rock solidified under great pressure , deluges of lava would have flowed out at innumerable points on every line of elevation .
( <unk> .
for a full account of the volcanic phenomena which accompanied the earthquake of the 20th , and for the conclusions <unk> from them , i must refer to volume 5 of the " geological transactions . " )

march 7 , 1835 .
we stayed three days at <name> , and then sailed for valparaiso .
the wind being northerly , we only reached the mouth of the harbour of <name> before it was dark .
being very near the land , and a fog coming on , the anchor was dropped .
presently a large american whaler appeared close alongside of us ; and we heard the yankee swearing at his men to keep quiet , whilst he listened for the breakers .
captain fitz <name> hailed him , in a loud clear voice , to anchor where he then was .
the poor man must have thought the voice came from the shore : such a babel of cries issued at once from the ship  every one <unk> out , " let go the anchor !
<unk> cable !
shorten sail ! "
it was the most laughable thing i ever heard .
if the ship 's crew had been all captains , and no men , there could not have been a greater uproar of orders .
we afterwards found that the mate stuttered : i suppose all hands were assisting him in giving his orders .
on the 11th we anchored at valparaiso , and two days afterwards i set out to cross the cordillera .
i proceeded to <name> , where mr. <unk> most kindly assisted me in every possible way in making the little preparations which were necessary .
in this part of chile there are two passes across the andes to mendoza : the one most commonly used , namely , that of aconcagua or uspallata  is situated some way to the north ; the other , called the portillo , is to the south , and nearer , but more lofty and dangerous .
march 18 , 1835 .
( plate 73 .
<unk> . )
we set out for the portillo pass .
leaving <name> we crossed the wide <unk> plain on which that city stands , and in the afternoon arrived at the <unk> , one of the principal rivers in chile .
the valley , at the point where it enters the first cordillera , is bounded on each side by lofty barren mountains ; and although not broad , it is very fertile .
numerous cottages were surrounded by vines , and by orchards of apple , nectarine , and peach-trees  their boughs breaking with the weight of the beautiful ripe fruit .
in the evening we passed the custom-house , where our luggage was examined .
the frontier of chile is better guarded by the cordillera than by the waters of the sea .
there are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges , and the mountains are quite impassable in other parts by beasts of burden .
the custom-house officers were very civil , which was perhaps partly owing to the passport which the president of the republic had given me ; but i must express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost every <unk> .
in this instance , the contrast with the same class of men in most other countries was strongly marked .
i may mention an anecdote with which i was at the time much pleased : we met near mendoza a little and very fat negress , riding astride on a mule .
she had a <unk> so enormous that it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment ; but my two companions almost instantly , by way of apology , made the common salute of the country by taking off their hats .
where would one of the lower or higher classes in europe have shown such feeling politeness to a poor and miserable object of a degraded race ?
at night we slept at a cottage .
our manner of travelling was delightfully independent .
in the inhabited parts we bought a little firewood , hired pasture for the animals , and <unk> in the corner of the same field with them .
carrying an iron pot , we cooked and ate our supper under a cloudless sky , and knew no trouble .
my companions were <name> gonzales , who had formerly accompanied me in chile , and an " <unk> , " with his ten mules and a " <unk> . "
the <unk> ( or <unk> ) is a most important personage : she is an old steady mare , with a little <name> round her neck ; and wherever she goes , the mules , like good children , follow her .
the affection of these animals for their <unk> saves infinite trouble .
if several large troops are turned into one field to graze , in the morning the <unk> have only to lead the <unk> a little apart , and tinkle their bells ; and although there may be two or three hundred together , each mule immediately knows the <name> of its own <unk> , and comes to her .
it is nearly impossible to lose an old mule ; for if detained for several hours by force , she <name> , by the power of smell , like a dog , track out her companions , or rather the <unk> , for , according to the <unk> , she is the chief object of affection .
the feeling , however , is not of an individual nature ; for i believe i am right in saying that any animal with a <name> <name> serve as a <unk> .
in a troop each animal carries on a level road , a cargo weighing 416 pounds ( more than 29 stone ) , but in a mountainous country 100 pounds less ; yet with what delicate slim limbs , without any proportional bulk of muscle , these animals support so great a burden !
the mule always appears to me a most surprising animal .
that a hybrid should possess more reason , memory , obstinacy , social affection , powers of muscular endurance , and length of life , than either of its parents , seems to indicate that <name> has here outdone nature .
of our ten animals , six were intended for riding , and four for carrying cargoes , each taking turn about .
we carried a good deal of food in case we should be snowed up , as the season was rather late for passing the portillo .
march 19 , 1835 .
we rode during this day to the last , and therefore most elevated , house in the valley .
the number of inhabitants became scanty ; but wherever water could be brought on the land , it was very fertile .
all the main valleys in the cordillera are characterised by having , on both sides , a fringe or terrace of shingle and sand , rudely stratified , and generally of considerable thickness .
these fringes evidently once extended across the valleys and were united ; and the bottoms of the valleys in northern chile , where there are no streams , are thus smoothly filled up .
on these fringes the roads are generally carried , for their surfaces are even , and they rise with a very gentle slope up the valleys : hence , also , they are easily cultivated by irrigation .
they may be traced up to a height of between <unk> and <unk> feet , where they become hidden by the irregular piles of debris .
at the lower end or mouths of the valleys they are continuously united to those <unk> plains ( also formed of shingle ) at the foot of the main cordillera , which i have described in a former chapter as characteristic of the scenery of chile , and which were undoubtedly deposited when the sea penetrated chile , as it now does the more southern coasts .
no one fact in the geology of south <name> interested me more than these terraces of <unk> shingle .
they precisely resemble in composition the matter which the torrents in each valley would deposit if they were checked in their course by any cause , such as entering a lake or arm of the sea ; but the torrents , instead of depositing matter , are now steadily at work wearing away both the solid rock and these alluvial deposits , along the whole line of every main valley and side valley .
it is impossible here to give the reasons , but i am convinced that the shingle terraces were accumulated , during the gradual elevation of the cordillera , by the torrents delivering , at successive levels , their detritus on the <unk> of long narrow arms of the sea , first high up the valleys , then lower and lower down as the land slowly rose .
if this be so , and i can not doubt it , the grand and broken chain of the cordillera , instead of having been suddenly thrown up , as was till lately the universal , and still is the common opinion of geologists , has been slowly upheaved in mass , in the same gradual manner as the coasts of the atlantic and pacific have risen within the recent period .
a multitude of facts in the structure of the cordillera , on this view receive a simple explanation .
( plate 74 .
south american bit . )
the rivers which flow in these valleys ought rather to be called <unk> .
their inclination is very great , and their water the colour of mud .
the roar which the <unk> made , as it rushed over the great rounded fragments , was like that of the sea .
amidst the din of rushing waters , the noise from the stones , as they rattled one over another , was most distinctly audible even from a distance .
this rattling noise , night and day , may be heard along the whole course of the torrent .
the sound spoke eloquently to the geologist ; the thousands and thousands of stones which , striking against each other , made the one dull uniform sound , were all hurrying in one direction .
it was like thinking on time , where the minute that now glides past is <unk> .
so was it with these stones ; the ocean is their eternity , and each note of that wild music told of one more step towards their <name> .
it is not possible for the mind to comprehend , except by a slow process , any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often that the <unk> itself conveys an idea not more definite than the savage implies when he points to the hairs of his head .
as often as i have seen beds of mud , sand , and shingle , accumulated to the thickness of many thousand feet , i have felt inclined to exclaim that causes , such as the present rivers and the present beaches , could never have ground down and produced such masses .
but , on the other hand , when listening to the rattling noise of these torrents , and calling to mind that whole races of animals have passed away from the face of the earth , and that during this whole period , night and day , these stones have gone rattling onwards in their course , i have thought to myself , can any mountains , any continent , withstand such waste ?
in this part of the valley , the mountains on each side were from 3000 to <unk> or <unk> feet high , with rounded outlines and steep bare flanks .
the general colour of the rock was <unk> purple , and the stratification very distinct .
if the scenery was not beautiful , it was remarkable and grand .
we met during the day several herds of cattle , which men were driving down from the higher valleys in the cordillera .
this sign of the approaching <name> hurried our steps , more than was convenient for <unk> .
the house where we slept was situated at the foot of a mountain , on the summit of which are the mines of s. <name> de <unk> .
sir f. head marvels how mines have been discovered in such extraordinary situations , as the bleak summit of the mountain of s. <name> de <unk> .
in the first place , metallic veins in this country are generally harder than the surrounding strata : hence , during the gradual wear of the hills , they project above the surface of the ground .
secondly , almost every <unk> , especially in the northern parts of chile , understands something about the appearance of ores .
in the great mining provinces of coquimbo and copiapó , firewood is very scarce , and men search for it over every hill and <name> ; and by this means nearly all the richest mines have there been discovered .
<unk> , from which silver to the value of many hundred thousand pounds has been raised in the course of a few years , was discovered by a man who threw a stone at his loaded donkey , and thinking that it was very heavy , he picked it up , and found it full of pure silver : the vein occurred at no great distance , standing up like a wedge of metal .
the miners , also , taking a crowbar with them , often wander on sundays over the mountains .
in this south part of chile the men who drive cattle into the cordillera , and who frequent every ravine where there is a little pasture , are the usual <unk> .
march 20 , 1835 .
as we ascended the valley , the vegetation , with the exception of a few pretty alpine flowers , became exceedingly scanty ; and of quadrupeds , birds , or insects , scarcely one could be seen .
the lofty mountains , their summits marked with a few patches of snow , stood well separated from each other ; the valleys being filled up with an immense thickness of stratified <unk> .
the features in the scenery of the andes which struck me most , as contrasted with the other mountain chains with which i am acquainted , were ,  the flat fringes sometimes expanding into narrow plains on each side of the valleys ,  the bright colours , chiefly red and purple , of the utterly bare and precipitous hills of porphyry , the grand and continuous <unk> dikes ,  the <unk> strata which , where nearly vertical , formed the picturesque and wild central pinnacles , but where less inclined , composed the great massive mountains on the outskirts of the range ,  and lastly , the smooth conical piles of fine and brightly coloured detritus , which sloped up at a high <name> from the base of the mountains , sometimes to a height of more than 2000 feet .
i frequently observed , both in <name> <name> fuego and within the andes , that where the rock was covered during the greater part of the year with snow , it was shivered in a very extraordinary manner into small angular fragments .
<unk> has observed the same fact in <unk> .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " arctic regions " volume 1 <name> 122 . )
the case appears to me rather obscure : for that part of the mountain which is protected by a mantle of snow must be less subject to repeated and great changes of temperature than any other part .
i have sometimes thought that the earth and fragments of stone on the surface were perhaps less effectually removed by slowly <unk> <unk> than by rain , and therefore that the appearance of a quicker disintegration of the solid rock under the snow was deceptive .
( <unk> .
i have heard it remarked in shropshire that the water , when the severn is flooded from long-continued rain , is much more turbid than when it proceeds from the snow melting on the welsh mountains .
d'orbigny tome 1 <name> 184 , in explaining the cause of the various colours of the rivers in south <name> , remarks that those with blue or clear water have their source in the cordillera , where the snow melts . )
whatever the cause may be , the quantity of crumbling stone on the cordillera is very great .
occasionally in the spring great masses of this detritus slide down the mountains , and cover the <unk> in the valleys , thus forming natural <unk> .
we rode over one , the height of which was far below the limit of perpetual snow .
as the evening <name> to a close , we reached a singular basin-like plain , called the <unk> <name> yeso .
it was covered by a little dry pasture , and we had the pleasant sight of a herd of cattle amidst the surrounding <name> deserts .
the valley takes its name of yeso from a great bed , i should think at least 2000 feet thick , of white , and in some parts quite pure , gypsum .
we slept with a party of men , who were employed in loading mules with this substance , which is used in the manufacture of wine .
we set out early in the morning ( 21st ) , and continued to follow the course of the river , which had become very small , till we arrived at the foot of the ridge that separates the waters flowing into the pacific and atlantic oceans .
the road , which as yet had been good with a steady but very gradual ascent , now changed into a steep zigzag track up the great range dividing the republics of chile and mendoza .
i <name> here give a very brief sketch of the geology of the several parallel lines forming the cordillera .
of these lines , there are two considerably higher than the others ; namely , on the chilian side , the peuquenes ridge , which , where the road crosses it , is <unk> feet above the sea ; and the portillo ridge , on the mendoza side , which is <unk> feet .
the lower beds of the peuquenes ridge , and of the several great lines to the westward of it , are composed of a vast pile , many thousand feet in thickness , of porphyries which have flowed as submarine lavas , alternating with angular and rounded fragments of the same rocks , thrown out of the submarine craters .
these alternating masses are covered in the central parts by a great thickness of red sandstone , conglomerate , and calcareous clay-slate , associated with , and passing into , prodigious beds of gypsum .
in these upper beds shells are tolerably frequent ; and they belong to about the period of the lower chalk of europe .
it is an old story , but not the less wonderful , to hear of shells which were once crawling on the bottom of the sea , now standing nearly <unk> feet above its level .
the lower beds in this great pile of strata have been dislocated , baked , crystallised and almost blended together , through the agency of mountain masses of a peculiar white <unk> rock .
the other main line , namely , that of the portillo , is of a totally different formation : it consists chiefly of grand bare pinnacles of a red <unk> , which low down on the western flank are covered by a sandstone , converted by the former heat into a <unk> .
on the quartz there rest beds of a conglomerate several thousand feet in thickness , which have been upheaved by the red granite , and dip at an <name> of 45 degrees towards the peuquenes line .
i was astonished to find that this conglomerate was partly composed of pebbles , derived from the rocks , with their fossil shells , of the peuquenes range ; and partly of red <unk> , like that of the portillo .
hence we must conclude that both the peuquenes and portillo ranges were partially upheaved and exposed to wear and tear when the conglomerate was forming ; but as the beds of the conglomerate have been thrown off at an <name> of 45 degrees by the red portillo granite ( with the underlying sandstone baked by it ) , we may feel sure that the greater part of the injection and upheaval of the already partially formed portillo line took place after the accumulation of the conglomerate , and long after the elevation of the peuquenes ridge .
so that the portillo , the loftiest line in this part of the cordillera , is not so old as the less lofty line of the peuquenes .
evidence derived from an inclined stream of lava at the eastern base of the portillo might be adduced to show that it owes part of its great height to elevations of a still later date .
looking to its earliest origin , the red granite seems to have been injected on an ancient pre-existing line of white granite and mica-slate .
in most parts , perhaps in all parts , of the cordillera , it may be concluded that each line has been formed by repeated <unk> and <unk> ; and that the several parallel lines are of different ages .
only thus can we gain time at all sufficient to explain the truly astonishing amount of denudation which these great , though comparatively with most other ranges recent , mountains have suffered .
finally , the shells in the peuquenes or oldest ridge prove , as before remarked , that it has been upraised <unk> feet since a secondary period , which in europe we are accustomed to consider as far from ancient ; but since these shells lived in a moderately deep sea , it can be shown that the area now occupied by the cordillera must have subsided several thousand feet  in northern chile as much as <unk> feet  so as to have allowed that amount of submarine strata to have been heaped on the bed on which the shells lived .
the proof is the same with that by which it was shown that , at a much later period since the tertiary shells of patagonia lived , there must have been there a subsidence of several hundred feet , as well as an ensuing elevation .
daily it is forced home on the mind of the geologist that nothing , not even the wind that blows , is so unstable as the level of the crust of this earth .
i <name> make only one other geological remark : although the portillo chain is here higher than the peuquenes , the waters , draining the intermediate valleys , have burst through it .
the same fact , on a grander scale , has been remarked in the eastern and loftiest line of the <unk> cordillera , through which the rivers pass : analogous facts have also been observed in other quarters of the world .
on the supposition of the subsequent and gradual elevation of the portillo line , this can be understood ; for a chain of islets would at first appear , and , as these were lifted up , the tides would be always wearing deeper and broader channels between them .
at the present day , even in the most retired sounds on the coast of <name> <name> fuego , the currents in the transverse breaks which connect the longitudinal channels are very strong , so that in one transverse channel even a small vessel under sail was whirled round and round .
about noon we began the tedious ascent of the peuquenes ridge , and then for the first time experienced some little difficulty in our respiration .
the mules would halt every fifty yards , and after resting for a few seconds the poor willing animals started of their own accord again .
the short breathing from the rarefied atmosphere is called by the <unk> " <unk> ; " and they have most ridiculous notions concerning its origin .
some say " all the waters here have <unk> ; " others that " where there is snow there is <unk> ; "  and this no doubt is true .
the only sensation i experienced was a slight <unk> across the head and chest , like that felt on leaving a warm room and running quickly in frosty weather .
there was some imagination even in this ; for upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge , i entirely forgot the <unk> in my delight .
certainly the exertion of walking was extremely great , and the respiration became deep and laborious : i am told that in <unk> ( about <unk> feet above the sea ) strangers do not become thoroughly accustomed to the atmosphere for an entire year .
the inhabitants all recommend onions for the <unk> ; as this vegetable has sometimes been given in europe for <unk> complaints , it may possibly be of real service :  for my part i found nothing so good as the fossil shells !
when about half-way up we met a large party with seventy loaded mules .
it was interesting to hear the wild cries of the <unk> , and to watch the long descending string of the animals ; they appeared so diminutive , there being nothing but the black mountains with which they could be compared .
when near the summit , the wind , as generally happens , was impetuous and extremely cold .
on each side of the ridge we had to pass over broad bands of perpetual snow , which were now soon to be covered by a fresh layer .
when we reached the crest and looked backwards , a glorious view was presented .
the atmosphere <unk> clear ; the sky an intense blue ; the profound valleys ; the wild broken forms : the heaps of ruins , piled up during the lapse of ages ; the bright-coloured rocks , contrasted with the quiet mountains of snow , all these together produced a scene no one could have imagined .
neither plant nor bird , excepting a few <unk> wheeling around the higher pinnacles , distracted my attention from the inanimate mass .
i felt glad that i was alone : it was like watching a thunderstorm , or hearing in full orchestra a chorus of the <unk> .
on several patches of the snow i found the <unk> <unk> , or red snow , so well known from the accounts of arctic navigators .
my attention was called to it by observing the footsteps of the mules stained a pale red , as if their hoofs had been slightly bloody .
i at first thought that it was owing to dust blown from the surrounding mountains of red porphyry ; for from the <unk> power of the crystals of snow , the groups of these microscopical plants appeared like coarse particles .
the snow was coloured only where it had thawed very rapidly , or had been accidentally crushed .
a little rubbed on paper gave it a faint rose tinge mingled with a little brick-red .
i afterwards scraped some off the paper , and found that it consisted of groups of little spheres in colourless cases , each the thousandth part of an inch in diameter .
the wind on the crest of the peuquenes , as just remarked , is generally impetuous and very cold : it is said to blow steadily from the westward or pacific side .
( <unk> .
dr. <unk> in " journal of natural and geographical science " <name> 1830 .
this author gives the heights of the passes . )
as the observations have been chiefly made in summer , this wind must be an upper and return current .
the peak of teneriffe , with a less elevation , and situated in latitude 28 degrees , in like manner falls within an upper return stream .
at first it appears rather surprising that the trade-wind along the northern parts of chile and on the coast of peru should blow in so very southerly a direction as it does ; but when we reflect that the cordillera , running in a north and south line , <unk> , like a great wall , the entire depth of the lower atmospheric current , we can easily see that the trade-wind must be drawn northward , following the line of mountains , towards the equatorial regions , and thus lose part of that easterly movement which it otherwise would have gained from the earth 's rotation .
at mendoza , on the eastern foot of the andes , the climate is said to be subject to long <unk> , and to frequent though false appearances of gathering <unk> : we may imagine that the wind , which coming from the eastward is thus banked up by the line of mountains , would become stagnant and irregular in its movements .
having crossed the peuquenes , we descended into a mountainous country , intermediate between the two main ranges , and then took up our quarters for the night .
we were now in the republic of mendoza .
the elevation was probably not under <unk> feet , and the vegetation in consequence exceedingly scanty .
the root of a small <unk> plant served as fuel , but it made a miserable fire , and the wind was <unk> cold .
being quite tired with my days work , i made up my bed as quickly as i could , and went to sleep .
about midnight i observed the sky became suddenly clouded : i awakened the <unk> to know if there was any danger of bad weather ; but he said that without thunder and lightning there was no risk of a heavy snow-storm .
the peril is imminent , and the difficulty of subsequent escape great , to any one overtaken by bad weather between the two ranges .
a certain cave offers the only place of refuge : mr. <unk> , who crossed on this same day of the month , was detained there for some time by a heavy fall of snow .
<unk> , or houses of refuge , have not been built in this pass as in that of uspallata , and therefore , during the autumn , the portillo is little frequented .
i may here remark that within the main cordillera rain never falls , for during the summer the sky is cloudless , and in <name> <unk> alone occur .
at the place where we slept water necessarily boiled , from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere , at a lower temperature than it does in a less lofty country ; the case being the converse of that of a <unk> 's <unk> .
hence the potatoes , after remaining for some hours in the boiling water , were nearly as hard as ever .
the pot was left on the fire all night , and next morning it was boiled again , but yet the potatoes were not cooked .
i found out this by <unk> my two companions discussing the cause , they had come to the simple conclusion " that the cursed pot ( which was a new one ) did not choose to boil potatoes . "
march 22 , 1835 .
after eating our <unk> breakfast , we travelled across the intermediate tract to the foot of the portillo range .
in the middle of summer cattle are brought up here to graze ; but they had now all been removed : even the greater number of the guanacos had <unk> , knowing well that if overtaken here by a snow-storm , they would be caught in a trap .
we had a fine view of a mass of mountains called <unk> , the whole clothed with unbroken snow , in the midst of which there was a blue patch , no doubt a glacier ;  a circumstance of rare occurrence in these mountains .
now commenced a heavy and long climb , similar to that of the peuquenes .
bold conical hills of red granite rose on each hand ; in the valleys there were several broad fields of perpetual snow .
these frozen masses , during the process of thawing , had in some parts been converted into pinnacles or columns , which , as they were high and close together , made it difficult for the cargo mules to pass .
( <unk> .
this structure in frozen snow was long since observed by <unk> in the icebergs near <unk> , and , lately , with more care , by colonel <name> " journal of geographical society " volume 5 <name> 12 , on the <name> .
mr. lyell " principles " volume 4 <name> 360 , has compared the fissures , by which the columnar structure seems to be determined , to the joints that traverse nearly all rocks , but which are best seen in the <unk> masses .
i may observe that in the case of the frozen snow the columnar structure must be owing to a " metamorphic " action , and not to a process during deposition . )
on one of these columns of ice a frozen horse was sticking as on a pedestal , but with its hind legs straight up in the air .
the animal , i suppose , must have fallen with its head downward into a hole , when the snow was continuous , and afterwards the surrounding parts must have been removed by the thaw .
when nearly on the crest of the portillo , we were enveloped in a falling cloud of minute frozen <unk> .
this was very unfortunate , as it continued the whole day , and quite intercepted our view .
the pass takes its name of portillo from a narrow cleft or doorway on the highest ridge , through which the road passes .
from this point , on a clear day , those vast plains which uninterruptedly extend to the atlantic ocean can be seen .
we descended to the upper limit of vegetation , and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of some large fragments of rock .
we met here some passengers , who made anxious inquiries about the state of the road .
shortly after it was dark the clouds suddenly cleared away , and the effect was quite magical .
the great mountains , bright with the full moon , seemed impending over us on all sides , as over a deep crevice : one morning , very early , i witnessed the same striking effect .
as soon as the clouds were dispersed it froze severely ; but as there was no wind , we slept very comfortably .
the increased brilliancy of the moon and stars at this elevation , owing to the perfect transparency of the atmosphere , was very remarkable .
travellers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and distances amidst lofty mountains , have generally attributed it to the absence of objects of comparison .
it appears to me , that it is fully as much owing to the transparency of the air <unk> objects at different distances , and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion ,  habit being thus opposed to the evidence of the senses .
i am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape , all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane , as in a drawing or panorama .
the transparency is , i presume , owing to the equable and high state of atmospheric dryness .
this dryness was shown by the manner in which woodwork shrank ( as i soon found by the trouble my geological hammer gave me ) ; by articles of food , such as bread and sugar , becoming extremely hard ; and by the preservation of the skin and parts of the flesh of the beasts which had perished on the road .
to the same cause we must attribute the singular facility with which electricity is excited .
my <unk> , when rubbed in the dark , appeared as if it had been washed with phosphorus ,  every hair on a dog 's back crackled ;  even the linen sheets , and leathern straps of the saddle , when handled , emitted sparks .
march 23 , 1835 .
the descent on the eastern side of the cordillera is much shorter or steeper than on the pacific side ; in other words , the mountains rise more abruptly from the plains than from the alpine country of chile .
a level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was stretched out beneath our feet , shutting out the view of the equally level pampas .
we soon entered the band of clouds , and did not again emerge from it that day .
about noon , finding pasture for the animals and bushes for firewood at los <unk> , we stopped for the night .
this was near the uppermost limit of bushes , and the elevation , i suppose , was between seven and eight thousand feet .
i was much struck with the marked difference between the vegetation of these eastern valleys and those on the chilian side : yet the climate , as well as the kind of soil , is nearly the same , and the difference of longitude very trifling .
the same remark holds good with the quadrupeds , and in a lesser degree with the birds and insects .
i may instance the mice , of which i obtained thirteen species on the shores of the atlantic , and five on the pacific , and not one of them is identical .
we must except all those species which habitually or occasionally frequent elevated mountains ; and certain birds , which range as far south as the strait of magellan .
this fact is in perfect accordance with the geological history of the andes ; for these mountains have existed as a great barrier since the present races of animals have appeared ; and therefore , unless we suppose the same species to have been created in two different places , we ought not to expect any closer similarity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of the andes than on the opposite shores of the ocean .
in both cases , we must leave out of the question those kinds which have been able to cross the barrier , whether of solid rock or salt-water .
( <unk> .
this is merely an illustration of the admirable laws , first laid down by mr. lyell , on the geographical distribution of animals , as influenced by geological changes .
the whole reasoning , of course , is founded on the assumption of the immutability of species ; otherwise the difference in the species in the two regions might be considered as <unk> during a length of time . )
a great number of the plants and animals were absolutely the same as , or most closely allied to , those of patagonia .
we here have the agouti , bizcacha , three species of <unk> , the ostrich , certain kinds of partridges and other birds , none of which are ever seen in chile , but are the characteristic animals of the desert plains of patagonia .
we have likewise many of the same ( to the eyes of a person who is not a botanist ) thorny stunted bushes , withered grass , and dwarf plants .
even the black slowly crawling beetles are closely similar , and some , i believe , on rigorous examination , absolutely identical .
it had always been to me a subject of regret that we were <unk> compelled to give up the ascent of the s. <name> river before reaching the mountains : i always had a latent <name> of meeting with some great change in the features of the country ; but i now feel sure that it would only have been following the plains of patagonia up a mountainous ascent .
march 24 , 1835 .
early in the morning i climbed up a mountain on one side of the valley , and enjoyed a far extended view over the pampas .
this was a spectacle to which i had always looked forward with interest , but i was disappointed : at the first glance it much resembled a distant view of the ocean , but in the northern parts many irregularities were soon distinguishable .
the most striking feature consisted in the rivers , which , facing the rising sun , glittered like silver threads , till lost in the immensity of the distance .
at mid-day we descended the valley , and reached a hovel , where an officer and three soldiers were posted to examine passports .
one of these men was a thoroughbred pampas indian : he was kept much for the same purpose as a bloodhound , to track out any person who might pass by secretly , either on foot or horseback .
some years ago a passenger endeavoured to escape detection by making a long circuit over a neighbouring mountain ; but this indian , having by chance crossed his track , followed it for the whole day over dry and very stony hills , till at last he came on his prey hidden in a gully .
we here heard that the silvery clouds , which we had admired from the bright region above , had poured down torrents of rain .
the valley from this point gradually opened , and the hills became mere water-worn hillocks compared to the giants behind ; it then expanded into a gently sloping plain of shingle , covered with low trees and bushes .
this talus , although appearing narrow , must be nearly ten miles wide before it blends into the apparently dead level pampas .
we passed the only house in this neighbourhood , the estancia of <unk> : and at sunset we pulled up in the first snug corner , and there <unk> .
march 25 , 1835 .
i was reminded of the pampas of buenos ayres , by seeing the disk of the rising sun intersected by an horizon level as that of the ocean .
during the night a heavy dew fell , a circumstance which we did not experience within the cordillera .
the road proceeded for some distance due east across a low swamp ; then meeting the dry plain , it turned to the north towards mendoza .
the distance is two very long days ' journey .
our first day 's journey was called fourteen leagues to <unk> , and the second seventeen to luxan , near mendoza .
the whole distance is over a level desert plain , with not more than two or three houses .
the sun was exceedingly powerful , and the ride devoid of all interest .
there is very little water in this " <unk> , " and in our second day 's journey we found only one little pool .
little water flows from the mountains , and it soon becomes absorbed by the dry and porous soil ; so that , although we travelled at the distance of only ten or fifteen miles from the outer range of the cordillera , we did not cross a single stream .
in many parts the ground was <unk> with a saline <unk> ; hence we had the same <unk> plants which are common near bahia <name> .
the landscape has a uniform character from the strait of magellan , along the whole eastern coast of patagonia , to the rio colorado ; and it appears that the same kind of country extends inland from this river , in a sweeping line as far as san <name> , and perhaps even farther north .
to the eastward of this curved line lies the basin of the comparatively damp and green plains of buenos ayres .
the sterile plains of mendoza and patagonia consist of a bed of shingle , worn smooth and accumulated by the waves of the sea ; while the pampas , covered by thistles , clover , and grass , have been formed by the ancient estuary mud of the plata .
after our two days ' tedious journey , it was refreshing to see in the distance the rows of <unk> and willows growing round the village and river of luxan .
shortly before we arrived at this place we observed to the south a ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour .
at first we thought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains ; but we soon found that it was a swarm of locusts .
they were flying northward ; and with the aid of a light breeze , they overtook us at a rate of ten or fifteen miles an hour .
the main body filled the air from a height of twenty feet to that , as it appeared , of two or three thousand above the ground ; " and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle : " or rather , i should say , like a strong breeze passing through the rigging of a ship .
the sky , seen through the advanced guard , appeared like a <unk> engraving , but the main body was impervious to sight ; they were not , however , so thick together , but that they could escape a stick waved backwards and forwards .
when they alighted , they were more numerous than the leaves in the field , and the surface became reddish instead of being green : the swarm having once alighted , the individuals flew from side to side in all directions .
locusts are not an uncommon pest in this country : already during this season several smaller swarms had come up from the south , where , as apparently in all other parts of the world , they are bred in the deserts .
the poor <unk> in vain attempted by lighting fires , by shouts , and by waving branches , to avert the attack .
this species of locust closely resembles , and perhaps is identical with , the famous gryllus <unk> of the east .
we crossed the luxan , which is a river of considerable size , though its course towards the sea-coast is very imperfectly known : it is even doubtful whether , in passing over the plains , it is not evaporated and lost .
we slept in the village of luxan , which is a small place surrounded by gardens , and forms the most southern cultivated district in the province of mendoza ; it is five leagues south of the capital .
at night i experienced an attack ( for it deserves no less a name ) of the <unk> , a species of <unk> , the great black bug of the pampas .
it is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects , about an inch long , crawling over one's body .
before sucking they are quite thin , but afterwards they become round and bloated with blood , and in this state are easily crushed .
one which i caught at iquique ( for they are found in chile and peru ) was very empty .
when placed on a table , and though surrounded by people , if a finger was presented , the bold insect would immediately protrude its sucker , make a charge , and if allowed , draw blood .
no pain was caused by the wound .
it was curious to watch its body during the act of sucking , as in less than ten minutes it changed from being as flat as a <unk> to a globular form .
this one feast , for which the <unk> was indebted to one of the officers , kept it fat during four whole months ; but , after the first fortnight , it was quite ready to have another suck .
march 27 , 1835 .
we rode on to mendoza .
the country was beautifully cultivated , and resembled chile .
this neighbourhood is celebrated for its fruit ; and certainly nothing could appear more flourishing than the vineyards and the orchards of figs , peaches , and olives .
we bought <unk> nearly twice as large as a man 's head , most deliciously cool and <unk> , for a <unk> apiece ; and for the value of <unk> , half a <unk> of peaches .
the cultivated and enclosed part of this province is very small ; there is little more than that which we passed through between luxan and the capital .
the land , as in chile , owes its fertility entirely to artificial irrigation ; and it is really wonderful to observe how extraordinarily productive a barren <unk> is thus rendered .
we stayed the ensuing day in mendoza .
the prosperity of the place has much declined of late years .
the inhabitants say " it is good to live in , but very bad to grow <name> in . "
the lower orders have the lounging , reckless manners of the gauchos of the pampas ; and their dress , <unk> , and habits of life , are nearly the same .
to my mind the town had a stupid , forlorn aspect .
neither the boasted <unk> , nor the scenery , is at all comparable with that of <name> ; but to those who , coming from buenos ayres , have just crossed the <unk> pampas , the gardens and orchards must appear delightful .
sir f. head , speaking of the inhabitants , says , " they eat their dinners , and it is so very hot , they go to sleep  and could they do better ? "
i quite agree with sir f. head : the happy doom of the <unk> is to eat , sleep and be idle .
march 29 , 1835 .
we set out on our return to chile by the uspallata pass situated north of mendoza .
we had to cross a long and most sterile <unk> of fifteen leagues .
the soil in parts was absolutely bare , in others covered by numberless dwarf <unk> , armed with formidable spines , and called by the inhabitants " little lions . "
there were , also , a few low bushes .
although the plain is nearly three thousand feet above the sea , the sun was very powerful ; and the heat , as well as the clouds of impalpable dust , rendered the travelling extremely irksome .
our course during the day lay nearly parallel to the cordillera , but gradually approaching them .
before sunset we entered one of the wide valleys , or rather bays , which open on the plain : this soon narrowed into a ravine , where a little higher up the house of villa <unk> is situated .
as we had ridden all day without a drop of water , both our mules and selves were very thirsty , and we looked out anxiously for the stream which flows down this valley .
it was curious to observe how gradually the water made its appearance : on the plain the course was quite dry ; by degrees it became a little damper ; then puddles of water appeared ; these soon became connected ; and at villa <unk> there was a nice little rivulet .
march 30 , 1835 .
the solitary hovel which bears the imposing name of villa <unk> has been mentioned by every traveller who has crossed the andes .
i stayed here and at some neighbouring mines during the two succeeding days .
the geology of the surrounding country is very curious .
the uspallata range is separated from the main cordillera by a long narrow plain or basin , like those so often mentioned in chile , but higher , being six thousand feet above the sea .
this range has nearly the same geographical position with respect to the cordillera , which the gigantic portillo line has , but it is of a totally different origin : it consists of various kinds of submarine lava , alternating with volcanic sandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits ; the whole having a very close resemblance to some of the tertiary beds on the shores of the pacific .
from this resemblance i expected to find silicified wood , which is generally characteristic of those formations .
i was gratified in a very extraordinary manner .
in the central part of the range , at an elevation of about seven thousand feet , i observed on a bare slope some snow-white projecting columns .
these were petrified trees , eleven being silicified , and from thirty to forty converted into <unk> white calcareous spar .
they were abruptly broken off , the upright stumps projecting a few feet above the ground .
the trunks measured from three to five feet each in circumference .
they stood a little way apart from each other , but the whole formed one group .
mr. <name> brown has been kind enough to examine the wood : he says it belongs to the fir tribe , partaking of the character of the <unk> family , but with some curious points of affinity with the yew .
the volcanic sandstone in which the trees were embedded , and from the lower part of which they must have sprung , had accumulated in successive thin layers around their trunks ; and the stone yet retained the impression of the bark .
it required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous story which this scene at once unfolded ; though i confess i was at first so much astonished that i could scarcely believe the plainest evidence .
i saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees once waved their branches on the shores of the atlantic , when that ocean ( now driven back 700 miles ) came to the foot of the andes .
i saw that they had sprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised above the level of the sea , and that subsequently this dry land , with its upright trees , had been let down into the depths of the ocean .
in these depths , the formerly dry land was covered by sedimentary beds , and these again by enormous streams of submarine lava  one such mass attaining the thickness of a thousand feet ; and these deluges of molten stone and aqueous deposits five times alternately had been spread out .
the ocean which received such thick masses must have been profoundly deep ; but again the subterranean forces exerted themselves , and i now beheld the bed of that ocean , forming a chain of mountains more than seven thousand feet in height .
nor had those antagonistic forces been dormant , which are always at work wearing down the surface of the land ; the great piles of strata had been intersected by many wide valleys , and the trees , now changed into silex , were exposed projecting from the volcanic soil , now changed into rock , whence formerly , in a green and budding state , they had raised their lofty heads .
now , all is utterly <unk> and desert ; even the lichen can not adhere to the stony casts of former trees .
vast , and scarcely comprehensible as such changes must ever appear , yet they have all occurred within a period , recent when compared with the history of the cordillera ; and the cordillera itself is absolutely modern as compared with many of the fossiliferous strata of europe and <name> .
<name> 1 , 1835 .
we crossed the uspallata range , and at night slept at the custom-house  the only inhabited spot on the plain .
shortly before leaving the mountains , there was a very extraordinary view ; red , purple , green , and quite white sedimentary rocks , alternating with black lavas , were broken up and thrown into all kinds of disorder by masses of porphyry of every shade of colour , from dark brown to the brightest lilac .
it was the first view i ever saw , which really resembled those pretty sections which geologists make of the inside of the earth .
the next day we crossed the plain , and followed the course of the same great mountain stream which flows by luxan .
here it was a furious torrent , quite impassable , and appeared larger than in the low country , as was the case with the rivulet of villa <unk> .
on the evening of the succeeding day we reached the rio de las <unk> , which is considered the worst stream in the cordillera to cross .
as all these rivers have a rapid and short course , and are formed by the melting of the snow , the hour of the day makes a considerable difference in their volume .
in the evening the stream is muddy and full , but about daybreak it becomes clearer and much less impetuous .
this we found to be the case with the rio <unk> , and in the morning we crossed it with little difficulty .
the scenery thus far was very uninteresting , compared with that of the portillo pass .
little can be seen beyond the bare walls of the one grand , flat-bottomed valley , which the road follows up to the highest crest .
the valley and the huge <name> mountains are extremely barren : during the two previous nights the poor mules had absolutely nothing to eat , for excepting a few low <unk> bushes , scarcely a plant can be seen .
in the course of this day we crossed some of the worst passes in the cordillera , but their danger has been much exaggerated .
i was told that if i attempted to pass on foot , my head would turn giddy , and that there was no room to dismount ; but i did not see a place where any one might not have walked over backwards , or got off his mule on either side .
one of the bad passes , called las <unk> ( the souls ) , i had crossed , and did not find out till a day afterwards that it was one of the awful dangers .
no doubt there are many parts in which , if the mule should stumble , the rider would be hurled down a great precipice ; but of this there is little chance .
i daresay , in the spring , the " <unk> , " or roads , which each year are formed anew across the piles of fallen detritus , are very bad ; but from what i saw , i suspect the real danger is nothing .
with <unk> the case is rather different , for the loads project so far , that the animals , occasionally running against each other , or against a point of rock , lose their balance , and are thrown down the precipices .
in crossing the rivers i can well believe that the difficulty may be very great : at this season there was little trouble , but in the summer they must be very hazardous .
i can quite imagine , as sir f. head describes , the different expressions of those who have passed the gulf , and those who are passing .
i never heard of any man being drowned , but with loaded mules it frequently happens .
the <unk> tells you to show your mule the best line , and then allow her to cross as she likes : the <unk> takes a bad line , and is often lost .
<name> 4 , 1835 .
from the rio de las <unk> to the puente <name> incas , half a day's journey .
as there was pasture for the mules , and geology for me , we <unk> here for the night .
when one hears of a natural bridge , one pictures to oneself some deep and narrow ravine , across which a bold mass of rock has fallen ; or a great arch hollowed out like the vault of a cavern .
instead of this , the incas bridge consists of a crust of stratified shingle cemented together by the deposits of the neighbouring hot springs .
it appears as if the stream had scooped out a channel on one side , leaving an overhanging ledge , which was met by earth and stones falling down from the opposite <name> .
certainly an oblique junction , as would happen in such a case , was very distinct on one side .
the bridge of the incas is by no means worthy of the great monarchs whose name it bears .
<name> 5 , 1835 .
we had a long day 's ride across the central ridge , from the incas bridge to the <unk> <name> <unk> , which are situated near the lowest <unk> on the chilian side .
these <unk> are round little towers , with steps outside to reach the floor , which is raised some feet above the ground on account of the <unk> .
they are eight in number , and under the spanish government were kept during the <name> well stored with food and charcoal , and each courier had a <unk> .
now they only answer the purpose of caves , or rather dungeons .
seated on some little eminence , they are not , however , ill suited to the surrounding scene of desolation .
the zigzag ascent of the cumbre , or the partition of the waters , was very steep and tedious ; its height , according to mr. <unk> , is <unk> feet .
the road did not pass over any perpetual snow , although there were patches of it on both hands .
the wind on the summit was exceedingly cold , but it was impossible not to stop for a few minutes to admire , again and again , the colour of the heavens , and the brilliant transparency of the atmosphere .
the scenery was grand : to the westward there was a fine chaos of mountains , divided by profound ravines .
some snow generally falls before this period of the season , and it has even happened that the cordillera have been finally closed by this time .
but we were most fortunate .
the sky , by night and by day , was cloudless , excepting a few round little masses of vapour , that floated over the highest pinnacles .
i have often seen these islets in the sky , marking the position of the cordillera , when the <unk> mountains have been hidden beneath the horizon .
<name> 6 , 1835 .
in the morning we found some thief had stolen one of our mules , and the <name> of the <unk> .
we therefore rode only two or three miles down the valley , and stayed there the ensuing day in hopes of recovering the mule , which the <unk> thought had been hidden in some ravine .
the scenery in this part had assumed a chilian character : the lower sides of the mountains , dotted over with the pale evergreen <unk> tree , and with the great <unk> cactus , are certainly more to be admired than the bare eastern valleys ; but i can not quite agree with the admiration expressed by some travellers .
the extreme pleasure , i suspect , is chiefly owing to the prospect of a good fire and of a good supper , after escaping from the cold regions above : and i am sure i most heartily participated in these feelings .
<name> 8 , 1835 .
we left the valley of the aconcagua , by which we had descended , and reached in the evening a cottage near the villa de st. <name> .
the fertility of the plain was delightful : the autumn being advanced , the leaves of many of the fruit-trees were falling ; and of the labourers ,  some were busy in drying figs and peaches on the roofs of their cottages , while others were gathering the grapes from the vineyards .
it was a pretty scene ; but i missed that pensive stillness which makes the autumn in england indeed the evening of the year .
on the 10th we reached <name> , where i received a very kind and hospitable reception from mr. <unk> .
my excursion only cost me twenty-four days , and never did i more deeply enjoy an equal space of time .
a few days afterwards i returned to mr. <unk> 's house at valparaiso .

<name> 27 , 1835 .
i set out on a journey to coquimbo , and thence through guasco to copiapó , where captain fitz <name> kindly offered to pick me up in the " beagle . "
the distance in a straight line along the shore northward is only 420 miles ; but my mode of travelling made it a very long journey .
i bought four horses and two mules , the latter carrying the luggage on alternate days .
the six animals together only cost the value of twenty-five pounds <name> , and at copiapó i sold them again for twenty-three .
we travelled in the same independent manner as before , cooking our own meals , and sleeping in the open air .
as we rode towards the <unk> <name> mar , i took a farewell view of valparaiso , and admired its picturesque appearance .
for geological purposes i made a detour from the high road to the foot of the <name> of quillota .
we passed through an alluvial district <name> in gold , to the neighbourhood of <unk> , where we slept .
washing for gold supports the inhabitants of numerous hovels , scattered along the sides of each little rivulet ; but , like all those whose gains are uncertain , they are <unk> in their habits , and consequently poor .
<name> 28 , 1835 .
in the afternoon we arrived at a cottage at the foot of the <name> mountain .
the inhabitants were <unk> , which is not very usual in chile .
they supported themselves on the produce of a garden and a little field , but were very poor .
capital is here so deficient that the people are obliged to sell their green corn while standing in the field , in order to buy necessaries for the ensuing year .
wheat in consequence was dearer in the very district of its production than at valparaiso , where the contractors live .
the next day we joined the main road to coquimbo .
at night there was a very light shower of rain : this was the first drop that had fallen since the heavy rain of <name> 11th and 12th , which detained me a prisoner at the baths of cauquenes .
the interval was seven and a half months ; but the rain this year in chile was rather later than usual .
the distant andes were now covered by a thick mass of snow , and were a glorious sight .
may 2 , 1835 .
the road continued to follow the coast at no great distance from the sea .
the few trees and bushes which are common in central chile decreased rapidly in <name> , and were replaced by a tall plant , something like a <unk> in appearance .
the surface of the country , on a small scale , was singularly broken and irregular ; abrupt little peaks of rock rising out of small plains or basins .
the indented coast and the bottom of the neighbouring sea , studded with breakers , would , if converted into dry land , present similar forms ; and such a conversion without doubt has taken place in the part over which we rode .
may 3 , 1835 .
<unk> to <unk> .
the country became more and more barren .
in the valleys there was scarcely sufficient water for any irrigation ; and the intermediate land was quite bare , not supporting even goats .
in the spring , after the <name> showers , a thin pasture rapidly springs up , and cattle are then driven down from the cordillera to graze for a short time .
it is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass and other plants seem to accommodate themselves , as if by an acquired habit , to the quantity of rain which falls upon different parts of this coast .
one shower far northward at copiapó produces as great an effect on the vegetation , as two at guasco , and three or four in this district .
at valparaiso a <name> so dry as greatly to injure the pasture , would at guasco produce the most unusual abundance .
proceeding northward , the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict proportion to the latitude .
at <unk> , which is only 67 miles north of valparaiso , rain is not expected till the end of may ; whereas at valparaiso some generally falls early in <name> : the annual quantity is likewise small in proportion to the <unk> of the season at which it commences .
may 4 , 1835 .
finding the <unk> devoid of interest of any kind , we turned inland towards the mining district and valley of <unk> .
this valley , like every other in chile , is level , broad , and very fertile : it is bordered on each side , either by cliffs of stratified shingle , or by bare <name> mountains .
above the straight line of the uppermost <unk> ditch , all is brown as on a <unk> ; while all below is of as bright a green as <unk> , from the beds of <unk> , a kind of clover .
we proceeded to los hornos , another mining district , where the principal hill was drilled with holes , like a great <unk> .
the chilian miners are a peculiar race of men in their habits .
living for weeks together in the most desolate spots , when they descend to the villages on <unk> there is no excess of extravagance into which they do not run .
they sometimes gain a considerable sum , and then , like sailors with <unk> , they try how soon they can contrive to squander it .
they drink excessively , buy quantities of clothes , and in a few days return penniless to their miserable abodes , there to work harder than beasts of burden .
this <unk> , as with sailors , is evidently the result of a similar manner of life .
their daily food is found them , and they acquire no habits of <unk> ; moreover , temptation and the means of yielding to it are placed in their power at the same time .
on the other hand , in cornwall , and some other parts of england , where the system of selling part of the vein is followed , the miners , from being obliged to act and think for themselves , are a singularly intelligent and <unk> set of men .
the dress of the chilian miner is peculiar and rather picturesque .
he wears a very long shirt of some dark-coloured <unk> , with a leathern apron ; the whole being fastened round his waist by a bright-coloured sash .
his trousers are very broad , and his small cap of <name> cloth is made to fit the head closely .
we met a party of these miners in full costume , carrying the body of one of their companions to be buried .
they marched at a very quick trot , four men supporting the corpse .
one set having run as hard as they could for about two hundred yards , were relieved by four others , who had previously dashed on ahead on horseback .
thus they proceeded , encouraging each other by wild cries : altogether the scene formed a most strange funeral .
we continued travelling northward in a zigzag line ; sometimes stopping a day to <unk> .
the country was so thinly inhabited , and the track so obscure , that we often had difficulty in finding our way .
on the 12th i stayed at some mines .
the ore in this case was not considered particularly good , but from being abundant it was supposed the mine would sell for about thirty or forty thousand dollars ( that is , <unk> or <unk> pounds <name> ) ; yet it had been bought by one of the english associations for an ounce of gold ( three pounds eight shillings ) .
the ore is yellow <unk> , which , as i have already remarked , before the arrival of the english was not supposed to contain a particle of copper .
on a scale of profits nearly as great as in the above instance , piles of cinders , abounding with minute globules of metallic copper , were purchased ; yet with these advantages , the mining associations , as is well known , contrived to lose immense sums of money .
the folly of the greater number of the commissioners and <unk> amounted to infatuation ;  a thousand pounds per annum given in some cases to entertain the chilian authorities ; libraries of <unk> geological books ; miners brought out for particular metals , as tin , which are not found in chile ; contracts to supply the miners with milk , in parts where there are no cows ; machinery , where it could not possibly be used ; and a hundred similar arrangements , bore witness to our absurdity , and to this day afford amusement to the natives .
yet there can be no doubt , that the same capital well employed in these mines would have yielded an immense return : a confidential man of business , a practical miner and <unk> , would have been all that was required .
captain head has described the wonderful load which the " <unk> , " truly beasts of burden , <name> up from the deepest mines .
i confess i thought the account exaggerated : so that i was glad to take an opportunity of weighing one of the loads , which i picked out by hazard .
it required considerable exertion on my part , when standing directly over it , to lift it from the ground .
the load was considered under weight when found to be 197 pounds .
the <unk> had carried this up eighty perpendicular yards ,  part of the way by a steep passage , but the greater part up notched poles , placed in a zigzag line up the shaft .
according to the general regulation , the <unk> is not allowed to halt for breath , except the mine is six hundred feet deep .
the average load is considered as rather more than 200 pounds , and i have been assured that one of 300 pounds ( twenty-two stone and a half ) by way of a trial has been brought up from the deepest mine !
at this time the <unk> were bringing up the usual load twelve times in the day ; that is <unk> pounds from eighty yards deep ; and they were employed in the intervals in breaking and picking ore .
these men , excepting from accidents , are healthy , and appear cheerful .
their bodies are not very muscular .
they rarely eat meat once a week , and never oftener , and then only the hard dry <unk> .
although with a knowledge that the labour was voluntary , it was nevertheless quite revolting to see the state in which they reached the mouth of the mine ; their bodies bent forward , leaning with their arms on the steps , their legs bowed , their muscles quivering , the perspiration streaming from their faces over their breasts , their nostrils distended , the corners of their mouth forcibly drawn back , and the expulsion of their breath most laborious .
each time they draw their breath they utter an articulate cry of " <unk> , " which ends in a sound rising from deep in the chest , but shrill like the note of a fife .
after staggering to the pile of ore , they emptied the " <unk> ; " in two or three seconds recovering their breath , they wiped the sweat from their brows , and apparently quite fresh descended the mine again at a quick pace .
this appears to me a wonderful instance of the amount of labour which habit , for it can be nothing else , <name> enable a man to endure .
in the evening , talking with the <unk> of these mines about the number of foreigners now scattered over the whole country , he told me that , though quite a young man , he remembers when he was a boy at school at coquimbo , a holiday being given to see the captain of an english ship , who was brought to the city to speak to the governor .
he believes that nothing would have induced any boy in the school , himself included , to have gone close to the englishman ; so deeply had they been impressed with an idea of the heresy , <unk> , and evil to be derived from contact with such a person .
to this day they relate the atrocious actions of the <unk> ; and especially of one man , who took away the figure of the virgin <name> , and returned the year after for that of st. <name> , saying it was a pity the <name> should not have a husband .
i heard also of an old <name> who , at a dinner at coquimbo , remarked how wonderfully strange it was that she should have lived to dine in the same room with an englishman ; for she remembered as a girl , that twice , at the mere cry of " los <unk> , " every soul , carrying what valuables they could , had taken to the mountains .
may 14 , 1835 .
we reached coquimbo , where we stayed a few days .
the town is remarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness .
it is said to contain from <unk> to <unk> inhabitants .
on the morning of the 17th it rained lightly , the first time this year , for about five hours .
the farmers , who plant corn near the sea-coast where the atmosphere is more humid , taking advantage of this shower , would break up the ground ; after a second they would put the seed in ; and if a third shower should fall , they would reap a good harvest in the spring .
it was interesting to watch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture .
twelve hours afterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever ; yet after an interval of ten days all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches ; the grass being sparingly scattered in <unk> fibres a full inch in length .
before this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a <unk> .
( plate 77 .
coquimbo , chile . )
in the evening , captain fitz <name> and myself were dining with mr. edwards , an english resident well known for his hospitality by all who have visited coquimbo , when a sharp earthquake happened .
i heard the <unk> rumble , but from the screams of the ladies , the running of the servants , and the rush of several of the gentlemen to the doorway , i could not distinguish the motion .
some of the women afterwards were crying with terror , and one gentleman said he should not be able to sleep all night , or if he did , it would only be to dream of falling houses .
the father of this person had lately lost all his property at <unk> , and he himself had only just escaped a falling roof at valparaiso in 1822 .
he mentioned a curious coincidence which then happened : he was playing at cards , when a <name> , one of the party , got up , and said he would never sit in a room in these countries with the door shut , as , owing to his having done so , he had nearly lost his life at copiapó .
accordingly he opened the door ; and no sooner had he done this , than he cried out , " here it comes again ! "
and the famous shock commenced .
the whole party escaped .
the danger in an earthquake is not from the time lost in opening the door , but from the chance of its becoming jammed by the movement of the walls .
it is impossible to be much surprised at the fear which natives and old residents , though some of them known to be men of great command of mind , so generally experience during earthquakes .
i think , however , this excess of panic may be partly attributed to a want of habit in governing their fear , as it is not a feeling they are ashamed of .
indeed , the natives do not like to see a person indifferent .
i heard of two englishmen who , sleeping in the open air during a smart shock , knowing that there was no danger , did not rise .
the natives cried out indignantly , " look at those <unk> , they do not even get out of their beds ! "
i spent some days in examining the step-formed terraces of shingle , first noticed by captain b .
hall , and believed by mr. lyell to have been formed by the sea during the gradual rising of the land .
this certainly is the true explanation , for i found numerous shells of existing species on these terraces .
five narrow , gently sloping , <unk> terraces rise one behind the other , and where best developed are formed of shingle : they front the bay , and sweep up both sides of the valley .
at guasco , north of coquimbo , the phenomenon is displayed on a much grander scale , so as to strike with surprise even some of the inhabitants .
the terraces are there much broader , and may be called plains , in some parts there are six of them , but generally only five ; they run up the valley for thirty-seven miles from the coast .
these step-formed terraces or fringes closely resemble those in the valley of s. <name> , and , except in being on a smaller scale , those great ones along the whole <unk> of patagonia .
they have undoubtedly been formed by the <unk> power of the sea , during long periods of rest in the gradual elevation of the continent .
shells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the terraces at coquimbo ( to a height of 250 feet ) , but are embedded in a friable calcareous rock , which in some places is as much as between twenty and thirty feet in thickness , but is of little extent .
these modern beds rest on an ancient tertiary formation containing shells , apparently all extinct .
although i examined so many hundred miles of coast on the pacific , as well as atlantic side of the continent , i found no regular strata containing sea-shells of recent species , excepting at this place , and at a few points northward on the road to guasco .
this fact appears to me highly remarkable ; for the explanation generally given by geologists , of the absence in any district of stratified fossiliferous deposits of a given period , namely , that the surface then existed as dry land , is not here applicable ; for we know from the shells strewed on the surface and embedded in loose sand or mould , that the land for thousands of miles along both coasts has lately been submerged .
the explanation , no doubt , must be sought in the fact , that the whole southern part of the continent has been for a long time slowly rising ; and therefore that all matter deposited along shore in shallow water must have been soon brought up and slowly exposed to the wearing action of the sea-beach ; and it is only in comparatively shallow water that the greater number of <name> organic beings can flourish , and in such water it is obviously impossible that strata of any great thickness can accumulate .
to show the vast power of the wearing action of <unk> , we need only appeal to the great cliffs along the present coast of patagonia , and to the escarpments or ancient <unk> at different levels , one above another , on that same line of coast .
the old underlying tertiary formation at coquimbo appears to be of about the same age with several deposits on the coast of chile ( of which that of <unk> is the principal one ) , and with the great formation of patagonia .
both at <unk> and in patagonia there is evidence , that since the shells ( a list of which has been seen by professor e. forbes ) there <unk> were living , there has been a subsidence of several hundred feet , as well as an ensuing elevation .
it may naturally be asked how it comes that although no extensive fossiliferous deposits of the recent period , nor of any period intermediate between it and the ancient tertiary epoch , have been preserved on either side of the continent , yet that at this ancient tertiary epoch , sedimentary matter containing fossil remains should have been deposited and preserved at different points in north and south lines , over a space of <unk> miles on the shores of the pacific , and of at least <unk> miles on the shores of the atlantic , and in an east and west line of 700 miles across the widest part of the continent ?
i believe the explanation is not difficult , and that it is perhaps applicable to nearly analogous facts observed in other quarters of the world .
considering the enormous power of denudation which the sea possesses , as shown by numberless facts , it is not probable that a sedimentary deposit , when being upraised , could pass through the ordeal of the beach , so as to be preserved in sufficient masses to last to a distant period , without it were originally of wide extent and of considerable thickness : now it is impossible on a moderately shallow bottom , which alone is favourable to most living creatures , that a thick and widely extended covering of sediment could be spread out , without the bottom sank down to receive the successive layers .
this seems to have actually taken place at about the same period in southern patagonia and chile , though these places are a thousand miles apart .
hence , if prolonged movements of approximately contemporaneous subsidence are generally widely extensive , as i am strongly inclined to believe from my examination of the <name> reefs of the great oceans  or if , confining our view to south <name> , the subsiding movements have been <unk> with those of elevation , by which , within the same period of existing shells , the shores of peru , chile , <name> <name> fuego , patagonia , and la plata have been upraised  then we can see that at the same time , at far distant points , circumstances would have been favourable to the formation of fossiliferous deposits , of wide extent and of considerable thickness ; and such deposits , consequently , would have a good chance of resisting the wear and tear of successive <unk> , and of lasting to a future epoch .

i set out in company with <name> josé edwards to the <unk> of arqueros , and thence up the valley of coquimbo .
passing through a mountainous country , we reached by nightfall the mines belonging to mr. edwards .
i enjoyed my night 's rest here from a reason which <name> not be fully appreciated in england , namely , the absence of fleas !
the rooms in coquimbo swarm with them ; but they <name> not live here at the height of only three or four thousand feet : it can scarcely be the trifling diminution of temperature , but some other cause which destroys these troublesome insects at this place .
the mines are now in a bad state , though they formerly yielded about 2000 pounds in weight of silver a year .
it has been said that " a person with a <unk> <name> gain ; with silver he may gain ; but with gold he is sure to lose . "
this is not true : all the large chilian fortunes have been made by mines of the more precious metals .
a short time since an english physician returned to england from copiapó , taking with him the profits of one share in a <unk> , which amounted to about <unk> pounds <name> .
no doubt a <unk> with care is a sure game , whereas the other is gambling , or rather taking a ticket in a lottery .
the owners lose great quantities of <name> ores ; for no precautions can prevent robberies .
i heard of a gentleman laying a bet with another , that one of his men should <name> him before his face .
the ore when brought out of the mine is broken into pieces , and the useless stone thrown on one side .
a couple of the miners who were thus employed , pitched , as if by accident , two fragments away at the same moment , and then cried out for a joke " let us see which rolls furthest . "
the owner , who was standing by , bet a cigar with his friend on the race .
the miner by this means watched the very point amongst the rubbish where the stone lay .
in the evening he picked it up and carried it to his master , showing him a <name> mass of <unk> , and saying , " this was the stone on which you won a cigar by its rolling so far . "
may 23 , 1835 .
we descended into the fertile valley of coquimbo , and followed it till we reached an <unk> belonging to a relation of <name> josé , where we stayed the next day .
i then rode one day 's journey farther , to see what were declared to be some petrified shells and beans , which latter turned out to be small quartz pebbles .
we passed through several small villages ; and the valley was beautifully cultivated , and the whole scenery very grand .
we were here near the main cordillera , and the surrounding hills were lofty .
in all parts of northern chile fruit trees produce much more abundantly at a considerable height near the andes than in the lower country .
the figs and grapes of this district are famous for their excellence , and are cultivated to a great extent .
this valley is , perhaps , the most productive one north of quillota .
i believe it contains , including coquimbo , 25,000 inhabitants .
the next day i returned to the <unk> , and thence , together with <name> josé , to coquimbo .
<name> 2 , 1835 .
we set out for the valley of guasco , following the <unk> , which was considered rather less desert than the other .
our first day 's ride was to a solitary house , called <unk> <name> , where there was pasture for our horses .
the shower mentioned as having fallen a fortnight ago , only reached about half-way to guasco ; we had , therefore , in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge of green , which soon faded quite away .
even where brightest , it was scarcely sufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers of the spring of other countries .
while travelling through these deserts one feels like a prisoner shut up in a gloomy court , who <unk> to see something green and to smell a moist atmosphere .
<name> 3 , 1835 .
<unk> <name> to <unk> .
during the first part of the day we crossed a mountainous <name> desert , and afterwards a long deep <name> plain , strewed with broken sea-shells .
there was very little water , and that little saline : the whole country , from the coast to the cordillera , is an uninhabited desert .
i saw traces only of one living animal in abundance , namely , the shells of a <unk> , which were collected together in extraordinary <name> on the driest spots .
in the spring one humble little plant sends out a few leaves , and on these the <unk> feed .
as they are seen only very early in the morning , when the ground is slightly damp with dew , the <unk> believe that they are bred from it .
i have observed in other places that extremely dry and sterile districts , where the soil is calcareous , are extraordinarily favourable to land-shells .
at <unk> there were a few cottages , some brackish water , and a trace of cultivation : but it was with difficulty that we purchased a little corn and straw for our horses .
<name> 4 , 1835 .
<unk> to sauce .
we continued to ride over desert plains , tenanted by large herds of guanaco .
we crossed also the valley of <unk> ; which , although the most fertile one between guasco and coquimbo , is very narrow , and produces so little pasture that we could not purchase any for our horses .
at sauce we found a very civil old gentleman , superintending a <unk> furnace .
as an especial favour , he allowed me to purchase at a high price an armful of dirty straw , which was all the poor horses had for supper after their long day 's journey .
few <unk> are now at work in any part of chile ; it is found more profitable , on account of the extreme scarcity of firewood , and from the chilian method of reduction being so <unk> , to ship the ore for <unk> .
the next day we crossed some mountains to <unk> , in the valley of guasco .
during each day 's ride farther northward , the vegetation became more and more scanty ; even the great <unk> cactus was here replaced by a different and much smaller species .
during the <name> months , both in northern chile and in peru , a uniform bank of clouds hangs , at no great height , over the pacific .
from the mountains we had a very striking view of this white and brilliant <unk> , which sent arms up the valleys , leaving islands and promontories in the same manner as the sea does in the chonos archipelago and in <name> <name> fuego .
we stayed two days at <unk> .
in the valley of guasco there are four small towns .
at the mouth there is the port , a spot entirely desert , and without any water in the immediate neighbourhood .
five leagues higher up stands <unk> , a long straggling village , with decent whitewashed houses .
again , ten leagues further up <unk> is situated , and above this guasco <unk> , a horticultural village , famous for its dried fruit .
on a clear day the view up the valley is very fine ; the straight opening terminates in the <unk> snowy cordillera ; on each side an infinity of crossing lines are blended together in a beautiful haze .
the foreground is singular from the number of parallel and step-formed terraces ; and the included strip of green valley , with its <unk> , is contrasted on both hands with the naked hills .
that the surrounding country was most barren <name> be readily believed , when it is known that a shower of rain had not fallen during the last thirteen months .
the inhabitants heard with the greatest envy of the rain at coquimbo ; from the appearance of the sky they had hopes of equally good fortune , which , a fortnight afterwards , were realised .
i was at copiapó at the time ; and there the people , with equal envy , talked of the abundant rain at guasco .
after two or three very dry years , perhaps with not more than one shower during the whole time , a rainy year generally follows ; and this does more harm than even the drought .
the rivers swell , and cover with gravel and sand the narrow strips of ground which alone are fit for cultivation .
the floods also injure the <unk> ditches .
great devastation had thus been caused three years ago .
<name> 8 , 1835 .
we rode on to <unk> , which takes its name from <unk> in ireland , the birthplace of the family of <unk> , who , under the spanish government , were presidents and generals in chile .
as the <name> mountains on each hand were concealed by clouds , the <unk> plains gave to the valley an appearance like that of <name> <name> in patagonia .
after spending one day at <unk> i set out , on the 10th , for the upper part of the valley of copiapó .
we rode all day over an uninteresting country .
i am tired of repeating the epithets barren and sterile .
these words , however , as commonly used , are comparative ; i have always applied them to the plains of patagonia , which can boast of <unk> bushes and some tufts of grass ; and this is absolute fertility , as compared with northern chile .
here again , there are not many spaces of two hundred yards square , where some little bush , cactus or lichen , may not be discovered by careful examination ; and in the soil seeds lie dormant ready to spring up during the first rainy <name> .
in peru real deserts occur over wide tracts of country .
in the evening we arrived at a valley in which the bed of the <unk> was damp : following it up , we came to tolerably good water .
during the night the stream , from not being evaporated and absorbed so quickly , flows a league lower down than during the day .
sticks were plentiful for firewood , so that it was a good place of bivouac for us ; but for the poor animals there was not a mouthful to eat .
<name> 11 , 1835 .
we rode without stopping for twelve hours till we reached an old <unk> , where there was water and firewood ; but our horses again had nothing to eat , being shut up in an old courtyard .
the line of road was hilly , and the distant views interesting from the varied colours of the bare mountains .
it was almost a pity to see the sun shining constantly over so useless a country ; such splendid weather ought to have brightened fields and pretty gardens .
the next day we reached the valley of copiapó .
i was heartily glad of it ; for the whole journey was a continued source of anxiety ; it was most disagreeable to hear , whilst eating our own suppers , our horses gnawing the posts to which they were tied , and to have no means of relieving their hunger .
to all appearance , however , the animals were quite fresh ; and no one could have told that they had eaten nothing for the last fifty-five hours .
i had a letter of introduction to mr. <unk> , who received me very kindly at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this estate is between twenty and thirty miles long , but very narrow , being generally only two fields wide , one on each side the river .
in some parts the estate is of no width , that is to say , the land can not be irrigated , and therefore is valueless , like the surrounding <name> desert .
the small quantity of cultivated land in the whole line of valley does not so much depend on inequalities of level , and consequent <unk> for irrigation , as on the small supply of water .
the river this year was remarkably full : here , high up the valley , it reached to the horse 's belly , and was about fifteen yards wide , and rapid ; lower down it becomes smaller and smaller , and is generally quite lost , as happened during one period of thirty years , so that not a drop entered the sea .
the inhabitants watch a storm over the cordillera with great interest ; as one good fall of snow provides them with water for the ensuing year .
this is of infinitely more consequence than rain in the lower country .
rain , as often as it falls , which is about once in every two or three years , is a great advantage , because the cattle and mules can for some time afterwards find a little pasture in the mountains .
but without snow on the andes , desolation extends throughout the valley .
it is on record that three times nearly all the inhabitants have been obliged to emigrate to the south .
this year there was plenty of water , and every man irrigated his ground as much as he chose ; but it has frequently been necessary to post soldiers at the <unk> , to see that each estate took only its proper allowance during so many hours in the week .
the valley is said to contain 12,000 souls , but its produce is sufficient only for three months in the year ; the rest of the supply being drawn from valparaiso and the south .
before the discovery of the famous <unk> of <unk> , copiapó was in a rapid state of decay ; but now it is in a very thriving condition ; and the town , which was completely overthrown by an earthquake , has been rebuilt .
the valley of copiapó , forming a mere ribbon of green in a desert , runs in a very southerly direction ; so that it is of considerable length to its source in the cordillera .
the valleys of guasco and copiapó may both be considered as long narrow islands , separated from the rest of chile by deserts of rock instead of by salt water .
northward of these , there is one other very miserable valley , called <unk> , which contains about two hundred souls ; and then there extends the real desert of <unk>  a barrier far worse than the most turbulent ocean .
after staying a few days at <unk> <unk> , i proceeded up the valley to the house of <name> <name> <name> , to whom i had a letter of introduction .
i found him most hospitable ; indeed it is impossible to bear too strong testimony to the kindness with which travellers are received in almost every part of south <name> .
the next day i hired some mules to take me by the ravine of <unk> into the central cordillera .
on the second night the weather seemed to foretell a storm of snow or rain , and whilst lying in our beds we felt a trifling shock of an earthquake .
the connexion between earthquakes and the weather has been often disputed : it appears to me to be a point of great interest , which is little understood .
humboldt has remarked in one part of the " personal narrative , " that it would be difficult for any person who had long resided in new <unk> , or in lower peru , to deny that there exists some connection between these phenomena : in another part , however , he seems to think the connexion fanciful .
( <unk> .

for those on <unk> by mr. hamilton see " transactions of british association " 1840 .
for those on <unk> see mr. <unk> in " philosophical transactions " 1835 .
in the former edition i collected several references on the coincidences between sudden falls in the barometer and earthquakes ; and between earthquakes and <unk> . )
at <unk> it is said that a heavy shower in the dry season is invariably followed by an earthquake .
in northern chile , from the extreme <unk> of rain , or even of weather <unk> rain , the probability of accidental coincidences becomes very small ; yet the inhabitants are here most firmly convinced of some connexion between the state of the atmosphere and of the trembling of the ground : i was much struck by this when mentioning to some people at copiapó that there had been a sharp shock at coquimbo : they immediately cried out , " how fortunate !
there <name> be plenty of pasture there this year . "
to their minds an earthquake foretold rain as surely as rain foretold abundant pasture .
certainly it did so happen that on the very day of the earthquake that shower of rain fell which i have described as in ten days ' time producing a thin sprinkling of grass .
at other times rain has followed earthquakes at a period of the year when it is a far greater prodigy than the earthquake itself : this happened after the shock of november 1822 , and again in 1829 at valparaiso ; also after that of <name> 1833 , at <unk> .
a person must be somewhat habituated to the climate of these countries to perceive the extreme improbability of rain falling at such seasons , except as a consequence of some law quite unconnected with the ordinary course of the weather .
in the cases of great volcanic eruptions , as that of <unk> , where torrents of rain fell at a time of the year most unusual for it , and " almost unprecedented in central <name> , " it is not difficult to understand that the volumes of vapour and clouds of ashes might have disturbed the atmospheric equilibrium .
humboldt extends this view to the case of earthquakes <unk> by eruptions ; but i can hardly conceive it possible that the small quantity of <unk> fluids which then escape from the fissured ground can produce such remarkable effects .
there appears much probability in the view first proposed by mr. p. scrope , that when the barometer is low , and when rain might naturally be expected to fall , the diminished pressure of the atmosphere over a wide extent of country might well determine the precise day on which the earth , already stretched to the utmost by the subterranean forces , should yield , crack , and consequently tremble .
it is , however , doubtful how far this idea <name> explain the circumstance of torrents of rain falling in the dry season during several days , after an earthquake <unk> by an eruption ; such cases seem to <unk> some more intimate connexion between the atmospheric and subterranean regions .
finding little of interest in this part of the ravine , we retraced our steps to the house of <name> <name> , where i stayed two days collecting fossil shells and wood .
great prostrate silicified trunks of trees , embedded in a conglomerate , were extraordinarily numerous .
i measured one which was fifteen feet in circumference : how surprising it is that every atom of the woody matter in this great cylinder should have been removed and replaced by silex so perfectly that each vessel and pore is preserved !
these trees flourished at about the period of our lower chalk ; they all belonged to the <unk> .
it was amusing to hear the inhabitants discussing the nature of the fossil shells which i collected , almost in the same terms as were used a century ago in europe ,  namely , whether or not they had been thus " born by nature . "
my geological examination of the country generally created a good deal of surprise amongst the <unk> : it was long before they could be convinced that i was not hunting for mines .
this was sometimes troublesome : i found the most ready way of explaining my employment was to ask them how it was that they themselves were not curious concerning earthquakes and <unk> ?  why some springs were hot and others cold ?  why there were mountains in chile , and not a hill in la plata ?
these bare questions at once satisfied and silenced the greater number ; some , however ( like a few in england who are a century <unk> ) , thought that all such inquiries were useless and impious ; and that it was quite sufficient that god had thus made the mountains .
an order had recently been issued that all stray dogs should be killed , and we saw many lying dead on the road .
a great number had lately gone mad , and several men had been bitten and had died in consequence .
on several occasions hydrophobia has prevailed in this valley .
it is remarkable thus to find so strange and dreadful a disease appearing time after time in the same isolated spot .
it has been remarked that certain villages in england are in like manner much more subject to this visitation than others .
dr. <unk> states that hydrophobia was first known in south <name> in <unk> : this statement is corroborated by azara and <unk> having never heard of it in their time .
dr. <unk> says that it broke out in central <name> , and slowly travelled southward .
it reached <unk> in 1807 ; and it is said that some men there , who had not been bitten , were affected , as were some negroes , who had eaten a bullock which had died of hydrophobia .
at <unk> forty-two people thus miserably perished .
the disease came on between twelve and ninety days after the bite ; and in those cases where it did come on , death ensued invariably within five days .
after 1808 a long interval ensued without any cases .
on inquiry , i did not hear of hydrophobia in van diemen 's land , or in australia ; and burchell says that during the five years he was at the cape of good <name> , he never heard of an instance of it .
webster asserts that at the azores hydrophobia has never occurred ; and the same assertion has been made with respect to mauritius and st. <name> .

in so strange a disease some information might possibly be gained by considering the circumstances under which it originates in distant climates ; for it is improbable that a dog already bitten should have been brought to these distant countries .
at night a stranger arrived at the house of <name> <name> and asked permission to sleep there .
he said he had been wandering about the mountains for seventeen days , having lost his way .
he started from guasco , and being accustomed to travelling in the cordillera , did not expect any difficulty in following the track to copiapó ; but he soon became involved in a labyrinth of mountains whence he could not escape .
some of his mules had fallen over precipices and he had been in great distress .
his chief difficulty arose from not knowing where to find water in the lower country , so that he was obliged to keep bordering the central ranges .
we returned down the valley , and on the <unk> reached the town of copiapó .
the lower part of the valley is broad , forming a fine plain like that of quillota .
the town covers a considerable space of ground , each house possessing a garden : but it is an uncomfortable place , and the dwellings are poorly furnished .
every one seems bent on the one object of making money , and then <unk> as quickly as possible .
all the inhabitants are more or less directly concerned with mines ; and mines and ores are the sole subjects of conversation .
necessaries of all sorts are extremely dear ; as the distance from the town to the port is eighteen leagues , and the land carriage very expensive .
a fowl costs five or six shillings ; meat is nearly as dear as in england ; firewood , or rather sticks , are brought on donkeys from a distance of two and three days ' journey within the cordillera ; and pasturage for animals is a shilling a day : all this for south <name> is wonderfully exorbitant .
<name> 26 , 1835 .
i hired a guide and eight mules to take me into the cordillera by a different line from my last excursion .
as the country was utterly desert , we took a cargo and a half of barley mixed with chopped straw .
about two leagues above the town a broad valley called the " despoblado , " or uninhabited , branches off from that one by which we had arrived .
although a valley of the grandest dimensions , and leading to a pass across the cordillera , yet it is completely dry , excepting perhaps for a few days during some very rainy <name> .
the sides of the crumbling mountains were furrowed by scarcely any ravines ; and the bottom of the main valley , filled with shingle , was smooth and nearly level .
no considerable torrent could ever have flowed down this bed of shingle ; for if it had , a great <unk> channel , as in all the southern valleys , would assuredly have been formed .
i feel little doubt that this valley , as well as those mentioned by travellers in peru , were left in the state we now see them by the waves of the sea , as the land slowly rose .
i observed in one place where the despoblado was joined by a ravine ( which in almost any other chain would have been called a grand valley ) , that its bed , though composed merely of sand and gravel , was higher than that of its tributary .
a mere rivulet of water , in the course of an hour , would have cut a channel for itself ; but it was evident that ages had passed away , and no such rivulet had drained this great tributary .
it was curious to behold the machinery , if such a term may be used , for the drainage , all , with the last trifling exception , perfect , yet without any signs of action .
every one must have remarked how mud-banks , left by the retiring tide , imitate in miniature a country with hill and <name> ; and here we have the original model in rock , formed as the continent rose during the secular retirement of the ocean , instead of during the ebbing and flowing of the tides .
if a shower of rain falls on the <unk> , when left dry , it <unk> the <unk> shallow lines of excavation ; and so it is with the rain of successive centuries on the bank of rock and soil , which we call a continent .
we rode on after it was dark , till we reached a side ravine with a small well , called " <unk> <unk> . "
the water deserved its name , for besides being saline it was most <unk> putrid and bitter ; so that we could not force ourselves to drink either tea or <unk> .
i suppose the distance from the river of copiapó to this spot was at least twenty-five or thirty english miles ; in the whole space there was not a single drop of water , the country deserving the name of desert in the strictest sense .
yet about half-way we passed some old indian ruins near punta gorda : i noticed also in front of some of the valleys which branch off from the despoblado , two piles of stones placed a little way apart , and directed so as to point up the mouths of these small valleys .
my companions knew nothing about them , and only answered my queries by their imperturbable " <unk> <unk> ? "
i observed indian ruins in several parts of the cordillera : the most perfect which i saw were the <unk> de <unk> in the uspallata pass .
small square rooms were there huddled together in separate groups : some of the doorways were yet standing ; they were formed by a cross slab of stone only about three feet high .
<unk> has remarked on the lowness of the doors in the ancient peruvian dwellings .
these houses , when perfect , must have been capable of containing a considerable number of persons .
tradition says that they were used as <unk> for the incas , when they crossed the mountains .
traces of indian habitations have been discovered in many other parts , where it does not appear probable that they were used as mere <unk> , but yet where the land is as utterly unfit for any kind of cultivation as it is near the <unk> or at the incas bridge , or in the portillo pass , at all which places i saw ruins .
in the ravine of <unk> , near aconcagua , where there is no pass , i heard of remains of houses situated at a great height , where it is extremely cold and sterile .
at first i imagined that these buildings had been places of refuge , built by the indians on the first arrival of the spaniards ; but i have since been inclined to speculate on the probability of a small change of climate .
in this northern part of chile , within the cordillera , old indian houses are said to be especially numerous : by digging amongst the ruins , bits of woollen articles , instruments of precious metals , and heads of indian corn , are not unfrequently discovered : an <unk> made of agate , and of precisely the same form with those now used in <name> <name> fuego , was given me .
i am aware that the peruvian indians now frequently inhabit most lofty and bleak situations ; but at copiapó i was assured by men who had spent their lives in travelling through the andes , that there were very many ( <unk> ) buildings at heights so great as almost to border on the perpetual snow , and in parts where there exist no passes , and where the land produces absolutely nothing , and what is still more extraordinary , where there is no water .
nevertheless it is the opinion of the people of the country ( although they are much puzzled by the circumstance ) , that , from the appearance of the houses , the indians must have used them as places of residence .
in this valley , at punta gorda , the remains consisted of seven or eight square little rooms , which were of a similar form with those at <unk> , but built chiefly of mud , which the present inhabitants can not , either here or , according to <unk> , in peru , imitate in <unk> .
they were situated in the most conspicuous and defenceless position , at the bottom of the flat broad valley .
there was no water nearer than three or four leagues , and that only in very small quantity , and bad : the soil was absolutely sterile ; i looked in vain even for a lichen adhering to the rocks .
at the present day , with the advantage of beasts of burden , a mine , unless it were very <name> , could scarcely be worked here with profit .
yet the indians formerly chose it as a place of residence !
if at the present time two or three showers of rain were to fall annually , instead of one , as now is the case , during as many years , a small rill of water would probably be formed in this great valley ; and then , by irrigation ( which was formerly so well understood by the indians ) , the soil would easily be rendered sufficiently productive to support a few families .
i have convincing proofs that this part of the continent of south <name> has been elevated near the coast at least from 400 to 500 , and in some parts from 1000 to <unk> feet , since the epoch of existing shells ; and farther inland the rise possibly may have been greater .
as the peculiarly arid character of the climate is evidently a consequence of the height of the cordillera , we may feel almost sure that before the later elevations , the atmosphere could not have been so completely drained of its moisture as it now is ; and as the rise has been gradual , so would have been the change in climate .
on this notion of a change of climate since the buildings were inhabited , the ruins must be of extreme antiquity , but i do not think their preservation under the chilian climate any great difficulty .
we must also admit on this notion ( and this perhaps is a greater difficulty ) that man has inhabited south <name> for an immensely long period , inasmuch as any change of climate effected by the elevation of the land must have been extremely gradual .
at valparaiso , within the last 220 years , the rise has been somewhat less than 19 feet : at lima a sea-beach has certainly been upheaved from 80 to 90 feet , within the <unk> period : but such small elevations could have had little power in <unk> the <unk> atmospheric currents .
dr. lund , however , found human skeletons in the caves of brazil , the appearance of which induced him to believe that the indian race has existed during a vast lapse of time in south <name> .
when at lima , i conversed on these subjects with mr. gill , a civil engineer , who had seen much of the interior country .
( <unk> .
<name> , in his travels through upper peru , or <unk> , in going from <unk> to <unk> , says " i saw many indian villages or dwellings in ruins , up even to the very tops of the mountains , <unk> a former population where now all is desolate . "
he makes similar remarks in another place ; but i can not tell whether this desolation has been caused by a want of population , or by an altered condition of the land . )
he told me that a conjecture of a change of climate had sometimes crossed his mind ; but that he thought that the greater portion of land , now incapable of cultivation , but covered with indian ruins , had been reduced to this state by the <unk> , which the indians formerly constructed on so wonderful a scale , having been injured by neglect and by subterranean movements .
i may here mention that the <unk> actually carried their <unk> streams in tunnels through hills of solid rock .
mr. gill told me he had been employed <unk> to examine one : he found the passage low , narrow , crooked , and not of uniform breadth , but of very considerable length .
is it not most wonderful that men should have attempted such operations , without the use of iron or gunpowder ?
mr. gill also mentioned to me a most interesting , and , as far as i am aware , quite unparalleled case , of a subterranean disturbance having changed the drainage of a country .
travelling from <unk> to <unk> ( not very far distant from lima ) , he found a plain covered with ruins and marks of ancient cultivation but now quite barren .
near it was the dry course of a considerable river , whence the water for irrigation had formerly been conducted .
there was nothing in the appearance of the watercourse to indicate that the river had not flowed there a few years previously ; in some parts , beds of sand and gravel were spread out ; in others , the solid rock had been worn into a broad channel , which in one spot was about 40 yards in breadth and 8 feet deep .
it is self-evident that a person following up the course of a stream <name> always ascend at a greater or less inclination : mr. gill , therefore , was much astonished , when walking up the bed of this ancient river , to find himself suddenly going down hill .
he imagined that the downward slope had a fall of about 40 or 50 feet perpendicular .
we here have unequivocal evidence that a ridge had been uplifted right across the old bed of a stream .
from the moment the <unk> was thus arched , the water must necessarily have been thrown back , and a new channel formed .
from that moment , also , the neighbouring plain must have lost its fertilising stream , and become a desert .

we set out early in the morning , and by mid-day reached the ravine of <unk> , where there is a <name> rill of water , with a little vegetation , and even a few <unk> trees , a kind of <unk> .
from having firewood , a <unk> had formerly been built here : we found a solitary man in charge of it , whose sole employment was hunting guanacos .
at night it froze sharply ; but having plenty of wood for our fire , we kept ourselves warm .
<name> 28 , 1835 .
we continued gradually ascending , and the valley now changed into a ravine .
during the day we saw several guanacos , and the track of the closely-allied species , the <unk> : this latter animal is <unk> alpine in its habits ; it seldom descends much below the limit of perpetual snow , and therefore haunts even a more lofty and sterile situation than the guanaco .
the only other animal which we saw in any number was a small fox : i suppose this animal preys on the mice and other small rodents which , as long as there is the least vegetation , subsist in considerable <name> in very desert places .
in patagonia , even on the borders of the salinas , where a drop of fresh water can never be found , excepting dew , these little animals swarm .
next to lizards , mice appear to be able to support existence on the smallest and driest portions of the earth  even on islets in the midst of great oceans .
the scene on all sides showed desolation , brightened and made palpable by a clear , <unk> sky .
for a time such scenery is sublime , but this feeling can not last , and then it becomes uninteresting .
we <unk> at the foot of the " <unk> <unk> , " or the first line of the partition of the waters .
the streams , however , on the east side do not flow to the atlantic , but into an elevated district , in the middle of which there is a large <name> , or salt lake ;  thus forming a little caspian sea at the height , perhaps , of ten thousand feet .
where we slept , there were some considerable patches of snow , but they do not remain throughout the year .
the winds in these lofty regions obey very regular laws ; every day a fresh breeze blows up the valley , and at night , an hour or two after sunset , the air from the cold regions above descends as through a funnel .
this night it blew a <name> of wind , and the temperature must have been considerably below the <unk> , for water in a vessel soon became a block of ice .
no clothes seemed to oppose any obstacle to the air ; i suffered very much from the cold , so that i could not sleep , and in the morning rose with my body quite dull and benumbed .
in the cordillera farther southward people lose their lives from <unk> ; here , it sometimes happens from another cause .
my guide , when a boy of fourteen years old , was passing the cordillera with a party in the month of may ; and while in the central parts , a furious <name> of wind arose , so that the men could hardly cling on their mules , and stones were flying along the ground .
the day was cloudless , and not a speck of snow fell , but the temperature was low .
it is probable that the thermometer would not have stood very many degrees below the <unk> , but the effect on their bodies , ill protected by clothing , must have been in proportion to the rapidity of the current of cold air .
the <name> lasted for more than a day ; the men began to lose their strength , and the mules would not move onwards .
my guide 's brother tried to return , but he perished , and his body was found two years afterwards , lying by the side of his mule near the road , with the bridle still in his hand .
two other men in the party lost their fingers and toes ; and out of two hundred mules and thirty cows , only fourteen mules escaped alive .
many years ago the whole of a large party are supposed to have perished from a similar cause , but their bodies to this day have never been discovered .
the union of a cloudless sky , low temperature , and a furious <name> of wind , must be , i should think , in all parts of the world an unusual occurrence .
<name> 29 , 1835 .
we gladly travelled down the valley to our former night 's lodging , and thence to near the <unk> <unk> .
on july 1st we reached the valley of copiapó .
the smell of the fresh clover was quite delightful , after the <unk> air of the dry sterile despoblado .
whilst staying in the town i heard an account from several of the inhabitants , of a hill in the neighbourhood which they called " el <unk> , "  the <unk> or <unk> .
i did not at the time pay sufficient attention to the account ; but , as far as i understood , the hill was covered by sand , and the noise was produced only when people , by ascending it , put the sand in motion .
the same circumstances are described in detail on the authority of <unk> and ehrenberg , as the cause of the sounds which have been heard by many travellers on mount <unk> near the red sea .
( <unk> .

also <unk> on volcanoes <name> 438 and " bengal journal " volume 7 <name> 324 . )
one person with whom i conversed had himself heard the noise : he described it as very surprising ; and he distinctly stated that , although he could not understand how it was caused , yet it was necessary to set the sand rolling down the <unk> .
a horse walking over dry and coarse sand causes a peculiar chirping noise from the friction of the particles ; a circumstance which i several times noticed on the coast of brazil .
three days afterwards i heard of the " beagle 's " arrival at the port , distant eighteen leagues from the town .
there is very little land cultivated down the valley ; its wide expanse supports a wretched wiry grass , which even the donkeys can hardly eat .
this poorness of the vegetation is owing to the quantity of saline matter with which the soil is impregnated .
the port consists of an assemblage of miserable little hovels , situated at the foot of a sterile plain .
at present , as the river contains water enough to reach the sea , the inhabitants enjoy the advantage of having fresh water within a mile and a half .
on the beach there were large piles of merchandise , and the little place had an air of activity .
in the evening i gave my <unk> , with a hearty good-will , to my companion <name> gonzales , with whom i had ridden so many leagues in chile .
the next morning the " beagle " sailed for iquique .
july 12 , 1835 .
we anchored in the port of iquique , in latitude 20 degrees 12 ' , on the coast of peru .
the town contains about a thousand inhabitants , and stands on a little plain of sand at the foot of a great wall of rock , 2000 feet in height , here forming the coast .
the whole is utterly desert .
a light shower of rain falls only once in very many years ; and the ravines consequently are filled with detritus , and the <unk> covered by piles of fine white sand , even to a height of a thousand feet .
during this season of the year a heavy bank of clouds , stretched over the ocean , seldom rises above the wall of rocks on the coast .
the aspect of the place was most gloomy ; the little port , with its few vessels , and small group of wretched houses , seemed overwhelmed and out of all proportion with the rest of the scene .
the inhabitants live like persons on board a ship : every necessary comes from a distance : water is brought in boats from <unk> , about forty miles northward , and is sold at the rate of nine <unk> ( four shillings and sixpence ) an <unk> cask : i bought a <unk> full for <unk> .
in like manner firewood , and of course every article of food , is imported .
very few animals can be maintained in such a place : on the ensuing morning i hired with difficulty , at the price of four pounds <name> , two mules and a guide to take me to the nitrate of soda works .
these are at present the support of iquique .
this salt was first exported in 1830 : in one year an amount in value of one hundred thousand pounds <name> was sent to <name> and england .
it is principally used as a manure and in the manufacture of nitric acid : owing to its <unk> property it <name> not serve for gunpowder .
formerly there were two exceedingly <name> <unk> in this neighbourhood , but their produce is now very small .
our arrival in the offing caused some little apprehension .
peru was in a state of anarchy ; and each party having demanded a contribution , the poor town of iquique was in <unk> , thinking the evil hour was come .
the people had also their domestic troubles ; a short time before , three french carpenters had broken open , during the same night , the two churches , and stolen all the plate : one of the robbers , however , subsequently confessed , and the plate was recovered .
the convicts were sent to <unk> , which though the capital of this province , is two hundred leagues distant , the government there thought it a pity to punish such useful workmen who could make all sorts of furniture ; and accordingly liberated them .
things being in this state , the churches were again broken open , but this time the plate was not recovered .
the inhabitants became dreadfully enraged , and declaring that none but <unk> would thus " eat god almighty , " proceeded to torture some englishmen , with the intention of afterwards shooting them .
at last the authorities interfered , and peace was established .
july 13 , 1835 .
in the morning i started for the <unk> , a distance of fourteen leagues .
having ascended the steep <unk> by a zigzag <name> track , we soon came in view of the mines of <unk> and st. <name> .
these two small villages are placed at the very mouths of the mines ; and being perched up on hills , they had a still more unnatural and desolate appearance than the town of iquique .
we did not reach the <unk> works till after sunset , having ridden all day across an undulating country , a complete and utter desert .
the road was strewed with the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden which had perished on it from fatigue .
excepting the <unk> <name> , which preys on the carcasses , i saw neither bird , quadruped , reptile , nor insect .
on the <unk> , at the height of about 2000 feet , where during this season the clouds generally <name> , a very few <unk> were growing in the <unk> of rock ; and the loose sand was strewed over with a lichen , which lies on the surface quite unattached .
this plant belongs to the genus <unk> , and somewhat resembles the reindeer lichen .
in some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand , as seen from a distance , of a pale yellowish colour .
farther inland , during the whole ride of fourteen leagues , i saw only one other vegetable production , and that was a most minute yellow lichen , growing on the bones of the dead mules .
this was the first true desert which i had seen : the effect on me was not impressive ; but i believe this was owing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes , as i rode northward from valparaiso , through coquimbo , to copiapó .
the appearance of the country was remarkable , from being covered by a thick crust of common salt , and of a stratified saliferous <unk> , which seems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of the sea .
the salt is white , very hard , and compact : it occurs in water-worn nodules projecting from the <unk> sand , and is associated with much gypsum .
the appearance of this superficial mass very closely resembled that of a country after snow , before the last dirty patches are thawed .
the existence of this crust of a soluble substance over the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily dry the climate must have been for a long period .
at night i slept at the house of the owner of one of the <unk> mines .
the country is here as unproductive as near the coast ; but water , having rather a bitter and brackish taste , can be procured by digging wells .
the well at this house was thirty-six yards deep : as scarcely any rain falls , it is evident the water is not thus derived ; indeed if it were , it could not fail to be as salt as brine , for the whole surrounding country is <unk> with various saline substances .
we must therefore conclude that it <unk> under ground from the cordillera , though distant many leagues .
in that direction there are a few small villages , where the inhabitants , having more water , are enabled to <unk> a little land , and raise hay , on which the mules and asses , employed in carrying the <unk> , are fed .
the nitrate of soda was now selling at the ship 's side at fourteen shillings per hundred pounds : the chief expense is its transport to the sea-coast .
the mine consists of a hard stratum , between two and three feet thick , of the nitrate mingled with a little of the sulphate of soda and a good deal of common salt .
it lies close beneath the surface , and follows for a length of one hundred and fifty miles the margin of a grand basin or plain ; this , from its outline , manifestly must once have been a lake , or more probably an inland arm of the sea , as may be inferred from the presence of <unk> salts in the saline stratum .
the surface of the plain is <unk> feet above the pacific .
july 19 , 1835 .
we anchored in the bay of callao , the seaport of lima , the capital of peru .
we stayed here six weeks , but from the troubled state of public affairs i saw very little of the country .
during our whole visit the climate was far from being so delightful as it is generally represented .
a dull heavy bank of clouds constantly <name> over the land , so that during the first sixteen days i had only one view of the cordillera behind lima .
these mountains , seen in stages , one above the other , through openings in the clouds , had a very grand appearance .
it is almost become a proverb , that rain never falls in the lower part of peru .
yet this can hardly be considered correct ; for during almost every day of our visit there was a thick <unk> mist , which was sufficient to make the streets muddy and one 's clothes damp : this the people are pleased to call peruvian dew .
that much rain does not fall is very certain , for the houses are covered only with flat roofs made of hardened mud ; and on the mole <unk> of wheat were piled up , being thus left for weeks together without any shelter .
i can not say i liked the very little i saw of peru : in summer , however , it is said that the climate is much pleasanter .
in all seasons , both inhabitants and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague .
this disease is common on the whole coast of peru , but is unknown in the interior .
the attacks of illness which arise from <unk> never fail to appear most mysterious .
so difficult is it to judge from the aspect of a country , whether or not it is healthy , that if a person had been told to choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for health , very probably he would have named this coast .
the plain round the outskirts of callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass , and in some parts there are a few stagnant , though very small , pools of water .
the <unk> , in all probability , arises from these : for the town of <name> was similarly circumstanced , and its <unk> was much improved by the drainage of some little pools .
<unk> is not always produced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate ; for many parts of brazil , even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation , are much more healthy than this sterile coast of peru .
the <unk> forests in a temperate climate , as in chiloe , do not seem in the slightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere .
the island of st. jago , at the cape de <unk> , offers another strongly-marked instance of a country , which any one would have expected to find most healthy , being very much the contrary .
i have described the bare and open plains as supporting , during a few weeks after the rainy season , a thin vegetation , which directly withers away and dries up : at this period the air appears to become quite poisonous ; both natives and foreigners often being affected with violent fevers .
on the other hand , the galapagos archipelago , in the pacific , with a similar soil , and periodically subject to the same process of vegetation , is perfectly healthy .
humboldt has observed that " under the torrid zone , the smallest marshes are the most dangerous , being surrounded , as at <name> <name> and <unk> , with an arid and <name> soil , which raises the temperature of the <unk> air . "
( <unk> .
" political essay on the kingdom of new spain " volume 4 <name> 199 . )
on the coast of peru , however , the temperature is not hot to any excessive degree ; and perhaps in consequence the intermittent fevers are not of the most malignant order .
in all unhealthy countries the greatest risk is run by sleeping on shore .
is this owing to the state of the body during sleep , or to a greater abundance of <unk> at such times ?
it appears certain that those who stay on board a vessel , though anchored at only a short distance from the coast , generally suffer less than those actually on shore .
on the other hand , i have heard of one remarkable case where a fever broke out among the crew of a man-of-war some hundred miles off the coast of africa , and at the same time one of those fearful periods of death commenced at <name> <name> .
( <unk> .
a similar interesting case is recorded in the " madras medical quarterly journal " 1839 <name> 340 .
dr. ferguson in his admirable paper see 9th volume of " edinburgh <name> transactions " shows clearly that the poison is generated in the drying process ; and hence that dry hot countries are often the most unhealthy . )
no state in south <name> , since the declaration of independence , has suffered more from anarchy than peru .
at the time of our visit there were four chiefs in arms contending for supremacy in the government : if one succeeded in becoming for a time very powerful , the others <unk> against him ; but no sooner were they victorious than they were again hostile to each other .
the other day , at the anniversary of the independence , high mass was performed , the president partaking of the sacrament : during the " te <unk> <unk> , " instead of each regiment displaying the peruvian flag , a black one with death 's head was <unk> .
imagine a government under which such a scene could be ordered , on such an occasion , to be typical of their determination of fighting to death !
this state of affairs happened at a time very unfortunately for me , as i was <unk> from taking any excursions much beyond the limits of the town .
the barren island of san <name> , which forms the harbour , was nearly the only place where one could walk securely .
the upper part , which is upwards of 1000 feet in height , during this season of the year ( <name> ) , comes within the lower limit of the clouds ; and in consequence an abundant <unk> vegetation and a few flowers cover the summit .
on the hills near lima , at a height but little greater , the ground is carpeted with moss , and beds of beautiful yellow lilies , called <unk> .
this indicates a very much greater degree of <unk> than at a corresponding height at iquique .
proceeding northward of lima , the climate becomes damper , till on the banks of the <unk> , nearly under the equator , we find the most luxuriant forests .
the change , however , from the sterile coast of peru to that fertile land is described as taking place rather abruptly in the latitude of cape blanco , two degrees south of <unk> .
callao is a filthy , <unk> , small seaport .
the inhabitants , both here and at lima , present every imaginable shade of mixture , between european , negro , and indian blood .
they appear a depraved , drunken set of people .
the atmosphere is loaded with foul smells , and that peculiar one , which may be perceived in almost every town within the tropics , was here very strong .
the fortress , which withstood lord <unk> 's long siege , has an imposing appearance .
but the president , during our stay , sold the brass guns , and proceeded to <unk> parts of it .
the reason assigned was , that he had not an officer to whom he could trust so important a charge .
he himself had good reason for thinking so , as he had obtained the <unk> by <unk> while in charge of this same fortress .
after we left south <name> , he paid the penalty in the usual manner , by being conquered , taken prisoner , and shot .
lima stands on a plain in a valley , formed during the gradual retreat of the sea .
it is seven miles from callao , and is elevated 500 feet above it ; but from the slope being very gradual , the road appears absolutely level ; so that when at lima it is difficult to believe one has ascended even one hundred feet : humboldt has remarked on this singularly deceptive case .
steep barren hills rise like islands from the plain , which is divided , by straight <unk> , into large green fields .
in these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows , and an occasional clump of bananas and of oranges .
the city of lima is now in a wretched state of decay : the streets are nearly <unk> ; and heaps of filth are piled up in all directions , where the black <unk> , tame as poultry , pick up bits of carrion .
the houses have generally an upper story , built , on account of the earthquakes , of plastered woodwork ; but some of the old ones , which are now used by several families , are immensely large , and would rival in suites of apartments the most magnificent in any place .
lima , the city of the kings , must formerly have been a splendid town .
the extraordinary number of churches gives it , even at the present day , a peculiar and striking character , especially when viewed from a short distance .
one day i went out with some merchants to hunt in the immediate vicinity of the city .
our sport was very poor ; but i had an opportunity of seeing the ruins of one of the ancient indian villages , with its mound like a natural hill in the centre .
the remains of houses , enclosures , <unk> streams , and burial mounds , scattered over this plain , can not fail to give one a high idea of the condition and number of the ancient population .
when their earthenware , woollen clothes , utensils of elegant forms cut out of the hardest rocks , tools of copper , ornaments of precious stones , palaces , and <unk> works , are considered , it is impossible not to respect the considerable advance made by them in the arts of civilisation .
the burial mounds , called <unk> , are really stupendous ; although in some places they appear to be natural hills encased and modelled .
there is also another and very different class of ruins which possesses some interest , namely , those of old callao , overwhelmed by the great earthquake of <unk> , and its accompanying wave .
the destruction must have been more complete even than at <unk> .
quantities of shingle almost conceal the foundations of the walls , and vast masses of brickwork appear to have been whirled about like pebbles by the retiring waves .
it has been stated that the land subsided during this memorable shock : i could not discover any proof of this ; yet it seems far from improbable , for the form of the coast must certainly have undergone some change since the foundation of the old town ; as no people in their senses would willingly have chosen for their building place the narrow spit of shingle on which the ruins now stand .
since our voyage , m. <unk> has come to the conclusion , by the comparison of old and modern maps , that the coast both north and south of lima has certainly subsided .
on the island of san <name> there are very satisfactory proofs of elevation within the recent period ; this of course is not opposed to the belief of a small sinking of the ground having subsequently taken place .
the side of this island fronting the bay of callao is worn into three obscure terraces , the lower one of which is covered by a bed a mile in length , almost wholly composed of shells of eighteen species , now living in the adjoining sea .
the height of this bed is eighty-five feet .
many of the shells are deeply corroded , and have a much older and more decayed appearance than those at the height of 500 or 600 feet on the coast of chile .
these shells are associated with much common salt , a little sulphate of lime ( both probably left by the evaporation of the spray , as the land slowly rose ) , together with sulphate of soda and muriate of lime .
they rest on fragments of the underlying sandstone , and are covered by a few inches thick of detritus .
the shells higher up on this terrace could be traced scaling off in flakes , and falling into an impalpable powder ; and on an upper terrace , at the height of 170 feet , and likewise at some considerably higher points , i found a layer of saline powder of exactly similar appearance , and lying in the same relative position .
i have no doubt that this upper layer originally existed as a bed of shells , like that on the <unk> ledge ; but it does not now contain even a trace of organic structure .
the powder has been <unk> for me by mr. t. reeks ; it consists of <unk> and <unk> both of lime and soda , with very little carbonate of lime .
it is known that common salt and carbonate of lime left in a mass for some time together partly decompose each other ; though this does not happen with small quantities in solution .
as the <unk> shells in the lower parts are associated with much common salt , together with some of the saline substances composing the upper saline layer , and as these shells are corroded and decayed in a remarkable manner , i strongly suspect that this double decomposition has here taken place .
the <unk> salts , however , ought to be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime , the latter is present , but not the carbonate of soda .
hence i am led to imagine that by some unexplained means the carbonate of soda becomes changed into the sulphate .
it is obvious that the saline layer could not have been preserved in any country in which abundant rain occasionally fell : on the other hand this very circumstance , which at first sight appears so highly favourable to the long preservation of exposed shells , has probably been the indirect means , through the common salt not having been washed away , of their decomposition and early decay .
i was much interested by finding on the terrace , at the height of eighty-five feet , embedded amidst the shells and much <unk> rubbish , some bits of cotton thread , plaited rush , and the head of a stalk of indian corn : i compared these relics with similar ones taken out of the <unk> , or old peruvian tombs , and found them identical in appearance .
on the mainland in front of san <name> , near <unk> , there is an extensive and level plain about a hundred feet high , of which the lower part is formed of alternating layers of sand and impure <name> , together with some gravel , and the surface , to the depth of from three to six feet , of a reddish loam , containing a few scattered sea-shells and numerous small fragments of coarse red earthenware , more abundant at certain spots than at others .
at first i was inclined to believe that this superficial bed , from its wide extent and smoothness , must have been deposited beneath the sea ; but i afterwards found in one spot that it lay on an artificial floor of round stones .
it seems , therefore , most probable that at a period when the land stood at a lower level there was a plain very similar to that now surrounding callao , which , being protected by a shingle beach , is raised but very little above the level of the sea .
on this plain , with its underlying <unk> beds , i imagine that the indians manufactured their earthen vessels ; and that , during some violent earthquake , the sea broke over the beach , and converted the plain into a temporary lake , as happened round callao in <unk> and <unk> .
the water would then have deposited mud containing fragments of pottery from the <unk> , more abundant at some spots than at others , and shells from the sea .
this bed with fossil earthenware stands at about the same height with the shells on the lower terrace of san <name> , in which the <unk> and other relics were embedded .
hence we may safely conclude that within the <unk> period there has been an elevation , as before alluded to , of more than eighty-five feet ; for some little elevation must have been lost by the coast having subsided since the old maps were engraved .
at valparaiso , although in the 220 years before our visit the elevation can not have exceeded nineteen feet , yet subsequently to 1817 there has been a rise , partly insensible and partly by a start during the shock of 1822 , of ten or eleven feet .
the antiquity of the <unk> race here , judging by the eighty-five feet rise of the land since the relics were embedded , is the more remarkable , as on the coast of patagonia , when the land stood about the same number of feet lower , the macrauchenia was a living beast ; but as the patagonian coast is some way distant from the cordillera , the rising there may have been slower than here .
at bahia <name> the elevation has been only a few feet since the numerous gigantic quadrupeds were there entombed ; and , according to the generally received opinion , when these extinct animals were living man did not exist .
but the rising of that part of the coast of patagonia is perhaps no way connected with the cordillera , but rather with a line of old volcanic rocks in banda oriental , so that it may have been infinitely slower than on the shores of peru .
all these speculations , however , must be vague ; for who <name> pretend to say that there may not have been several periods of subsidence , intercalated between the movements of elevation ?
for we know that along the whole coast of patagonia there have certainly been many and long pauses in the upward action of the elevatory forces .

( plate 80 .
galapagos archipelago . )
this archipelago consists of ten principal islands , of which five exceed the others in size .
they are situated under the equator , and between five and six hundred miles westward of the coast of <name> .
they are all formed of volcanic rocks ; a few fragments of granite curiously glazed and altered by the heat can hardly be considered as an exception .
some of the craters <unk> the larger islands are of immense size , and they rise to a height of between three and four thousand feet .
their flanks are studded by innumerable smaller orifices .
i scarcely hesitate to affirm that there must be in the whole archipelago at least two thousand craters .
these consist either of lava and scoriae , or of <unk> , <unk> tuff .
most of the latter are beautifully symmetrical ; they owe their origin to eruptions of volcanic mud without any lava : it is a remarkable circumstance that every one of the twenty-eight <unk> which were examined had their southern sides either much lower than the other sides , or quite broken down and removed .
as all these craters apparently have been formed when standing in the sea , and as the waves from the trade wind and the swell from the open pacific here unite their forces on the southern coasts of all the islands , this singular uniformity in the broken state of the craters , composed of the soft and yielding tuff , is easily explained .
considering that these islands are placed directly under the equator , the climate is far from being excessively hot ; this seems chiefly caused by the singularly low temperature of the surrounding water , brought here by the great southern polar current .
excepting during one short season very little rain falls , and even then it is irregular ; but the clouds generally <name> low .
hence , whilst the lower parts of the islands are very sterile , the upper parts , at a height of a thousand feet and upwards , possess a damp climate and a tolerably luxuriant vegetation .
this is especially the case on the windward sides of the islands , which first receive and condense the moisture from the atmosphere .
in the morning ( 17th ) we landed on chatham island , which , like the others , rises with a tame and rounded outline , broken here and there by scattered hillocks , the remains of former craters .
nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance .
a broken field of black basaltic lava , thrown into the most rugged waves , and crossed by great fissures , is everywhere covered by stunted , <unk> brushwood , which shows little signs of life .
the dry and parched surface , being heated by the noonday sun , gave to the air a close and sultry feeling , like that from a stove : we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly .
although i diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible , i succeeded in getting very few ; and such <unk> little weeds would have better become an arctic than an equatorial <name> .
the brushwood appears , from a short distance , as leafless as our trees during <name> ; and it was some time before i discovered that not only almost every plant was now in full leaf , but that the greater number were in flower .
the commonest bush is one of the <unk> : an <unk> and a great <unk> cactus are the only trees which afford any shade .
after the season of heavy rains , the islands are said to appear for a short time partially green .
the volcanic island of <name> noronha , placed in many respects under nearly similar conditions , is the only other country where i have seen a vegetation at all like this of the galapagos islands .
the " beagle " sailed round chatham island , and anchored in several bays .
one night i slept on shore on a part of the island where black truncated cones were extraordinarily numerous : from one small eminence i counted sixty of them , all surmounted by craters more or less perfect .
the greater number consisted merely of a ring of red scoriae or <unk> cemented together : and their height above the plain of lava was not more than from fifty to a hundred feet : none had been very lately active .
the entire surface of this part of the island seems to have been <unk> , like a <unk> , by the subterranean vapours : here and there the lava , whilst soft , has been blown into great bubbles ; and in other parts , the tops of caverns similarly formed have fallen in , leaving circular pits with steep sides .
from the regular form of the many craters , they gave to the country an artificial appearance , which vividly reminded me of those parts of staffordshire where the great <unk> are most numerous .
the day was glowing hot , and the scrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets was very fatiguing ; but i was well repaid by the strange <unk> scene .
as i was walking along i met two large tortoises , each of which must have weighed at least two hundred pounds : one was eating a piece of cactus , and as i approached , it stared at me and slowly walked away ; the other gave a deep hiss , and <name> in its head .
these huge reptiles , surrounded by the black lava , the leafless shrubs , and large <unk> , seemed to my fancy like some <unk> animals .
the few dull-coloured birds cared no more for me than they did for the great tortoises .

the " beagle " proceeded to <name> island .
this archipelago has long been frequented , first by the <unk> , and latterly by whalers , but it is only within the last six years that a small colony has been established here .
the inhabitants are between two and three hundred in number ; they are nearly all people of colour , who have been banished for political crimes from the republic of the equator , of which <unk> is the capital .
the settlement is placed about four and a half miles inland , and at a height probably of a thousand feet .
in the first part of the road we passed through leafless thickets , as in chatham island .
higher up the woods gradually became greener ; and as soon as we crossed the ridge of the island we were cooled by a fine southerly breeze , and our sight refreshed by a green and thriving vegetation .
in this upper region coarse grasses and ferns abound ; but there are no <unk> : i saw nowhere any member of the palm family , which is the more singular , as 360 miles northward , <unk> island takes its name from the number of <unk> .
the houses are irregularly scattered over a flat space of ground , which is cultivated with sweet potatoes and bananas .
it <name> not easily be imagined how pleasant the sight of black mud was to us , after having been so long accustomed to the parched soil of peru and northern chile .
the inhabitants , although complaining of poverty , obtain , without much trouble , the means of subsistence .
in the woods there are many wild pigs and goats ; but the staple article of animal food is supplied by the tortoises .
their <name> have of course been greatly reduced in this island , but the people yet count on two days ' hunting giving them food for the rest of the week .
it is said that formerly single vessels have taken away as many as seven hundred , and that the ship 's company of a frigate some years since brought down in one day two hundred tortoises to the beach .
<name> 29 , 1835 .
we doubled the south-west extremity of albemarle island , and the next day were nearly <unk> between it and <unk> island .
both are covered with immense deluges of black naked lava , which have flowed either over the rims of the great <unk> , like pitch over the rim of a pot in which it has been boiled , or have burst forth from smaller orifices on the flanks ; in their descent they have spread over miles of the sea-coast .
on both of these islands eruptions are known to have taken place ; and in albemarle we saw a small jet of smoke curling from the summit of one of the great craters .
in the evening we anchored in bank 's cove , in albemarle island .
the next morning i went out walking .
to the south of the broken <unk> , in which the " beagle " was anchored , there was another beautifully symmetrical one of an elliptic form ; its longer axis was a little less than a mile , and its depth about 500 feet .
at its bottom there was a shallow lake , in the middle of which a <name> crater formed an islet .
the day was <unk> hot , and the lake looked clear and blue : i hurried down the <unk> slope , and , choked with dust , eagerly tasted the water  but , to my sorrow , i found it salt as brine .
the rocks on the coast abounded with great black lizards , between three and four feet long ; and on the hills , an ugly yellowish-brown species was equally common .
we saw many of this latter kind , some clumsily running out of the way , and others shuffling into their burrows .
i shall presently describe in more detail the habits of both these reptiles .
the whole of this northern part of albemarle island is miserably sterile .
october 8 , 1835 .
we arrived at <name> island : this island , as well as <name> island , were long since thus named after our kings of the <name> line .
mr. <unk> , myself , and our servants were left here for a week , with provisions and a tent , whilst the " beagle " went for water .
we found here a party of spaniards who had been sent from <name> island to dry fish and to salt <unk> .
about six miles inland and at the height of nearly 2000 feet , a hovel had been built in which two men lived , who were employed in catching tortoises , whilst the others were fishing on the coast .
i paid this party two visits , and slept there one night .
as in the other islands , the lower region was covered by nearly leafless bushes , but the trees were here of a larger growth than elsewhere , several being two feet and some even two feet nine inches in diameter .
the upper region , being kept damp by the clouds , supports a green and flourishing vegetation .
so damp was the ground , that there were large beds of a coarse <unk> , in which great <name> of a very small <unk> lived and bred .
while staying in this upper region , we lived entirely upon <unk> : the <unk> roasted ( as the gauchos do <unk> con <unk> ) , with the flesh on it , is very good ; and the young tortoises make excellent soup ; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent .
one day we accompanied a party of the spaniards in their <unk> to a <name> , or lake from which salt is procured .
after landing we had a very rough walk over a rugged field of recent lava , which has almost surrounded a <unk> at the bottom of which the <unk> lies .
the water is only three or four inches deep and rests on a layer of beautifully crystallised , white salt .
the lake is quite circular , and is fringed with a border of bright green succulent plants ; the almost precipitous walls of the crater are clothed with wood , so that the scene was altogether both picturesque and curious .
a few years since the sailors belonging to a <unk> murdered their captain in this quiet spot ; and we saw his skull lying among the bushes .
during the greater part of our stay of a week the sky was cloudless , and if the trade-wind failed for an hour the heat became very oppressive .
on two days the thermometer within the tent stood for some hours at 93 degrees ; but in the open air , in the wind and sun , at only 85 degrees .
the sand was extremely hot ; the thermometer placed in some of a brown colour immediately rose to 137 degrees , and how much above that it would have risen i do not know for it was not graduated any higher .
the black sand felt much hotter , so that even in thick boots it was quite disagreeable to walk over it .
the natural history of these islands is eminently curious , and well deserves attention .
most of the organic productions are aboriginal creations found nowhere else ; there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the different islands ; yet all show a marked relationship with those of <name> , though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean , between 500 and 600 miles in width .
the archipelago is a little world within itself , or rather a satellite attached to <name> , whence it has derived a few stray colonists , and has received the general character of its indigenous productions .
considering the small size of these islands , we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings , and at their confined range .
seeing every height crowned with its crater , and the boundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct , we are led to believe that within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was here spread out .
hence , both in space and time , we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact  that mystery of mysteries  the first appearance of new beings on this earth .
of terrestrial mammals there is only one which must be considered as indigenous , namely a mouse ( mus <unk> ) and this is confined , as far as i could ascertain , to chatham island , the most easterly island of the group .
it belongs , as i am informed by mr. waterhouse , to a division of the family of mice characteristic of <name> .
at <name> island there is a rat sufficiently distinct from the common kind to have been named and described by mr. waterhouse ; but as it belongs to the <unk> division of the family , and as this island has been frequented by ships for the last hundred and fifty years , i can hardly doubt that this rat is merely a variety produced by the new and peculiar climate , food , and soil , to which it has been subjected .
although no one has a right to speculate without distinct facts , yet even with respect to the chatham island mouse , it should be borne in mind that it may possibly be an american species imported here ; for i have seen , in a most unfrequented part of the pampas , a native mouse living in the roof of a newly built hovel , and therefore its transportation in a vessel is not improbable : analogous facts have been observed by dr. richardson in north <name> .
of land-birds i obtained twenty-six kinds , all peculiar to the group and found nowhere else , with the exception of one <unk> finch from north <name> ( <unk> <unk> ) which ranges on that continent as far north as 54 degrees , and generally <unk> marshes .
the other twenty-five birds consist , firstly , of a hawk , curiously intermediate in structure between a buzzard and the american group of <unk> <unk> ; and with these latter birds it agrees most closely in every habit and even tone of voice .
secondly there are two owls , representing the <unk> and white <unk> of europe .
thirdly a wren , three <unk> ( two of them species of <unk> , one or both of which would be ranked by some ornithologists as only varieties ) , and a dove  all analogous to , but distinct from , american species .
fourthly a swallow , which though differing from the <unk> purpurea of both <unk> , only in being rather duller coloured , smaller , and <unk> , is considered by mr. gould as specifically distinct .
fifthly there are three species of mocking-thrush  a form highly characteristic of <name> .
the remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches , related to each other in the structure of their beaks , short tails , form of body and plumage : there are thirteen species which mr. gould has divided into four sub-groups .
all these species are peculiar to this archipelago ; and so is the whole group , with the exception of one species of the sub-group <unk> , lately brought from bow island , in the low archipelago .
of <unk> the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great <unk> ; but all the other species of this group of finches , mingled together in flocks , feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts .
the males of all , or certainly of the greater number , are jet black ; and the females ( with perhaps one or two exceptions ) are brown .
( plate 81 .
finches from galapagos archipelago .

4 .
<unk> <unk> . )
the most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of <unk> , from one as large as that of a <unk> to that of a chaffinch , and ( if mr. gould is right in including his sub-group , <unk> , in the main group ) even to that of a <unk> .
the largest beak in the genus <unk> is shown in ( plate 81 ) figure 1 , and the smallest in figure 3 ; but instead of there being only one intermediate species , with a beak of the size shown in figure 2 , there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks .
the beak of the sub-group <unk> , is shown in figure 4 .
the beak of <unk> is somewhat like that of a starling , and that of the fourth sub-group , <unk> , is slightly <unk> .
seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small , intimately related group of birds , one might really fancy that from an original <unk> of birds in this archipelago , one species had been taken and modified for different ends .
in a like manner it might be fancied that a bird , originally a buzzard , had been induced here to undertake the office of the <unk> <unk> of the american continent .
of waders and <unk> i was able to get only eleven kinds , and of these only three ( including a rail confined to the damp summits of the islands ) are new species .
considering the wandering habits of the gulls , i was surprised to find that the species inhabiting these islands is peculiar , but allied to one from the southern parts of south <name> .
the far greater peculiarity of the land-birds , namely , twenty-five out of twenty-six being new species , or at least new races , compared with the waders and <unk> birds , is in accordance with the greater range which these latter orders have in all parts of the world .
we shall hereafter see this law of aquatic forms , whether <name> or fresh water , being less peculiar at any given point of the <unk> surface than the terrestrial forms of the same classes , strikingly illustrated in the shells , and in a lesser degree in the insects of this archipelago .
two of the waders are rather smaller than the same species brought from other places : the swallow is also smaller , though it is doubtful whether or not it is distinct from its <unk> .
the two owls , the two <unk> ( <unk> ) and the dove , are also smaller than the analogous but distinct species , to which they are most nearly related ; on the other hand , the gull is rather larger .
the two owls , the swallow , all three species of mocking-thrush , the dove in its separate colours though not in its whole plumage , the <unk> , and the gull , are likewise <unk> coloured than their analogous species ; and in the case of the mocking-thrush and <unk> , than any other species of the two genera .
with the exception of a wren with a fine yellow breast , and of a <unk> with a <name> tuft and breast , none of the birds are brilliantly coloured , as might have been expected in an equatorial district .
hence it would appear probable that the same causes which here make the immigrants of some species smaller , make most of the peculiar <unk> species also smaller , as well as very generally more dusky coloured .
all the plants have a wretched , <unk> appearance , and i did not see one beautiful flower .
the insects , again , are <unk> and dull coloured , and , as mr. waterhouse informs me , there is nothing in their general appearance which would have led him to imagine that they had come from under the equator .
( <unk> .
the progress of research has shown that some of these birds , which were then thought to be confined to the islands , occur on the american continent .
the eminent ornithologist , mr. sclater , informs me that this is the case with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; and probably with the <unk> <unk> and <name> <unk> : so that the number of endemic birds is reduced to twenty-three , or probably to twenty-one .
mr. sclater thinks that one or two of these endemic forms should be ranked rather as varieties than species , which always seemed to me probable . )
the birds , plants , and insects have a desert character , and are not more brilliantly coloured than those from southern patagonia ; we may , therefore , conclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical productions is not related either to the heat or light of those zones , but to some other cause , perhaps to the conditions of existence being generally favourable to life .
we <name> now turn to the order of reptiles , which gives the most striking character to the zoology of these islands .
the species are not numerous , but the <name> of individuals of each species are extraordinarily great .
there is one small lizard belonging to a south american genus , and two species ( and probably more ) of the <unk>  a genus confined to the galapagos islands .
there is one snake which is numerous ; it is identical , as i am informed by m. <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> from chile .
( <unk> .
this is stated by dr. gunther " zoological society " <name> 24 , 1859 , to be a peculiar species , not known to inhabit any other country . )
of <unk> i believe there are more than one species , and of tortoises there are , as we shall presently show , two or three species or races .
of toads and frogs there are none : i was surprised at this , considering how well suited for them the temperate and damp upper woods appeared to be .
it recalled to my mind the remark made by bory st. <name> , namely , that none of this family are found on any of the volcanic islands in the great oceans .

<name> . )
as far as i can ascertain from various works , this seems to hold good throughout the pacific , and even in the large islands of the sandwich archipelago .
mauritius offers an apparent exception , where i saw the <name> <unk> in abundance : this frog is said now to inhabit the <unk> , madagascar , and bourbon ; but on the other hand , du bois , in his voyage in <unk> , states that there were no reptiles in bourbon except tortoises ; and the <unk> du roi asserts that before <unk> it had been attempted , without success , to introduce frogs into mauritius  i presume for the purpose of eating : hence it may be well doubted whether this frog is an aboriginal of these islands .
the absence of the frog family in the oceanic islands is the more remarkable , when contrasted with the case of lizards , which swarm on most of the smallest islands .
may this difference not be caused by the greater facility with which the eggs of lizards , protected by calcareous shells , might be transported through salt-water , than could the slimy spawn of frogs ?
i <name> first describe the habits of the tortoise ( <unk> nigra , formerly called indica ) , which has been so frequently alluded to .
these animals are found , i believe , on all the islands of the archipelago ; certainly on the greater number .
they frequent in preference the high damp parts , but they likewise live in the lower and arid districts .
i have already shown , from the <name> which have been caught in a single day , how very numerous they must be .
some grow to an immense size : mr. lawson , an englishman , and <unk> of the colony , told us that he had seen several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground ; and that some had afforded as much as two hundred pounds of meat .
the old males are the largest , the females rarely growing to so great a size : the male can readily be distinguished from the female by the greater length of its tail .
the tortoises which live on those islands where there is no water , or in the lower and arid parts of the others , feed chiefly on the succulent cactus .
those which frequent the higher and damp regions eat the leaves of various trees , a kind of <name> ( called <unk> ) which is acid and austere , and likewise a pale green <unk> lichen ( <unk> <unk> ) , that hangs from the boughs of the trees .
the tortoise is very fond of water , drinking large quantities , and wallowing in the mud .
the larger islands alone possess springs , and these are always situated towards the central parts , and at a considerable height .
the tortoises , therefore , which frequent the lower districts , when thirsty , are obliged to travel from a long distance .
hence broad and <unk> paths branch off in every direction from the wells down to the sea-coast ; and the spaniards , by following them up , first discovered the <unk> .
when i landed at chatham island , i could not imagine what animal travelled so methodically along <unk> tracks .
near the springs it was a curious spectacle to behold many of these huge creatures , one set eagerly travelling onwards with outstretched necks , and another set returning , after having drunk their fill .
when the tortoise arrives at the spring , quite regardless of any spectator , he buries his head in the water above his eyes , and greedily swallows great <unk> , at the rate of about ten in a minute .
the inhabitants say each animal stays three or four days in the neighbourhood of the water , and then returns to the lower country ; but they differed respecting the frequency of these visits .
the animal probably <unk> them according to the nature of the food on which it has lived .
it is , however , certain that tortoises can subsist even on those islands where there is no other water than what falls during a few rainy days in the year .
i believe it is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as a reservoir for the moisture necessary to its existence : such seems to be the case with the tortoise .
for some time after a visit to the springs , their <unk> bladders are distended with fluid , which is said gradually to decrease in volume , and to become less pure .
the inhabitants , when walking in the lower district , and overcome with thirst , often take advantage of this circumstance , and drink the contents of the bladder if full : in one i saw killed , the fluid was quite limpid , and had only a very slightly bitter taste .
the inhabitants , however , always first drink the water in the <unk> , which is described as being best .
the tortoises , when purposely moving towards any point , travel by night and day and arrive at their journey 's end much sooner than would be expected .
the inhabitants , from observing marked individuals , consider that they travel a distance of about eight miles in two or three days .
one large tortoise , which i watched , walked at the rate of sixty yards in ten minutes , that is 360 yards in the hour , or four miles a day ,  allowing a little time for it to eat on the road .
during the breeding season , when the male and female are together , the male utters a hoarse roar or bellowing , which , it is said , can be heard at the distance of more than a hundred yards .
the female never uses her voice , and the male only at these times ; so that when the people hear this noise , they know that the two are together .
they were at this time ( october ) laying their eggs .
the female , where the soil is <name> , deposits them together , and covers them up with sand ; but where the ground is <name> she drops them indiscriminately in any hole : mr. <unk> found seven placed in a fissure .
the egg is white and spherical ; one which i measured was seven inches and <unk> in circumference , and therefore larger than a hen 's egg .
the young tortoises , as soon as they are hatched , fall a prey in great <name> to the <unk> buzzard .
the old ones seem generally to die from accidents , as from falling down precipices : at least , several of the inhabitants told me that they never found one dead without some evident cause .
the inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf ; certainly they do not overhear a person walking close behind them .
i was always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters , as it was quietly pacing along , to see how suddenly , the instant i passed , it would draw in its head and legs , and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound , as if struck dead .
i frequently got on their backs , and then giving a few <unk> on the hinder part of their shells , they would rise up and walk away ;  but i found it very difficult to keep my balance .
the flesh of this animal is largely employed , both fresh and salted ; and a beautifully clear oil is prepared from the fat .
when a tortoise is caught , the man makes a slit in the skin near its tail , so as to see inside its body , whether the fat under the dorsal plate is thick .
if it is not , the animal is liberated ; and it is said to recover soon from this strange operation .
in order to secure the tortoises , it is not sufficient to turn them like turtle , for they are often able to get on their legs again .
there can be little doubt that this tortoise is an aboriginal inhabitant of the galapagos ; for it is found on all , or nearly all , the islands , even on some of the smaller ones where there is no water ; had it been an imported species this would hardly have been the case in a group which has been so little frequented .
moreover , the old <unk> found this tortoise in greater <name> even than at present : wood and rogers also , in <unk> , say that it is the opinion of the spaniards that it is found nowhere else in this quarter of the world .
it is now widely distributed ; but it may be questioned whether it is in any other place an aboriginal .
the bones of a tortoise at mauritius , associated with those of the extinct dodo , have generally been considered as belonging to this tortoise ; if this had been so , undoubtedly it must have been there indigenous ; but m. <unk> informs me that he believes that it was distinct , as the species now living there certainly is .
( plate 82 .
<unk> cristatus .
a. tooth of natural size , and likewise magnified . )
the <unk> , a remarkable genus of lizards , is confined to this archipelago ; there are two species , resembling each other in general form , one being terrestrial and the other aquatic .
this latter species ( a. cristatus ) was first characterised by mr. <name> , who well foresaw , from its short , broad head , and strong claws of equal length , that its habits of life would turn out very peculiar , and different from those of its nearest ally , the <unk> .
it is extremely common on all the islands throughout the group , and lives exclusively on the <name> <unk> , being never found , at least i never saw one , even ten yards <unk> .
it is a <unk> creature , of a dirty black colour , stupid , and sluggish in its movements .
the usual length of a full-grown one is about a yard , but there are some even four feet long ; a large one weighed twenty pounds : on the island of albemarle they seem to grow to a greater size than elsewhere .
their tails are flattened sideways , and all four feet partially webbed .
they are occasionally seen some hundred yards from the shore , swimming about ; and captain <unk> , in his voyage says , " they go to sea in herds a-fishing , and sun themselves on the rocks ; and may be called alligators in miniature . "
it must not , however , be supposed that they live on fish .
when in the water this lizard swims with perfect ease and quickness , by a serpentine movement of its body and flattened tail  the legs being motionless and closely collapsed on its sides .
a seaman on board sank one , with a heavy weight attached to it , thinking thus to kill it directly ; but when , an hour afterwards , he <name> up the line , it was quite active .
their limbs and strong claws are admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured masses of lava which everywhere form the coast .
in such situations a group of six or seven of these hideous reptiles may <unk> be seen on the black rocks , a few feet above the surf , basking in the sun with outstretched legs .
i opened the stomachs of several , and found them largely distended with <unk> sea-weed ( <unk> ) , which grows in thin foliaceous <unk> of a bright green or a dull red colour .
i do not recollect having observed this sea-weed in any quantity on the tidal rocks ; and i have reason to believe it grows at the bottom of the sea , at some little distance from the coast .
if such be the case , the object of these animals occasionally going out to sea is explained .
the stomach contained nothing but the sea-weed .
mr. <unk> , however , found a piece of a crab in one ; but this might have got in accidentally , in the same manner as i have seen a caterpillar , in the midst of some lichen , in the <unk> of a tortoise .
the intestines were large , as in other <unk> animals .
the nature of this lizard 's food , as well as the structure of its tail and feet , and the fact of its having been seen voluntarily swimming out at sea , absolutely prove its aquatic habits ; yet there is in this respect one strange anomaly , namely , that when frightened it <name> not enter the water .
hence it is easy to drive these lizards down to any little point overhanging the sea , where they <name> sooner allow a person to catch hold of their tails than jump into the water .
they do not seem to have any notion of biting ; but when much frightened they <unk> a drop of fluid from each <unk> .
i threw one several times as far as i could , into a deep pool left by the retiring tide ; but it invariably returned in a direct line to the spot where i stood .
it swam near the bottom , with a very graceful and rapid movement , and occasionally aided itself over the uneven ground with its feet .
as soon as it arrived near the edge , but still being under water , it tried to conceal itself in the tufts of sea-weed , or it entered some crevice .
as soon as it thought the danger was past , it crawled out on the dry rocks , and shuffled away as quickly as it could .
i several times caught this same lizard , by driving it down to a point , and though possessed of such perfect powers of diving and swimming , nothing would induce it to enter the water ; and as often as i threw it in , it returned in the manner above described .
perhaps this singular piece of apparent stupidity may be accounted for by the circumstance that this reptile has no enemy whatever on shore , whereas at sea it must often fall a prey to the numerous sharks .
hence , probably , urged by a fixed and hereditary instinct that the shore is its place of safety , whatever the emergency may be , it there takes refuge .
during our visit ( in october ) i saw extremely few small individuals of this species , and none i should think under a year old .
from this circumstance it seems probable that the breeding season had not then commenced .
i asked several of the inhabitants if they knew where it laid its eggs : they said that they knew nothing of its propagation , although well acquainted with the eggs of the land kind  a fact , considering how very common this lizard is , not a little extraordinary .
we <name> now turn to the terrestrial species ( a. <unk> ) , with a round tail , and toes without webs .
this lizard , instead of being found like the other on all the islands , is confined to the central part of the archipelago , namely to albemarle , <name> , barrington , and indefatigable islands .
to the southward , in <name> , hood , and chatham islands , and to the northward , in towers , <unk> , and <unk> , i neither saw nor heard of any .
it would appear as if it had been created in the centre of the archipelago , and thence had been dispersed only to a certain distance .
some of these lizards inhabit the high and damp parts of the islands , but they are much more numerous in the lower and sterile districts near the coast .
i can not give a more forcible proof of their <name> , than by stating that when we were left at <name> island , we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent .
like their brothers the <unk> , they are ugly animals , of a yellowish orange beneath , and of a <unk> colour above : from their low facial <name> they have a singularly stupid appearance .
they are , perhaps , of a rather less size than the <name> species ; but several of them weighed between ten and fifteen pounds .
in their movements they are lazy and half torpid .
when not frightened , they slowly crawl along with their tails and bellies dragging on the ground .
they often stop , and doze for a minute or two , with closed eyes and hind legs spread out on the parched soil .
they inhabit burrows which they sometimes make between fragments of lava , but more generally on level patches of the soft <unk> tuff .
the holes do not appear to be very deep , and they enter the ground at a small <name> ; so that when walking over these <unk> , the soil is constantly giving way , much to the annoyance of the tired <name> .
this animal , when making its burrow , works alternately the opposite sides of its body .
one front leg for a short time scratches up the soil , and throws it towards the hind foot , which is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole .
that side of the body being tired , the other takes up the task , and so on alternately .
i watched one for a long time , till half its body was buried ; i then walked up and pulled it by the tail ; at this it was greatly astonished , and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter ; and then stared me in the face , as much as to say , " what made you pull my tail ? "
they feed by day , and do not wander far from their burrows ; if frightened , they rush to them with a most awkward gait .
except when running down hill , they can not move very fast , apparently from the lateral position of their legs .
they are not at all <unk> : when attentively watching any one , they curl their tails , and , raising themselves on their front legs , nod their heads vertically , with a quick movement , and try to look very fierce ; but in reality they are not at all so : if one just stamps on the ground , down go their tails , and off they shuffle as quickly as they can .
i have frequently observed small <unk> lizards , when watching anything , nod their heads in precisely the same manner ; but i do not at all know for what purpose .
if this <unk> is held and plagued with a stick , it <name> bite it very severely ; but i caught many by the tail , and they never tried to bite me .
if two are placed on the ground and held together , they <name> fight , and bite each other till blood is drawn .
the individuals , and they are the greater number , which inhabit the lower country , can scarcely taste a drop of water throughout the year ; but they consume much of the succulent cactus , the branches of which are occasionally broken off by the wind .
i several times threw a piece to two or three of them when together ; and it was amusing enough to see them trying to seize and <name> it away in their mouths , like so many hungry dogs with a bone .
they eat very deliberately , but do not chew their food .
the little birds are aware how harmless these creatures are : i have seen one of the <unk> finches picking at one end of a piece of cactus ( which is much <unk> by all the animals of the lower region ) , whilst a lizard was eating at the other end ; and afterwards the little bird with the utmost indifference hopped on the back of the reptile .
i opened the stomachs of several , and found them full of vegetable fibres and leaves of different trees , especially of an <unk> .
in the upper region they live chiefly on the acid and <unk> berries of the <unk> , under which trees i have seen these lizards and the huge tortoises feeding together .
to obtain the <unk> they crawl up the low stunted trees ; and it is not uncommon to see a pair quietly browsing , whilst seated on a branch several feet above the ground .
these lizards , when cooked , yield a white meat , which is liked by those whose stomachs soar above all prejudices .
humboldt has remarked that in intertropical south <name> all lizards which inhabit dry regions are esteemed delicacies for the table .
the inhabitants state that those which inhabit the upper damp parts drink water , but that the others do not , like the tortoises , travel up for it from the lower sterile country .
at the time of our visit , the females had within their bodies numerous , large , elongated eggs , which they lay in their burrows : the inhabitants seek them for food .
these two species of <unk> agree , as i have already stated , in their general structure , and in many of their habits .
neither have that rapid movement , so characteristic of the genera <unk> and <unk> .
they are both <unk> , although the kind of vegetation on which they feed is so very different .
mr. <name> has given the name to the genus from the shortness of the snout : indeed , the form of the mouth may almost be compared to that of the tortoise : one is led to suppose that this is an adaptation to their <unk> appetites .
it is very interesting thus to find a <unk> genus , having its <name> and terrestrial species , belonging to so confined a portion of the world .
the aquatic species is by far the most remarkable , because it is the only existing lizard which lives on <name> vegetable productions .
as i at first observed , these islands are not so remarkable for the number of the species of reptiles , as for that of the individuals , when we remember the <unk> paths made by the thousands of huge tortoises  the many turtles  the great <unk> of the terrestrial <unk>  and the groups of the <name> species basking on the <unk> of every island  we must admit that there is no other quarter of the world where this order replaces the <unk> mammalia in so extraordinary a manner .
the geologist on hearing this <name> probably refer back in his mind to the secondary epochs , when lizards , some <unk> , some carnivorous , and of dimensions comparable only with our existing whales , swarmed on the land and in the sea .
it is , therefore , worthy of his observation that this archipelago , instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation , can not be considered otherwise than extremely arid , and , for an equatorial region , remarkably temperate .
to finish with the zoology : the fifteen kinds of <unk> which i procured here are all new species ; they belong to twelve genera , all widely distributed , with the exception of <unk> , of which the four previously known species live on the eastern side of <name> .
of land-shells i collected sixteen kinds ( and two marked varieties ) of which , with the exception of one helix found at tahiti , all are peculiar to this archipelago : a single fresh-water shell ( <unk> ) is common to tahiti and van diemen 's land .
mr. cuming , before our voyage , procured here ninety species of sea-shells , and this does not include several species not yet specifically examined , of trochus , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
he has been kind enough to give me the following interesting results : of the ninety shells , no less than forty-seven are unknown elsewhere  a wonderful fact , considering how widely distributed sea-shells generally are .
of the forty-three shells found in other parts of the world , twenty-five inhabit the western coast of <name> , and of these eight are distinguishable as varieties ; the remaining eighteen ( including one variety ) were found by mr. cuming in the low archipelago , and some of them also at the philippines .
this fact of shells from islands in the central parts of the pacific occurring here , deserves notice , for not one single <unk> is known to be common to the islands of that ocean and to the west coast of <name> .
the space of open sea running north and south off the west coast separates two quite distinct <unk> provinces ; but at the galapagos archipelago we have a <unk> , where many new forms have been created , and whither these two great <unk> provinces have each sent several colonists .
the american province has also sent here representative species ; for there is a <unk> species of <unk> , a genus only found on the west coast of <name> ; and there are <unk> species of <unk> and <unk> , genera common on the west coast , but not found ( as i am informed by mr. cuming ) in the central islands of the pacific .
on the other hand , there are <unk> species of <unk> and <unk> , genera common to the west indies and to the chinese and indian seas , but not found either on the west coast of <name> or in the central pacific .
i may here add , that after the comparison by messrs. cuming and <unk> of about 2000 shells from the eastern and western coasts of <name> , only one single shell was found in common , namely , the <unk> <unk> , which inhabits the west indies , the coast of panama , and the galapagos .
we have , therefore , in this quarter of the world , three great <unk> <unk> , quite distinct , though surprisingly near each other , being separated by long north and south spaces either of land or of open sea .
i took great pains in collecting the insects , but excepting <name> <name> fuego , i never saw in this respect so poor a country .
even in the upper and damp region i procured very few , excepting some minute diptera and hymenoptera , mostly of common mundane forms .
as before remarked , the insects , for a tropical region , are of very small size and dull colours .
of beetles i collected twenty-five species ( excluding a <unk> and <unk> imported wherever a ship touches ) ; of these , two belong to the <unk> , two to the <unk> , nine to three families of the <unk> , and the remaining twelve to as many different families .
this circumstance of insects ( and i may add plants ) , where few in number , belonging to many different families , is , i believe , very general .
mr. waterhouse , who has published an account of the insects of this archipelago , and to whom i am indebted for the above details , informs me that there are several new genera ; and that of the genera not new , one or two are american , and the rest of mundane distribution .
( <unk> .
" annals and magazine of natural history " volume 16 <name> 19 . )
with the exception of a <unk> <unk> , and of one or probably two <unk> from the american continent , all the species appear to be new .
the botany of this group is fully as interesting as the zoology .
dr. j. hooker <name> soon publish in the " linnean transactions " a full account of the <name> , and i am much indebted to him for the following details .
of flowering plants there are , as far as at present is known , 185 species , and 40 <unk> species , making together 225 ; of this number i was fortunate enough to bring home 193 .
of the flowering plants , 100 are new species , and are probably confined to this archipelago .
dr. hooker <unk> that , of the plants not so confined , at least 10 species found near the cultivated ground at <name> island have been imported .
it is , i think , surprising that more american species have not been introduced naturally , considering that the distance is only between 500 and 600 miles from the continent , and that ( according to <unk> , <name> 58 ) drift-wood , bamboos , canes , and the nuts of a palm , are often washed on the south-eastern shores .
the proportion of 100 flowering plants out of 185 ( or 175 excluding the imported weeds ) being new , is sufficient , i conceive , to make the galapagos archipelago a distinct botanical province ; but this <name> is not nearly so peculiar as that of st. <name> , nor , as i am informed by dr. hooker , of <name> fernandez .
the peculiarity of the <unk> <name> is best shown in certain families ;  thus there are 21 species of compositae , of which 20 are peculiar to this archipelago ; these belong to twelve genera , and of these genera no less than ten are confined to the archipelago !
dr. hooker informs me that the <name> has an undoubted western american character ; nor can he detect in it any affinity with that of the pacific .
if , therefore , we except the eighteen <name> , the one fresh-water , and one <unk> , which have apparently come here as colonists from the central islands of the pacific , and likewise the one distinct pacific species of the <unk> group of finches , we see that this archipelago , though standing in the pacific ocean , is <unk> part of <name> .
if this character were owing merely to immigrants from <name> , there would be little remarkable in it ; but we see that a vast majority of all the land animals , and that more than half of the flowering plants , are aboriginal productions .
it was most striking to be surrounded by new birds , new reptiles , new shells , new insects , new plants , and yet by innumerable trifling details of structure , and even by the tones of voice and plumage of the birds , to have the temperate plains of patagonia , or the hot dry deserts of northern chile , vividly brought before my eyes .
why , on these small points of land , which within a late geological period must have been covered by the ocean , which are formed of basaltic lava , and therefore differ in geological character from the american continent , and which are placed under a peculiar climate ,  why were their aboriginal inhabitants , associated , i may add , in different proportions both in kind and number from those on the continent , and therefore acting on each other in a different manner  why were they created on american types of organisation ?
it is probable that the islands of the cape de verd group resemble , in all their physical conditions , far more closely the galapagos islands than these latter physically resemble the coast of <name> , yet the aboriginal inhabitants of the two groups are totally unlike ; those of the cape de verd islands bearing the impress of africa , as the inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago are stamped with that of <name> .
i have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago ; it is , that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings .
my attention was first called to this fact by the <unk> , mr. lawson , declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands , and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought .
i did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement , and i had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands .
i never dreamed that islands , about 50 or 60 miles apart , and most of them in sight of each other , formed of precisely the same rocks , placed under a quite similar climate , rising to a nearly equal height , would have been differently tenanted ; but we shall soon see that this is the case .
it is the fate of most voyagers , no sooner to discover what is most interesting in any locality , than they are hurried from it ; but i ought , perhaps , to be thankful that i obtained sufficient materials to establish this most remarkable fact in the distribution of organic beings .
the inhabitants , as i have said , state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands ; and that they differ not only in size , but in other characters .
captain <name> has described those from <name> and from the nearest island to it , namely , hood island , as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a spanish saddle , whilst the tortoises from <name> island are <unk> , blacker , and have a better taste when cooked .
( <unk> .
" voyage in the u.s. ship essex " volume 1 <name> 215 . )
m. <unk> , moreover , informs me that he has seen what he considers two distinct species of tortoise from the galapagos , but he does not know from which islands .
the specimens that i brought from three islands were young ones : and probably owing to this cause neither mr. gray nor myself could find in them any specific differences .
i have remarked that the <name> <unk> was larger at albemarle island than elsewhere ; and m. <unk> informs me that he has seen two distinct aquatic species of this genus ; so that the different islands probably have their representative species or races of the <unk> , as well as of the tortoise .
my attention was first thoroughly aroused by comparing together the numerous specimens , shot by myself and several other parties on board , of the <unk> , when , to my astonishment , i discovered that all those from <name> island belonged to one species ( <unk> <unk> ) all from albemarle island to m. <unk> ; and all from <name> and chatham islands ( between which two other islands are situated , as connecting links ) belonged to m. <unk> .
these two latter species are closely allied , and would by some ornithologists be considered as only well-marked races or varieties ; but the <unk> <unk> is very distinct .
unfortunately most of the specimens of the finch tribe were mingled together ; but i have strong reasons to suspect that some of the species of the sub-group <unk> are confined to separate islands .
if the different islands have their representatives of <unk> , it may help to explain the singularly large number of the species of this sub-group in this one small archipelago , and as a probable consequence of their <name> , the perfectly graduated series in the size of their beaks .
two species of the sub-group <unk> , and two of the <unk> , were procured in the archipelago ; and of the numerous specimens of these two sub-groups shot by four collectors at <name> island , all were found to belong to one species of each ; whereas the numerous specimens shot either on chatham or <name> island ( for the two sets were mingled together ) all belonged to the two other species : hence we may feel almost sure that these islands possess their representative species of these two sub-groups .
in land-shells this law of distribution does not appear to hold good .
in my very small collection of insects , mr. waterhouse remarks that of those which were <unk> with their locality , not one was common to any two of the islands .

* ( or 29 , if the probably imported plants be <unk> . )
if we now turn to the <name> , we shall find the aboriginal plants of the different islands wonderfully different .
i give all the following results ( table <unk> ) on the high authority of my friend dr. j. hooker .
i may premise that i indiscriminately collected everything in flower on the different islands , and fortunately kept my collections separate .
too much confidence , however , must not be placed in the proportional results , as the small collections brought home by some other naturalists though in some respects confirming the results , plainly show that much remains to be done in the botany of this group : the leguminosae , moreover , have as yet been only approximately worked out :  hence we have the truly wonderful fact , that in <name> island , of the thirty-eight <unk> plants , or those found in no other part of the world , thirty are exclusively confined to this one island ; and in albemarle island , of the twenty-six aboriginal <unk> plants , twenty-two are confined to this one island , that is , only four are at present known to grow in the other islands of the archipelago ; and so on , as shown in the above table , with the plants from chatham and <name> islands .
this fact <name> , perhaps , be rendered even more striking , by giving a few illustrations :  thus , <unk> , a remarkable <unk> genus of the compositae , is confined to the archipelago : it has six species : one from chatham , one from albemarle , one from <name> island , two from <name> island , and the sixth from one of the three latter islands , but it is not known from which : not one of these six species grows on any two islands .
again , <unk> , a mundane or widely distributed genus , has here eight species , of which seven are confined to the archipelago , and not one found on any two islands : <unk> and <unk> , both mundane genera , have respectively six and seven species , none of which have the same species on two islands , with the exception of one <unk> , which does occur on two islands .
the species of the compositae are particularly local ; and dr. hooker has furnished me with several other most striking illustrations of the difference of the species on the different islands .
he remarks that this law of distribution holds good both with those genera confined to the archipelago , and those distributed in other quarters of the world : in like manner we have seen that the different islands have their proper species of the mundane genus of tortoise , and of the widely distributed american genus of the mocking-thrush , as well as of two of the <unk> sub-groups of finches , and almost certainly of the <unk> genus <unk> .
the distribution of the tenants of this archipelago would not be nearly so wonderful , if , for instance , one island had a mocking-thrush , and a second island some other quite distinct genus ;  if one island had its genus of lizard , and a second island another distinct genus , or none whatever ;  or if the different islands were inhabited , not by representative species of the same genera of plants , but by totally different genera , as does to a certain extent hold good ; for , to give one instance , a large <unk> tree at <name> island has no representative species in <name> island .
but it is the circumstance that several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise , mocking-thrush , finches , and numerous plants , these species having the same general habits , occupying analogous situations , and obviously filling the same place in the natural economy of this archipelago , that strikes me with wonder .
it may be suspected that some of these representative species , at least in the case of the tortoise and of some of the birds , may hereafter prove to be only well-marked races ; but this would be of equally great interest to the philosophical naturalist .
i have said that most of the islands are in sight of each other : i may specify that <name> island is fifty miles from the nearest part of chatham island , and thirty-three miles from the nearest part of albemarle island .
chatham island is sixty miles from the nearest part of <name> island , but there are two intermediate islands between them which were not visited by me .
<name> island is only ten miles from the nearest part of albemarle island , but the two points where the collections were made are thirty-two miles apart .
i must repeat , that neither the nature of the soil , nor height of the land , nor the climate , nor the general character of the associated beings , and therefore their action one on another , can differ much in the different islands .
if there be any sensible difference in their climates , it must be between the windward group ( namely , <name> and chatham islands ) , and that to leeward ; but there seems to be no corresponding difference in the productions of these two halves of the archipelago .
the only light which i can throw on this remarkable difference in the inhabitants of the different islands is that very strong currents of the sea running in a westerly and <unk> direction must separate , as far as transportal by the sea is concerned , the southern islands from the northern ones ; and between these northern islands a strong north-west current was observed , which must effectually separate <name> and albemarle islands .
as the archipelago is free to a most remarkable degree from gales of wind , neither the birds , insects , nor lighter seeds , would be blown from island to island .
and lastly , the profound depth of the ocean between the islands , and their apparently recent ( in a geological sense ) volcanic origin , render it highly unlikely that they were ever united ; and this , probably , is a far more important consideration than any other with respect to the geographical distribution of their inhabitants .
reviewing the facts here given , one is astonished at the amount of creative force , if such an expression may be used , displayed on these small , barren , and <name> islands ; and still more so , at its diverse yet analogous action on points so near each other .
i have said that the galapagos archipelago might be called a satellite attached to <name> , but it should rather be called a group of satellites , physically similar , <unk> distinct , yet intimately related to each other , and all related in a marked though much lesser degree , to the great american continent .
i <name> conclude my description of the natural history of these islands by giving an account of the extreme tameness of the birds .
this disposition is common to all the terrestrial species ; namely , to the <unk> , the finches , <unk> , <unk> , the dove , and <unk> .
all of them often approached sufficiently near to be killed with a switch , and sometimes , as i myself tried , with a cap or hat .
a gun is here almost superfluous ; for with the muzzle i pushed a hawk off the branch of a tree .
one day , whilst lying down , a mocking-thrush alighted on the edge of a pitcher , made of the shell of a tortoise , which i held in my hand , and began very quietly to sip the water ; it allowed me to lift it from the ground whilst seated on the vessel : i often tried , and very nearly succeeded , in catching these birds by their legs .
formerly the birds appear to have been even <unk> than at present .
<unk> ( in the year <unk> ) says that the " <unk> were so tame , that they would often alight on our hats and arms , so as that we could take them alive : they not fearing man , until such time as some of our company did fire at them , whereby they were rendered more shy . "
<unk> also , in the same year , says that a man in a morning 's walk might kill six or seven dozen of these doves .
at present , although certainly very tame , they do not alight on people 's arms , nor do they suffer themselves to be killed in such large <name> .
it is surprising that they have not become wilder ; for these islands during the last hundred and fifty years have been frequently visited by <unk> and whalers ; and the sailors , wandering through the wood in search of tortoises , always take cruel delight in knocking down the little birds .
these birds , although now still more persecuted , do not readily become wild : in <name> island , which had then been <unk> about six years , i saw a boy sitting by a well with a switch in his hand , with which he killed the doves and finches as they came to drink .
he had already procured a little heap of them for his dinner , and he said that he had constantly been in the habit of waiting by this well for the same purpose .
it would appear that the birds of this archipelago , not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous animal than the tortoise or the <unk> , disregard him , in the same manner as in england shy birds , such as magpies , disregard the cows and horses grazing in our fields .
the falkland islands offer a second instance of birds with a similar disposition .
the extraordinary tameness of the little <unk> has been remarked by <unk> , lesson , and other voyagers .
it is not , however , peculiar to that bird : the <unk> , snipe , upland and lowland goose , thrush , bunting , and even some true hawks , are all more or less tame .
as the birds are so tame there , where foxes , hawks , and owls occur , we may infer that the absence of all <unk> animals at the galapagos is not the cause of their tameness here .
the upland geese at the falklands show , by the precaution they take in building on the islets , that they are aware of their danger from the foxes ; but they are not by this rendered wild towards man .
this tameness of the birds , especially of the <unk> , is strongly contrasted with the habits of the same species in <name> <name> fuego , where for ages past they have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants .
in the falklands , the sportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day than he can <name> home ; whereas in <name> <name> fuego it is nearly as difficult to kill one as it is in england to shoot the common wild goose .
in the time of <unk> ( <unk> ) all the birds there appear to have been much <unk> than at present ; he states that the <unk> would almost perch on his finger ; and that with a wand he killed ten in half an hour .
at that period the birds must have been about as tame as they now are at the galapagos .
they appear to have learnt caution more slowly at these latter islands than at the falklands , where they have had proportionate means of experience ; for besides frequent visits from vessels , those islands have been at intervals <unk> during the entire period .
even formerly , when all the birds were so tame , it was impossible by <unk> account to kill the <unk> swan  a bird of passage , which probably brought with it the wisdom learnt in foreign countries .
i may add that , according to du bois , all the birds at bourbon in <unk> , with the exception of the <unk> and geese , were so extremely tame , that they could be caught by the hand , or killed in any number with a stick .
again , at <name> <unk> in the atlantic , <unk> states that the only two land-birds , a thrush and a bunting , were " so tame as to suffer themselves to be caught with a <unk> . "
( <unk> .
" linnean transactions " volume 12 <name> <unk> .
the most anomalous fact on this subject which i have met with is the wildness of the small birds in the arctic parts of north <name> ( as described by richardson " fauna bor . "
volume 2 <name> 332 ) , where they are said never to be persecuted .
this case is the more strange , because it is asserted that some of the same species in their <unk> in the united states are tame .
there is much , as dr. richardson well remarks , utterly inexplicable connected with the different degrees of shyness and care with which birds conceal their nests .
how strange it is that the english <unk> , generally so wild a bird , should very frequently rear its young in <unk> close to houses ! )
from these several facts we may , i think , conclude , first , that the wildness of birds with regard to man is a particular instinct directed against him , and not dependent upon any general degree of caution arising from other sources of danger ; secondly , that it is not acquired by individual birds in a short time , even when much persecuted ; but that in the course of successive generations it becomes hereditary .
with domesticated animals we are accustomed to see new mental habits or instincts acquired and rendered hereditary ; but with animals in a state of nature it must always be most difficult to discover instances of acquired hereditary knowledge .
in regard to the wildness of birds towards man , there is no way of accounting for it , except as an inherited habit : comparatively few young birds , in any one year , have been injured by man in england , yet almost all , even nestlings , are afraid of him ; many individuals , on the other hand , both at the galapagos and at the falklands , have been pursued and injured by man , but yet have not learned a salutary dread of him .
we may infer from these facts , what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must cause in a country , before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants have become adapted to the <unk> craft or power .

the survey of the galapagos archipelago being concluded , we steered towards tahiti and commenced our long passage of <unk> miles .
in the course of a few days we sailed out of the gloomy and clouded <unk> which extends during the <name> far from the coast of south <name> .
we then enjoyed bright and clear weather , while running pleasantly along at the rate of 150 or 160 miles a day before the steady trade-wind .
the temperature in this more central part of the pacific is higher than near the american shore .
the thermometer in the poop cabin , by night and day , ranged between 80 and 83 degrees , which feels very pleasant ; but with one degree or two higher , the heat becomes oppressive .
we passed through the low or dangerous archipelago , and saw several of those most curious rings of <name> land , just rising above the water 's edge , which have been called lagoon islands .
a long and <unk> beach is capped by a margin of green vegetation ; and the strip , looking either way , rapidly narrows away in the distance , and sinks beneath the horizon .
from the <unk> a wide expanse of smooth water can be seen within the ring .
these low hollow <name> islands bear no proportion to the vast ocean out of which they abruptly rise ; and it seems wonderful that such weak invaders are not overwhelmed by the all-powerful and <unk> waves of that great sea , <unk> the pacific .
november 15 , 1835 .
at daylight , tahiti , an island which must for ever remain classical to the voyager in the south sea , was in view .
at a distance the appearance was not attractive .
the luxuriant vegetation of the lower part could not yet be seen , and as the clouds rolled past , the wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards the centre of the island .
as soon as we anchored in <unk> bay , we were surrounded by canoes .
this was our <name> , but the monday of tahiti : if the case had been reversed , we should not have received a single visit ; for the injunction not to launch a canoe on the sabbath is rigidly obeyed .
after dinner we landed to enjoy all the delights produced by the first impressions of a new country , and that country the charming tahiti .
a crowd of men , women , and children , was collected on the memorable point <name> , ready to receive us with laughing , <name> faces .
they <unk> us towards the house of mr. <name> , the missionary of the district , who met us on the road , and gave us a very friendly reception .
after sitting a short time in his house , we separated to walk about , but returned there in the evening .
the land capable of cultivation is scarcely in any part more than a fringe of low alluvial soil , accumulated round the base of the mountains , and protected from the waves of the sea by a <name> reef , which <unk> the entire line of coast .
within the reef there is an expanse of smooth water , like that of a lake , where the canoes of the natives can ply with safety and where ships anchor .
the low land which comes down to the beach of <unk> is covered by the most beautiful productions of the intertropical regions .
in the midst of bananas , orange , cocoa-nut , and <unk> trees , spots are cleared where <unk> , sweet potatoes , the sugar-cane , and <unk> are cultivated .
even the brushwood is an imported <unk> , namely , the <unk> , which from its abundance has become as <unk> as a weed .
in brazil i have often admired the varied beauty of the bananas , palms , and <unk> contrasted together ; and here we also have the <unk> , conspicuous from its large , glossy , and deeply <unk> leaf .
it is admirable to behold groves of a tree , sending forth its branches with the vigour of an english oak , loaded with large and most nutritious fruit .
however seldom the usefulness of an object can account for the pleasure of beholding it , in the case of these beautiful woods , the knowledge of their high productiveness no doubt enters largely into the feeling of admiration .
the little winding paths , cool from the surrounding shade , led to the scattered houses ; the owners of which everywhere gave us a cheerful and most hospitable reception .
i was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants .
there is a <unk> in the expression of their countenances which at once <unk> the idea of a savage ; and an intelligence which shows that they are advancing in civilisation .
the common people , when working , keep the upper part of their bodies quite naked ; and it is then that the tahitians are seen to advantage .
they are very tall , broad-shouldered , athletic , and <unk> .
it has been remarked that it requires little habit to make a dark skin more pleasing and natural to the eye of a european than his own colour .
a white man bathing by the side of a <unk> was like a plant bleached by the gardener 's <name> compared with a fine dark green one growing vigorously in the open fields .
most of the men are tattooed , and the ornaments follow the curvature of the body so gracefully that they have a very elegant effect .
one common pattern , varying in its details , is somewhat like the crown of a <unk> .
it springs from the central line of the back , and gracefully curls round both sides .
the simile may be a fanciful one , but i thought the body of a man thus ornamented was like the trunk of a <name> tree embraced by a delicate creeper .
many of the elder people had their feet covered with small figures , so placed as to resemble a sock .
this fashion , however , is partly gone by , and has been succeeded by others .
here , although fashion is far from immutable , every one must abide by that prevailing in his youth .
an old man has thus his age for ever stamped on his body , and he can not assume the airs of a young dandy .
the women are tattooed in the same manner as the men , and very commonly on their fingers .
one unbecoming fashion is now almost universal : namely , shaving the hair from the upper part of the head , in a circular form , so as to leave only an outer ring .
the missionaries have tried to persuade the people to change this habit ; but it is the fashion , and that is a sufficient answer at tahiti , as well as at <name> .
i was much disappointed in the personal appearance of the women : they are far inferior in every respect to the men .
the custom of wearing a white or <name> flower in the back of the head , or through a small hole in each ear , is pretty .
a crown of woven cocoa-nut leaves is also worn as a shade for the eyes .
the women appear to be in greater want of some becoming costume even than the men .
nearly all the natives understand a little english  that is , they know the names of common things ; and by the aid of this , together with signs , a lame sort of conversation could be carried on .
in returning in the evening to the boat , we stopped to witness a very pretty scene .
<name> of children were playing on the beach , and had lighted bonfires which illumined the placid sea and surrounding trees ; others , in circles , were singing <unk> verses .
we seated ourselves on the sand , and joined their party .
the songs were impromptu , and i believe related to our arrival : one little girl sang a line , which the rest took up in parts , forming a very pretty chorus .
the whole scene made us unequivocally aware that we were seated on the shores of an island in the <unk> south sea .
november 17 , 1835 .
this day is reckoned in the <unk> as tuesday the 17th , instead of monday the 16th , owing to our , so far , successful <name> of the sun .
before breakfast the ship was hemmed in by a flotilla of canoes ; and when the natives were allowed to come on board , i suppose there could not have been less than two hundred .
it was the opinion of every one that it would have been difficult to have picked out an equal number from any other nation , who would have given so little trouble .
everybody brought something for sale : shells were the main article of trade .
the tahitians now fully understand the value of money , and prefer it to old clothes or other articles .
the various coins , however , of english and spanish denomination puzzle them , and they never seemed to think the small silver quite secure until changed into dollars .
some of the chiefs have accumulated considerable sums of money .
one chief , not long since , offered 800 dollars ( about 160 pounds <name> ) for a small vessel ; and frequently they purchase whale-boats and horses at the rate of from 50 to 100 dollars .
after breakfast i went on shore , and ascended the nearest slope to a height of between two and three thousand feet .
the outer mountains are smooth and conical , but steep ; and the old volcanic rocks , of which they are formed , have been cut through by many profound ravines , diverging from the central broken parts of the island to the coast .
having crossed the narrow low girt of inhabited and fertile land , i followed a smooth steep ridge between two of the deep ravines .
the vegetation was singular , consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf ferns , mingled , higher up , with coarse grass ; it was not very dissimilar from that on some of the welsh hills , and this so close above the orchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising .
at the highest point which i reached trees again appeared .
of the three zones of comparative luxuriance , the lower one owes its moisture , and therefore fertility , to its flatness ; for , being scarcely raised above the level of the sea , the water from the higher land drains away slowly .
the intermediate zone does not , like the upper one , reach into a damp and cloudy atmosphere , and therefore remains sterile .
the woods in the upper zone are very pretty , <unk> replacing the <unk> on the coast .
it must not , however , be supposed that these woods at all equal in splendour the forests of brazil .
the vast number of productions , which characterise a continent , can not be expected to occur in an island .
( plate 85 .
<unk> and barrier-reef . )
from the highest point which i attained there was a good view of the distant island of <unk> , dependent on the same sovereign with tahiti .
on the lofty and broken pinnacles white massive clouds were piled up , which formed an island in the blue sky , as <unk> itself did in the blue ocean .
the island , with the exception of one small gateway , is completely encircled by a reef .
at this distance , a narrow but well-defined brilliantly white line was alone visible , where the waves first encountered the wall of <name> .
the mountains rose abruptly out of the glassy expanse of the lagoon , included within this narrow white line , outside which the heaving waters of the ocean were dark-coloured .
the view was striking : it may aptly be compared to a framed engraving , where the frame represents the breakers , the marginal paper the smooth lagoon , and the drawing the island itself .
when in the evening i descended from the mountain , a man , whom i had pleased with a trifling gift , met me , bringing with him hot roasted bananas , a <unk> , and <unk> .
after walking under a burning sun , i do not know anything more delicious than the milk of a young cocoa-nut .
<unk> are here so abundant that the people eat them in the same wasteful manner as we might turnips .
they are of an excellent flavour  perhaps even better than those cultivated in england ; and this i believe is the highest compliment which can be paid to any fruit .
before going on board , mr. <name> interpreted for me to the <unk> who had paid me so adroit an attention , that i wanted him and another man to accompany me on a short excursion into the mountains .
november 18 , 1835 .
in the morning i came on shore early , bringing with me some provisions in a bag , and two blankets for myself and servant .
these were lashed to each end of a long pole , which was alternately carried by my <unk> companions on their shoulders .
these men are accustomed thus to <name> , for a whole day , as much as fifty pounds at each end of their poles .
i told my guides to provide themselves with food and clothing ; but they said that there was plenty of food in the mountains , and for clothing , that their skins were sufficient .
our line of march was the valley of <unk> , down which a river flows into the sea by point <name> .
this is one of the principal streams in the island , and its source lies at the base of the loftiest central pinnacles , which rise to a height of about <unk> feet .
the whole island is so mountainous that the only way to penetrate into the interior is to follow up the valleys .
our road , at first , lay through woods which bordered each side of the river ; and the glimpses of the lofty central peaks , seen as through an avenue , with here and there a waving cocoa-nut tree on one side , were extremely picturesque .
the valley soon began to narrow , and the sides to grow lofty and more precipitous .
after having walked between three and four hours , we found the width of the ravine scarcely exceeded that of the bed of the stream .
on each hand the walls were nearly vertical ; yet from the soft nature of the volcanic strata , trees and a rank vegetation sprung from every projecting ledge .
these precipices must have been some thousand feet high ; and the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than anything which i had ever before beheld .
until the mid-day sun stood vertically over the ravine , the air felt cool and damp , but now it became very sultry .
shaded by a ledge of rock , beneath a facade of columnar lava , we ate our dinner .
my guides had already procured a dish of small fish and fresh-water <unk> .
they carried with them a small net stretched on a hoop ; and where the water was deep and in eddies , they dived , and like <unk> , with their eyes open followed the fish into holes and corners , and thus caught them .
the tahitians have the dexterity of <unk> animals in the water .
an anecdote mentioned by <name> shows how much they feel at home in this element .
when a horse was landing for <unk> in 1817 , the slings broke , and it fell into the water ; immediately the natives jumped overboard , and by their cries and vain efforts at assistance almost drowned it .
as soon , however , as it reached the shore , the whole population took to flight , and tried to hide themselves from the <unk> pig , as they christened the horse .
a little higher up , the river divided itself into three little streams .
the two northern ones were impracticable , owing to a succession of waterfalls which descended from the jagged summit of the highest mountain ; the other to all appearance was equally inaccessible , but we managed to ascend it by a most extraordinary road .
the sides of the valley were here nearly precipitous ; but , as frequently happens with stratified rocks , small ledges projected , which were thickly covered by wild bananas , <unk> plants , and other luxuriant productions of the tropics .
the tahitians , by climbing amongst these ledges , searching for fruit , had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be scaled .
the first ascent from the valley was very dangerous ; for it was necessary to pass a steeply inclined face of naked rock by the aid of ropes which we brought with us .
how any person discovered that this formidable spot was the only point where the side of the mountain was practicable , i can not imagine .
we then cautiously walked along one of the ledges till we came to one of the three streams .
this ledge formed a flat spot above which a beautiful cascade , some hundred feet in height , poured down its waters , and beneath , another high cascade fell into the main stream in the valley below .
from this cool and shady recess we made a circuit to avoid the overhanging waterfall .
as before , we followed little projecting ledges , the danger being partly concealed by the thickness of the vegetation .
in passing from one of the ledges to another there was a vertical wall of rock .
one of the tahitians , a fine active man , placed the trunk of a tree against this , climbed up it , and then by the aid of crevices reached the summit .
he fixed the ropes to a projecting point , and lowered them for our dog and luggage , and then we clambered up ourselves .
beneath the ledge on which the dead tree was placed , the precipice must have been five or six hundred feet deep ; and if the abyss had not been partly concealed by the overhanging ferns and lilies my head would have turned giddy , and nothing should have induced me to have attempted it .
we continued to ascend , sometimes along ledges , and sometimes along <unk> ridges , having on each hand profound ravines .
in the cordillera i have seen mountains on a far grander scale , but for abruptness nothing at all comparable with this .
in the evening we reached a flat little spot on the banks of the same stream which we had continued to follow , and which descends in a chain of waterfalls : here we <unk> for the night .
on each side of the ravine there were great beds of the <unk> , covered with ripe fruit .
many of these plants were from twenty to twenty-five feet high , and from three to four in circumference .
by the aid of strips of bark for rope , the stems of bamboos for rafters , and the large leaf of the banana for a thatch , the tahitians in a few minutes built us an excellent house ; and with withered leaves made a soft bed .
( plate 86 .
<unk> fall , tahiti . )
( plate 87 .
<unk> . )
they then proceeded to make a fire , and cook our evening meal .
a light was procured by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove made in another , as if with intention of deepening it , until by the friction the dust became ignited .
a peculiarly white and very light wood ( the hibiscus <unk> ) is alone used for this purpose : it is the same which serves for poles to <name> any burden , and for the floating <unk> to their canoes .
the fire was produced in a few seconds : but to a person who does not understand the <name> , it requires , as i found , the greatest exertion ; but at last , to my great pride , i succeeded in <unk> the dust .
the gaucho in the pampas uses a different method : taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long , he presses one end on his breast , and the other pointed end into a hole in a piece of wood , and then rapidly turns the curved part like a carpenter 's <unk> .
the tahitians having made a small fire of sticks , placed a score of stones of about the size of <unk> , on the burning wood .
in about ten minutes the sticks were consumed , and the stones hot .
they had previously folded up in small parcels of leaves , pieces of beef , fish , ripe and <unk> bananas , and the tops of the wild <unk> .
these green parcels were laid in a layer between two layers of the hot stones , and the whole then covered up with earth , so that no smoke or steam could escape .
in about a quarter of an hour the whole was most deliciously cooked .
the choice green parcels were now laid on a cloth of banana leaves , and with a cocoa-nut shell we drank the cool water of the running stream ; and thus we enjoyed our rustic meal .
i could not look on the surrounding plants without admiration .
on every side were forests of bananas ; the fruit of which , though serving for food in various ways , lay in heaps decaying on the ground .
in front of us there was an extensive brake of wild sugar-cane ; and the stream was shaded by the dark green knotted stem of the <name> ,  so famous in former days for its powerful intoxicating effects .
i chewed a piece , and found that it had an acrid and unpleasant taste , which would have induced any one at once to have pronounced it poisonous .
thanks to the missionaries , this plant now <unk> only in these deep ravines , innocuous to every one .
close by i saw the wild <unk> , the roots of which , when well baked , are good to eat , and the young leaves better than <unk> .
there was the wild <unk> , and a <unk> plant called <unk> , which grows in abundance , and has a soft brown root , in shape and size like a huge log of wood : this served us for dessert , for it is as sweet as <unk> , and with a pleasant taste .
there were , moreover , several other wild fruits , and useful vegetables .
the little stream , besides its cool water , produced eels and <unk> .
i did indeed admire this scene , when i compared it with an uncultivated one in the temperate zones .
i felt the force of the remark that man , at least savage man , with his reasoning powers only partly developed , is the child of the tropics .
as the evening <name> to a close , i strolled beneath the gloomy shade of the bananas up the course of the stream .
my walk was soon brought to a close by coming to a waterfall between two and three hundred feet high ; and again above this there was another .
i mention all these waterfalls in this one <name> to give a general idea of the inclination of the land .
in the little recess where the water fell , it did not appear that a breath of wind had ever blown .
the thin edges of the great leaves of the banana , damp with spray , were unbroken , instead of being , as is so generally the case , split into a thousand shreds .
from our position , almost suspended on the mountain-side , there were glimpses into the depths of the neighbouring valleys ; and the lofty points of the central mountains , towering up within sixty degrees of the zenith , hid half the evening sky .
thus seated , it was a sublime spectacle to watch the shades of night gradually <unk> the last and highest pinnacles .
before we laid ourselves down to sleep , the elder <unk> fell on his knees , and with closed eyes repeated a long prayer in his native tongue .
he prayed as a <name> should do , with fitting reverence , and without the fear of ridicule or any ostentation of piety .
at our meals neither of the men would taste food , without saying beforehand a short <name> .
those travellers who think that a <unk> prays only when the eyes of the missionary are fixed on him , should have slept with us that night on the mountain-side .
before morning it rained very heavily ; but the good thatch of <unk> kept us dry .
november 19 , 1835 .
at daylight my friends , after their morning prayer , prepared an excellent breakfast in the same manner as in the evening .
they themselves certainly partook of it largely ; indeed i never saw any men eat near so much .
i suppose such enormously capacious stomachs must be the effect of a large part of their diet consisting of fruit and vegetables which contain , in a given bulk , a comparatively small portion of nutriment .
unwittingly , i was the means of my companions breaking , as i afterwards learned , one of their own laws and resolutions : i took with me a flask of spirits , which they could not refuse to partake of ; but as often as they drank a little , they put their fingers before their mouths , and uttered the word " missionary . "
about two years ago , although the use of the <name> was prevented , drunkenness from the introduction of spirits became very prevalent .
the missionaries prevailed on a few good men who saw that their country was rapidly going to ruin , to join with them in a temperance society .
from good sense or shame , all the chiefs and the <name> were at last persuaded to join .
immediately a law was passed that no spirits should be allowed to be introduced into the island , and that he who sold and he who bought the forbidden article should be punished by a fine .
with remarkable justice , a certain period was allowed for stock in hand to be sold , before the law came into effect .
but when it did , a general search was made , in which even the houses of the missionaries were not <unk> , and all the <name> ( as the natives call all ardent spirits ) was poured on the ground .
when one reflects on the effect of intemperance on the aborigines of the two <unk> , i think it <name> be acknowledged that every <unk> of tahiti owes no common debt of gratitude to the missionaries .
as long as the little island of st. <name> remained under the government of the east <name> company , spirits , owing to the great injury they had produced , were not allowed to be imported ; but wine was supplied from the cape of good <name> .
it is rather a striking , and not very gratifying fact , that in the same year that spirits were allowed to be sold in st. <name> , their use was banished from tahiti by the free <name> of the people .
after breakfast we proceeded on our journey .
as my object was merely to see a little of the interior scenery , we returned by another track , which descended into the main valley lower down .
for some distance we wound , by a most intricate path , along the side of the mountain which formed the valley .
in the less precipitous parts we passed through extensive groves of the wild banana .
the tahitians , with their naked , tattooed bodies , their heads ornamented with flowers , and seen in the dark shade of these groves , would have formed a fine picture of man inhabiting some primeval land .
in our descent we followed the line of ridges ; these were exceedingly narrow , and for considerable lengths steep as a ladder ; but all clothed with vegetation .
the extreme care necessary in <unk> each step rendered the walk fatiguing .
i did not cease to wonder at these ravines and precipices : when viewing the country from one of the <unk> ridges , the point of support was so small that the effect was nearly the same as it must be from a balloon .
in this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once , at the point where we entered the main valley .
we slept under the same ledge of rock where we had dined the day before : the night was fine , but from the depth and narrowness of the gorge , profoundly dark .
before actually seeing this country , i found it difficult to understand two facts mentioned by <name> ; namely , that after the murderous battles of former times , the survivors on the conquered side retired into the mountains , where a handful of men could resist a multitude .
certainly half a dozen men , at the spot where the <unk> reared the old tree , could easily have repulsed thousands .
secondly , that after the introduction of christianity , there were wild men who lived in the mountains , and whose retreats were unknown to the more civilised inhabitants .
november 20 , 1835 .
in the morning we started early , and reached <unk> at noon .
on the road we met a large party of <name> athletic men , going for wild bananas .
i found that the ship , on account of the difficulty in watering , had moved to the harbour of <unk> , to which place i immediately walked .
this is a very pretty spot .
the cove is surrounded by reefs , and the water as smooth as in a lake .
the cultivated ground , with its beautiful productions , interspersed with cottages , comes close down to the water 's edge .
from the varying accounts which i had read before reaching these islands , i was very anxious to form , from my own observation , a judgment of their moral state ,  although such judgment would necessarily be very imperfect .
first impressions at all times very much depend on one 's previously acquired ideas .
my notions were drawn from <name> 's " polynesian researches "  an admirable and most interesting work , but naturally looking at everything under a favourable point of view , from beechey 's " voyage ; " and from that of kotzebue , which is strongly adverse to the whole missionary system .
he who compares these three accounts <name> , i think , form a tolerably accurate <name> of the present state of tahiti .
one of my impressions , which i took from the two last authorities , was decidedly incorrect ; namely , that the tahitians had become a gloomy race , and lived in fear of the missionaries .
of the latter feeling i saw no trace , unless , indeed , fear and respect be confounded under one name .
instead of discontent being a common feeling , it would be difficult in europe to pick out of a crowd half so many <name> and happy faces .
the prohibition of the flute and dancing is <unk> against as wrong and foolish ;  the more than presbyterian manner of keeping the sabbath is looked at in a similar light .
on these points i <name> not pretend to offer any opinion , in opposition to men who have resided as many years as i was days on the island .
on the whole , it appears to me that the morality and religion of the inhabitants are highly creditable .
there are many who attack , even more <unk> than kotzebue , both the missionaries , their system , and the effects produced by it .
such <unk> never compare the present state with that of the island only twenty years ago ; nor even with that of europe at this day ; but they compare it with the high standard of gospel perfection .
they expect the missionaries to effect that which the apostles themselves failed to do .
inasmuch as the condition of the people falls short of this high standard , blame is attached to the missionary , instead of credit for that which he has effected .
they forget , or <name> not remember , that human sacrifices , and the power of an idolatrous <unk>  a system of profligacy unparalleled in any other part of the world  infanticide a consequence of that system  bloody wars , where the conquerors spared neither women nor children  that all these have been abolished ; and that <unk> , intemperance , and licentiousness have been greatly reduced by the introduction of christianity .
in a voyager to forget these things is base ingratitude ; for should he chance to be at the point of shipwreck on some unknown coast , he <name> most devoutly pray that the lesson of the missionary may have extended thus far .
in point of morality , the virtue of the women , it has been often said , is most open to exception .
but before they are blamed too severely , it <name> be well distinctly to call to mind the scenes described by captain cook and mr. banks , in which the <unk> and mothers of the present race played a part .
those who are most severe , should consider how much of the morality of the women in europe is owing to the system early impressed by mothers on their daughters , and how much in each individual case to the precepts of religion .
but it is useless to argue against such <unk> ;  i believe that , disappointed in not finding the field of licentiousness quite so open as formerly , they <name> not give credit to a morality which they do not wish to practise , or to a religion which they <unk> , if not despise .
<name> , november 22 , 1835 .
the harbour of <unk> , where the <name> resides , may be considered as the capital of the island : it is also the seat of government , and the chief resort of shipping .
captain fitz <name> took a party there this day to hear divine service , first in the <unk> language , and afterwards in our own .
mr. pritchard , the leading missionary in the island , performed the service .
the chapel consisted of a large airy framework of wood ; and it was filled to excess by tidy , clean people , of all ages and both sexes .
i was rather disappointed in the apparent degree of attention ; but i believe my expectations were raised too high .
at all events the appearance was quite equal to that in a country church in england .
the singing of the hymns was decidedly very pleasing , but the language from the pulpit , although fluently delivered , did not sound well : a constant repetition of words , like " <unk> <name> , <unk> <name> , " rendered it monotonous .
after english service , a party returned on foot to <unk> .
it was a pleasant walk , sometimes along the sea-beach and sometimes under the shade of the many beautiful trees .
about two years ago , a small vessel under english colours was plundered by some of the inhabitants of the low islands , which were then under the dominion of the <name> of tahiti .
it was believed that the <unk> were <unk> to this act by some indiscreet laws issued by her majesty .
the british government demanded compensation ; which was acceded to , and a sum of nearly three thousand dollars was agreed to be paid on the first of last <name> .
the commodore at lima ordered captain fitz <name> to inquire concerning this debt , and to demand satisfaction if it were not paid .
captain fitz <name> accordingly requested an interview with the <name> <unk> , since famous from the <unk> she has received from the french ; and a parliament was held to consider the question , at which all the principal chiefs of the island and the <name> were assembled .
i <name> not attempt to describe what took place , after the interesting account given by captain fitz <name> .
the money , it appeared , had not been paid ; perhaps the alleged reasons were rather equivocal ; but otherwise i can not sufficiently express our general surprise at the extreme good sense , the reasoning powers , moderation , <unk> , and prompt resolution , which were displayed on all sides .
i believe we all left the meeting with a very different opinion of the tahitians from what we entertained when we entered .
the chiefs and people resolved to subscribe and complete the sum which was wanting ; captain fitz <name> urged that it was hard that their private property should be sacrificed for the crimes of distant islanders .
they replied that they were grateful for his consideration , but that <unk> was their <name> , and that they were determined to help her in this her difficulty .
this resolution and its prompt execution , for a book was opened early the next morning , made a perfect conclusion to this very remarkable scene of loyalty and good feeling .
after the main discussion was ended , several of the chiefs took the opportunity of asking captain fitz <name> many intelligent questions on international customs and laws , relating to the treatment of ships and foreigners .
on some points , as soon as the decision was made , the law was issued <unk> on the spot .
this <unk> parliament lasted for several hours ; and when it was over captain fitz <name> invited <name> <unk> to pay the " beagle " a visit .
november 25 , 1835 .
in the evening four boats were sent for her majesty ; the ship was dressed with flags , and the yards manned on her coming on board .
she was accompanied by most of the chiefs .
the behaviour of all was very proper : they begged for nothing , and seemed much pleased with captain fitz <name> 's presents .
the <name> is a large awkward woman , without any beauty , <name> or dignity .
she has only one <name> attribute : a perfect <unk> of expression under all circumstances , and that rather a sullen one .
the rockets were most admired , and a deep " oh ! "
could be heard from the shore , all round the dark bay , after each explosion .
the sailors ' songs were also much admired ; and the <name> said she thought that one of the most boisterous ones certainly could not be a hymn !
the <name> party did not return on shore till past midnight .
november 26 , 1835 .
in the evening , with a gentle <unk> , a course was steered for new zealand ; and as the sun set , we had a farewell view of the mountains of tahiti  the island to which every voyager has offered up his tribute of admiration .
december 19 , 1835 .
in the evening we saw in the distance new zealand .
we may now consider that we have nearly crossed the pacific .
it is necessary to sail over this great ocean to comprehend its immensity .
moving quickly onwards for weeks together , we meet with nothing but the same blue , profoundly deep , ocean .
even within the archipelagoes , the islands are mere specks , and far distant one from the other .
accustomed to look at maps drawn on a small scale , where dots , shading , and names are crowded together , we do not rightly judge how infinitely small the proportion of dry land is to the water of this vast expanse .
the meridian of the <unk> has likewise been passed ; and now every league , it made us happy to think , was one league nearer to england .
these <unk> call to one 's mind old recollections of childish doubt and wonder .
only the other day i looked forward to this airy barrier as a definite point in our voyage <unk> ; but now i find it , and all such <unk> for the imagination , are like shadows , which a man moving onwards can not catch .
a <name> of wind lasting for some days has lately given us full leisure to measure the future stages in our homeward voyage , and to wish most earnestly for its termination .
december 21 , 1835 .
early in the morning we entered the bay of islands , and being <unk> for some hours near the mouth , we did not reach the anchorage till the middle of the day .
the country is hilly , with a smooth outline , and is deeply intersected by numerous arms of the sea extending from the bay .
the surface appears from a distance as if clothed with coarse pasture , but this in truth is nothing but <name> .
on the more distant hills , as well as in parts of the valleys , there is a good deal of woodland .
the general tint of the landscape is not a bright green ; and it resembles the country a short distance to the south of <name> in chile .
in several parts of the bay little villages of square <unk> houses are scattered close down to the water 's edge .
three <unk> were lying at anchor , and a canoe every now and then crossed from shore to shore ; with these exceptions , an air of extreme quietness reigned over the whole district .
only a single canoe came alongside .
this , and the aspect of the whole scene , afforded a remarkable , and not very pleasing contrast , with our joyful and boisterous welcome at tahiti .
in the afternoon we went on shore to one of the larger groups of houses , which yet hardly deserves the title of a village .
its name is <unk> : it is the residence of the missionaries ; and there are no native residents except servants and labourers .
in the vicinity of the bay of islands the number of englishmen , including their families , amounts to between two and three hundred .
all the cottages , many of which are whitewashed and look very neat , are the property of the english .
the hovels of the natives are so diminutive and paltry that they can scarcely be perceived from a distance .
at <unk> it was quite pleasing to behold the english flowers in the gardens before the houses ; there were roses of several kinds , honeysuckle , <name> , stocks , and whole hedges of <unk> .
december 22 , 1835 .
in the morning i went out walking ; but i soon found that the country was very impracticable .
all the hills are thickly covered with tall <name> , together with a low bush which grows like a cypress ; and very little ground has been cleared or cultivated .
i then tried the sea-beach ; but proceeding towards either hand , my walk was soon stopped by salt-water creeks and deep <name> .
the communication between the inhabitants of the different parts of the bay is ( as in chiloe ) almost entirely kept up by boats .
i was surprised to find that almost every hill which i ascended had been at some former time more or less fortified .
the summits were cut into steps or successive terraces , and frequently they had been protected by deep trenches .
i afterwards observed that the principal hills inland in like manner showed an artificial outline .
these are the pas , so frequently mentioned by captain cook under the name of " <unk> ; " the difference of sound being owing to the <unk> article .
that the pas had formerly been much used was evident from the piles of shells , and the pits in which , as i was informed , sweet potatoes used to be kept as a reserve .
as there was no water on these hills , the defenders could never have anticipated a long siege , but only a hurried attack for plunder , against which the successive terraces would have afforded good protection .
the general introduction of firearms has changed the whole system of warfare ; and an exposed situation on the top of a hill is now worse than useless .
the pas in consequence are , at the present day , always built on a level piece of ground .
they consist of a double stockade of thick and tall posts , placed in a zigzag line , so that every part can be flanked .
within the stockade a mound of earth is thrown up , behind which the defenders can rest in safety , or use their firearms over it .
on the level of the ground little <unk> sometimes pass through this <unk> , by which means the defenders can crawl out to the stockade and reconnoitre their enemies .
the reverend w. <name> , who gave me this account , added that in one pas he had noticed spurs or buttresses projecting on the inner and protected side of the mound of earth .
on asking the chief the use of them , he replied , that if two or three of his men were shot their neighbours would not see the bodies , and so be discouraged .
these pas are considered by the new zealanders as very perfect means of defence : for the attacking force is never so well disciplined as to rush in a body to the stockade , cut it down , and effect their entry .
when a tribe goes to war , the chief can not order one party to go here and another there ; but every man fights in the manner which best pleases himself ; and to each separate individual to approach a stockade defended by firearms must appear certain death .
i should think a more warlike race of inhabitants could not be found in any part of the world than the new zealanders .
their conduct on first seeing a ship , as described by captain cook , strongly illustrates this : the act of throwing volleys of stones at so great and novel an object , and their defiance of " come on shore and we <name> kill and eat you all , " shows uncommon boldness .
this warlike spirit is evident in many of their customs , and even in their smallest actions .
if a new <unk> is struck , although but in joke , the blow must be returned ; and of this i saw an instance with one of our officers .
at the present day , from the progress of civilisation , there is much less warfare , except among some of the southern tribes .
i heard a characteristic anecdote of what took place some time ago in the south .
a missionary found a chief and his tribe in preparation for war ;  their muskets clean and bright , and their ammunition ready .
he reasoned long on the <unk> of the war , and the little provocation which had been given for it .
the chief was much shaken in his resolution , and seemed in doubt : but at length it occurred to him that a barrel of his gunpowder was in a bad state , and that it would not keep much longer .
this was brought forward as an unanswerable argument for the necessity of immediately declaring war : the idea of allowing so much good gunpowder to spoil was not to be thought of ; and this settled the point .
i was told by the missionaries that in the life of <unk> , the chief who visited england , the love of war was the one and lasting spring of every action .
the tribe in which he was a principal chief had at one time been much oppressed by another tribe from the thames river .
a solemn oath was taken by the men that when their boys should grow up , and they should be powerful enough , they would never forget or forgive these injuries .
to fulfil this oath appears to have been <unk> 's chief motive for going to england ; and when there it was his sole object .
presents were valued only as they could be converted into arms ; of the arts , those alone interested him which were connected with the manufacture of arms .
when at <name> , <unk> , by a strange coincidence , met the hostile chief of the thames river at the house of mr. <unk> : their conduct was civil to each other ; but <unk> told him that when again in new zealand he would never cease to <name> war into his country .
the challenge was accepted ; and <unk> on his return fulfilled the threat to the utmost letter .
the tribe on the thames river was utterly overthrown , and the chief to whom the challenge had been given was himself killed .
<unk> , although <unk> such deep feelings of hatred and revenge , is described as having been a good-natured person .
in the evening i went with captain fitz <name> and mr. baker , one of the missionaries , to pay a visit to <unk> : we wandered about the village , and saw and conversed with many of the people , both men , women , and children .
looking at the new <unk> , one naturally compares him with the <unk> ; both belonging to the same family of mankind .
the comparison , however , tells heavily against the new <unk> .
he may , perhaps be superior in energy , but in every other respect his character is of a much lower order .
one glance at their respective expressions brings conviction to the mind that one is a savage , the other a civilised man .
it would be vain to seek in the whole of new zealand a person with the face and mien of the old <unk> chief <unk> .
no doubt the extraordinary manner in which tattooing is here practised gives a disagreeable expression to their countenances .
the complicated but symmetrical figures covering the whole face puzzle and mislead an unaccustomed eye : it is moreover probable that the deep <unk> , by destroying the play of the superficial muscles , give an air of rigid <unk> .
but , besides this , there is a twinkling in the eye which can not indicate anything but cunning and ferocity .
their figures are tall and bulky ; but not comparable in elegance with those of the <unk> in tahiti .
both their persons and houses are <unk> dirty and offensive : the idea of washing either their bodies or their clothes never seems to enter their heads .
i saw a chief , who was wearing a shirt black and matted with filth , and when asked how it came to be so dirty , he replied , with surprise , " do not you see it is an old one ? "
some of the men have shirts ; but the common dress is one or two large blankets , generally black with dirt , which are thrown over their shoulders in a very inconvenient and awkward fashion .
a few of the principal chiefs have decent suits of english clothes ; but these are only worn on great occasions .
december 23 , 1835 .
at a place called <unk> , about fifteen miles from the bay of islands , and midway between the eastern and western coasts , the missionaries have purchased some land for agricultural purposes .
i had been introduced to the reverend w. <name> , who , upon my expressing a wish , invited me to pay him a visit there .
mr. <unk> , the british resident , offered to take me in his boat by a creek , where i should see a pretty waterfall , and by which means my walk would be shortened .
he likewise procured for me a guide .
upon asking a neighbouring chief to recommend a man , the chief himself offered to go ; but his ignorance of the value of money was so complete , that at first he asked how many pounds i would give him , but afterwards was well contented with two dollars .
when i showed the chief a very small bundle which i wanted carried , it became absolutely necessary for him to take a slave .
these feelings of pride are beginning to wear away ; but formerly a leading man would sooner have died than undergone the indignity of carrying the smallest burden .
my companion was a light active man , dressed in a dirty blanket , and with his face completely tattooed .
he had formerly been a great warrior .
he appeared to be on very cordial terms with mr. <unk> ; but at various times they had quarrelled violently .
mr. <unk> remarked that a little quiet irony would frequently silence any one of these natives in their most blustering moments .
this chief has come and <unk> mr. <unk> in a <unk> manner , saying , " a great chief , a great man , a friend of mine , has come to pay me a visit  you must give him something good to eat , some fine presents , etc . "
mr. <unk> has allowed him to finish his discourse , and then has quietly replied by some answer such as , " what else shall your slave do for you ? "
the man would then instantly , with a very comical expression , cease his <unk> .
some time ago mr. <unk> suffered a far more serious attack .
a chief and a party of men tried to break into his house in the middle of the night , and not finding this so easy , commenced a brisk firing with their muskets .
mr. <unk> was slightly wounded , but the party was at length driven away .
shortly afterwards it was discovered who was the aggressor ; and a general meeting of the chiefs was convened to consider the case .
it was considered by the new zealanders as very atrocious , inasmuch as it was a night attack , and that mrs. <unk> was lying ill in the house : this latter circumstance , much to their honour , being considered in all cases as a protection .
the chiefs agreed to confiscate the land of the aggressor to the king of england .
the whole proceeding , however , in thus trying and punishing a chief was entirely without precedent .
the aggressor , moreover , lost caste in the estimation of his equals ; and this was considered by the british as of more consequence than the <unk> of his land .
as the boat was shoving off , a second chief stepped into her , who only wanted the amusement of the passage up and down the creek .
i never saw a more horrid and ferocious expression than this man had .
it immediately struck me i had somewhere seen his likeness : it <name> be found in <unk> 's outlines to <unk> 's ballad of <unk> , where two men are pushing <name> into the burning iron furnace .
it is the man who has his arm on <name> 's breast .
physiognomy here spoke the truth ; this chief had been a notorious murderer , and was an <unk> coward to boot .
at the point where the boat landed , mr. <unk> accompanied me a few hundred yards on the road : i could not help admiring the cool impudence of the hoary old villain , whom we left lying in the boat , when he shouted to mr. <unk> , " do not you stay long , i shall be tired of waiting here . "
we now commenced our walk .
the road lay along a <unk> path , bordered on each side by the tall <name> which covers the whole country .
after travelling some miles we came to a little country village , where a few hovels were collected together , and some patches of ground cultivated with potatoes .
the introduction of the potato has been the most essential benefit to the island ; it is now much more used than any native vegetable .
new zealand is favoured by one great natural advantage ; namely , that the inhabitants can never perish from famine .
the whole country abounds with <name> : and the roots of this plant , if not very <unk> , yet contain much nutriment .
a native can always subsist on these , and on the <unk> which are abundant on all parts of the sea-coast .
the villages are chiefly conspicuous by the platforms which are raised on four posts ten or twelve feet above the ground , and on which the produce of the fields is kept secure from all accidents .
on coming near one of the huts i was much amused by seeing in due form the ceremony of rubbing , or , as it ought to be called , pressing noses .
the women , on our first approach , began uttering something in a most <unk> voice ; they then squatted themselves down and held up their faces ; my companion standing over them , one after another , placed the bridge of his nose at right angles to theirs , and commenced pressing .
this lasted rather longer than a cordial shake of the hand with us , and as we vary the force of the grasp of the hand in shaking , so do they in pressing .
during the process they uttered comfortable little grunts , very much in the same manner as two pigs do , when rubbing against each other .
i noticed that the slave would press noses with any one he met , indifferently either before or after his master the chief .
although among these savages the chief has absolute power of life and death over his slave , yet there is an entire absence of ceremony between them .
mr. burchell has remarked the same thing in southern africa with the rude <unk> .
where civilisation has arrived at a certain point , complex formalities soon arise between the different grades of society : thus at tahiti all were formerly obliged to uncover themselves as low as the waist in presence of the king .
the ceremony of pressing noses having been duly completed with all present , we seated ourselves in a circle in the front of one of <unk> , and rested there half an hour .
all the hovels have nearly the same form and dimensions , and all agree in being <unk> dirty .
they resemble a cow-shed with one end open , but having a partition a little way within , with a square hole in it , making a small gloomy chamber .
in this the inhabitants keep all their property , and when the weather is cold they sleep there .
they eat , however , and pass their time in the open part in front .
my guides having finished their pipes , we continued our walk .
the path led through the same undulating country , the whole uniformly clothed as before with <name> .
on our right hand we had a serpentine river , the banks of which were fringed with trees , and here and there on the hill-sides there was a clump of wood .
the whole scene , in spite of its green colour , had rather a desolate aspect .
the sight of so much <name> impresses the mind with an idea of sterility : this , however , is not correct ; for wherever the <name> grows thick and <unk> , the land by tillage becomes productive .
some of the residents think that all this extensive open country originally was covered with forests , and that it has been cleared by fire .
it is said , that by digging in the <unk> spots , lumps of the kind of <unk> which flows from the <unk> pine are frequently found .
the natives had an evident motive in clearing the country ; for the <name> , formerly a staple article of food , flourishes only in the open cleared tracks .
the almost entire absence of associated grasses , which forms so remarkable a feature in the vegetation of this island , may perhaps be accounted for by the land having been aboriginally covered with <unk> .
the soil is volcanic ; in several parts we passed over <unk> lavas , and craters could clearly be distinguished on several of the neighbouring hills .
although the scenery is nowhere beautiful , and only occasionally pretty , i enjoyed my walk .
i should have enjoyed it more , if my companion , the chief , had not possessed extraordinary conversational powers .
i knew only three words : " good , " " bad , " and " yes : " and with these i answered all his remarks , without of course having understood one word he said .
this , however , was quite sufficient : i was a good listener , an agreeable person , and he never ceased talking to me .
at length we reached <unk> .
after having passed over so many miles of an uninhabited useless country , the sudden appearance of an english farm-house , and its well-dressed fields , placed there as if by an <unk> 's wand , was exceedingly pleasant .
mr. <name> not being at home , i received in mr. davies 's house a cordial welcome .
after drinking tea with his family party , we took a stroll about the farm .
at <unk> there are three large houses , where the missionary gentlemen , messrs. <name> , davies , and clarke , reside ; and near them are the huts of the native labourers .
on an adjoining slope fine crops of barley and wheat were standing in full ear ; and in another part fields of potatoes and clover .
but i can not attempt to describe all i saw ; there were large gardens , with every fruit and vegetable which england produces ; and many belonging to a warmer clime .
i may instance asparagus , kidney beans , <unk> , <unk> , apples , pears , figs , peaches , apricots , grapes , olives , <unk> , <unk> , hops , gorse for fences , and english oaks ; also many kinds of flowers .
around the <unk> there were stables , a <unk> with its <unk> machine , a blacksmith 's forge , and on the ground <unk> and other tools : in the middle was that happy mixture of pigs and poultry , lying comfortably together , as in every english <unk> .
at the distance of a few hundred yards , where the water of a little rill had been <unk> up into a pool , there was a large and substantial <unk> .
all this is very surprising when it is considered that five years ago nothing but the <name> flourished here .
moreover , native workmanship , taught by the missionaries , has effected this change ;  the lesson of the missionary is the <unk> 's wand .
the house had been built , the windows framed , the fields ploughed , and even the trees grafted , by the new <unk> .
at the mill a new <unk> was seen powdered white with flower , like his brother miller in england .
when i looked at this whole scene i thought it admirable .
it was not merely that england was brought vividly before my mind ; yet , as the evening <name> to a close , the domestic sounds , the fields of corn , the distant undulating country with its trees , might well have been mistaken for our <unk> : nor was it the triumphant feeling at seeing what englishmen could effect , but rather the high hopes thus inspired for the future progress of this fine island .
several young men , redeemed by the missionaries from slavery , were employed on the farm .
they were dressed in a shirt , jacket , and trousers , and had a respectable appearance .
judging from one trifling anecdote , i should think they must be honest .
when walking in the fields , a young <unk> came up to mr. davies and gave him a knife and <unk> , saying that he had found them on the road , and did not know to whom they belonged !
these young men and boys appeared very <name> and <unk> .
in the evening i saw a party of them at cricket : when i thought of the <unk> of which the missionaries have been accused , i was amused by observing one of their own sons taking an active part in the game .
a more decided and pleasing change was manifested in the young women , who acted as servants within the houses .
their clean , tidy , and healthy appearance , like that of the <unk> in england , formed a wonderful contrast with the women of the filthy hovels in <unk> .
the wives of the missionaries tried to persuade them not to be tattooed ; but a famous operator having arrived from the south , they said , " we really must just have a few lines on our lips ; else when we grow old , our lips <name> <unk> , and we shall be so very ugly . "
there is not nearly so much tattooing as formerly ; but as it is a badge of distinction between the chief and the slave , it <name> probably long be practised .
so soon does any train of ideas become habitual , that the missionaries told me that even in their eyes a plain face looked mean , and not like that of a new zealand gentleman .
late in the evening i went to mr. <name> 's house , where i passed the night .
i found there a large party of children , collected together for christmas day , and all sitting round a table at tea .
i never saw a nicer or more <name> group ; and to think that this was in the centre of the land of <unk> , murder , and all atrocious crimes !
the cordiality and happiness so plainly pictured in the faces of the little circle appeared equally felt by the older persons of the mission .
december 24 , 1835 .
in the morning prayers were read in the native tongue to the whole family .
after breakfast i rambled about the gardens and farm .
this was a <unk> , when the natives of the surrounding hamlets bring their potatoes , indian corn , or pigs , to exchange for blankets , tobacco , and sometimes , through the persuasions of the missionaries , for soap .
mr. davies 's eldest son , who manages a farm of his own , is the man of business in the market .
the children of the missionaries , who came while young to the island , understand the language better than their parents , and can get anything more readily done by the natives .
a little before noon messrs. <name> and davies walked with me to part of a neighbouring forest , to show me the famous <unk> pine .
i measured one of these <name> trees , and found it thirty-one feet in circumference above the roots .
there was another close by , which i did not see , thirty-three feet ; and i heard of one no less than forty feet .
these trees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical <unk> , which run up to a height of sixty , and even ninety feet , with a nearly equal diameter , and without a single branch .
the crown of branches at the summit is out of all proportion small to the trunk ; and the leaves are likewise small compared with the branches .
the forest was here almost composed of the <unk> ; and the largest trees , from the parallelism of their sides , stood up like gigantic columns of wood .
the timber of the <unk> is the most valuable production of the island ; moreover , a quantity of <unk> <unk> from the bark , which is sold at a <name> a pound to the americans , but its use was then unknown .
some of the new zealand forests must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree .
mr. matthews informed me that one forest only thirty-four miles in width , and separating two inhabited districts , had only lately , for the first time , been crossed .
he and another missionary , each with a party of about fifty men , undertook to open a road , but it cost them more than a fortnight 's labour !
in the woods i saw very few birds .
with regard to animals , it is a most remarkable fact , that so large an island , extending over more than 700 miles in latitude , and in many parts ninety broad , with varied stations , a fine climate , and land of all heights , from <unk> feet downwards , with the exception of a small rat , did not possess one indigenous animal .
the several species of that gigantic genus of birds , the <unk> , seem here to have replaced mammiferous quadrupeds , in the same manner as the reptiles still do at the galapagos archipelago .
it is said that the common norway rat , in the short space of two years , annihilated in this northern end of the island the new zealand species .
in many places i noticed several sorts of weeds , which , like the rats , i was forced to own as countrymen .
a <unk> has overrun whole districts , and <name> prove very troublesome , but it was imported as a favour by a french vessel .
the common dock is also widely disseminated , and <name> , i fear , for ever remain a proof of the rascality of an englishman who sold the seeds for those of the tobacco plant .
on returning from our pleasant walk to the house , i dined with mr. <name> ; and then , a horse being lent me , i returned to the bay of islands .
i took leave of the missionaries with thankfulness for their kind welcome , and with feelings of high respect for their <unk> , useful , and upright characters .
i think it would be difficult to find a body of men better adapted for the high office which they fulfil .
christmas day , 1835 .
in a few more days the fourth year of our absence from england <name> be completed .
our first christmas day was spent at plymouth , the second at st. <name> 's cove near cape horn ; the third at port <name> in patagonia ; the fourth at anchor in a wild harbour in the peninsula of tres montes , this fifth here , and the next , i trust in providence , <name> be in england .
we attended divine service in the chapel of <unk> ; part of the service being read in english , and part in the native language .
whilst at new zealand we did not hear of any recent acts of <unk> ; but mr. stokes found burnt human bones strewed round a fireplace on a small island near the anchorage ; but these remains of a comfortable banquet might have been lying there for several years .
it is probable that the moral state of the people <name> rapidly improve .
mr. <unk> mentioned one pleasing anecdote as a proof of the sincerity of some , at least , of those who profess christianity .
one of his young men left him , who had been accustomed to read prayers to the rest of the servants .
some weeks afterwards , happening to pass late in the evening by an <unk> , he saw and heard one of his men reading the bible with difficulty by the light of the fire , to the others .
after this the party knelt and prayed : in their prayers they mentioned mr. <unk> and his family , and the missionaries , each separately in his respective district .
december 26 , 1835 .
mr. <unk> offered to take mr. sulivan and myself in his boat some miles up the river to <unk> , and proposed afterwards to walk on to the village of <unk> , where there are some curious rocks .
following one of the arms of the bay we enjoyed a pleasant row , and passed through pretty scenery , until we came to a village , beyond which the boat could not pass .
from this place a chief and a party of men volunteered to walk with us to <unk> , a distance of four miles .
the chief was at this time rather notorious from having lately <name> one of his wives and a slave for <unk> .
when one of the missionaries remonstrated with him he seemed surprised , and said he thought he was exactly following the english method .
old <unk> , who happened to be in england during the <name> 's trial , expressed great disapprobation at the whole proceeding : he said he had five wives , and he would rather cut off all their heads than be so much troubled about one .
leaving this village , we crossed over to another , seated on a hill-side at a little distance .
the daughter of a chief , who was still a heathen , had died there five days before .
the hovel in which she had expired had been burnt to the ground : her body , being enclosed between two small canoes , was placed upright on the ground , and protected by an enclosure bearing wooden images of their gods , and the whole was painted bright red , so as to be conspicuous from afar .
her gown was fastened to the coffin , and her hair being cut off was cast at its foot .
the relatives of the family had torn the flesh of their arms , bodies , and faces , so that they were covered with clotted blood ; and the old women looked most filthy , disgusting objects .
on the following day some of the officers visited this place , and found the women still howling and cutting themselves .
we continued our walk , and soon reached <unk> .
here there are some singular masses of limestone resembling ruined castles .
these rocks have long served for burial places , and in consequence are held too sacred to be approached .
one of the young men , however , cried out , " let us all be brave , " and ran on ahead ; but when within a hundred yards , the whole party thought better of it , and stopped short .
with perfect indifference , however , they allowed us to examine the whole place .
at this village we rested some hours , during which time there was a long discussion with mr. <unk> , concerning the right of sale of certain lands .
one old man , who appeared a perfect <unk> , illustrated the successive possessors by bits of stick driven into the ground .
before leaving the houses a little <unk> of roasted sweet potatoes was given to each of our party ; and we all , according to the custom , carried them away to eat on the road .
i noticed that among the women employed in cooking , there was a <unk> : it must be a humiliating thing for a man in this warlike country to be employed in doing that which is considered as the lowest woman 's work .
slaves are not allowed to go to war ; but this perhaps can hardly be considered as a hardship .
i heard of one poor wretch who , during hostilities , ran away to the opposite party ; being met by two men , he was immediately seized ; but as they could not agree to whom he should belong , each stood over him with a stone hatchet , and seemed determined that the other at least should not take him away alive .
the poor man , almost dead with fright , was only saved by the address of a chief 's wife .
we afterwards enjoyed a pleasant walk back to the boat , but did not reach the ship till late in the evening .
december 30 , 1835 .
in the afternoon we stood out of the bay of islands , on our course to <name> .
i believe we were all glad to leave new zealand .
it is not a pleasant place .
amongst the natives there is absent that charming simplicity which is found in tahiti ; and the greater part of the english are the very refuse of society .
neither is the country itself attractive .
i look back but to one bright spot , and that is <unk> , with its <name> inhabitants .

<name> 12 , 1836 .
early in the morning a light air carried us towards the entrance of port <name> .
instead of beholding a verdant country , interspersed with fine houses , a straight line of yellowish <name> brought to our minds the coast of patagonia .
a solitary lighthouse , built of white stone , alone told us that we were near a great and populous city .
having entered the harbour , it appears fine and spacious , with <unk> shores of horizontally stratified sandstone .
the nearly level country is covered with thin <unk> trees , <unk> the curse of sterility .
proceeding farther inland , the country improves : beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and there scattered along the beach .
in the distance stone houses , two and three stories high , and <unk> standing on the edge of a bank , pointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of australia .
at last we anchored within <name> cove .
we found the little basin occupied by many large ships , and surrounded by warehouses .
in the evening i walked through the town , and returned full of admiration at the whole scene .
it is a most magnificent testimony to the power of the british nation .
here , in a less promising country , scores of years have done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have effected in south <name> .
my first feeling was to congratulate myself that i was born an englishman .
upon seeing more of the town afterwards , perhaps my admiration fell a little ; but yet it is a fine town .
the streets are regular , broad , clean , and kept in excellent order ; the houses are of a good size , and the shops well furnished .
it may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from london and a few other great towns in england ; but not even near london or <unk> is there an appearance of such rapid growth .
the number of large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising ; nevertheless , every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in procuring a house .
coming from south <name> , where in the towns every man of property is known , no one thing surprised me more than not being able to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged .
i hired a man and two horses to take me to bathurst , a village about one hundred and twenty miles in the interior , and the centre of a great pastoral district .
by this means i hoped to gain a general idea of the appearance of the country .
on the morning of the 16th ( <name> ) i set out on my excursion .
the first stage took us to <unk> , a small country town , next to <name> in importance .
the roads were excellent , and made upon the <unk> principle , <unk> having been brought for the purpose from the distance of several miles .
in all respects there was a close resemblance to england : perhaps the <unk> here were more numerous .
the iron gangs , or parties of convicts who have committed here some offence , appeared the least like england : they were working in chains , under the charge of sentries with loaded arms .
the power which the government possesses , by means of forced labour , of at once opening good roads throughout the country , has been , i believe , one main cause of the early prosperity of this colony .
i slept at night at a very comfortable inn at <unk> ferry , thirty-five miles from <name> , and near the ascent of the blue mountains .
this line of road is the most frequented , and has been the longest inhabited of any in the colony .
the whole land is enclosed with high railings , for the farmers have not succeeded in rearing hedges .
there are many substantial houses and good cottages scattered about ; but although considerable pieces of land are under cultivation , the greater part yet remains as when first discovered .
the extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of new south wales .
everywhere we have an open woodland , the ground being partially covered with a very thin pasture , with little appearance of verdure .
the trees nearly all belong to one family , and mostly have their leaves placed in a vertical , instead of as in europe , in a nearly horizontal position : the foliage is scanty , and of a peculiar pale green tint , without any gloss .
hence the woods appear light and <unk> : this , although a loss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer , is of importance to the farmer , as it allows grass to grow where it otherwise would not .
the leaves are not shed periodically : this character appears common to the entire southern hemisphere , namely , south <name> , australia , and the cape of good <name> .
the inhabitants of this hemisphere , and of the intertropical regions , thus lose perhaps one of the most glorious , though to our eyes common , spectacles in the world  the first bursting into full foliage of the leafless tree .
they may , however , say that we pay dearly for this by having the land covered with mere naked skeletons for so many months .
this is too true ; but our senses thus acquire a keen relish for the exquisite green of the spring , which the eyes of those living within the tropics , <unk> during the long year with the gorgeous productions of those glowing climates , can never experience .
the greater number of the trees , with the exception of some of the <unk> , do not attain a large size ; but they grow tall and tolerably straight , and stand well apart .
the bark of some of the <unk> falls annually , or hangs dead in long shreds which swing about with the wind , and give to the woods a desolate and untidy appearance .
i can not imagine a more complete contrast , in every respect , than between the forests of valdivia or chiloe , and the woods of australia .
at sunset , a party of a score of the black aborigines passed by , each carrying , in their accustomed manner , a bundle of spears and other weapons .
by giving a leading young man a shilling , they were easily detained , and threw their spears for my amusement .
they were all partly clothed , and several could speak a little english : their countenances were <unk> and pleasant , and they appeared far from being such utterly degraded beings as they have usually been represented .
in their own arts they are admirable .
a cap being fixed at thirty yards distance , they transfixed it with a spear , delivered by the <unk> with the rapidity of an arrow from the bow of a practised archer .
in tracking animals or men they show most wonderful sagacity ; and i heard of several of their remarks which manifested considerable acuteness .
they <name> not , however , cultivate the ground , or build houses and remain stationary , or even take the trouble of tending a flock of sheep when given to them .
on the whole they appear to me to stand some few degrees higher in the scale of civilisation than the fuegians .
it is very curious thus to see in the midst of a civilised people , a set of harmless savages wandering about without knowing where they shall sleep at night , and gaining their livelihood by hunting in the woods .
as the white man has travelled onwards , he has spread over the country belonging to several tribes .
these , although thus enclosed by one common people , keep up their ancient distinctions , and sometimes go to war with each other .
in an engagement which took place lately , the two parties most singularly chose the centre of the village of bathurst for the field of battle .
this was of service to the defeated side , for the runaway warriors took refuge in the barracks .
the number of aborigines is rapidly decreasing .
in my whole ride , with the exception of some boys brought up by englishmen , i saw only one other party .
this decrease , no doubt , must be partly owing to the introduction of spirits , to european diseases ( even the milder ones of which , such as the measles , prove very destructive ) , and to the gradual extinction of the wild animals .
( <unk> .
it is remarkable how the same disease is modified in different climates .
at the little island of st. <name> the introduction of <unk> is dreaded as a plague .
in some countries foreigners and natives are as differently affected by certain contagious <unk> as if they had been different animals ; of which fact some instances have occurred in chile ; and according to humboldt in mexico " political essay new spain " volume 4 . )
it is said that <name> of their children invariably perish in very early infancy from the effects of their wandering life ; and as the difficulty of procuring food increases , so must their wandering habits increase ; and hence the population , without any apparent deaths from famine , is repressed in a manner extremely sudden compared to what happens in civilised countries , where the father , though in adding to his labour he may injure himself , does not destroy his offspring .
besides these several evident causes of destruction , there appears to be some more mysterious agency generally at work .
wherever the european has trod , death seems to pursue the aboriginal .
we may look to the wide extent of the <unk> , <unk> , the cape of good <name> , and australia , and we find the same result .
nor is it the white man alone that thus acts the destroyer ; the polynesian of malay extraction has in parts of the east indian archipelago thus driven before him the dark-coloured native .
the varieties of man seem to act on each other in the same way as different species of animals  the stronger always <unk> the weaker .
it was melancholy at new zealand to hear the fine energetic natives saying that they knew the land was doomed to pass from their children .
every one has heard of the inexplicable reduction of the population in the beautiful and healthy island of tahiti since the date of captain cook 's voyages : although in that case we might have expected that it would have been increased ; for infanticide , which formerly prevailed to so extraordinary a degree , has ceased , profligacy has greatly diminished , and the murderous wars become less frequent .
the reverend j. <name> , in his interesting work , says that the first intercourse between natives and europeans " is invariably attended with the introduction of fever , dysentery , or some other disease which carries off <name> of the people . "
( <unk> .
" narrative of missionary enterprise " <name> 282 . )
again he affirms " it is certainly a fact , which can not be <unk> , that most of the diseases which have raged in the islands during my residence there have been introduced by ships ; and what renders this fact remarkable is that there might be no appearance of disease among the crew of the ship which conveyed this destructive importation . "
( <unk> .
captain beechey chapter 4 volume 1 , states that the inhabitants of pitcairn island are firmly convinced that after the arrival of every ship they suffer <unk> and other <unk> .
captain beechey attributes this to the change of diet during the time of the visit .
dr. macculloch " western isles " volume 2 <name> 32 , says " it is asserted that on the arrival of a stranger ( at st. <unk> ) all the inhabitants , in the common phraseology , catch a cold . "
dr. macculloch considers the whole case , although often previously affirmed , as ludicrous .
he adds , however , that " the question was put by us to the inhabitants who unanimously agreed in the story . "
in vancouver 's " voyage " there is a somewhat similar statement with respect to <unk> .
dr. <unk> , in a note to his translation of this journal , states that the same fact is universally believed by the inhabitants of the chatham islands and in parts of new zealand .
it is impossible that such a belief should have become universal in the northern hemisphere , at the <unk> , and in the pacific , without some good foundation .
humboldt " political essay on kingdom of new spain " volume 4 , says that the great epidemics at panama and callao are " marked " by the arrival of ships from chile , because the people from that temperate region first experience the fatal effects of the torrid zones .
i may add that i have heard it stated in shropshire that sheep which have been imported from vessels , although themselves in a healthy condition , if placed in the same fold with others , frequently produce sickness in the flock . )
this statement is not quite so extraordinary as it at first appears ; for several cases are on record of the most malignant fevers having broken out , although the parties themselves , who were the cause , were not affected .
in the early part of the reign of <name> iii , a prisoner who had been confined in a dungeon was taken in a coach with four constables before a magistrate ; and although the man himself was not ill , the four constables died from a short putrid fever ; but the <unk> extended to no others .
from these facts it would almost appear as if the <unk> of one set of men shut up for some time together was poisonous when <unk> by others ; and possibly more so , if the men be of different races .
mysterious as this circumstance appears to be , it is not more surprising than that the body of one's fellow-creature , directly after death , and before <unk> has commenced , should often be of so <unk> a quality that the mere <unk> from an instrument used in its dissection should prove fatal .
<name> 17 , 1836 .
early in the morning we passed the <unk> in a ferry-boat .
the river , although at this spot both broad and deep , had a very small body of running water .
having crossed a low piece of land on the opposite side , we reached the slope of the blue mountains .
the ascent is not steep , the road having been cut with much care on the side of a sandstone <name> .
on the summit an almost level plain extends , which , rising imperceptibly to the westward , at last attains a height of more than 3000 feet .
from so grand a title as blue mountains , and from their absolute altitude , i expected to have seen a bold chain of mountains crossing the country ; but instead of this , a sloping plain presents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land near the coast .
from this first slope the view of the extensive woodland to the east was striking , and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty .
but when once on the sandstone platform , the scenery becomes exceedingly monotonous ; each side of the road is bordered by <unk> trees of the <unk> <unk> family ; and with the exception of two or three small inns , there are no houses or cultivated land ; the road , moreover , is solitary ; the most frequent object being a <unk> , piled up with bales of wool .
in the middle of the day we baited our horses at a little inn , called the <unk> .
the country here is elevated <unk> feet above the sea .
about a mile and a half from this place there is a view exceedingly well worth visiting .
following down a little valley and its <name> rill of water , an immense gulf unexpectedly opens through the trees which border the pathway , at the depth of perhaps 1500 feet .
walking on a few yards , one stands on the brink of a vast precipice , and below one sees a grand bay or gulf , for i know not what other name to give it , thickly covered with forest .
the point of view is situated as if at the head of a bay , the line of <name> diverging on each side , and showing headland behind headland , as on a bold sea-coast .
these cliffs are composed of horizontal strata of whitish sandstone ; and are so absolutely vertical , that in many places a person standing on the edge and throwing down a stone , can see it strike the trees in the abyss below .
so unbroken is the line of <name> that in order to reach the foot of the waterfall formed by this little stream , it is said to be necessary to go sixteen miles round .
about five miles distant in front another line of <name> extends , which thus appears completely to <unk> the valley ; and hence the name of bay is justified , as applied to this grand <unk> depression .
if we imagine a winding harbour , with its deep water surrounded by bold <unk> shores , to be laid dry , and a forest to spring up on its <name> bottom , we should then have the appearance and structure here exhibited .
this kind of view was to me quite novel , and extremely magnificent .
in the evening we reached the blackheath .
the sandstone plateau has here attained the height of <unk> feet ; and is covered , as before , with the same <unk> woods .
from the road there were occasional glimpses into a profound valley of the same character as the one described ; but from the <unk> and depth of its sides , the bottom was scarcely ever to be seen .
the blackheath is a very comfortable inn , kept by an old soldier ; and it reminded me of the small inns in north wales .
<name> 18 , 1836 .
very early in the morning i walked about three miles to see <unk> 's leap : a view of a similar character with that near the <unk> , but perhaps even more stupendous .
so early in the day the gulf was filled with a thin blue haze , which , although destroying the general effect of the view , added to the apparent depth at which the forest was stretched out beneath our feet .
these valleys , which so long presented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most enterprising of the colonists to reach the interior , are most remarkable .
great <unk> bays , expanding at their upper ends , often branch from the main valleys and penetrate the sandstone platform ; on the other hand , the platform often sends promontories into the valleys , and even leaves in them great , almost insulated , masses .
to descend into some of these valleys , it is necessary to go round twenty miles ; and into others , the <unk> have only lately penetrated , and the colonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle .
but the most remarkable feature in their structure is , that although several miles wide at their heads , they generally contract towards their mouths to such a degree as to become impassable .
the <unk> , sir t. <name> , endeavoured in vain , first walking and then by crawling between the great fallen fragments of sandstone , to ascend through the gorge by which the river <unk> joins the <unk> ( <unk> .
" travels in australia " volume 1 <name> 154 .
i must express my obligation to sir t. <name> for several interesting personal communications on the subject of these great valleys of new south wales .
) ; yet the valley of the <unk> in its upper part , as i saw , forms a magnificent level basin some miles in width , and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs , the summits of which are believed to be nowhere less than 3000 feet above the level of the sea .
when cattle are driven into the valley of the <unk> by a path ( which i descended ) , partly natural and partly made by the owner of the land , they can not escape ; for this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs , and eight miles lower down it contracts from an average width of half a mile , to a mere chasm , impassable to man or beast .
sir t. <name> states that the great valley of the cox river with all its branches , contracts , where it unites with the <unk> , into a gorge <unk> yards in width , and about 1000 feet in depth .
other similar cases might have been added .
the first impression on seeing the correspondence of the horizontal strata on each side of these valleys and great <unk> depressions , is that they have been hollowed out , like other valleys , by the action of water ; but when one reflects on the enormous amount of stone which on this view must have been removed through mere gorges or chasms , one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided .
but considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys , and of the narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms , we are compelled to abandon this notion .
to attribute these hollows to the present alluvial action would be preposterous ; nor does the drainage from the <unk> always fall , as i remarked near the <unk> , into the head of these valleys , but into one side of their <unk> recesses .
some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never viewed one of those <unk> recesses , with the headlands receding on both hands , without being struck with their resemblance to a bold sea-coast .
this is certainly the case ; moreover , on the present coast of new south wales , the numerous fine , <unk> harbours , which are generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth worn through the sandstone <unk> , varying from one mile in width to a quarter of a mile , present a likeness , though on a miniature scale , to the great valleys of the interior .
but then immediately occurs the startling difficulty , why has the sea worn out these great though circumscribed depressions on a wide platform , and left mere gorges at the openings , through which the whole vast amount of triturated matter must have been carried away ?
the only light i can throw upon this enigma is by remarking that banks of the most irregular forms appear to be now forming in some seas , as in parts of the west indies and in the red sea , and that their sides are exceedingly steep .
such banks , i have been led to suppose , have been formed by sediment heaped by strong currents on an irregular bottom .
that in some cases the sea , instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet , heaps it round submarine rocks and islands , it is hardly possible to doubt , after examining the charts of the west indies ; and that the waves have power to form high and precipitous cliffs , even in <unk> harbours , i have noticed in many parts of south <name> .
to apply these ideas to the sandstone platforms of new south wales , i imagine that the strata were heaped by the action of strong currents , and of the undulations of an open sea , on an irregular bottom ; and that the <unk> spaces thus left <unk> had their steeply sloping flanks worn into cliffs during a slow elevation of the land ; the <unk> sandstone being removed , either at the time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea , or subsequently by alluvial action .
soon after leaving the blackheath we descended from the sandstone platform by the pass of mount <name> .
to effect this pass an enormous quantity of stone has been cut through ; the design and its manner of execution being worthy of any line of road in england .
we now entered upon a country less elevated by nearly a thousand feet , and consisting of granite .
with the change of rock the vegetation improved ; the trees were both finer and stood farther apart ; and the pasture between them was a little greener and more plentiful .
at <name> 's walls i left the <unk> , and made a short detour to a farm called <unk> ; to the superintendent of which i had a letter of introduction from the owner in <name> .
mr. browne had the kindness to ask me to stay the ensuing day , which i had much pleasure in doing .
this place offers an example of one of the large farming , or rather <unk> , establishments of the colony .
cattle and horses are , however , in this case rather more numerous than usual , owing to some of the valleys being swampy and producing a coarser pasture .
two or three flat pieces of ground near the house were cleared and cultivated with corn , which the <unk> were now reaping : but no more wheat is sown than sufficient for the annual support of the labourers employed on the establishment .
the usual number of assigned <unk> here is about forty , but at the present time there were rather more .
although the farm was well stocked with every necessary , there was an apparent absence of comfort ; and not one single woman resided here .
the sunset of a fine day <name> generally cast an air of happy contentment on any scene ; but here , at this retired farmhouse , the brightest tints on the surrounding woods could not make me forget that forty hardened , profligate men were ceasing from their daily labours , like the slaves from africa , yet without their holy claim for compassion .
early on the next morning mr. archer , the joint superintendent , had the kindness to take me out <unk> .
we continued riding the greater part of the day , but had very bad sport , not seeing a kangaroo , or even a wild dog .
the greyhounds pursued a kangaroo rat into a hollow tree , out of which we dragged it : it is an animal as large as a rabbit , but with the figure of a kangaroo .
a few years since this country abounded with wild animals ; but now the <unk> is banished to a long distance , and the kangaroo is become scarce ; to both the english greyhound has been highly destructive .
it may be long before these animals are altogether exterminated , but their doom is fixed .
the aborigines are always anxious to borrow the dogs from the farmhouses : the use of them , the offal when an animal is killed , and some milk from the cows , are the <unk> of the settlers , who push farther and farther towards the interior .
the thoughtless aboriginal , blinded by these trifling advantages , is delighted at the approach of the white man , who seems <unk> to inherit the country of his children .
although having poor sport , we enjoyed a pleasant ride .
the woodland is generally so open that a person on horseback can gallop through it .
it is traversed by a few flat-bottomed valleys , which are green and free from trees : in such spots the scenery was pretty like that of a park .
in the whole country i scarcely saw a place without the marks of a fire ; whether these had been more or less recent  whether the stumps were more or less black , was the greatest change which varied the uniformity so wearisome to the traveller 's eye .
in these woods there are not many birds ; i saw , however , some large flocks of the white <unk> feeding in a <unk> , and a few most beautiful parrots ; crows like our <unk> were not uncommon , and another bird something like the magpie .
in the dusk of the evening i took a stroll along a chain of ponds , which in this dry country represented the course of a river , and had the good fortune to see several of the famous ornithorhynchus <unk> .
they were diving and playing about the surface of the water , but showed so little of their bodies that they might easily have been mistaken for <unk> .
mr. browne shot one : certainly it is a most extraordinary animal ; a stuffed specimen does not at all give a good idea of the appearance of the head and beak when fresh ; the latter becoming hard and contracted .
( <unk> .
i was interested by finding here the hollow conical pitfall of the <unk> , or some other insect : first a fly fell down the treacherous slope and immediately disappeared ; then came a large but <unk> ant ; its struggles to escape being very violent , those curious little jets of sand , described by <name> and spence " entomology " volume 1 <name> 425 , as being <unk> by the <unk> tail , were promptly directed against the expected victim .
but the ant enjoyed a better fate than the fly and escaped the fatal jaws which lay concealed at the base of the conical hollow .
this australian pitfall was only about half the size of that made by the european <unk> . )
<name> 20 , 1836 .
a long day 's ride to bathurst .
before joining the high road we followed a mere path through the forest ; and the country , with the exception of a few <unk> ' huts , was very solitary .
we experienced this day the <unk> wind of australia , which comes from the parched deserts of the interior .
clouds of dust were travelling in every direction ; and the wind felt as if it had passed over a fire .
i afterwards heard that the thermometer out of doors had stood at 119 degrees , and in a closed room at 96 degrees .
in the afternoon we came in view of the downs of bathurst .
these undulating but nearly smooth plains are very remarkable in this country , from being absolutely destitute of trees .
they support only a thin brown pasture .
we rode some miles over this country , and then reached the township of bathurst , seated in the middle of what may be called either a very broad valley , or narrow plain .
i was told at <name> not to form too bad an opinion of australia by judging of the country from the roadside , nor too good a one from bathurst ; in this latter respect i did not feel myself in the least danger of being prejudiced .
the season , it must be owned , had been one of great drought , and the country did not wear a favourable aspect ; although i understand it was incomparably worse two or three months before .
the secret of the rapidly growing prosperity of bathurst is that the brown pasture which appears to the stranger 's eye so wretched is excellent for <unk> .
the town stands at the height of <unk> feet above the sea , on the banks of the <unk> : this is one of the rivers flowing into the vast and scarcely known interior .
the line of <unk> which divides the inland streams from those on the coast , has a height of about 3000 feet , and runs in a north and south direction at the distance of from eighty to a hundred miles from the seaside .
the <unk> figures in the map as a respectable river , and it is the largest of those draining this part of the <unk> ; yet to my surprise i found it a mere chain of ponds , separated from each other by spaces almost dry .
generally a small stream is running ; and sometimes there are high and impetuous floods .
scanty as the supply of the water is throughout this district , it becomes still <unk> further inland .
<name> 22 , 1836 .
i commenced my return and followed a new road called <unk> 's line along which the country is rather more hilly and picturesque .
this was a long day 's ride ; and the house where i wished to sleep was some way off the road , and not easily found .
i met on this occasion , and indeed on all others , a very general and ready civility among the lower orders , which , when one considers what they are , and what they have been , would scarcely have been expected .
the farm where i passed the night was owned by two young men who had only lately come out , and were beginning a <unk> life .
the total want of almost every comfort was not very attractive ; but future and certain prosperity was before their eyes , and that not far distant .
the next day we passed through large tracts of country in flames , volumes of smoke sweeping across the road .
before noon we joined our former road and ascended mount <name> .
i slept at the <unk> , and before dark took another walk to the amphitheatre .
on the road to <name> i spent a very pleasant evening with captain king at <unk> ; and thus ended my little excursion in the colony of new south wales .
before arriving here the three things which interested me most were  the state of society amongst the higher classes , the condition of the convicts , and the degree of attraction sufficient to induce persons to emigrate .
of course , after so very short a visit , one 's opinion is worth scarcely anything ; but it is as difficult not to form some opinion , as it is to form a correct judgment .
on the whole , from what i heard , more than from what i saw , i was disappointed in the state of society .
the whole community is <unk> divided into parties on almost every subject .
among those who , from their station in life , ought to be the best , many live in such open profligacy that respectable people can not associate with them .
there is much jealousy between the children of the <name> <unk> and the free settlers , the former being pleased to consider honest men as <unk> .
the whole population , poor and <name> , are bent on acquiring wealth : amongst the higher orders , wool and <unk> form the constant subject of conversation .
there are many serious drawbacks to the comforts of a family , the chief of which , perhaps , is being surrounded by convict servants .
how thoroughly odious to every feeling , to be waited on by a man who the day before , perhaps , was flogged , from your representation , for some trifling <unk> .
the female servants are of course much worse : hence children learn the <unk> expressions , and it is fortunate if not equally vile ideas .
on the other hand , the capital of a person , without any trouble on his part , produces him treble interest to what it <name> in england ; and with care he is sure to grow <name> .
the luxuries of life are in abundance , and very little dearer than in england , and most articles of food are cheaper .
the climate is splendid , and perfectly healthy ; but to my mind its charms are lost by the <unk> aspect of the country .
settlers possess a great advantage in finding their sons of service when very young .
at the age of from sixteen to twenty they frequently take charge of distant farming stations .
this , however , must happen at the expense of their boys associating entirely with convict servants .
i am not aware that the tone of society has assumed any peculiar character ; but with such habits , and without intellectual pursuits , it can hardly fail to <unk> .
my opinion is such that nothing but rather sharp necessity should compel me to emigrate .
the rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me , not understanding these subjects , very puzzling .
the two main <unk> are wool and <unk> , and to both of these productions there is a limit .
the country is totally unfit for canals , therefore there is a not very distant point beyond which the <unk> of wool <name> not repay the expense of <unk> and tending sheep .
pasture everywhere is so thin that settlers have already pushed far into the interior ; moreover , the country farther inland becomes extremely poor .
agriculture , on account of the <unk> , can never succeed on an extended scale : therefore , so far as i can see , australia must ultimately depend upon being the centre of commerce for the southern hemisphere and perhaps on her future <unk> .
possessing coal , she always has the moving power at hand .
from the habitable country extending along the coast , and from her english extraction , she is sure to be a maritime nation .
i formerly imagined that australia would rise to be as grand and powerful a country as north <name> , but now it appears to me that such future grandeur is rather <unk> .
with respect to the state of the convicts , i had still fewer opportunities of judging than on other points .
the first question is , whether their condition is at all one of punishment : no one <name> maintain that it is a very severe one .
this , however , i suppose , is of little consequence as long as it continues to be an object of dread to criminals at home .
the corporeal wants of the convicts are tolerably well supplied : their prospect of future <name> and comfort is not distant , and , after good conduct , certain .
a " ticket of leave , " which , as long as a man keeps clear of suspicion as well as of crime , makes him free within a certain district , is given upon good conduct , after years proportional to the length of the sentence ; yet with all this , and overlooking the previous imprisonment and wretched passage out , i believe the years of <unk> are passed away with discontent and unhappiness .
as an intelligent man remarked to me , the convicts know no pleasure beyond <unk> , and in this they are not gratified .
the enormous bribe which government possesses in offering free pardons , together with the deep horror of the secluded penal settlements , destroys confidence between the convicts , and so prevents crime .
as to a sense of shame , such a feeling does not appear to be known , and of this i witnessed some very singular proofs .
though it is a curious fact , i was universally told that the character of the convict population is one of <unk> cowardice ; not unfrequently some become desperate , and quite indifferent as to life , yet a plan requiring cool or continued courage is seldom put into execution .
the worst feature in the whole case is that although there exists what may be called a legal reform , and comparatively little is committed which the law can touch , yet that any moral reform should take place appears to be quite out of the question .
i was assured by well-informed people that a man who should try to improve , could not while living with other assigned servants ;  his life would be one of intolerable misery and persecution .
nor must the <unk> of the <unk> and prisons , both here and in england , be forgotten .
on the whole , as a place of punishment , the object is scarcely gained ; as a real system of reform it has failed , as perhaps would every other plan ; but as a means of making men outwardly honest ,  of converting vagabonds , most useless in one hemisphere , into active citizens of another , and thus giving birth to a new and splendid country  a grand centre of civilisation  it has succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in history .
<name> 30 , 1836 .
( plate 90 .
hobart town and mount wellington . )
the " beagle " sailed for hobart town in van diemen 's land .
on the 5th of february , after a six days ' passage , of which the first part was fine , and the latter very cold and <unk> , we entered the mouth of storm bay ; the weather justified this awful name .
the bay should rather be called an estuary , for it receives at its head the waters of the <unk> .
near the mouth there are some extensive basaltic platforms ; but higher up the land becomes mountainous , and is covered by a light wood .
the lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared ; and the bright yellow fields of corn , and dark green ones of potatoes , appear very luxuriant .
late in the evening we anchored in the snug cove on the shores of which stands the capital of tasmania .
the first aspect of the place was very inferior to that of <name> ; the latter might be called a city , this is only a town .
it stands at the base of mount wellington , a mountain <unk> feet high , but of little picturesque beauty ; from this source , however , it receives a good supply of water .
round the cove there are some fine warehouses and on one side a small fort .
coming from the spanish settlements , where such magnificent care has generally been paid to the fortifications , the means of defence in these colonies appeared very contemptible .
comparing the town with <name> , i was chiefly struck with the comparative <unk> of the large houses , either built or building .
hobart town , from the census of 1835 , contained <unk> inhabitants , and the whole of tasmania <unk> .
all the aborigines have been removed to an island in <unk> straits , so that van diemen 's land enjoys the great advantage of being free from a native population .
this most cruel step seems to have been quite unavoidable , as the only means of stopping a fearful succession of robberies , <unk> , and murders , committed by the blacks ; and which sooner or later would have ended in their utter destruction .
i fear there is no doubt that this train of evil and its consequences originated in the infamous conduct of some of our countrymen .
thirty years is a short period in which to have banished the last aboriginal from his native island ,  and that island nearly as large as ireland .
the correspondence on this subject which took place between the government at home and that of van diemen 's land , is very interesting .
although <name> of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the <unk> , which was going on at intervals for several years , nothing seems fully to have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming power , until the whole island , in 1830 , was put under martial law , and by proclamation the whole population commanded to assist in one great attempt to secure the entire race .
the plan adopted was nearly similar to that of the great <unk> in <name> : a line was formed reaching across the island , with the intention of driving the natives into a <unk> on <unk> 's peninsula .
the attempt failed ; the natives , having tied up their dogs , stole during one night through the lines .
this is far from surprising , when their practised senses and usual manner of crawling after wild animals is considered .
i have been assured that they can conceal themselves on almost bare ground , in a manner which until witnessed is scarcely credible ; their dusky bodies being easily mistaken for the blackened stumps which are scattered all over the country .
i was told of a trial between a party of englishmen and a native , who was to stand in full view on the side of a bare hill ; if the englishmen closed their eyes for less than a minute , he would squat down , and then they were never able to distinguish him from the surrounding stumps .
but to return to the <unk> ; the natives understanding this kind of warfare , were terribly alarmed , for they at once perceived the power and <name> of the whites .
shortly afterwards a party of thirteen belonging to two tribes came in ; and , conscious of their unprotected condition , delivered themselves up in despair .
subsequently by the intrepid exertions of mr. robinson , an active and benevolent man , who fearlessly visited by himself the most hostile of the natives , the whole were induced to act in a similar manner .
they were then removed to an island , where food and clothes were provided them .
count <unk> states that " at the epoch of their <unk> in 1835 , the number of natives amounted to 210 .
in 1842 , that is after the interval of seven years , they mustered only fifty-four individuals ; and , while each family of the interior of new south wales , <unk> by contact with the whites , swarms with children , those of <unk> island had during eight years an accession of only fourteen in number ! "
( <unk> .
" physical description of new south wales and van diemen 's land " <name> 354 . )
the " beagle " stayed here ten days , and in this time i made several pleasant little excursions , chiefly with the object of examining the geological structure of the immediate neighbourhood .
the main points of interest consist , first in some highly fossiliferous strata belonging to the devonian or carboniferous period ; secondly , in proofs of a late small rise of the land ; and lastly , in a solitary and superficial patch of yellowish limestone or <unk> , which contains numerous impressions of leaves of trees , together with land-shells , not now existing .
it is not improbable that this one small quarry includes the only remaining record of the vegetation of van diemen 's land during one former epoch .
the climate here is damper than in new south wales , and hence the land is more fertile .
agriculture flourishes ; the cultivated fields look well , and the gardens abound with thriving vegetables and fruit-trees .
some of the farmhouses , situated in retired spots , had a very attractive appearance .
the general aspect of the vegetation is similar to that of australia ; perhaps it is a little more green and cheerful ; and the pasture between the trees rather more abundant .
one day i took a long walk on the side of the bay opposite to the town : i crossed in a steamboat , two of which are constantly plying backwards and forwards .
the machinery of one of these vessels was entirely manufactured in this colony , which , from its very foundation , then numbered only three and thirty years !
another day i ascended mount wellington ; i took with me a guide , for i failed in a first attempt , from the thickness of the wood .
our guide , however , was a stupid fellow , and conducted us to the southern and damp side of the mountain , where the vegetation was very luxuriant ; and where the labour of the ascent , from the number of rotten trunks , was almost as great as on a mountain in <name> <name> fuego or in chiloe .
it cost us five and a half hours of hard climbing before we reached the summit .
in many parts the <unk> grew to a great size and composed a <name> forest .
in some of the <unk> ravines <unk> flourished in an extraordinary manner ; i saw one which must have been at least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds , and was in girth exactly six feet .
the fronds , forming the most elegant <unk> , produced a gloomy shade , like that of the first hour of night .
the summit of the mountain is broad and flat and is composed of huge angular masses of naked greenstone .
its elevation is <unk> feet above the level of the sea .
the day was splendidly clear , and we enjoyed a most extensive view ; to the north , the country appeared a mass of wooded mountains , of about the same height with that on which we were standing , and with an equally tame outline : to the south the broken land and water , forming many intricate bays , was mapped with clearness before us .
after staying some hours on the summit we found a better way to descend , but did not reach the " beagle " till eight o'clock , after a severe day 's work .
february 7 , 1836 .
the " beagle " sailed from tasmania , and , on the 6th of the ensuing month , reached king <name> 's sound , situated close to the south-west corner of australia .
we stayed there eight days ; and we did not during our voyage pass a more dull and uninteresting time .
the country , viewed from an eminence , appears a woody plain , with here and there rounded and partly bare hills of granite protruding .
one day i went out with a party , in hopes of seeing a <unk> , and walked over a good many miles of country .
everywhere we found the soil <name> , and very poor ; it supported either a coarse vegetation of thin , low brushwood and wiry grass , or a forest of stunted trees .
the scenery resembled that of the high sandstone platform of the blue mountains ; the <unk> ( a tree somewhat resembling a scotch fir ) is , however , here in greater number , and the <unk> in rather less .
in the open parts there were many <unk> ,  a plant which , in appearance , has some affinity with the palm ; but , instead of being surmounted by a crown of <name> fronds , it can boast merely of a tuft of very coarse <unk> leaves .
the general bright green colour of the brushwood and other plants , viewed from a distance , seemed to promise fertility .
a single walk , however , was enough to dispel such an illusion ; and he who thinks with me <name> never wish to walk again in so <unk> a country .
one day i accompanied captain fitz <name> to bald head , the place mentioned by so many navigators , where some imagined that they saw corals , and others that they saw petrified trees , standing in the position in which they had grown .
according to our view , the beds have been formed by the wind having heaped up fine sand , composed of minute rounded particles of shells and corals , during which process branches and roots of trees , together with many land-shells , became enclosed .
the whole then became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous matter ; and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the wood were thus also filled up with a hard <unk> stone .
the weather is now wearing away the softer parts , and in consequence the hard casts of the roots and branches of the trees project above the surface , and , in a singularly deceptive manner , resemble the stumps of a dead thicket .
a large tribe of natives , called the white <unk> men happened to pay the settlement a visit while we were there .
these men , as well as those of the tribe belonging to king <name> 's sound , being tempted by the offer of some tubs of rice and sugar , were persuaded to hold a " <unk> , " or great <unk> .
as soon as it grew dark , small fires were lighted , and the men commenced their toilet , which consisted in painting themselves white in spots and lines .
as soon as all was ready , large fires were kept blazing , round which the women and children were collected as spectators ; the <unk> and king <name> 's men formed two distinct parties , and generally danced in answer to each other .
the dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in indian file into an open space , and stamping the ground with great force as they marched together .
their heavy footsteps were accompanied by a kind of grunt , by beating their clubs and spears together , and by various other gesticulations , such as extending their arms and wriggling their bodies .
it was a most rude , barbarous scene , and , to our ideas , without any sort of meaning ; but we observed that the black women and children watched it with the greatest pleasure .
perhaps these dances originally represented actions , such as wars and victories ; there was one called the <unk> dance , in which each man extended his arm in a bent manner , like the neck of that bird .
in another dance one man imitated the movements of a kangaroo grazing in the woods , whilst a second crawled up and pretended to spear him .
when both tribes mingled in the dance , the ground trembled with the <unk> of their steps , and the air resounded with their wild cries .
every one appeared in high spirits , and the group of nearly naked figures , viewed by the light of the blazing fires , all moving in hideous <name> , formed a perfect display of a festival amongst the lowest barbarians .
in <name> <name> fuego we have beheld many curious scenes in savage life , but never , i think , one where the natives were in such high spirits , and so perfectly at their ease .
after the dancing was over the whole party formed a great circle on the ground , and the boiled rice and sugar was distributed , to the delight of all .
after several tedious delays from clouded weather , on the 14th of march we gladly stood out of king <name> 's sound on our course to keeling island .
farewell , australia !
you are a rising child , and doubtless some day <name> reign a great <name> in the south ; but you are too great and ambitious for affection , yet not great enough for respect .
i leave your shores without sorrow or regret .

<name> 1 , 1836 .
we arrived in view of the keeling or <unk> islands , situated in the indian ocean , and about six hundred miles distant from the coast of sumatra .
this is one of the lagoon-islands ( or atolls ) of <name> formation similar to those in the low archipelago which we passed near .
when the ship was in the channel at the entrance , mr. <unk> , an english resident , came off in his boat .
the history of the inhabitants of this place , in as few words as possible , is as follows .
about nine years ago , mr. hare , a worthless character , brought from the east indian archipelago a number of malay slaves , which now , including children , amount to more than a hundred .
shortly afterwards captain <name> , who had before visited these islands in his <unk> , arrived from england , bringing with him his family and goods for settlement : along with him came mr. <unk> , who had been a mate in his vessel .
the malay slaves soon ran away from the islet on which mr. hare was settled , and joined captain <name> 's party .
mr. hare upon this was ultimately obliged to leave the place .
the malays are now nominally in a state of freedom , and certainly are so as far as regards their personal treatment ; but in most other points they are considered as slaves .
from their discontented state , from the repeated <unk> from islet to islet , and perhaps also from a little <unk> , things are not very prosperous .
the island has no domestic quadruped excepting the pig , and the main vegetable production is the cocoa-nut .
the whole prosperity of the place depends on this tree ; the only <unk> being oil from the nut , and the nuts themselves , which are taken to singapore and mauritius , where they are chiefly used , when grated , in making <unk> .
on the cocoa-nut , also , the pigs , which are loaded with fat , almost entirely subsist , as do the ducks and poultry .
even a huge <unk> is furnished by nature with the means to open and feed on this most useful production .
the ring-formed reef of the <unk> is surmounted in the greater part of its length by linear islets .
on the northern or leeward side there is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage within .
on entering , the scene was very curious and rather pretty ; its beauty , however , entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding colours .
the shallow , clear , and still water of the lagoon , resting in its greater part on white sand , is , when illumined by a vertical sun , of the most vivid green .
this brilliant expanse , several miles in width , is on all sides divided , either by a line of snow-white breakers from the dark heaving waters of the ocean , or from the blue vault of heaven by the strips of land , crowned by the level tops of the cocoa-nut trees .
as a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing contrast with the azure sky , so in the lagoon bands of living <name> darken the <name> green water .
the next morning after <unk> i went on shore on direction island .
the strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width ; on the lagoon side there is a white calcareous beach , the radiation from which under this sultry climate was very oppressive ; and on the outer coast a solid broad flat of coral-rock served to break the violence of the open sea .
excepting near the lagoon , where there is some sand , the land is entirely composed of rounded fragments of <name> .
in such a loose , dry , stony soil , the climate of the intertropical regions alone could produce a vigorous vegetation .
on some of the smaller islets nothing could be more elegant than the manner in which the young and full-grown cocoa-nut trees , without destroying each other 's symmetry , were mingled into one wood .
a beach of glittering white sand formed a border to these <name> spots .
i <name> now give a sketch of the natural history of these islands , which , from its very <unk> , possesses a peculiar interest .
the cocoa-nut tree , at first glance , seems to compose the whole wood ; there are however , five or six other trees .
one of these grows to a very large size , but , from the extreme softness of its wood , is useless ; another sort affords excellent timber for ship-building .
besides the trees the number of plants is exceedingly limited and consists of insignificant weeds .
in my collection , which includes , i believe , nearly the perfect <name> , there are twenty species without reckoning a moss , lichen , and fungus .
to this number two trees must be added ; one of which was not in flower , and the other i only heard of .
the latter is a solitary tree of its kind , and grows near the beach , where , without doubt , the one seed was thrown up by the waves .
a <unk> also grows on only one of the islets .
i do not include in the above list the sugar-cane , banana , some other vegetables , fruit-trees , and imported grasses .
as the islands consist entirely of <name> , and at one time must have existed as mere <unk> reefs , all their terrestrial productions must have been transported here by the waves of the sea .
in accordance with this , the <unk> has quite the character of a refuge for the destitute : professor henslow informs me that of the twenty species nineteen belong to different genera , and these again to no less than sixteen families !
( <unk> .
these plants are described in the " annals of natural history " volume 1 1838 <name> 337 . )
in <unk> 's " travels " an account is given , on the authority of mr. <unk> <unk> , who resided twelve months on these islands , of the various seeds and other bodies which have been known to have been washed on shore .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " travels " volume 4 <name> 378 . )
" seeds and plants from sumatra and java have been driven up by the surf on the windward side of the islands .
among them have been found the <unk> , native of sumatra and the peninsula of malacca ; the cocoa-nut of <unk> , known by its shape and size ; the <unk> , which is planted by the malays with the <unk> , the latter <unk> round its trunk , and supporting itself by the prickles on its stem ; the <unk> ; the castor-oil plant ; trunks of the <unk> palm ; and various kinds of seeds unknown to the malays settled on the islands .
these are all supposed to have been driven by the north-west monsoon to the coast of new holland , and thence to these islands by the south-east trade-wind .
large masses of java teak and yellow wood have also been found , besides immense trees of red and white cedar , and the blue <unk> of new holland , in a perfectly sound condition .
all the hardy seeds , such as creepers , retain their germinating power , but the softer kinds , among which is the <unk> , are destroyed in the passage .
<unk> , apparently from java , have at times been washed on shore . "
it is interesting thus to discover how numerous the seeds are , which , coming from several countries , are drifted over the wide ocean .
professor henslow tells me he believes that nearly all the plants which i brought from these islands are common littoral species in the east indian archipelago .
from the direction , however , of the winds and currents , it seems scarcely possible that they could have come here in a direct line .
if , as suggested with much probability by mr. <unk> , they were first carried towards the coast of new holland , and thence drifted back together with the productions of that country , the seeds , before germinating , must have travelled between <unk> and <unk> miles .
chamisso , when describing the <unk> archipelago , situated in the western part of the pacific , states that " the sea brings to these islands the seeds and fruits of many trees , most of which have yet not grown here .
the greater part of these seeds appear to have not yet lost the capability of growing . "
( <unk> .
kotzebue 's " first voyage " volume 3 <name> 155 . )
it is also said that palms and bamboos from somewhere in the torrid zone , and trunks of northern firs , are washed on shore ; these firs must have come from an immense distance .
these facts are highly interesting .
it can not be doubted that , if there were land-birds to pick up the seeds when first cast on shore , and a soil better adapted for their growth than the loose blocks of <name> , the most isolated of the lagoon islands would in time possess a far more abundant <name> than they now have .
the list of land animals is even poorer than that of the plants .
some of the islets are inhabited by rats , which were brought in a ship from the mauritius , wrecked here .
these rats are considered by mr. waterhouse as identical with the english kind , but they are smaller , and more brightly coloured .
there are no true land-birds , for a snipe and a rail ( <unk> <unk> ) , though living entirely in the dry herbage , belong to the order of waders .
birds of this order are said to occur on several of the small low islands in the pacific .
at ascension , where there is no <unk> , a rail ( <unk> <unk> ) was shot near the summit of the mountain , and it was evidently a solitary <unk> .
at <name> <unk> , where , according to <unk> , there are only two land-birds , there is a <unk> .
from these facts i believe that the waders , after the innumerable <unk> species , are generally the first colonists of small isolated islands .
i may add that whenever i noticed birds , not of oceanic species , very far out at sea , they always belonged to this order ; and hence they would naturally become the earliest colonists of any remote point of land .
of reptiles i saw only one small lizard .
of insects i took pains to collect every kind .
exclusive of spiders , which were numerous , there were thirteen species .
( <unk> .
the thirteen species belong to the following orders :  in the coleoptera , a minute <unk> ; orthoptera , a gryllus and a <unk> ; <unk> , one species ; homoptera , two ; neuroptera , a <unk> ; hymenoptera , two ants ; lepidoptera <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> ( ?
) ; diptera , two species . )
of these one only was a beetle .
a small ant swarmed by thousands under the loose dry blocks of <name> , and was the only true insect which was abundant .
although the productions of the land are thus scanty , if we look to the waters of the surrounding sea the number of organic beings is indeed infinite .
chamisso has described the natural history of a <unk> in the <unk> archipelago ( <unk> .
kotzebue 's " first voyage " volume 3 <name> 222 .
) ; and it is remarkable how closely its inhabitants , in number and kind , resemble those of keeling island .
there is one lizard and two waders , namely , a snipe and <unk> .
of plants there are nineteen species , including a <name> ; and some of these are the same with those growing here , though on a spot so immensely remote , and in a different ocean .
the long strips of land , forming the linear islets , have been raised only to that height to which the surf can throw fragments of <name> , and the wind heap up calcareous sand .
the solid flat of <name> rock on the outside , by its breadth , breaks the first violence of the waves , which otherwise , in a day , would sweep away these islets and all their productions .
the ocean and the land seem here struggling for mastery : although <name> <unk> has obtained a footing , the <unk> of the water think their claim at least equally good .
in every part one meets hermit crabs of more than one species , carrying on their backs the shells which they have stolen from the neighbouring beach .
( <unk> .
the large claws or pincers of some of these crabs are most beautifully adapted , when drawn back , to form an <unk> to the shell , nearly as perfect as the proper one originally belonging to the <unk> animal .
i was assured , and as far as my observations went i found it so , that certain species of the <unk> always use certain species of shells . )
overhead numerous <unk> , <unk> , and terns , rest on the trees ; and the wood , from the many nests and from the smell of the atmosphere , might be called a <unk> .
the <unk> , sitting on their rude nests , gaze at one with a stupid yet angry air .
the <unk> , as their name expresses , are silly little creatures .
but there is one charming bird : it is a small , snow-white <unk> , which smoothly hovers at the distance of a few feet above one 's head , its large black eye scanning , with quiet curiosity , your expression .
little imagination is required to fancy that so light and delicate a body must be tenanted by some wandering <name> spirit .
<name> , <name> 3 , 1836 .
after service i accompanied captain fitz <name> to the settlement , situated at the distance of some miles , on the point of an islet thickly covered with tall cocoa-nut trees .
captain <name> and mr. <unk> live in a large <unk> house open at both ends , and lined with mats made of woven bark .
the houses of the malays are arranged along the shore of the lagoon .
the whole place had rather a desolate aspect , for there were no gardens to show the signs of care and cultivation .
the natives belong to different islands in the east indian archipelago , but all speak the same language : we saw the inhabitants of borneo , <unk> , java , and sumatra .
in colour they resemble the tahitians , from whom they do not widely differ in features .
some of the women , however , show a good deal of the chinese character .
i liked both their general expressions and the sound of their voices .
they appeared poor , and their houses were destitute of furniture ; but it was evident from the <unk> of the little children , that <unk> and turtle afford no bad sustenance .
on this island the wells are situated from which ships obtain water .
at first sight it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water should regularly ebb and flow with the tides ; and it has even been imagined that sand has the power of <unk> the salt from the sea-water .
these ebbing wells are common on some of the low islands in the west indies .
the compressed sand , or porous <name> rock , is <unk> like a sponge with the salt water , but the rain which falls on the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea , and must accumulate there , <unk> an equal bulk of the salt water .
as the water in the lower part of the great <unk> <name> mass rises and falls with the tides , so <name> the water near the surface ; and this <name> keep fresh , if the mass be sufficiently compact to prevent much mechanical <unk> ; but where the land consists of great loose blocks of <name> with open interstices , if a well be dug , the water , as i have seen , is brackish .
after dinner we stayed to see a curious half superstitious scene acted by the malay women .
a large wooden spoon dressed in garments , and which had been carried to the grave of a dead man , they pretend becomes inspired at the full of the moon , and <name> dance and jump about .
after the proper preparations , the spoon , held by two women , became convulsed , and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding children and women .
it was a most foolish spectacle ; but mr. <unk> maintained that many of the malays believed in its spiritual movements .
the dance did not commence till the moon had risen , and it was well worth remaining to behold her bright orb so quietly shining through the long arms of the cocoa-nut trees as they waved in the evening breeze .
these scenes of the tropics are in themselves so delicious that they almost equal those dearer ones at home , to which we are bound by each best feeling of the mind .
the next day i employed myself in examining the very interesting , yet simple structure and origin of these islands .
the water being unusually smooth , i waded over the outer flat of dead rock as far as the living mounds of <name> , on which the swell of the open sea breaks .
in some of the gullies and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured fishes , and the form and tints of many of the <unk> were admirable .
it is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite <name> of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics , so prodigal of life , <unk> ; yet i must confess i think those naturalists who have described , in well-known words , the submarine <unk> decked with a thousand beauties , have indulged in rather <unk> language .
<name> 6 , 1836 .
i accompanied captain fitz <name> to an island at the head of the lagoon : the channel was exceedingly intricate , winding through fields of delicately branched corals .
we saw several turtle and two boats were then employed in catching them .
the water was so clear and shallow , that although at first a turtle quickly dives out of sight , yet in a canoe or boat under sail the pursuers after no very long <name> come up to it .
a man standing ready in the bow at this moment dashes through the water upon the turtle 's back ; then clinging with both hands by the shell of its neck , he is carried away till the animal becomes exhausted and is secured .
it was quite an interesting <name> to see the two boats thus doubling about , and the men dashing head foremost into the water trying to seize their prey .
captain moresby informs me that in the chagos archipelago in this same ocean , the natives , by a horrible process , take the shell from the back of the living turtle .
" it is covered with burning charcoal , which causes the outer shell to curl upwards , it is then forced off with a knife , and before it becomes cold flattened between boards .
after this barbarous process the animal is suffered to regain its native element , where , after a certain time , a new shell is formed ; it is , however , too thin to be of any service , and the animal always appears languishing and sickly . "
when we arrived at the head of the lagoon we crossed a narrow islet and found a great surf breaking on the windward coast .
i can hardly explain the reason , but there is to my mind much grandeur in the view of the outer shores of these lagoon-islands .
there is a simplicity in the <unk> beach , the margin of green bushes and tall <unk> , the solid flat of dead coral-rock , strewed here and there with great loose fragments , and the line of furious breakers , all rounding away towards either hand .
the ocean throwing its waters over the broad reef appears an invincible , all-powerful enemy ; yet we see it resisted , and even conquered , by means which at first seem most weak and inefficient .
it is not that the ocean spares the rock of <name> ; the great fragments scattered over the reef , and heaped on the beach , whence the tall cocoa-nut springs , plainly <unk> the <unk> power of the waves .
nor are any periods of repose granted .
the long swell caused by the gentle but steady action of the trade-wind , always blowing in one direction over a wide area , causes breakers , almost equalling in force those during a <name> of wind in the temperate regions , and which never cease to rage .
it is impossible to behold these waves without feeling a conviction that an island , though built of the hardest rock , let it be porphyry , granite , or quartz , would ultimately yield and be demolished by such an irresistible power .
yet these low , insignificant <unk> stand and are victorious : for here another power , as an antagonist , takes part in the contest .
the organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of lime , one by one , from the foaming breakers , and unite them into a symmetrical structure .
let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge fragments ; yet what <name> that tell against the accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day , month after month ?
thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a <unk> , through the agency of the vital laws , conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the <name> of man nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist .
we did not return on board till late in the evening , for we stayed a long time in the lagoon , examining the fields of <name> and the gigantic shells of the <unk> , into which , if a man were to put his hand , he would not , as long as the animal lived , be able to withdraw it .
near the head of the lagoon i was much surprised to find a wide area , considerably more than a mile square , covered with a forest of delicately branching corals , which , though standing upright , were all dead and rotten .
at first i was quite at a loss to understand the cause ; afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following rather curious combination of circumstances .
it should , however , first be stated , that corals are not able to survive even a short exposure in the air to the <unk> rays , so that their upward limit of growth is determined by that of lowest water at spring tides .
it appears , from some old charts , that the long island to windward was formerly separated by wide channels into several islets ; this fact is likewise indicated by the trees being younger on these portions .
under the former condition of the reef , a strong breeze , by throwing more water over the barrier , would tend to raise the level of the lagoon .
now it acts in a directly contrary manner ; for the water within the lagoon not only is not increased by currents from the outside , but is itself blown outwards by the force of the wind .
hence it is observed that the tide near the head of the lagoon does not rise so high during a strong breeze as it does when it is calm .
this difference of level , although no doubt very small , has , i believe , caused the death of those <unk> , which under the former and more open condition of the outer reef had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth .
a few miles north of keeling there is another small atoll , the lagoon of which is nearly filled up with <unk> .
captain <name> found embedded in the conglomerate on the outer coast a well-rounded fragment of greenstone , rather larger than a man's head : he and the men with him were so much surprised at this , that they brought it away and preserved it as a curiosity .
the occurrence of this one stone , where every other particle of matter is calcareous , certainly is very puzzling .
the island has scarcely ever been visited , nor is it probable that a ship had been wrecked there .
from the absence of any better explanation , i came to the conclusion that it must have come entangled in the roots of some large tree : when , however , i considered the great distance from the nearest land , the combination of chances against a stone thus being entangled , the tree washed into the sea , floated so far , then landed safely , and the stone finally so embedded as to allow of its discovery , i was almost afraid of imagining a means of transport apparently so improbable .
it was therefore with great interest that i found chamisso , the justly distinguished naturalist who accompanied kotzebue , stating that the inhabitants of the <unk> archipelago , a group of lagoon islands in the midst of the pacific , obtained stones for sharpening their instruments by searching the roots of trees which are cast upon the beach .
it <name> be evident that this must have happened several times , since laws have been established that such stones belong to the chief , and a punishment is inflicted on any one who attempts to steal them .
when the isolated position of these small islands in the midst of a vast ocean  their great distance from any land excepting that of <name> formation , attested by the value which the inhabitants , who are such bold navigators , attach to a stone of any kind  and the slowness of the currents of the open sea , are all considered , the occurrence of pebbles thus transported does appear wonderful .
( <unk> .
some natives carried by kotzebue to <unk> collected stones to take back to their country . )
stones may often be thus carried ; and if the island on which they are stranded is constructed of any other substance besides <name> , they would scarcely attract attention , and their origin at least would never be guessed .
moreover , this agency may long escape discovery from the probability of trees , especially those loaded with stones , floating beneath the surface .
in the channels of <name> <name> fuego large quantities of drift timber are cast upon the beach , yet it is extremely rare to meet a tree swimming on the water .
these facts may possibly throw light on single stones , whether angular or rounded , occasionally found embedded in fine sedimentary masses .
during another day i visited west islet , on which the vegetation was perhaps more luxuriant than on any other .
the cocoa-nut trees generally grow separate , but here the young ones flourished beneath their tall parents , and formed with their long and curved fronds the most shady <unk> .
those alone who have tried it know how delicious it is to be seated in such shade , and drink the cool pleasant fluid of the cocoa-nut .
in this island there is a large <unk> space , composed of the finest white sand : it is quite level and is only covered by the tide at high water ; from this large bay smaller creeks penetrate the surrounding woods .
to see a field of glittering white sand representing water , with the cocoa-nut trees extending their tall and waving trunks round the margin , formed a singular and very pretty view .
i have before alluded to a crab which lives on the <unk> ; it is very common on all parts of the dry land , and grows to a monstrous size : it is closely allied or identical with the <unk> <unk> .
the front pair of legs terminate in very strong and heavy pincers , and the last pair are fitted with others weaker and much narrower .
it would at first be thought quite impossible for a crab to open a strong cocoa-nut covered with the husk ; but mr. <unk> assures me that he has repeatedly seen this effected .
the crab begins by tearing the husk , fibre by fibre , and always from that end under which the three <unk> are situated ; when this is completed , the crab commences hammering with its heavy claws on one of the <unk> till an opening is made .
then turning round its body , by the aid of its posterior and narrow pair of pincers it extracts the white albuminous substance .
i think this is as curious a case of instinct as ever i heard of , and likewise of adaptation in structure between two objects apparently so remote from each other in the scheme of nature as a crab and a cocoa-nut tree .
the <unk> is <unk> in its habits ; but every night it is said to pay a visit to the sea , no doubt for the purpose of <unk> its branchiae .
the young are likewise hatched , and live for some time , on the coast .
these crabs inhabit deep burrows , which they hollow out beneath the roots of trees ; and where they accumulate surprising quantities of the picked fibres of the cocoa-nut husk , on which they rest as on a bed .
the malays sometimes take advantage of this , and collect the fibrous mass to use as junk .
these crabs are very good to eat ; moreover , under the tail of the larger ones there is a mass of fat , which , when melted , sometimes yields as much as a <unk> of limpid oil .
it has been stated by some authors that the <unk> crawls up the cocoa-nut trees for the purpose of stealing the nuts : i very much doubt the possibility of this ; but with the <unk> the task would be very much easier .
( <unk> .
see " proceedings of the zoological society " 1832 <name> 17 . )
i was told by mr. <unk> that on these islands the <unk> lives only on the nuts which have fallen to the ground .
captain moresby informs me that this crab inhabits the chagos and <unk> groups , but not the neighbouring maldiva archipelago .
it formerly abounded at mauritius , but only a few small ones are now found there .
in the pacific this species , or one with closely allied habits , is said to inhabit a single <name> island north of the society group .
( <unk> .
<unk> and <name> " voyage " etc .
volume 2 <name> 33 . )
to show the wonderful strength of the front pair of pincers , i may mention that captain moresby confined one in a strong tin box , which had held biscuits , the lid being secured with wire ; but the crab turned down the edges and escaped .
in turning down the edges it actually punched many small holes quite through the tin !
i was a good deal surprised by finding two species of <name> of the genus millepora ( m. <unk> and <unk> ) , possessed of the power of stinging .
the stony branches or plates , when taken fresh from the water , have a harsh feel and are not slimy , although possessing a strong and disagreeable smell .
the stinging property seems to vary in different specimens : when a piece was pressed or rubbed on the tender skin of the face or arm , a pricking sensation was usually caused , which came on after the interval of a second , and lasted only for a few minutes .
one day , however , by merely touching my face with one of the branches , pain was instantaneously caused ; it increased as usual after a few seconds , and remaining sharp for some minutes , was perceptible for half an hour afterwards .
the sensation was as bad as that from a <unk> , but more like that caused by the <unk> or portuguese man-of-war .
little red spots were produced on the tender skin of the arm , which appeared as if they would have formed watery <unk> , but did not .
m. quoy mentions this case of the millepora ; and i have heard of stinging corals in the west indies .
many <name> animals seem to have this power of stinging : besides the portuguese man-of-war , many <unk> , and the <unk> or <unk> of the cape de verd islands , it is stated in the " voyage of the <unk> " that an <unk> or <unk> , as well as a flexible coralline allied to <unk> , both possess this means of offence or defence .
in the east indian sea a stinging sea-weed is said to be found .
two species of fish , of the genus <unk> , which are common here , exclusively feed on <name> : both are coloured of a splendid <unk> , one living invariably in the lagoon , and the other amongst the outer breakers .
mr. <unk> assured us that he had repeatedly seen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the tops of the <name> branches : i opened the intestines of several and found them distended with yellowish calcareous <name> mud .
the slimy disgusting <unk> ( allied to our <unk> ) , which the chinese <unk> are so fond of , also feed largely , as i am informed by dr. <name> , on corals ; and the bony apparatus within their bodies seems well adapted for this end .
these <unk> , the fish , the numerous burrowing shells , and <unk> worms , which <unk> every block of dead <name> , must be very efficient agents in producing the fine white mud which lies at the bottom and on the shores of the lagoon .
a portion , however , of this mud , which when wet resembled pounded chalk , was found by professor ehrenberg to be partly composed of <unk> infusoria .
<name> 12 , 1836 .
in the morning we stood out of the lagoon on our passage to the isle of <name> .
i am glad we have visited these islands : such formations surely rank high amongst the wonderful objects of this world .
captain fitz <name> found no bottom with a line <unk> feet in length , at the distance of only <unk> yards from the shore ; hence this island forms a lofty submarine mountain , with sides steeper even than those of the most abrupt volcanic cone .
the <unk> summit is nearly ten miles across ; and every single atom , from the least particle to the largest fragment of rock , in this great pile , which however is small compared with very many other lagoon islands , bears the stamp of having been subjected to organic arrangement .
( <unk> .
i exclude , of course , some soil which has been imported here in vessels from malacca and java , and likewise some small fragments of pumice , drifted here by the waves .
the one block of greenstone , moreover , on the northern island must be excepted . )
we feel surprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the pyramids and other great ruins , but how utterly insignificant are the greatest of these , when compared to these mountains of stone accumulated by the agency of various minute and tender animals !
this is a wonder which does not at first strike the eye of the body , but , after reflection , the eye of reason .

<unk> island . )
i <name> now give a very brief account of the three great classes of coral-reefs ; namely , atolls , barrier , and fringing reefs , and <name> explain my views on their formation .
( <unk> .
these were first read before the geological society in may 1837 and have since been developed in a separate volume on the " structure and distribution of <name> reefs . " )
almost every voyager who has crossed the pacific has expressed his unbounded astonishment at the lagoon islands , or as i shall for the future call them by their indian name of atolls , and has attempted some explanation .
even as long ago as the year <unk> , <unk> de <unk> well exclaimed , " c'est une <unk> de <unk> <unk> de ces <unk> , <unk> d'un grand banc de <name> tout <unk> , <unk> <unk> point <unk> <unk> . "
the accompanying sketch of <unk> island in the pacific , copied from captain <unk> admirable " voyage " ( plate 93 ) , gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of an atoll : it is one of the smallest size , and has its narrow islets united together in a ring .
the immensity of the ocean , the fury of the breakers , contrasted with the lowness of the land and the smoothness of the bright green water within the lagoon , can hardly be imagined without having been seen .
the earlier voyagers fancied that the <unk> animals instinctively built up their great circles to afford themselves protection in the inner parts ; but so far is this from the truth that those massive kinds , to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the very existence of the reef depends , can not live within the lagoon , where other <unk> kinds flourish .
moreover , on this view , many species of distinct genera and families are supposed to combine for one end ; and of such a combination , not a single instance can be found in the whole of nature .
the theory that has been most generally received is that atolls are based on submarine craters ; but when we consider the form and size of some , the number , proximity , and relative positions of others , this idea loses its plausible character : thus <unk> atoll is 44 geographical miles in diameter in one line , by 34 miles in another line ; <unk> is 54 by 20 miles across , and it has a strangely sinuous margin ; bow atoll is 30 miles long , and on an average only 6 in width ; <unk> atoll consists of three atolls united or tied together .
this theory , moreover , is totally <unk> to the northern maldiva atolls in the indian ocean ( one of which is 88 miles in length , and between 10 and 20 in breadth ) , for they are not bounded like ordinary atolls by narrow reefs , but by a vast number of separate little atolls ; other little atolls rising out of the great central <unk> spaces .
a third and better theory was advanced by chamisso , who thought that from the corals growing more vigorously where exposed to the open sea , as undoubtedly is the case , the outer edges would grow up from the general foundation before any other part , and that this would account for the ring or <unk> structure .
but we shall immediately see , that in this , as well as in the <unk> , a most important consideration has been overlooked , namely , on what have the reef-building corals , which can not live at a great depth , based their massive structures ?
numerous soundings were carefully taken by captain fitz <name> on the steep outside of keeling atoll , and it was found that within ten fathoms the prepared tallow at the bottom of the lead invariably came up marked with the impressions of living corals , but as perfectly clean as if it had been dropped on a carpet of turf ; as the depth increased , the impressions became less numerous , but the adhering particles of sand more and more numerous , until at last it was evident that the bottom consisted of a smooth <name> layer ; to <name> on the analogy of the turf , the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner , till at last the soil was so sterile that nothing sprang from it .
from these observations , confirmed by many others , it may be safely inferred that the utmost depth at which corals can construct reefs is between 20 and 30 fathoms .
now there are enormous areas in the pacific and indian oceans in which every single island is of <name> formation , and is raised only to that height to which the waves can throw up fragments , and the winds pile up sand .
thus the <unk> group of atolls is an irregular square , 520 miles long and 240 broad ; the low archipelago is <unk> , 840 miles in its longer , and 420 in its shorter axis : there are other small groups and single low islands between these two archipelagoes , making a linear space of ocean actually more than <unk> miles in length , in which not one single island rises above the specified height .
again , in the indian ocean there is a space of ocean 1500 miles in length , including three archipelagoes , in which every island is low and of <name> formation .
from the fact of the reef-building corals not living at great depths , it is absolutely certain that throughout these vast areas , wherever there is now an atoll , a foundation must have originally existed within a depth of from 20 to 30 fathoms from the surface .
it is improbable in the highest degree that broad , lofty , isolated , <unk> banks of sediment , arranged in groups and lines hundreds of leagues in length , could have been deposited in the central and profoundest parts of the pacific and indian oceans , at an immense distance from any continent , and where the water is perfectly limpid .
it is equally improbable that the elevatory forces should have uplifted throughout the above vast areas , innumerable great <name> banks within 20 to 30 fathoms , or 120 to 180 feet , of the surface of the sea , and not one single point above that level ; for where on the whole face of the globe can we find a single chain of mountains , even a few hundred miles in length , with their many summits rising within a few feet of a given level , and not one pinnacle above it ?
if then the foundations , whence the <unk> corals sprang , were not formed of sediment , and if they were not lifted up to the required level , they must of necessity have subsided into it ; and this at once <unk> the difficulty .
for as mountain after mountain , and island after island , slowly sank beneath the water , fresh bases would be successively afforded for the growth of the corals .
it is impossible here to enter into all the necessary details , but i venture to defy any one to explain in any other manner how it is possible that numerous islands should be distributed throughout vast areas  all the islands being low  all being built of corals , absolutely requiring a foundation within a limited depth from the surface .
( <unk> .
it is remarkable that mr. lyell , even in the first edition of his " principles of geology , " inferred that the amount of subsidence in the pacific must have exceeded that of elevation , from the area of land being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it , namely , the growth of <name> and volcanic action . )
( plate 94 .
barrier-reef , bolabola . )
before explaining how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar structure , we must turn to the second great class , namely , barrier-reefs .
these either extend in straight lines in front of the shores of a continent or of a large island , or they <unk> smaller islands ; in both cases , being separated from the land by a broad and rather deep channel of water , analogous to the lagoon within an atoll .
it is remarkable how little attention has been paid to encircling barrier-reefs ; yet they are truly wonderful structures .
the sketch ( plate 94 ) represents part of the barrier encircling the island of bolabola in the pacific , as seen from one of the central peaks .
in this instance the whole line of reef has been converted into land ; but usually a snow-white line of great breakers , with only here and there a single low islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees , divides the dark heaving waters of the ocean from the light green expanse of the lagoon-channel .
and the quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a fringe of low alluvial soil , loaded with the most beautiful productions of the tropics , and lying at the foot of the wild , abrupt , central mountains .
encircling barrier-reefs are of all sizes , from three miles to no less than forty-four miles in diameter ; and that which fronts one side , and <unk> both ends , of new caledonia , is 400 miles long .
each reef includes one , two , or several <name> islands of various heights ; and in one instance , even as many as twelve separate islands .
the reef runs at a greater or less distance from the included land ; in the society archipelago generally from one to three or four miles ; but at <unk> the reef is 20 miles on the southern side , and 14 miles on the opposite or northern side , from the included islands .
the depth within the lagoon-channel also varies much ; from 10 to 30 fathoms may be taken as an average ; but at vanikoro there are spaces no less than 56 fathoms or 336 feet deep .
internally the reef either slopes gently into the lagoon-channel , or ends in a perpendicular wall sometimes between two and three hundred feet under water in height : externally the reef rises , like an atoll , with extreme abruptness out of the profound depths of the ocean .
what can be more singular than these structures ?
we see an island , which may be compared to a castle situated on the summit of a lofty submarine mountain , protected by a great wall of coral-rock , always steep externally and sometimes internally , with a broad level summit , here and there breached by narrow gateways , through which the largest ships can enter the wide and deep encircling moat .
as far as the actual reef of <name> is concerned , there is not the smallest difference in general size , outline , grouping , and even in quite trifling details of structure , between a barrier and an atoll .
the <unk> <unk> has well remarked that an encircled island is an atoll with high land rising out of its lagoon ; remove the land from within , and a perfect atoll is left .
but what has caused these reefs to spring up at such great distances from the shores of the included islands ?
it can not be that the corals <name> not grow close to the land ; for the shores within the lagoon-channel , when not surrounded by alluvial soil , are often fringed by living reefs ; and we shall presently see that there is a whole class , which i have called fringing-reefs from their close attachment to the shores both of continents and of islands .
again , on what have the reef-building corals , which can not live at great depths , based their encircling structures ?
this is a great apparent difficulty , analogous to that in the case of atolls , which has generally been overlooked .
it <name> be perceived more clearly by inspecting the following sections which are real ones , taken in north and south lines , through the islands with their barrier-reefs , of vanikoro , gambier , and <unk> ; and they are laid down , both vertically and horizontally , on the same scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile .

the horizontal shading shows the barrier-reefs and <unk> .
the inclined shading above the level of the sea ( aa ) shows the actual form of the land ; the inclined shading below this line shows its probable prolongation under water . )
it should be observed that the sections might have been taken in any direction through these islands , or through many other encircled islands , and the general features would have been the same .
now bearing in mind that reef-building <name> can not live at a greater depth than from 20 to 30 fathoms , and that the scale is so small that the <unk> on the right hand show a depth of 200 fathoms , on what are these barrier-reefs based ?
are we to suppose that each island is surrounded by a <unk> submarine ledge of rock , or by a great bank of sediment , ending abruptly where the reef ends ?
if the sea had formerly eaten deeply into the islands , before they were protected by the reefs , thus having left a shallow ledge round them under water , the present shores would have been invariably bounded by great precipices ; but this is most rarely the case .
moreover , on this notion , it is not possible to explain why the corals should have sprung up , like a wall , from the extreme outer margin of the ledge , often leaving a broad space of water within , too deep for the growth of corals .
the accumulation of a wide bank of sediment all round these islands , and generally widest where the included islands are smallest , is highly improbable , considering their exposed positions in the central and deepest parts of the ocean .
in the case of the barrier-reef of new caledonia , which extends for 150 miles beyond the northern point of the island , in the same straight line with which it fronts the west coast , it is hardly possible to believe that a bank of sediment could thus have been <unk> deposited in front of a lofty island , and so far beyond its termination in the open sea .
finally , if we look to other oceanic islands of about the same height and of similar geological constitution , but not encircled by coral-reefs , we may in vain search for so trifling a <unk> depth as 30 fathoms , except quite near to their shores ; for usually land that rises abruptly out of water , as do most of the encircled and <unk> oceanic islands , plunges abruptly under it .
on what then , i repeat , are these barrier reefs based ?
why , with their wide and deep <unk> channels , do they stand so far from the included land ?
we shall soon see how easily these difficulties disappear .
we come now to our third class of fringing-reefs , which <name> require a very short notice .
where the land slopes abruptly under water , these reefs are only a few yards in width , forming a mere ribbon or fringe round the shores : where the land slopes gently under the water the reef extends farther , sometimes even as much as a mile from the land ; but in such cases the soundings outside the reef always show that the submarine prolongation of the land is gently inclined .
in fact the reefs extend only to that distance from the shore at which a foundation within the requisite depth from 20 to 30 fathoms is found .
as far as the actual reef is concerned , there is no essential difference between it and that forming a barrier or an atoll : it is , however , generally of less width , and consequently few islets have been formed on it .
from the corals growing more vigorously on the outside , and from the <unk> effect of the sediment washed inwards , the outer edge of the reef is the highest part , and between it and the land there is generally a shallow <name> channel a few feet in depth .
where banks of sediment have accumulated near to the surface , as in parts of the west indies , they sometimes become fringed with corals , and hence in some degree resemble lagoon-islands or atolls , in the same manner as fringing-reefs , surrounding gently sloping islands , in some degree resemble barrier-reefs .

no theory on the formation of coral-reefs can be considered satisfactory which does not include the three great classes .
we have seen that we are driven to believe in the subsidence of those vast areas , interspersed with low islands , of which not one rises above the height to which the wind and waves can throw up matter , and yet are constructed by animals requiring a foundation , and that foundation to lie at no great depth .
let us then take an island surrounded by fringing-reefs , which offer no difficulty in their structure ; and let this island with its reef , represented by the unbroken lines in plate 96 , slowly subside .
now as the island sinks down , either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly , we may safely infer , from what is known of the conditions favourable to the growth of <name> , that the living masses , bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef , <name> soon regain the surface .
the water , however , <name> encroach little by little on the shore , the island becoming lower and smaller , and the space between the inner edge of the reef and the beach proportionally broader .
a section of the reef and island in this state , after a subsidence of several hundred feet , is given by the dotted lines .
<name> islets are supposed to have been formed on the reef ; and a ship is anchored in the lagoon-channel .
this channel <name> be more or less deep , according to the rate of subsidence , to the amount of sediment accumulated in it , and to the growth of the delicately branched corals which can live there .
the section in this state resembles in every respect one drawn through an encircled island : in fact , it is a real section ( on the scale of <unk> of an inch to a mile ) through bolabola in the pacific .
we can now at once see why encircling barrier-reefs stand so far from the shores which they front .
we can also perceive that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the outer edge of the new reef , to the foundation of solid rock beneath the old <unk> , <name> exceed by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence , that small limit of depth at which the effective corals can live :  the little architects having built up their great <unk> mass , as the whole sank down , upon a basis formed of other corals and their consolidated fragments .
thus the difficulty on this head , which appeared so great , disappears .
if , instead of an island , we had taken the shore of a continent fringed with reefs , and had imagined it to have subsided , a great straight barrier , like that of australia or new caledonia , separated from the land by a wide and deep channel , would evidently have been the result .

let us take our new encircling barrier-reef ( plate 97 ) , of which the section is now represented by unbroken lines , and which , as i have said , is a real section through bolabola , and let it go on subsiding .
as the barrier-reef slowly sinks down , the corals <name> go on vigorously growing upwards ; but as the island sinks , the water <name> gain inch by inch on the shore  the separate mountains first forming separate islands within one great reef  and finally , the last and highest pinnacle disappearing .
the instant this takes place , a perfect atoll is formed : i have said , remove the high land from within an encircling barrier-reef , and an atoll is left , and the land has been removed .
we can now perceive how it comes that atolls , having sprung from encircling barrier-reefs , resemble them in general size , form , in the manner in which they are grouped together , and in their arrangement in single or double lines ; for they may be called rude outline charts of the sunken islands over which they stand .
we can further see how it arises that the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans extend in lines parallel to the generally prevailing strike of the high islands and great <unk> of those oceans .
i venture , therefore , to affirm that on the theory of the upward growth of the corals during the sinking of the land , all the leading features in those wonderful structures , the lagoon-islands or atolls , which have so long excited the attention of voyagers , as well as in the no less wonderful barrier-reefs , whether encircling small islands or stretching for hundreds of miles along the shores of a continent , are simply explained .
( <unk> .
it has been highly satisfactory to me to find the following passage in a pamphlet by mr. couthouy , one of the naturalists in the great antarctic expedition of the united states :  " having personally examined a large number of coral-islands , and resided eight months among the volcanic class having shore and partially encircling reefs , i may be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a conviction of the correctness of the theory of mr .
<name> . "
the naturalists , however , of this expedition differ with me on some points respecting <name> formations . )
( plate 98 .
bolabola island . )
it may be asked whether i can offer any direct evidence of the subsidence of barrier-reefs or atolls ; but it must be borne in mind how difficult it must ever be to detect a movement , the tendency of which is to hide under water the part affected .
nevertheless , at keeling atoll i observed on all sides of the lagoon old cocoa-nut trees undermined and falling ; and in one place the <unk> of a shed , which the inhabitants asserted had stood seven years before just above high-water <name> , but now was daily washed by every tide ; on inquiry i found that three earthquakes , one of them severe , had been felt here during the last ten years .
at vanikoro the lagoon-channel is remarkably deep , scarcely any alluvial soil has accumulated at the foot of the lofty included mountains , and remarkably few islets have been formed by the heaping of fragments and sand on the <unk> barrier reef ; these facts , and some analogous ones , led me to believe that this island must lately have subsided and the reef grown upwards : here again earthquakes are frequent and very severe .
in the society archipelago , on the other hand , where the <unk> are almost choked up , where much low alluvial land has accumulated , and where in some cases long islets have been formed on the barrier-reefs  facts all showing that the islands have not very lately subsided  only feeble shocks are most rarely felt .
in these <name> formations , where the land and water seem struggling for mastery , it must be ever difficult to decide between the effects of a change in the set of the tides and of a slight subsidence : that many of these reefs and atolls are subject to changes of some kind is certain ; on some atolls the islets appear to have increased greatly within a late period ; on others they have been partially or wholly washed away .
the inhabitants of parts of the maldiva archipelago know the date of the first formation of some islets ; in other parts the corals are now flourishing on <unk> reefs , where holes made for graves attest the former existence of inhabited land .
it is difficult to believe in frequent changes in the tidal currents of an open ocean ; whereas we have in the earthquakes recorded by the natives on some atolls , and in the great fissures observed on other atolls , plain evidence of changes and disturbances in progress in the subterranean regions .
it is evident , on our theory , that coasts merely fringed by reefs can not have subsided to any perceptible amount ; and therefore they must , since the growth of their corals , either have remained stationary or have been upheaved .
now it is remarkable how generally it can be shown , by the presence of upraised organic remains , that the fringed islands have been elevated : and so far , this is indirect evidence in favour of our theory .
i was particularly struck with this fact , when i found , to my surprise , that the descriptions given by mm .
quoy and gaimard were applicable , not to reefs in general as implied by them , but only to those of the fringing class ; my surprise , however , ceased when i afterwards found that , by a strange chance , all the several islands visited by these eminent naturalists could be shown by their own statements to have been elevated within a recent geological <name> .
not only the grand features in the structure of barrier-reefs and of atolls , and of their likeness to each other in form , size , and other characters , are explained on the theory of subsidence  which theory we are independently forced to admit in the very areas in question , from the necessity of finding bases for the corals within the requisite depth  but many details in structure and exceptional cases can thus also be simply explained .
i <name> give only a few instances .
in barrier-reefs it has long been remarked with surprise that the passages through the reef exactly face valleys in the included land , even in cases where the reef is separated from the land by a lagoon-channel so wide and so much deeper than the actual passage itself , that it seems hardly possible that the very small quantity of water or sediment brought down could injure the corals on the reef .
now , every reef of the fringing class is breached by a narrow gateway in front of the smallest rivulet , even if dry during the greater part of the year , for the mud , sand , or gravel occasionally washed down kills the corals on which it is deposited .
consequently , when an island thus fringed <unk> , though most of the narrow gateways <name> probably become closed by the outward and upward growth of the corals , yet any that are not closed ( and some must always be kept open by the sediment and impure water flowing out of the lagoon-channel ) <name> still continue to front exactly the upper parts of those valleys at the mouths of which the original basal <unk> was breached .
we can easily see how an island fronted only on one side , or on one side with one end or both ends encircled by barrier-reefs , might after long-continued subsidence be converted either into a single <unk> reef , or into an atoll with a great straight spur projecting from it , or into two or three atolls tied together by straight reefs  all of which exceptional cases actually occur .
as the reef-building corals require food , are preyed upon by other animals , are killed by sediment , can not adhere to a loose bottom , and may be easily carried down to a depth whence they can not spring up again , we need feel no surprise at the reefs both of atolls and barriers becoming in parts imperfect .
the great barrier of new caledonia is thus imperfect and broken in many parts ; hence , after long subsidence , this great reef would not produce one great atoll 400 miles in length , but a chain or archipelago of atolls , of very nearly the same dimensions with those in the maldiva archipelago .
moreover , in an atoll once breached on opposite sides , from the likelihood of the oceanic and tidal currents passing straight through the breaches , it is extremely improbable that the corals , especially during continued subsidence , would ever be able again to unite the rim ; if they did not , as the whole sank downwards , one atoll would be divided into two or more .
in the maldiva archipelago there are distinct atolls so related to each other in position , and separated by channels either unfathomable or very deep ( the channel between <name> and <unk> atolls is 150 fathoms , and that between the north and south <unk> atolls is 200 fathoms in depth ) , that it is impossible to look at a map of them without believing that they were once more intimately related .
and in this same archipelago , <unk> atoll is divided by a <unk> channel from 100 to 132 fathoms in depth , in such a manner that it is scarcely possible to say whether it ought strictly to be called three separate atolls , or one great atoll not yet finally divided .
( plate 99 .
corals . )
i <name> not enter on many more details ; but i must remark that the curious structure of the northern maldiva atolls receives ( taking into consideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken margins ) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the corals , originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons , such as occur in common atolls , and on broken portions of the linear marginal reef , such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form .
i can not refrain from once again remarking on the <unk> of these complex structures  a great <name> and generally concave disk rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean , with its central expanse studded and its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just <unk> the surface of the sea , sometimes clothed with vegetation , and each containing a lake of clear water !
one more point in detail : as in the two neighbouring archipelagoes corals flourish in one and not in the other , and as so many conditions before enumerated must affect their existence , it would be an inexplicable fact if , during the changes to which earth , air , and water are subjected , the reef-building corals were to keep alive for perpetuity on any one spot or area .
and as by our theory the areas including atolls and barrier-reefs are subsiding , we ought occasionally to find reefs both dead and submerged .
in all reefs , owing to the sediment being washed out of the lagoon or lagoon-channel to leeward , that side is least favourable to the long-continued vigorous growth of the corals ; hence dead portions of reef not unfrequently occur on the leeward side ; and these , though still retaining their proper <unk> form , are now in several instances sunk several fathoms beneath the surface .
the chagos group appears from some cause , possibly from the subsidence having been too rapid , at present to be much less favourably circumstanced for the growth of reefs than formerly : one atoll has a portion of its marginal reef , nine miles in length , dead and submerged ; a second has only a few quite small living points which rise to the surface , a third and fourth are entirely dead and submerged ; a fifth is a mere wreck , with its structure almost obliterated .
it is remarkable that in all these cases the dead reefs and portions of reef lie at nearly the same depth , namely , from six to eight fathoms beneath the surface , as if they had been carried down by one uniform movement .
one of these " <unk> atolls , " so called by captain moresby ( to whom i am indebted for much invaluable information ) , is of vast size , namely , ninety nautical miles across in one direction , and seventy miles in another line ; and is in many respects eminently curious .
as by our theory it follows that new atolls <name> generally be formed in each new area of subsidence , two weighty objections might have been raised , namely , that atolls must be increasing indefinitely in number ; and secondly , that in old areas of subsidence each separate atoll must be increasing indefinitely in thickness , if proofs of their occasional destruction could not have been adduced .
thus have we traced the history of these great rings of coral-rock , from their first origin through their normal changes , and through the occasional accidents of their existence , to their death and final obliteration .
in my volume on " <name> formations " i have published a map , in which i have coloured all the atolls <unk> , the barrier-reefs pale-blue , and the fringing reefs red .
these latter reefs have been formed whilst the land has been stationary , or , as appears from the frequent presence of upraised organic remains , whilst it has been slowly rising : atolls and barrier-reefs , on the other hand , have grown up during the directly opposite movement of subsidence , which movement must have been very gradual , and in the case of atolls so vast in amount as to have buried every <unk> over wide <unk> .
now in this map we see that the reefs tinted pale and <unk> , which have been produced by the same order of movement , as a general rule manifestly stand near each other .
again we see that the areas with the two blue tints are of wide extent ; and that they lie separate from extensive lines of coast coloured red , both of which circumstances might naturally have been inferred , on the theory of the nature of the reefs having been governed by the nature of the earth 's movement .
it deserves notice that in more than one instance where single red and blue circles approach near each other , i can show that there have been oscillations of level ; for in such cases the red or fringed circles consist of atolls , originally by our theory formed during subsidence , but subsequently upheaved ; and on the other hand , some of the pale-blue or encircled islands are composed of coral-rock , which must have been uplifted to its present height before that subsidence took place , during which the existing barrier-reefs grew upwards .
authors have noticed with surprise that although atolls are the commonest <unk> throughout some enormous oceanic tracts , they are entirely absent in other seas , as in the west indies : we can now at once perceive the cause , for where there has not been subsidence , atolls can not have been formed ; and in the case of the west indies and parts of the east indies , these tracts are known to have been rising within the recent period .
the larger areas , coloured red and blue , are all elongated ; and between the two colours there is a degree of rude alternation , as if the rising of one had balanced the sinking of the other .
taking into consideration the proofs of recent elevation both on the fringed coasts and on some others ( for instance , in south <name> ) where there are no reefs , we are led to conclude that the great continents are for the most part rising areas : and from the nature of the coral-reefs , that the central parts of the great oceans are sinking areas .
the east indian archipelago , the most broken land in the world , is in most parts an area of elevation , but surrounded and penetrated , probably in more lines than one , by narrow areas of subsidence .
i have marked with vermilion spots all the many known active <unk> within the limits of this same map .
their entire absence from every one of the great subsiding areas , coloured either pale or dark blue , is most striking ; and not less so is the coincidence of the chief volcanic chains with the parts coloured red , which we are led to conclude have either long remained stationary , or more generally have been recently upraised .
although a few of the vermilion spots occur within no great distance of single circles tinted blue , yet not one single active volcano is situated within several hundred miles of an archipelago , or even small group of atolls .
it is , therefore , a striking fact that in the friendly archipelago , which consists of a group of atolls upheaved and since partially worn down , two <unk> , and perhaps more , are historically known to have been in action .
on the other hand , although most of the islands in the pacific which are encircled by barrier-reefs are of volcanic origin , often with the remnants of craters still distinguishable , not one of them is known to have ever been in eruption .
hence in these cases it would appear that <unk> burst forth into action and become extinguished on the same spots , accordingly as elevatory or subsiding movements prevail there .
numberless facts could be adduced to prove that upraised organic remains are common wherever there are active <unk> ; but until it could be shown that in areas of subsidence <unk> were either absent or inactive , the inference , however probable in itself , that their distribution depended on the rising or falling of the earth 's surface , would have been hazardous .
but now , i think , we may freely admit this important deduction .
taking a final view of the map , and bearing in mind the statements made with respect to the upraised organic remains , we must feel astonished at the vastness of the areas which have suffered changes in level either downwards or upwards , within a period not geologically remote .
it would appear also that the elevatory and subsiding movements follow nearly the same laws .
throughout the spaces interspersed with atolls , where not a single peak of high land has been left above the level of the sea , the sinking must have been immense in amount .
the sinking , moreover , whether continuous , or recurrent with intervals sufficiently long for the corals again to bring up their living edifices to the surface , must necessarily have been extremely slow .
this conclusion is probably the most important one which can be deduced from the study of <name> formations ;  and it is one which it is difficult to imagine how otherwise could ever have been arrived at .
nor can i quite pass over the probability of the former existence of large archipelagoes of lofty islands , where now only rings of coral-rock scarcely break the open expanse of the sea , throwing some light on the distribution of the inhabitants of the other high islands , now left standing so immensely remote from each other in the midst of the great oceans .
the <unk> corals have indeed reared and preserved wonderful memorials of the subterranean oscillations of level ; we see in each barrier-reef a proof that the land has there subsided , and in each atoll a monument over an island now lost .
we may thus , like unto a geologist who had lived his ten thousand years and kept a record of the passing changes , gain some insight into the great system by which the surface of this globe has been broken up , and land and water <unk> .

<name> 29 , 1836 .
in the morning we passed round the northern end of mauritius , or the isle of <name> .
from this point of view the aspect of the island equalled the expectations raised by the many well-known descriptions of its beautiful scenery .
the sloping plain of the <unk> , interspersed with houses , and coloured by the large fields of sugar-cane of a bright green , composed the foreground .
the brilliancy of the green was the more remarkable because it is a colour which generally is conspicuous only from a very short distance .
towards the centre of the island groups of wooded mountains rose out of this highly cultivated plain ; their summits , as so commonly happens with ancient volcanic rocks , being jagged into the sharpest points .
masses of white clouds were collected around these pinnacles , as if for the sake of pleasing the stranger 's eye .
the whole island , with its sloping border and central mountains , was adorned with an air of perfect elegance : the scenery , if i may use such an expression , appeared to the sight harmonious .
i spent the greater part of the next day in walking about the town and visiting different people .
the town is of considerable size , and is said to contain 20,000 inhabitants ; the streets are very clean and regular .
although the island has been so many years under the english government , the general character of the place is quite french : englishmen speak to their servants in french , and the shops are all french ; indeed i should think that calais or boulogne was much more <unk> .
there is a very pretty little theatre in which operas are excellently performed .
we were also surprised at seeing large booksellers ' shops , with <unk> shelves ;  music and reading <unk> our approach to the old world of civilisation ; for in truth both australia and <name> are new worlds .
the various races of men walking in the streets afford the most interesting spectacle in port <name> .
convicts from <name> are banished here for life ; at present there are about 800 , and they are employed in various public works .
before seeing these people , i had no idea that the inhabitants of <name> were such <unk> figures .
their skin is extremely dark , and many of the older men had large <unk> and beards of a snow-white colour ; this , together with the fire of their expression , gave them quite an imposing aspect .
the greater number had been banished for murder and the worst crimes ; others for causes which can scarcely be considered as moral faults , such as for not obeying , from superstitious motives , the english laws .
these men are generally quiet and <unk> ; from their outward conduct , their cleanliness and faithful observance of their strange religious rites , it was impossible to look at them with the same eyes as on our wretched convicts in new south wales .
<name> , may 1 , 1836 .
i took a quiet walk along the sea-coast to the north of the town .
the plain in this part is quite uncultivated ; it consists of a field of black lava , smoothed over with coarse grass and bushes , the latter being chiefly <unk> .
the scenery may be described as intermediate in character between that of the galapagos and of tahiti ; but this <name> convey a definite idea to very few persons .
it is a very pleasant country , but it has not the charms of tahiti , or the grandeur of brazil .
the next day i ascended la <unk> , a mountain so called from a <unk> projection , which rises close behind the town to a height of <unk> feet .
the centre of the island consists of a great platform , surrounded by old broken basaltic mountains , with their strata dipping <unk> .
the central platform , formed of comparatively recent streams of lava , is of an oval shape , thirteen geographical miles across in the line of its shorter axis .
the exterior bounding mountains come into that class of structures called craters of elevation , which are supposed to have been formed not like ordinary craters , but by a great and sudden upheaval .
there appear to me to be insuperable objections to this view : on the other hand , i can hardly believe , in this and in some other cases , that these marginal crateriform mountains are merely the basal remnants of immense <unk> , of which the summits either have been blown off or swallowed up in subterranean abysses .
from our elevated position we enjoyed an excellent view over the island .
the country on this side appears pretty well cultivated , being divided into fields and studded with farm-houses .
i was however assured that of the whole land not more than half is yet in a productive state ; if such be the case , considering the present large export of sugar , this island , at some future period when thickly peopled , <name> be of great value .
since england has taken possession of it , a period of only twenty-five years , the export of sugar is said to have increased seventy-five fold .
one great cause of its prosperity is the excellent state of the roads .
in the neighbouring isle of bourbon , which remains under the french government , the roads are still in the same miserable state as they were here only a few years ago .
although the french residents must have largely profited by the increased prosperity of their island , yet the english government is far from popular .
may 3 , 1836 .
in the evening captain <name> , the <unk> , so well known from his examination of the isthmus of panama , invited mr. stokes and myself to his <unk> , which is situated on the edge of <unk> plains , and about six miles from the port .
we stayed at this delightful place two days ; standing nearly 800 feet above the sea , the air was cool and fresh , and on every side there were delightful walks .
close by a grand ravine has been worn to a depth of about 500 feet through the slightly inclined streams of lava , which have flowed from the central platform .
may 5 , 1836 .
captain <name> took us to the <unk> <unk> , which is several miles to the southward , that i might examine some rocks of elevated <name> .
we passed through pleasant gardens , and fine fields of sugar-cane growing amidst huge blocks of lava .
the roads were bordered by hedges of <unk> , and near many of the houses there were avenues of the mango .
some of the views where the peaked hills and the cultivated farms were seen together , were exceedingly picturesque ; and we were constantly tempted to exclaim " how pleasant it would be to pass one 's life in such quiet abodes ! "
captain <name> possessed an elephant , and he sent it half-way with us , that we might enjoy a ride in true indian fashion .
the circumstance which surprised me most was its quite noiseless step .
this elephant is the only one at present on the island ; but it is said others <name> be sent for .
may 9 , 1836 .
( plate 102 .
st .
<name> . )
we sailed from port <name> , and , calling at the cape of good <name> , on the 8th of july we arrived off st. <name> .
this island , the forbidding aspect of which has been so often described , rises abruptly like a huge black castle from the ocean .
near the town , as if to complete nature 's defence , small forts and guns fill up every gap in the rugged rocks .
the town runs up a flat and narrow valley ; the houses look respectable , and are interspersed with a very few green trees .
when approaching the anchorage there was one striking view : an irregular castle perched on the summit of a lofty hill , and surrounded by a few scattered fir-trees , boldly projected against the sky .
the next day i obtained lodgings within a stone 's throw of <name> 's tomb ; it was a capital central situation , whence i could make excursions in every direction .
( <unk> .
after the volumes of eloquence which have poured forth on this subject , it is dangerous even to mention the tomb .
a modern traveller , in twelve lines , burdens the poor little island with the following titles ,  it is a grave , tomb , pyramid , cemetery , sepulchre , <unk> , sarcophagus , <unk> , and mausoleum ! )
during the four days i stayed here i wandered over the island from morning to night and examined its geological history .
my lodgings were situated at a height of about 2000 feet ; here the weather was cold and boisterous , with constant showers of rain ; and every now and then the whole scene was veiled in thick clouds .
near the coast the rough lava is quite bare : in the central and higher parts feldspathic rocks by their decomposition have produced a <unk> soil , which , where not covered by vegetation , is stained in broad bands of many bright colours .
at this season the land , moistened by constant showers , produces a singularly bright green pasture , which lower and lower down gradually fades away and at last disappears .
in latitude 16 degrees , and at the trifling elevation of 1500 feet , it is surprising to behold a vegetation possessing a character decidedly british .
the hills are crowned with irregular plantations of scotch firs ; and the sloping banks are thickly scattered over with thickets of gorse , covered with its bright yellow flowers .
<unk> are common on the banks of the rivulets , and the hedges are made of the <unk> , producing its well-known fruit .
when we consider that the number of plants now found on the island is <unk> , and that out of these fifty-two alone are indigenous species , the rest having been imported , and most of them from england , we see the reason of the british character of the vegetation .
many of these english plants appear to flourish better than in their native country ; some also from the opposite quarter of australia succeed remarkably well .
the many imported species must have destroyed some of the native kinds ; and it is only on the highest and steepest ridges that the indigenous <name> is now predominant .
the english , or rather welsh character of the scenery , is kept up by the numerous cottages and small white houses ; some buried at the bottom of the deepest valleys , and others mounted on the crests of the lofty hills .
some of the views are striking , for instance that from near sir w. <unk> 's house , where the bold peak called lot is seen over a dark wood of firs , the whole being backed by the red water-worn mountains of the southern coast .
on viewing the island from an eminence , the first circumstance which strikes one is the number of the roads and forts : the labour bestowed on the public works , if one forgets its character as a prison , seems out of all proportion to its extent or value .
there is so little level or useful land that it seems surprising how so many people , about <unk> , can subsist here .
the lower orders , or the emancipated slaves , are , i believe , extremely poor : they complain of the want of work .
from the reduction in the number of public servants , owing to the island having been given up by the east <name> company , and the consequent emigration of many of the richer people , the poverty probably <name> increase .
the chief food of the working class is rice with a little salt meat ; as neither of these articles are the products of the island , but must be purchased with money , the low wages tell heavily on the poor people .
now that the people are blessed with freedom , a right which i believe they value fully , it seems probable that their <name> <name> quickly increase : if so , what is to become of the little state of st. <name> ?
my guide was an elderly man who had been a <unk> when a boy , and knew every step amongst the rocks .
he was of a race many times crossed , and although with a dusky skin , he had not the disagreeable expression of a mulatto .
he was a very civil , quiet old man , and such appears the character of the greater number of the lower classes .
it was strange to my ears to hear a man , nearly white and <unk> dressed , talking with indifference of the times when he was a slave .
with my companion , who carried our dinners and a horn of water , which is quite necessary , as all the water in the lower valleys is saline , i every day took long walks .
beneath the upper and central green circle , the wild valleys are quite desolate and <unk> .
here , to the geologist , there were scenes of high interest , showing successive changes and complicated disturbances .
according to my views , st. <name> has existed as an island from a very remote epoch : some obscure proofs , however , of the elevation of the land are still extant .
i believe that the central and highest peaks form parts of the rim of a great crater , the southern half of which has been entirely removed by the waves of the sea : there is , moreover , an external wall of black basaltic rocks , like the <unk> of mauritius , which are older than the central volcanic streams .
on the higher parts of the island considerable <name> of a shell , long thought to be a <name> species , occur imbedded in the soil .
it proves to be a <unk> , or <unk> of a very peculiar form ; with it i found six other kinds ; and in another spot an eighth species .
( <unk> .
it deserves notice that all the many specimens of this shell found by me in one spot differ as a marked variety from another set of specimens procured from a different spot . )
it is remarkable that none of them are now found living .
their extinction has probably been caused by the entire destruction of the woods , and the consequent loss of food and shelter , which occurred during the early part of the last century .
the history of the changes which the elevated plains of <unk> and <unk> have undergone , as given in general <unk> 's account of the island , is extremely curious .
both plains , it is said , in former times were covered with wood , and were therefore called the great wood .
so late as the year <unk> there were many trees , but in <unk> the old trees had mostly fallen ; and as goats and hogs had been suffered to range about , all the young trees had been killed .
it appears also from the official records that the trees were unexpectedly , some years afterwards , succeeded by a wire grass which spread over the whole surface .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " st. <name> " introductory chapter <name> 4 . )
general <unk> adds that now this plain " is covered with fine <unk> , and is become the finest piece of pasture on the island . "
the extent of surface , probably covered by wood at a former period , is estimated at no less than two thousand acres ; at the present day scarcely a single tree can be found there .
it is also said that in 1709 there were quantities of dead trees in <name> bay ; this place is now so utterly desert that nothing but so well attested an account could have made me believe that they could ever have grown there .
the fact that the goats and hogs destroyed all the young trees as they sprang up , and that in the course of time the old ones , which were safe from their attacks , perished from age , seems clearly made out .
goats were introduced in the year <unk> ; <unk> years afterwards , in the time of <unk> , it is known that they were exceedingly numerous .
more than a century afterwards , in <unk> , when the evil was complete and <unk> , an order was issued that all stray animals should be destroyed .
it is very interesting thus to find that the arrival of animals at st. <name> in <unk> did not change the whole aspect of the island , until a period of two hundred and twenty years had elapsed : for the goats were introduced in <unk> , and in <unk> it is said " the old trees had mostly fallen . "
there can be little doubt that this great change in the vegetation affected not only the land-shells , causing eight species to become extinct , but likewise a multitude of insects .
st. <name> , situated so remote from any continent , in the midst of a great ocean , and possessing a unique <name> , excites our curiosity .
the eight land-shells , though now extinct , and one living <unk> , are peculiar species found nowhere else .
mr. cuming , however , informs me that an english helix is common here , its eggs no doubt having been imported in some of the many introduced plants .
mr. cuming collected on the coast sixteen species of sea-shells , of which seven , as far as he knows , are confined to this island .
birds and insects , as might have been expected , are very few in number ; indeed i believe all the birds have been introduced within late years .
( <unk> .
among these few insects i was surprised to find a small <unk> ( <unk> .
<unk> . )
and an <unk> , both extremely numerous under <name> .
when the island was discovered it certainly possessed no quadruped excepting perhaps a mouse : it becomes , therefore , a difficult point to ascertain , whether these <unk> insects have since been imported by accident , or if aborigines , on what food they formerly subsisted .
on the banks of the plata , where , from the vast number of cattle and horses , the fine plains of turf are richly manured , it is vain to seek the many kinds of <unk> beetles which occur so abundantly in europe .
i observed only an <unk> ( the insects of this genus in europe generally feed on decayed vegetable matter ) and two species of <unk> , common in such situations .
on the opposite side of the cordillera in chiloe another species of <unk> is exceedingly abundant , and it buries the <name> of the cattle in large earthen balls beneath the ground .
there is reason to believe that the genus <unk> , before the introduction of cattle , acted as <unk> to man .
in europe beetles which find support in the matter which has already contributed towards the life of other and larger animals , are so numerous that there must be considerably more than one hundred different species .
considering this , and observing what a quantity of food of this kind is lost on the plains of la plata , i imagined i saw an instance where man had disturbed that chain by which so many animals are linked together in their native country .
in van diemen 's land , however , i found four species of <unk> , two of <unk> , and one of a third genus , very abundant under the <name> of cows ; yet these latter animals had been then introduced only thirty-three years .
previous to that time the kangaroo and some other small animals were the only quadrupeds ; and their <name> is of a very different quality from that of their successors introduced by man .
in england the greater number of <unk> beetles are confined in their appetites ; that is , they do not depend indifferently on any quadruped for the means of subsistence .
the change , therefore , in habits which must have taken place in van diemen 's land is highly remarkable .
i am indebted to the reverend <unk> .
<name> , who , i <name> , <name> permit me to call him my master in entomology , for giving me the names of the foregoing insects . )
partridges and pheasants are tolerably abundant ; the island is much too english not to be subject to strict <unk> .
i was told of a more unjust sacrifice to such <unk> than i ever heard of even in england .
the poor people formerly used to burn a plant which grows on the <unk> , and export the soda from its ashes ; but a peremptory order came out <unk> this practice , and giving as a reason that the partridges would have nowhere to build !
in my walks i passed more than once over the grassy plain , bounded by deep valleys , on which <unk> stands .
viewed from a short distance , it appears like a respectable gentleman 's <unk> .
in front there are a few cultivated fields , and beyond them the smooth hill of coloured rocks called the flagstaff , and the rugged square black mass of the barn .
on the whole the view was rather bleak and uninteresting .
the only inconvenience i suffered during my walks was from the impetuous winds .
one day i noticed a curious circumstance : standing on the edge of a plain , terminated by a great <name> of about a thousand feet in depth , i saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward , some <unk> , struggling against a very strong breeze , whilst , where i stood , the air was quite calm .
approaching close to the brink , where the current seemed to be deflected upwards from the face of the <name> , i stretched out my arm , and immediately felt the full force of the wind : an invisible barrier , two yards in width , separated perfectly calm air from a strong blast .
i so much enjoyed my rambles among the rocks and mountains of st. <name> that i felt almost sorry on the morning of the 14th to descend to the town .
before noon i was on board , and the " beagle " made sail .
on the 19th of july we reached ascension .
those who have beheld a volcanic island situated under an arid climate <name> at once be able to picture to themselves the appearance of ascension .
they <name> imagine smooth conical hills of a bright red colour , with their summits generally truncated , rising separately out of a level surface of black rugged lava .
a principal mound in the centre of the island seems the father of the lesser cones .
it is called green hill : its name being taken from the faintest tinge of that colour , which at this time of the year is barely perceptible from the anchorage .
to complete the desolate scene , the black rocks on the coast are lashed by a wild and turbulent sea .
the settlement is near the beach ; it consists of several houses and barracks placed irregularly , but well built of white <unk> .
the only inhabitants are marines , and some negroes liberated from <unk> , who are paid and <unk> by government .
there is not a private person on the island .
many of the marines appeared well contented with their situation ; they think it better to serve their <unk> years on shore , let it be what it may , than in a ship ; in this choice , if i were a <name> , i should most heartily agree .
the next morning i ascended green hill , <unk> feet high , and thence walked across the island to the windward point .
a good <unk> leads from the <unk> to the houses , gardens , and fields , placed near the summit of the central mountain .
on the roadside there are <unk> , and likewise <unk> , where each thirsty passer-by can drink some good water .
similar care is displayed in each part of the establishment , and especially in the management of the springs , so that a single drop of water may not be lost : indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order .
i could not help , when admiring the active industry which had created such effects out of such means , at the same time <unk> that it had been wasted on so poor and trifling an end .
m. lesson has remarked with justice that the english nation would have thought of making the island of ascension a productive spot , any other people would have held it as a mere fortress in the ocean .
near this coast nothing grows ; farther inland an occasional green castor-oil plant , and a few grasshoppers , true friends of the desert , may be met with .
some grass is scattered over the surface of the central elevated region , and the whole much resembles the worse parts of the welsh mountains .
but , scanty as the pasture appears , about six hundred sheep , many goats , a few cows and horses , all thrive well on it .
of native animals , <unk> and rats swarm in <name> .
whether the rat is really indigenous may well be doubted ; there are two varieties as described by mr. waterhouse ; one is of a black colour , with fine glossy fur , and lives on the grassy summit , the other is <unk> and less glossy , with longer hairs , and lives near the settlement on the coast .
both these varieties are one-third smaller than the common black rat ( m. <unk> ) ; and they differ from it both in the colour and character of their fur , but in no other essential respect .
i can hardly doubt that these rats ( like the common mouse , which has also run wild ) have been imported , and , as at the galapagos , have varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have been exposed : hence the variety on the summit of the island differs from that on the coast .
of native birds there are none ; but the guinea-fowl , imported from the cape de verd islands , is abundant , and the common fowl has likewise run wild .
some cats which were originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice , have increased , so as to become a great plague .
the island is entirely without trees , in which , and in every other respect , it is very far inferior to st. <name> .
one of my excursions took me towards the south-west extremity of the island .
the day was clear and hot , and i saw the island , not smiling with beauty , but staring with naked <unk> .
the lava streams are covered with hummocks , and are rugged to a degree which , geologically speaking , is not of easy explanation .
the intervening spaces are concealed with layers of pumice , ashes and volcanic tuff .
whilst passing this end of the island at sea , i could not imagine what the white patches were with which the whole plain was mottled ; i now found that they were <unk> , sleeping in such full confidence , that even in mid-day a man could walk up and seize hold of them .
these birds were the only living creatures i saw during the whole day .
on the beach a great surf , although the breeze was light , came tumbling over the broken lava rocks .
( plate 103 .
cellular formation of volcanic bomb . )
the geology of this island is in many respects interesting .
in several places i noticed volcanic bombs , that is , masses of lava which have been shot through the air whilst fluid , and have consequently assumed a spherical or <unk> .
not only their external form , but , in several cases , their internal structure shows in a very curious manner that they have revolved in their aerial course .
the internal structure of one of these bombs , when broken , is represented very accurately in plate 103 .
the central part is coarsely cellular , the cells decreasing in size towards the exterior ; where there is a <unk> case about the third of an inch in thickness , of compact stone , which again is overlaid by the outside crust of finely cellular lava .
i think there can be little doubt , first , that the external crust cooled rapidly in the state in which we now see it ; secondly , that the still fluid lava within was packed by the centrifugal force generated by the revolving of the bomb , against the external cooled crust , and so produced the solid shell of stone ; and lastly , that the centrifugal force , by relieving the pressure in the more central parts of the bomb , allowed the heated vapours to expand their cells , thus forming the coarse cellular mass of the centre .
a hill formed of the older series of volcanic rocks , and which has been <unk> considered as the crater of a volcano , is remarkable from its broad , slightly hollowed , and circular summit having been filled up with many successive layers of ashes and fine scoriae .
these <unk> layers crop out on the margin , forming perfect rings of many different colours , giving to the summit a most fantastic appearance ; one of these rings is white and broad , and resembles a course round which horses have been exercised ; hence the hill has been called the devil 's riding school .
i brought away specimens of one of the tufaceous layers of a pinkish colour and it is a most extraordinary fact that professor ehrenberg finds it almost wholly composed of matter which has been organised ; he detects in it some <unk> , fresh-water infusoria , and no less than twenty-five different kinds of the siliceous tissue of plants , chiefly of grasses .
( <unk> .
" <unk> .

akad .
d. wiss .
zu berlin " <unk> <name> 1845 . )
from the absence of all <unk> matter , professor ehrenberg believes that these organic bodies have passed through the volcanic fire , and have been erupted in the state in which we now see them .
the appearance of the layers induced me to believe that they had been deposited under water , though from the extreme dryness of the climate i was forced to imagine that torrents of rain had probably fallen during some great eruption , and that thus a temporary lake had been formed into which the ashes fell .
but it may now be suspected that the lake was not a temporary one .
anyhow we may feel sure that at some former epoch the climate and productions of ascension were very different from what they now are .
where on the face of the earth can we find a spot on which close investigation <name> not discover signs of that endless cycle of change , to which this earth has been , is , and <name> be subjected ?
on leaving ascension , we sailed for bahia , on the coast of brazil , in order to complete the <unk> measurement of the world .
we arrived there on <name> 1st , and stayed four days , during which i took several long walks .
i was glad to find my enjoyment in tropical scenery had not decreased from the want of novelty , even in the slightest degree .
the elements of the scenery are so simple that they are worth mentioning , as a proof on what trifling circumstances exquisite natural beauty depends .
the country may be described as a level plain of about three hundred feet in elevation , which in all parts has been worn into flat-bottomed valleys .
this structure is remarkable in a granitic land , but is nearly universal in all those softer formations of which plains are usually composed .
the whole surface is covered by various kinds of stately trees , interspersed with patches of cultivated ground , out of which houses , convents , and chapels arise .
it must be remembered that within the tropics the wild luxuriance of nature is not lost even in the vicinity of large cities : for the natural vegetation of the hedges and hill-sides <unk> in picturesque effect the artificial labour of man .
hence , there are only a few spots where the bright red soil affords a strong contrast with the universal clothing of green .
from the edges of the plain there are distant views either of the ocean , or of the great bay with its <unk> shores , and on which numerous boats and canoes show their white sails .
excepting from these points , the scene is extremely limited ; following the level <unk> , on each hand , only glimpses into the wooded valleys below can be obtained .
the houses i may add , and especially the sacred edifices , are built in a peculiar and rather fantastic style of architecture .
they are all whitewashed ; so that when illumined by the brilliant sun of mid-day , and as seen against the pale blue sky of the horizon , they stand out more like shadows than real buildings .
such are the elements of the scenery , but it is a hopeless attempt to paint the general effect .
learned naturalists describe these scenes of the tropics by naming a multitude of objects , and mentioning some characteristic feature of each .
to a learned traveller this possibly may communicate some definite ideas : but who else from seeing a plant in an <unk> can imagine its appearance when growing in its native soil ?
who from seeing choice plants in a hothouse can magnify some into the dimensions of forest trees , and crowd others into an entangled jungle ?
who when examining in the cabinet of the entomologist the <name> exotic butterflies , and singular <unk> , <name> associate with these lifeless objects the ceaseless harsh music of the latter and the lazy flight of the former ,  the sure <unk> of the still , glowing noonday of the tropics ?
it is when the sun has attained its greatest height that such scenes should be viewed : then the dense splendid foliage of the mango hides the ground with its darkest shade , whilst the upper branches are rendered from the profusion of light of the most brilliant green .
in the temperate zones the case is different  the vegetation there is not so dark or so <name> , and hence the rays of the declining sun , tinged of a red , purple , or bright yellow colour , add most to the beauties of those climes .
when quietly walking along the shady <unk> , and admiring each successive view , i wished to find language to express my ideas .
epithet after epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not visited the intertropical regions the sensation of delight which the mind experiences .
i have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to communicate a just idea of the vegetation , yet i must recur to it .
the land is one great wild , untidy , luxuriant hothouse , made by nature for herself , but taken possession of by man , who has studded it with <name> houses and formal gardens .
how great would be the <name> in every admirer of nature to behold , if such were possible , the scenery of another planet !
yet to every person in europe , it may be truly said , that at the distance of only a few degrees from his native soil the glories of another world are opened to him .
in my last walk i stopped again and again to gaze on these beauties , and endeavoured to fix in my mind for ever an impression which at the time i knew sooner or later must fail .
the form of the <unk> , the cocoa-nut , the palm , the mango , the <unk> , the banana , <name> remain clear and separate ; but the thousand beauties which unite these into one perfect scene must fade away : yet they <name> leave , like a tale heard in childhood , a picture full of indistinct , but most beautiful figures .
<name> 6 , 1836 .
in the afternoon we stood out to sea , with the intention of making a direct course to the cape de verd islands .
unfavourable winds , however , delayed us , and on the 12th we ran into pernambuco ,  a large city on the coast of brazil , in latitude 8 degrees south .
we anchored outside the reef ; but in a short time a pilot came on board and took us into the inner harbour , where we lay close to the town .
pernambuco is built on some narrow and low <unk> which are separated from each other by shoal channels of salt water .
the three parts of the town are connected together by two long bridges built on wooden piles .
the town is in all parts disgusting , the streets being narrow , <unk> , and filthy ; the houses tall and gloomy .
the season of heavy rains had hardly come to an end , and hence the surrounding country , which is scarcely raised above the level of the sea , was flooded with water ; and i failed in all my attempts to take long walks .
the flat swampy land on which pernambuco stands is surrounded , at the distance of a few miles , by a semicircle of low hills , or rather by the edge of a country elevated perhaps two hundred feet above the sea .
the old city of <name> stands on one extremity of this range .
one day i took a canoe , and proceeded up one of the channels to visit it ; i found the old town from its situation both sweeter and cleaner than that of pernambuco .
i must here commemorate what happened for the first time during our nearly five years ' wandering , namely , having met with a want of politeness ; i was refused in a sullen manner at two different houses , and obtained with difficulty from a third , permission to pass through their gardens to an uncultivated hill , for the purpose of viewing the country .
i feel glad that this happened in the land of the <unk> , for i bear them no good <name>  a land also of slavery , and therefore of moral <unk> .
a spaniard would have felt ashamed at the very thought of refusing such a request , or of behaving to a stranger with rudeness .
the channel by which we went to and returned from <name> was bordered on each side by <unk> , which sprang like a miniature forest out of the greasy mud-banks .
the bright green colour of these bushes always reminded me of the rank grass in a churchyard : both are nourished by putrid <unk> ; the one speaks of death past , and the other too often of death to come .
( plate 104 .
cicada homoptera . )
the most curious object which i saw in this neighbourhood was the reef that forms the harbour .
i doubt whether in the whole world any other natural structure has so artificial an appearance .
( <unk> .
i have described this bar in detail in the " london and edinburgh philosophical magazine " volume 19 1841 <name> 257 . )
it runs for a length of several miles in an absolutely straight line , parallel to and not far distant from the shore .
it varies in width from thirty to sixty yards , and its surface is level and smooth ; it is composed of <unk> hard sandstone .
at high water the waves break over it ; at low water its summit is left dry , and it might then be mistaken for a breakwater erected by <unk> workmen .
on this coast the currents of the sea tend to throw up in front of the land long spits and bars of loose sand , and on one of these part of the town of pernambuco stands .
in former times a long spit of this nature seems to have become consolidated by the percolation of calcareous matter , and afterwards to have been gradually upheaved ; the outer and loose parts during this process having been worn away by the action of the sea , and the solid nucleus left as we now see it .
although night and day the waves of the open atlantic , turbid with sediment , are driven against the steep outside edges of this wall of stone , yet the oldest pilots know of no tradition of any change in its appearance .
this <unk> is much the most curious fact in its history : it is due to a tough layer , a few inches thick , of calcareous matter , wholly formed by the successive growth and death of the small shells of <unk> , together with some few barnacles and nulliporae .
these nulliporae , which are hard , very <unk> <unk> , play an analogous and important part in protecting the upper surfaces of coral-reefs , behind and within the breakers , where the true corals , during the outward growth of the mass , become killed by exposure to the sun and air .
these insignificant organic beings , especially the <unk> , have done good service to the people of pernambuco ; for without their protective aid the bar of sandstone would inevitably have been long ago worn away and without the bar , there would have been no harbour .
on the 19th of <name> we finally left the shores of brazil .
i thank god , i shall never again visit a <unk> .
to this day , if i hear a distant scream , it recalls with painful vividness my feelings , when passing a house near pernambuco , i heard the most pitiable moans , and could not but suspect that some poor slave was being tortured , yet knew that i was as powerless as a child even to remonstrate .
i suspected that these moans were from a tortured slave , for i was told that this was the case in another instance .
near rio de janeiro i lived opposite to an old <name> , who kept screws to crush the fingers of her female slaves .
i have stayed in a house where a young household mulatto , daily and hourly , was reviled , beaten , and persecuted enough to break the spirit of the lowest animal .
i have seen a little boy , six or seven years old , struck thrice with a <unk> ( before i could interfere ) on his naked head , for having handed me a glass of water not quite clean ; i saw his father tremble at a mere glance from his master 's eye .
these latter cruelties were witnessed by me in a spanish colony , in which it has always been said that slaves are better treated than by the portuguese , english , or other european nations .
i have seen at rio de janeiro a powerful negro afraid to <name> off a blow directed , as he thought , at his face .
i was present when a kind-hearted man was on the point of separating forever the men , women , and little children of a large number of families who had long lived together .
i <name> not even allude to the many <unk> atrocities which i <unk> heard of ;  nor would i have mentioned the above revolting details , had i not met with several people , so blinded by the constitutional gaiety of the negro as to speak of slavery as a tolerable evil .
such people have generally visited at the houses of the upper classes , where the domestic slaves are usually well treated , and they have not , like myself , lived amongst the lower classes .
such <unk> <name> ask slaves about their condition ; they forget that the slave must indeed be dull who does not calculate on the chance of his answer reaching his master 's ears .
it is argued that self-interest <name> prevent excessive cruelty ; as if self-interest protected our domestic animals , which are far less likely than degraded slaves to stir up the rage of their savage masters .
it is an argument long since protested against with <name> feeling , and strikingly exemplified , by the <unk> humboldt .
it is often attempted to <unk> slavery by comparing the state of slaves with our poorer countrymen : if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws of nature , but by our institutions , great is our sin ; but how this bears on slavery , i can not see ; as well might the use of the <unk> be defended in one land , by showing that men in another land suffered from some dreadful disease .
those who look tenderly at the slave owner , and with a cold heart at the slave , never seem to put themselves into the position of the latter ;  what a cheerless prospect , with not even a <name> of change !
picture to yourself the chance , ever hanging over you , of your wife and your little children  those objects which nature urges even the slave to call his own  being torn from you and sold like beasts to the first <unk> !
and these deeds are done and <unk> by men who profess to love their neighbours as themselves , who believe in god , and pray that his <name> be done on earth !
it makes one 's blood boil , yet heart tremble , to think that we englishmen and our american descendants , with their <unk> cry of <name> , have been and are so guilty ; but it is a consolation to reflect , that we at least have made a greater sacrifice than ever made by any nation , to <unk> our sin .
on the last day of <name> we anchored for the second time at porto praya in the cape de verd archipelago ; thence we proceeded to the azores , where we stayed six days .
on the 2nd of october we made the shores of england ; and at <unk> i left the " beagle , " having lived on board the good little vessel nearly five years .
( plate 105 .
homeward bound , the " beagle . " )
our voyage having come to an end , i <name> take a short retrospect of the advantages and disadvantages , the pains and pleasures , of our <unk> of the world .
if a person asked my advice , before undertaking a long voyage , my answer would depend upon his possessing a decided taste for some branch of knowledge , which could by this means be advanced .
no doubt it is a high satisfaction to behold various countries and the many races of mankind , but the pleasures gained at the time do not <unk> the evils .
it is necessary to look forward to a harvest , however distant that may be , when some fruit <name> be <unk> , some good effected .
many of the losses which must be experienced are obvious ; such as that of the society of every old friend , and of the sight of those places with which every dearest remembrance is so intimately connected .
these losses , however , are at the time partly relieved by the <unk> delight of anticipating the <unk> day of return .
if , as poets say , life is a dream , i am sure in a voyage these are the visions which best serve to pass away the long night .
other losses , although not at first felt , tell heavily after a period : these are the want of room , of seclusion , of rest ; the <unk> feeling of constant hurry ; the privation of small luxuries , the loss of domestic society and even of music and the other pleasures of imagination .
when such trifles are mentioned , it is evident that the real grievances , excepting from accidents , of a <unk> are at an end .
the short space of sixty years has made an astonishing difference in the facility of distant navigation .
even in the time of cook , a man who left his fireside for such expeditions underwent severe privations .
a yacht now , with every luxury of life , can <unk> the globe .
besides the vast improvements in ships and naval resources , the whole western shores of <name> are thrown open , and australia has become the capital of a rising continent .
how different are the circumstances to a man shipwrecked at the present day in the pacific , to what they were in the time of cook !
since his voyage a hemisphere has been added to the civilised world .
if a person suffer much from <unk> , let him weigh it heavily in the balance .
i speak from experience : it is no trifling evil , cured in a week .
if , on the other hand , he take pleasure in naval tactics , he <name> assuredly have full scope for his taste .
but it must be borne in mind how large a proportion of the time , during a long voyage , is spent on the water , as compared with the days in harbour .
and what are the boasted glories of the illimitable ocean ?
a tedious waste , a desert of water , as the arabian calls it .
no doubt there are some delightful scenes .
a moonlight night , with the clear heavens and the dark glittering sea , and the white sails filled by the soft air of a <unk> trade-wind , a dead calm , with the heaving surface polished like a mirror , and all still except the occasional flapping of the canvas .
it is well once to behold a squall with its rising arch and coming fury , or the heavy <name> of wind and mountainous waves .
i confess , however , my imagination had painted something more grand , more terrific , in the full-grown storm .
it is an incomparably finer spectacle when beheld on shore , where the waving trees , the wild flight of the birds , the dark shadows and bright lights , the rushing of the torrents , all proclaim the strife of the <unk> elements .
at sea the albatross and little petrel fly as if the storm were their proper sphere , the water rises and sinks as if fulfilling its usual task , the ship alone and its inhabitants seem the objects of wrath .
on a forlorn and weather-beaten coast the scene is indeed different , but the feelings partake more of horror than of wild delight .
let us now look at the brighter side of the past time .
the pleasure derived from beholding the scenery and the general aspect of the various countries we have visited has decidedly been the most constant and highest source of enjoyment .
it is probable that the picturesque beauty of many parts of europe exceeds anything which we beheld .
but there is a growing pleasure in comparing the character of the scenery in different countries , which to a certain degree is distinct from merely admiring its beauty .
it depends chiefly on an acquaintance with the individual parts of each view ; i am strongly induced to believe that as in music , the person who understands every note <name> , if he also possesses a proper taste , more thoroughly enjoy the whole , so he who examines each part of a fine view may also thoroughly comprehend the full and combined effect .
hence , a traveller should be a botanist , for in all views plants form the chief embellishment .
group masses of naked rock even in the wildest forms , and they may for a time afford a sublime spectacle , but they <name> soon grow monotonous .
paint them with bright and varied colours , as in northern chile , they <name> become fantastic ; clothe them with vegetation , they must form a decent , if not a beautiful picture .
when i say that the scenery of parts of europe is probably superior to anything which we beheld , i except , as a class by itself , that of the intertropical zones .
the two classes can not be compared together ; but i have already often enlarged on the grandeur of those regions .
as the force of impressions generally depends on preconceived ideas , i may add that mine were taken from the vivid descriptions in the " personal narrative " of humboldt , which far exceed in merit anything else which i have read .
yet with these <unk> ideas , my feelings were far from partaking of a tinge of disappointment on my first and final landing on the shores of brazil .
among the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind , none exceed in sublimity the primeval forests <unk> by the hand of man ; whether those of brazil , where the powers of life are predominant , or those of <name> <name> fuego , where death and decay prevail .
both are temples filled with the varied productions of the god of nature :  no one can stand in these solitudes unmoved , and not feel that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body .
in calling up images of the past , i find that the plains of patagonia frequently cross before my eyes ; yet these plains are pronounced by all wretched and useless .
they can be described only by negative characters ; without habitations , without water , without trees , without mountains , they support merely a few dwarf plants .
why , then , and the case is not peculiar to myself , have these arid wastes taken so firm a hold on my memory ?
why have not the still more level , the greener and more fertile pampas , which are serviceable to mankind , produced an equal impression ?
i can scarcely analyse these feelings : but it must be partly owing to the free scope given to the imagination .
the plains of patagonia are boundless , for they are scarcely passable , and hence unknown : they bear the stamp of having lasted , as they are now , for ages , and there appears no limit to their duration through future time .
if , as the ancients supposed , the flat earth was surrounded by an impassable breadth of water , or by deserts heated to an intolerable excess , who would not look at these last boundaries to man's knowledge with deep but ill-defined sensations ?
lastly , of natural scenery , the views from lofty mountains , though certainly in one sense not beautiful , are very memorable .
when looking down from the highest crest of the cordillera , the mind , undisturbed by minute details , was filled with the stupendous dimensions of the surrounding masses .
of individual objects , perhaps nothing is more certain to create astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a barbarian ,  of man in his lowest and most savage state .
one 's mind hurries back over past centuries , and then asks , could our progenitors have been men like these ?  men , whose very signs and expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals ; men , who do not possess the instinct of those animals , nor yet appear to boast of human reason , or at least of arts consequent on that reason .
i do not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference between savage and civilised man .
it is the difference between a wild and tame animal : and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the same which would lead every one to <name> to see the lion in his desert , the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle , or the rhinoceros wandering over the wild plains of africa .
among the other most remarkable spectacles which we have beheld , may be ranked the southern cross , the cloud of magellan , and the other constellations of the southern hemisphere  the <unk>  the glacier leading its blue stream of ice , overhanging the sea in a bold precipice  a <unk> raised by the reef-building corals  an active volcano  and the overwhelming effects of a violent earthquake .
these latter phenomena , perhaps , possess for me a peculiar interest , from their intimate connexion with the geological structure of the world .
the earthquake , however , must be to every one a most impressive event : the earth , considered from our earliest childhood as the type of solidity , has <unk> like a thin crust beneath our feet ; and in seeing the laboured works of man in a moment overthrown , we feel the insignificance of his boasted power .
it has been said that the love of the <name> is an inherent delight in man  a relic of an instinctive passion .
if so , i am sure the pleasure of living in the open air , with the sky for a roof and the ground for a table , is part of the same feeling ; it is the savage returning to his wild and native habits .
i always look back to our boat <unk> , and my land journeys , when through unfrequented countries , with an extreme delight , which no scenes of civilisation could have created .
i do not doubt that every traveller must remember the glowing sense of happiness which he experienced when he first breathed in a foreign clime where the civilised man had seldom or never trod .
there are several other sources of enjoyment in a long voyage which are of a more reasonable nature .
the map of the world ceases to be a blank ; it becomes a picture full of the most varied and animated figures .
each part assumes its proper dimensions : continents are not looked at in the light of islands , or islands considered as mere specks , which are , in truth , larger than many kingdoms of europe .
africa , or north and south <name> , are <unk> names , and easily pronounced ; but it is not until having sailed for weeks along small portions of their shores , that one is thoroughly convinced what vast spaces on our immense world these names imply .
from seeing the present state , it is impossible not to look forward with high expectations to the future progress of nearly an entire hemisphere .
the march of improvement , consequent on the introduction of christianity throughout the south sea , probably stands by itself in the records of history .
it is the more striking when we remember that only sixty years since , cook , whose excellent judgment none <name> dispute , could foresee no prospect of a change .
yet these changes have now been effected by the <unk> spirit of the british nation .
in the same quarter of the globe australia is rising , or indeed may be said to have risen , into a grand centre of civilisation , which , at some not very remote period , <name> rule as empress over the southern hemisphere .
it is impossible for an englishman to behold these distant colonies without a high pride and satisfaction .
to hoist the british flag seems to draw with it as a certain consequence , wealth , prosperity , and civilisation .
in conclusion it appears to me that nothing can be more improving to a young naturalist than a journey in distant countries .
it both <unk> and partly <unk> that want and craving , which , as sir j. <name> remarks , a man experiences although every corporeal sense be fully satisfied .
the excitement from the novelty of objects , and the chance of success , stimulate him to increased activity .
moreover , as a number of isolated facts soon become uninteresting , the habit of comparison leads to <unk> .
on the other hand , as the traveller stays but a short time in each place , his descriptions must generally consist of mere sketches , instead of detailed observations .
hence arises , as i have found to my cost , a constant tendency to fill up the wide gaps of knowledge by inaccurate and superficial <unk> .
but i have too deeply enjoyed the voyage , not to recommend any naturalist , although he must not expect to be so fortunate in his companions as i have been , to take all chances , and to start , on travels by land if possible , if otherwise , on a long voyage .
he may feel assured he <name> meet with no difficulties or dangers , excepting in rare cases , nearly so bad as he beforehand <unk> .
in a moral point of view the effect ought to be to teach him <unk> <name> , freedom from selfishness , the habit of acting for himself , and of making the best of every occurrence .
in short , he ought to partake of the characteristic qualities of most sailors .
travelling ought also to teach him distrust ; but at the same time he <name> discover how many truly kind-hearted people there are , with whom he never before had , or ever again <name> have any further communication , who yet are ready to offer him the most disinterested assistance .

critical introduction .
a scientific discovery is the outcome of an interesting process of evolution in the mind of its author .
when we are able to detect the germs of thought in which such a discovery has originated , and to trace the successive stages of the reasoning by which the crude idea has developed into an <unk> book , we have the materials for <unk> an important chapter of scientific history .
such a contribution to the story of the " making of science " may be furnished in respect to <name> 's famous theory of coral-reefs , and the clearly reasoned treatise in which it was first fully set forth .
the subject of corals and coral-reefs is one concerning which much popular <unk> has always prevailed .
the misleading comparison of coral-rock with the combs of bees and the nests of wasps is perhaps responsible for much of this misunderstanding ; one writer has indeed described a coral-reef as being " built by fishes by means of their teeth . "
scarcely less misleading , however , are the references we so frequently meet with , both in prose and verse , to the " skill , " " industry , " and " perseverance " of the " <unk> " in " building " his " home . "
as well might we praise men for their cleverness in making their own skeletons , and laud their <unk> in filling <unk> with the same .
the <unk> and other organisms , whose remains accumulate to form a coral-reef , simply live and perform their natural functions , and then die , leaving behind them , in the natural course of events , the hard calcareous portions of their structures to add to the growing reef .
while the forms of coral-reefs and coral-islands are sometimes very remarkable and worthy of attentive study , there is no ground , it need scarcely be added , for the suggestion that they afford proofs of design on the part of the living builders , or that , in the words of flinders , they constitute <unk> , defending the workshops from whence " infant colonies might be safely sent forth . "
it was not till the beginning of the present century that travellers like beechey , chamisso , quoy and gaimard , moresby , <name> , and others , began to collect accurate details concerning the forms and structure of <unk> , and to make such observations on the habits of <unk> <unk> , as might serve as a basis for safe reasoning concerning the origin of coral-reefs and islands .
in the second volume of lyell 's " principles of geology , " published in 1832 , the final chapter gives an admirable summary of all that was then known on the subject .
at that time , the <unk> of the atolls was almost universally regarded as a proof that they had grown up on submerged volcanic craters ; and lyell gave his powerful support to that theory .
<name> <name> was never tired of acknowledging his indebtedness to lyell .
in <unk> to his friend the second edition of his " naturalist 's voyage round the world , " <name> writes that he does so " with grateful pleasure , as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may possess , has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable 'principles of geology . ' "
the second volume of lyell 's " principles " appeared after <name> had left england ; but it was doubtless sent on to him without delay by his faithful friend and correspondent , professor henslow .
it appears to have reached <name> at a most <unk> moment , while , in fact , he was studying the striking evidences of slow and long-continued , but often interrupted movement on the west coast of south <name> .
<name> 's acute mind could not fail to detect the weakness of the then prevalent theory concerning the origin of the <unk> atolls  and the difficulty which he found in accepting the volcanic theory , as an explanation of the phenomena of coral-reefs , is well set forth in his book .
in an interesting fragment of autobiography , <name> has given us a very clear account of the way in which the leading idea of the theory of coral-reefs originated in his mind ; he writes , " no other work of mine was begun in so <unk> a spirit as this , for the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of south <name> , before i had seen a true coral-reef .
i had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs .
but it should be observed that i had during the two previous years been incessantly attending to the effects on the shores of south <name> of the intermittent elevation of the land , together with the denudation and deposition of sediment .
this necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence , and it was easy to replace in imagination the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals .
to do this was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls . "
on her homeward voyage , the " beagle " visited tahiti , australia , and some of the coral-islands in the indian ocean , and <name> had an opportunity of testing and <unk> the conclusion at which he had arrived by studying the statements of other observers .
i well recollect a remarkable conversation i had with <name> , shortly after the death of lyell .
with characteristic modesty , he told me that he never fully realised the importance of his theory of coral-reefs till he had an opportunity of discussing it with lyell , shortly after the return of the " beagle " .
lyell , on receiving from the lips of its author a sketch of the new theory , was so overcome with delight that he danced about and threw himself into the wildest <unk> , as was his manner when excessively pleased .
he wrote shortly afterwards to <name> as follows :  " i could think of nothing for days after your lesson on coral-reefs , but of the tops of submerged continents .
it is all true , but do not flatter yourself that you <name> be believed till you are growing bald like me , with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world . "
on may 24th , 1837 , lyell wrote to sir <name> <name> as follows :  " i am very full of <name> 's new theory of coral-islands , and have urged <unk> to make him read it at our next meeting .
i must give up my volcanic crater forever , though it cost me a pang at first , for it accounted for so much . "
dr. <unk> was president of the geological society at the time , and on may <unk> , 1837 , <name> read a paper entitled " on certain areas of elevation and subsidence in the pacific and indian oceans , as deduced from the study of <name> formations , " an abstract of which appeared in the second volume of the <unk> proceedings .
it was about this time that <name> , having settled himself in lodgings at great marlborough street , commenced the writing of his book on " coral-reefs . "
many delays from <unk> and the interruption of other work , caused the progress to be slow , and his journal speaks of " <unk> " the subject in february 1839 , shortly after his marriage , and again in october of the same year .
in july 1841 , he states that he began once more " after more than thirteen month 's interval , " and the last <unk> of the book was not corrected till may 6th , 1842 .
<name> writes in his autobiography , " this book , though a small one , cost me twenty months of hard work , as i had to read every work on the islands of the pacific , and to consult many charts . "
the task of <unk> and writing out his books was , with <name> , always a very slow and laborious one ; but it is clear that in accomplishing the work now under consideration , there was a long and constant struggle with the lethargy and weakness resulting from the sad condition of his health at that time .
lyell 's anticipation that the theory of coral-reefs would be slow in meeting with general acceptance was certainly not justified by the actual facts .
on the contrary the new book was at once received with general assent among both geologists and <unk> , and even attracted a considerable amount of attention from the general public .
it was not long before the coral-reef theory of <name> found an able <unk> and sturdy champion in the person of the great american naturalist , professor <name> d. <name> .
two years after the return of the " beagle " to england , the ships of the united states exploring expedition set sail upon their four years ' cruise , under the command of captain wilkes , and <name> was a member of the scientific staff .
when , in 1839 , the expedition arrived at <name> , a newspaper paragraph was found which gave the american naturalist the first intimation of <name> 's new theory of the origin of atolls and barrier-reefs .
writing in 1872 , <name> describes the effect produced on his mind by reading this passage :  " the paragraph threw a flood of light over the subject , and called forth feelings of peculiar satisfaction , and of <unk> to mr. <name> , which still come up afresh whenever the subject of <name> islands is mentioned .
the gambier islands in the <unk> , which gave him the key to the theory , i had not seen ; but on reaching the <unk> , six months later , in 1840 , i found there similar facts on a still grander scale and of a more diversified character , so that i was afterward enabled to speak of his theory as established with more <unk> than he himself , in his philosophic caution , had been ready to adopt .
his work on coral-reefs appeared in 1842 , when my report on the subject was already in manuscript .
it showed that the conclusions on other points , which we had independently reached , were for the most part the same .
the principal points of difference relate to the reason for the absence of corals from some coasts , and the evidence therefrom as to changes of level , and the distribution of the oceanic regions of elevation and subsidence  topics which a wide range of travel over the pacific brought directly and constantly to my attention . "
among the reports of the united states exploring expedition , two important works from the pen of professor <name> made their appearance ;  one on " <unk> , " which treats at length on " corals and <unk> , " and the other on " coral-reefs and islands . "
in 1872 , <name> prepared a work of a more popular character in which some of the chief results of his studies are described ; it bore the title of " corals and coral-islands . "
of this work , new and enlarged editions appeared in 1874 and 1890 in <name> , while two editions were published in this country in 1872 and 1875 .
in all these works their author , while maintaining an independent judgment on certain matters of detail , warmly defends the views of <name> on all points essential to the theory .
another able <unk> and <unk> of the theory of coral-reefs was found in professor <unk> jukes , who accompanied h.m.s .
" fly " , as naturalist , during the survey of the great barrier-reef  in the years 1842 to 1846 .
jukes , who was a man of great acuteness as well as independence of mind , concludes his account of the great australian reefs with the following words :  " after seeing much of the great barrier-reefs , and reflecting much upon them , and trying if it were possible by any means to evade the conclusions to which mr. <name> has come , i can not help adding that his hypothesis is perfectly satisfactory to my mind , and rises beyond a mere hypothesis into the true theory of coral-reefs . "
as the result of the clear exposition of the subject by <name> , lyell , <name> , and jukes , the theory of coral-reefs had , by the middle of the present century , commanded the almost universal assent of both <unk> and geologists .
in 1859 baron <name> <unk> brought forward new facts in its support , by showing that the existence of the thick masses of <unk> limestone in the <unk> could be best accounted for if they were regarded as of coralline origin and as being formed during a period of long continued subsidence .
the same views were maintained by professor <unk> in his " <unk> <name> <unk> und <unk> , " which appeared in 1879 .
the first serious note of dissent to the generally accepted theory was heard in 1863 , when a distinguished <name> naturalist , dr. <name> <unk> , declared that his study of the <unk> islands showed that uninterrupted subsidence could not have been going on in that region .
dr. <unk> objections were very carefully considered by mr. <name> , and a reply to them appeared in the second and revised edition of his " coral-reefs , " which was published in 1874 .
with characteristic frankness and freedom from prejudice , <name> admitted that the facts brought forward by dr. <unk> proved that in certain specified cases , subsidence could not have played the chief part in originating the peculiar forms of the coral-islands .
but while making this admission , he firmly maintained that exceptional cases , like those described in the <unk> islands , were not sufficient to <unk> the theory of subsidence as applied to the widely spread atolls , encircling reefs , and barrier-reefs of the pacific and indian oceans .
it is worthy of note that to the end of his life <name> maintained a friendly correspondence with <unk> concerning the points on which they were at issue .
after the appearance of <unk> 's work , dr. <unk> .
rein published an account of the <unk> , in which he opposed the interpretation of the structure of the islands given by <name> and other authors , and maintained that the facts observed in them are opposed to the views of <name> .
although , so far as i am aware , <name> had no opportunity of studying and considering these particular objections , it may be mentioned that two american geologists have since carefully <unk> the district  professor <unk> .
rice in 1884 and professor a. <unk> in 1889  and they have independently arrived at the conclusion that dr .
rein 's objections can not be maintained .
the most serious opposition to <name> 's coral-reef theory , however , was that which developed itself after the return of h.m.s .
" <unk> " from her famous voyage .
mr. <name> <name> , one of the staff of naturalists on board that vessel , propounded a new theory of coral-reefs , and maintained that the view that they were formed by subsidence was one that was no longer <unk> ; these objections have been supported by professor <name> agassiz in the united states , and by dr. a. <unk> , and dr. <unk> .
<unk> in this country .
although mr. <name> did not live to bring out a third edition of his " coral-reefs , " i know from several conversations with him that he had given the most patient and thoughtful consideration to mr. <name> 's paper on the subject .
he admitted to me that had he known , when he wrote his work , of the abundant deposition of the remains of calcareous organisms on the sea floor , he might have regarded this cause as sufficient in a few cases to raise the summits of submerged volcanoes or other mountains to a level at which <unk> corals can commence to flourish .
but he did not think that the admission that under certain favourable conditions , atolls might be thus formed without subsidence , necessitated an abandonment of his theory in the case of the innumerable examples of the kind which stud the indian and pacific oceans .
a letter written by <name> to professor <name> agassiz in may 1881 shows exactly the attitude which careful consideration of the subject led him to maintain towards the theory propounded by mr. <name> :  " you <name> have seen , " he writes , " mr. <name> 's views on the formation of atolls and barrier-reefs .
before publishing my book , i thought long over the same view , but only as far as ordinary <name> organisms are concerned , for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms .
i rejected this view , as from the few <unk> made in the " beagle " , in the south temperate regions , i concluded that shells , the smaller corals , etc. , decayed and were dissolved when not protected by the deposition of sediment , and sediment could not accumulate in the open ocean .
certainly , shells , etc. , were in several cases completely rotten , and crumbled into mud between my fingers ; but you <name> know whether this is in any degree common .
i have expressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll , which could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence .
i can , however , hardly believe in the existence of as many banks ( there having been no subsidence ) as there are atolls in the great oceans , within a reasonable depth , on which minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the depth of many hundred feet . "
<name> 's concluding words in the same letter written within a year of his death , are a striking proof of the <unk> and <unk> of mind which he preserved so well to the end , in this as in other controversies .
" if i am wrong , the sooner i am knocked on the head and annihilated so much the better .
it still seems to me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much , and long-continued , subsidence in the beds of the great oceans .
i wish some doubly <name> millionaire would take it into his head to have <unk> made in some of the pacific and indian atolls , and bring home cores for <unk> from a depth of 500 or 600 feet . "
it is noteworthy that the objections to <name> 's theory have for the most part proceeded from <unk> , while those who have fully appreciated the geological aspect of the question , have been the <unk> supporters of the theory of subsidence .
the <unk> of such boring operations in atolls has been insisted upon by several geologists , and it may be hoped that before many years have passed away , <name> 's hopes may be realised , either with or without the intervention of the " doubly <name> millionaire . "
three years after the death of <name> , the veteran professor <name> re-entered the lists and contributed a powerful defence of the theory of subsidence in the form of a reply to an essay written by the ablest <unk> of the <unk> views on this subject , dr. a. <unk> .
while pointing out that the <unk> position had been to a great extent misunderstood by its opponents , he showed that the rival theory presented even greater difficulties than those which it professed to remove .
during the last five years , the whole question of the origin of coral-reefs and islands has been <unk> , and a controversy has arisen , into which , unfortunately , <unk> elements have been very unnecessarily introduced .
those who <name> it , <name> find clear and impartial statements of the varied and often mutually destructive views put forward by different authors , in three works which have made their appearance within the last year ,  " the bermuda islands , " by professor <name> <unk> ; " corals and coral-islands , " new edition by professor <unk> .
<name> ; and the third edition of <name> 's " coral-reefs , " with notes and appendix by professor <unk> .
<unk> .
most readers <name> , i think , rise from the perusal of these works with the conviction that , while on certain points of detail it is clear that , through the want of knowledge concerning the action of <name> organisms in the open ocean , <name> was betrayed into some grave errors , yet the main foundations of his argument have not been seriously impaired by the new facts observed in the deep-sea researches , or by the severe criticism to which his theory has been subjected during the last ten years .
on the other hand , i think it <name> appear that much <unk> has been exhibited by some of <name> 's critics , as to what his views and arguments really were ; so that the reprint and wide circulation of the book in its original form is greatly to be desired , and can not but be attended with advantage to all those who <name> have the fairness to acquaint themselves with <name> 's views at first hand , before attempting to reply to them .

coral-reefs .
introduction .
the object of this volume is to describe from my own observation and the works of others , the principal kinds of coral-reefs , more especially those occurring in the open ocean , and to explain the origin of their peculiar forms .
i do not here treat of the polypifers , which construct these vast works , except so far as relates to their distribution , and to the conditions favourable to their vigorous growth .
without any distinct intention to classify coral-reefs , most voyagers have spoken of them under the following heads : " lagoon-islands , " or " atolls , " " barrier " or " encircling reefs , " and " fringing " or " <unk> . "
the lagoon-islands have received much the most attention ; and it is not surprising , for every one must be struck with astonishment , when he first beholds one of these vast rings of coral-rock , often many leagues in diameter , here and there surmounted by a low verdant island with dazzling white shores , bathed on the outside by the foaming breakers of the ocean , and on the inside surrounding a calm expanse of water , which from reflection , is of a bright but pale green colour .
the naturalist <name> feel this astonishment more deeply after having examined the soft and almost gelatinous bodies of these apparently insignificant creatures , and when he knows that the solid reef increases only on the outer edge , which day and night is lashed by the breakers of an ocean never at rest .
well did <unk> <unk> de <unk> , in the year <unk> , exclaim , " c'est une <unk> de <unk> <unk> de ces <unk> , <unk> d'un grand banc de <name> tout <unk> , <unk> <unk> point <unk> <unk> . "
the accompanying sketch of <unk> island , in the south pacific , taken from captain beechey 's admirable " voyage , " although excellent of its kind , gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these lagoon-islands .
( plate : <unk> woodcut , <unk> atoll . )
<unk> island is of small size , and the whole circle has been converted into land , which is a comparatively rare circumstance .
as the reef of a <unk> generally supports many separate small islands , the word " island , " applied to the whole , is often the cause of confusion ; hence i have invariably used in this volume the term " atoll , " which is the name given to these circular groups of <unk> by their inhabitants in the indian ocean , and is synonymous with " <unk> . "
( plate : <unk> woodcut , reef at bolabola island . )
barrier-reefs , when encircling small islands , have been comparatively little noticed by voyagers ; but they well deserve attention .
in their structure they are little less marvellous than atolls , and they give a singular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the islands they surround .
in the accompanying sketch , taken from the " voyage of the 'coquille ' , " the reef is seen from within , from one of the high peaks of the island of bolabola .
( i have taken the <name> of <unk> the foreground , and leaving out a mountainous island in the far distance . )
here , as in <unk> island , the whole of that part of the reef which is visible is converted into land .
this is a circumstance of rare occurrence ; more usually a snow-white line of great breakers , with here and there an islet crowned by cocoa-nut trees , separates the smooth waters of the <unk> channel from the waves of the open sea .
the barrier-reefs of australia and of new caledonia , owing to their enormous dimensions , have excited much attention : in structure and form they resemble those encircling many of the smaller islands in the pacific ocean .
with respect to fringing , or <unk> , there is little in their structure which needs explanation ; and their name expresses their comparatively small extension .
they differ from barrier-reefs in not lying so far from the shore , and in not having within a broad channel of deep water .
reefs also occur around submerged banks of sediment and of <unk> rock ; and others are scattered quite irregularly where the sea is very shallow ; these in most respects are allied to those of the fringing class , but they are of comparatively little interest .
i have given a separate chapter to each of the above classes , and have described some one reef or island , on which i possessed most information , as typical ; and have afterwards compared it with others of a like kind .
although this classification is useful from being obvious , and from including most of the coral-reefs existing in the open sea , it admits of a more fundamental division into barrier and atoll-formed reefs on the one hand , where there is a great apparent difficulty with respect to the foundation on which they must first have grown ; and into fringing-reefs on the other , where , owing to the nature of the slope of the adjoining land , there is no such difficulty .
the two blue tints and the red colour ( replaced by <name> in this edition . )
on the map ( plate iii .
) , represent this main division , as explained in the beginning of the last chapter .
in the appendix , every existing coral-reef , except some on the coast of brazil not included in the map , is briefly described in geographical order , as far as i possessed information ; and any particular spot may be found by consulting the index .
several theories have been advanced to explain the origin of atolls or lagoon-islands , but scarcely one to account for barrier-reefs .
from the limited depths at which reef-building polypifers can flourish , taken into consideration with certain other circumstances , we are compelled to conclude , as it <name> be seen , that both in atolls and barrier-reefs , the foundation on which the <name> was primarily attached , has subsided ; and that during this downward movement , the reefs have grown upwards .
this conclusion , it <name> be further seen , explains most satisfactorily the outline and general form of atolls and barrier-reefs , and likewise certain peculiarities in their structure .
the distribution , also , of the different kinds of coral-reefs , and their position with relation to the areas of recent elevation , and to the points subject to volcanic eruptions , fully accord with this theory of their origin .
( a brief account of my views on <name> formations , now published in my journal of researches , was read may <unk> , 1837 , before the geological society , and an abstract has appeared in the proceedings . )
( description of the plates .
plate i.  map showing the resemblance in form between barrier coral-reefs surrounding mountainous islands , and atolls or lagoon islands . )
in the several original surveys , from which the small plans on this plate have been reduced , the coral-reefs are engraved in very different styles .
for the sake of uniformity , i have adopted the style used in the charts of the chagos archipelago , published by the east indian company , from the survey by captain moresby and lieutenant powell .
the surface of the reef , which dries at low water , is represented by a surface with small crosses : the <unk> on the reef are marked by small linear spaces , on which a few cocoa-nut trees , out of all proportion too large , have been introduced for the sake of clearness .
the entire annular reef , which when surrounding an open expanse of water , forms an " atoll , " and when surrounding one or more high islands , forms an encircling " barrier-reef , " has a nearly uniform structure .
the reefs in some of the original surveys are represented merely by a single line with crosses , so that their breadth is not given ; i have had such reefs engraved of the width usually attained by coral-reefs .
i have not thought it worth while to introduce all those small and very numerous reefs , which occur within the lagoons of most atolls and within the <unk> of most barrier-reefs , and which stand either isolated , or are attached to the shores of the reef or land .
at peros banhos none of the <unk> rise to the surface of the water ; a few of them have been introduced , and are marked by plain dotted circles .
a few of the deepest soundings are laid down within each reef ; they are in fathoms , of six english feet .
figure 1.  vanikoro , situated in the western part of the south pacific ; taken from the survey by captain d'urville in the " <unk> ; " the soundings on the southern side of the island , namely , from thirty to forty fathoms , are given from the voyage of the <unk> .
<name> ; the other soundings are laid down from the survey by d'urville ; height of the summit of the island is <unk> feet .
the principal small detached reefs within the lagoon-channel have in this instance been represented .
the southern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef : if the <unk> had carried this reef entirely round both islands , this figure would have served ( by leaving out in imagination the barrier-reef ) as a good specimen of an <unk> island , surrounded by a reef of the fringing class .

keeling or <unk> atoll is situated in the indian ocean , in 12 deg 5 ' s. , and longitude 90 deg 55 ' e. : a reduced chart of it was made from the survey of captain fitzroy and the officers of h.m.s .
" beagle , " is given in plate i. , figure 10 .
the greatest width of this atoll is nine miles and a half .
its structure is in most respects characteristic of the class to which it belongs , with the exception of the <unk> of the lagoon .
the accompanying woodcut represents a vertical section , supposed to be drawn at low water from the outer coast across one of the low islets ( one being taken of average dimensions ) to within the lagoon .
the section is true to the scale in a horizontal line , but it could not be made so in a vertical one , as the average greatest height of the land is only between six and twelve feet above high-water <name> .
i <name> describe the section , commencing with the outer margin .
i must first observe that the reef-building polypifers , not being tidal animals , require to be constantly submerged or washed by the breakers .
i was assured by mr. <unk> , a very intelligent resident on these islands , as well as by some chiefs at tahiti ( <unk> ) , that an exposure to the rays of the sun for a very short time invariably causes their destruction .
hence it is possible only under the most favourable circumstances , afforded by an unusually low tide and smooth water , to reach the outer margin , where the <name> is alive .
i succeeded only twice in gaining this part , and found it almost entirely composed of a living porites , which forms great irregularly rounded masses ( like those of an <unk> , but larger ) from four to eight feet broad , and little less in thickness .
these mounds are separated from each other by narrow crooked channels , about six feet deep , most of which intersect the line of reef at right angles .
on the furthest mound , which i was able to reach by the aid of a <unk> , and over which the sea broke with some violence , although the day was quite calm and the tide low , the polypifers in the uppermost cells were all dead , but between three and four inches lower down on its side they were living , and formed a projecting border round the upper and dead surface .
the <name> being thus checked in its upward growth , extends laterally , and hence most of the masses , especially those a little further inwards , had broad flat dead summits .
on the other hand i could see , during the recoil of the breakers , that a few yards further seaward , the whole convex surface of the porites was alive ; so that the point where we were standing was almost on the exact upward and shoreward limit of existence of those corals which form the outer margin of the reef .
we shall presently see that there are other organic productions , fitted to bear a somewhat longer exposure to the air and sun .
next , but much inferior in importance to the porites , is the millepora <unk> .
( this millepora ( <unk> of blainville ) , as well as the m. <unk> , possesses the singular property of stinging the skin where it is delicate , as on the face and arm . )
it grows in thick vertical plates , intersecting each other at various angles , and forms an exceedingly strong honeycombed mass , which generally affects a circular form , the marginal plates alone being alive .
between these plates and in the protected crevices on the reef , a multitude of branching <unk> and other productions flourish , but the porites and millepora alone seem able to resist the fury of the breakers on its upper and outer edge : at the depth of a few fathoms other kinds of stony corals live .
mr. <unk> , who was intimately acquainted with every part of this reef , and likewise with that of north keeling atoll , assured me that these corals invariably compose the outer margin .
the lagoon is inhabited by quite a distinct set of corals , generally brittle and thinly branched ; but a porites , apparently of the same species with that on the outside , is found there , although it does not seem to thrive , and certainly does not attain the thousandth part in bulk of the masses opposed to the breakers .
the woodcut shows the form of the bottom off the reef : the water <unk> for a space between one and two hundred yards wide , very gradually to twenty-five fathoms ( a in section ) , beyond which the sides plunge into the unfathomable ocean at an <name> of 45 deg .
( the soundings from which this section is laid down were taken with great care by captain fitzroy himself .
he used a <unk> lead , having a diameter of four inches , and the <unk> each time were cut off and brought on board for me to examine .
the arming is a preparation of tallow , placed in the concavity at the bottom of the lead .
sand , and even small fragments of rock , <name> adhere to it ; and if the bottom be of rock it brings up an exact impression of its surface . )
to the depth of ten or twelve fathoms the bottom is exceedingly rugged , and seems formed of great masses of living <name> , similar to those on the margin .
the arming of the lead here invariably came up quite clean , but deeply indented , and chains and anchors which were lowered , in the hopes of tearing up the <name> , were broken .
many small fragments , however , of millepora <unk> were brought up ; and on the arming from an <unk> cast , there was a perfect impression of an <unk> , apparently alive .
i examined the rolled fragments cast on the beach during gales , in order further to ascertain what corals grew outside the reef .
the fragments consisted of many kinds , of which the porites already mentioned and a <unk> , apparently the m. <unk> , were the most abundant .
as i searched in vain in the hollows on the reef and in the lagoon , for a living specimen of this <unk> , i conclude that it is confined to a zone outside , and beneath the surface , where it must be very abundant .
fragments of the millepora <unk> and of an <unk> were also numerous ; the former is found , but not in proportionate <name> , in the hollows on the reef ; but the <unk> i did not see living .
hence we may infer , that these are the kinds of <name> which form the rugged sloping surface ( represented in the woodcut by an uneven line ) , round and beneath the external margin .
between twelve and twenty fathoms the arming came up an equal number of times smoothed with sand , and indented with <name> : an anchor and lead were lost at the respective depths of thirteen and sixteen fathoms .
out of twenty-five soundings taken at a greater depth than twenty fathoms , every one showed that the bottom was covered with sand ; whereas , at a less depth than twelve fathoms , every sounding showed that it was exceedingly rugged , and free from all extraneous particles .
two soundings were obtained at the depth of 360 fathoms , and several between two hundred and three hundred fathoms .
the sand brought up from these depths consisted of finely triturated fragments of stony <unk> , but not , as far as i could distinguish , of a particle of any <unk> genus : fragments of shells were rare .
at a distance of <unk> yards from the breakers , captain fitzroy found no bottom with a line of <unk> feet in length ; hence the submarine slope of this <name> formation is steeper than that of any volcanic cone .
off the mouth of the lagoon , and likewise off the northern point of the atoll , where the currents act violently , the inclination , owing to the accumulation of sediment , is less .
as the arming of the lead from all the greater depths showed a smooth <name> bottom , i at first concluded that the whole consisted of a vast conical pile of calcareous sand , but the sudden increase of depth at some points , and the circumstance of the line having been cut , as if rubbed , when between five hundred and six hundred fathoms were out , indicate the probable existence of submarine cliffs .
on the margin of the reef , close within the line where the upper surface of the porites and of the millepora is dead , three species of <unk> flourish .
one grows in thin sheets , like a lichen on old trees ; the second in stony knobs , as thick as a man 's finger , radiating from a common centre ; and the third , which is less common , in a <unk> <unk> of thin , but perfectly rigid branches .
( this last species is of a beautiful bright <unk> colour .
its branches are about as thick as <unk> ; they are slightly flattened and <unk> at the extremities .
the extremities only are alive and brightly coloured .
the two other species are of a dirty <unk> .
the second species is extremely hard ; its short <unk> branches are cylindrical , and do not grow thicker at their extremities . )
the three species occur either separately or mingled together ; and they form by their successive growth a layer two or three feet in thickness , which in some cases is hard , but where formed of the <unk> kind , readily yields an impression to the hammer : the surface is of a reddish colour .
these nulliporae , although able to exist above the limit of true corals , seem to require to be bathed during the greater part of each tide by breaking water , for they are not found in any abundance in the protected hollows on the back part of the reef , where they might be immersed either during the whole or an equal proportional time of each tide .
it is remarkable that organic productions of such extreme simplicity , for the nulliporae undoubtedly belong to one of the lowest classes of the vegetable kingdom , should be limited to a zone so peculiarly circumstanced .
hence the layer composed by their growth merely fringes the reef for a space of about twenty yards in width , either under the form of separate <unk> projections , where the outer masses of <name> are separate , or , more commonly , where the corals are united into a solid margin , as a continuous smooth convex mound ( b in woodcut ) , like an artificial breakwater .
both the mound and <unk> projections stand about three feet higher than any other part of the reef , by which term i do not include the islets , formed by the accumulation of rolled fragments .
we shall hereafter see that other <name> reefs are protected by a similar thick growth of nulliporae on the outer margin , the part most exposed to the breakers , and this must effectually aid in preserving it from being worn down .
the woodcut represents a section across one of the islets on the reef , but if all that part which is above the level of c were removed , the section would be that of a simple reef , as it occurs where no islet has been formed .
it is this reef which essentially forms the atoll .
it is a ring , enclosing the lagoon on all sides except at the northern end , where there are two open spaces , through one of which ships can enter .
the reef varies in width from two hundred and fifty to five hundred yards , its surface is level , or very slightly inclined towards the lagoon , and at high tide the sea breaks entirely over it : the water at low tide thrown by the breakers on the reef , is carried by the many narrow and shoal gullies or channels on its surface , into the lagoon : a return stream sets out of the lagoon through the main entrance .
the most frequent <name> in the hollows on the reef is <unk> <unk> , which grows in short sinuous plates , or branches , and when alive is of a beautiful pale <unk> : a <unk> , closely allied or identical with m. <unk> , is also common .
as soon as an islet is formed , and the waves are prevented breaking entirely over the reef , the channels and hollows in it become filled up with cemented fragments , and its surface is converted into a hard smooth floor ( c of woodcut ) , like an artificial one of <unk> .
this flat surface varies in width from one hundred to two hundred , or even three hundred yards , and is strewed with a few large fragments of <name> torn up during gales : it is uncovered only at low water .
i could with difficulty , and only by the aid of a chisel , procure chips of rock from its surface , and therefore could not ascertain how much of it is formed by the aggregation of detritus , and how much by the outward growth of mounds of corals , similar to those now living on the margin .
nothing can be more singular than the appearance at low tide of this " flat " of naked stone , especially where it is externally bounded by the smooth convex mound of nulliporae , appearing like a breakwater built to resist the waves , which are constantly throwing over it sheets of foaming water .
the characteristic appearance of this " flat " is shown in the foregoing woodcut of <unk> atoll .
the islets on the reef are first formed between two hundred and three hundred yards from its outer edge , through the accumulation of a pile of fragments , thrown together by some unusually strong <name> .
their ordinary width is under a quarter of a mile , and their length varies from a few yards to several miles .
those on the south-east and windward side of the atoll , increase solely by the addition of fragments on their outer side ; hence the loose blocks of <name> , of which their surface is composed , as well as the shells mingled with them , almost exclusively consist of those kinds which live on the outer coast .
the highest part of the islets ( excepting hillocks of blown sand , some of which are thirty feet high ) , is close to the outer beach ( e of the woodcut ) , and averages from six to ten feet above ordinary high-water <name> .
from the outer beach the surface slopes gently to the shores of the lagoon , which no doubt has been caused by the breakers the further they have rolled over the reef , having had less power to throw up fragments .
the little waves of the lagoon heap up sand and fragments of <unk> corals on the inner side of the islets on the leeward side of the atoll ; and these islets are broader than those to windward , some being even eight hundred yards in width ; but the land thus added is very low .
the fragments beneath the surface are cemented into a solid mass , which is exposed as a ledge ( d of the woodcut ) , projecting some yards in front of the outer shore and from two to four feet high .
this ledge is just reached by the waves at ordinary high-water : it extends in front of all the islets , and everywhere has a water-worn and scooped appearance .
the fragments of <name> which are occasionally cast on the " flat " are during gales of unusual violence swept together on the beach , where the waves each day at high-water tend to remove and gradually wear them down ; but the lower fragments having become firmly cemented together by the percolation of calcareous matter , resist the daily tides longer , and hence project as a ledge .
the cemented mass is generally of a white colour , but in some few parts reddish from ferruginous matter ; it is very hard , and is sonorous under the hammer ; it is obscurely divided by seams , dipping at a small <name> seaward ; it consists of fragments of the corals which grow on the outer margin , some quite and others partially rounded , some small and others between two and three feet across ; and of masses of previously formed conglomerate , torn up , rounded , and <unk> ; or it consists of a calcareous sandstone , entirely composed of rounded particles , generally almost blended together , of shells , corals , the spines of <unk> , and other such organic bodies ; rocks , of this latter kind , occur on many shores , where there are no <name> reefs .
the structure of the <name> in the conglomerate has generally been much obscured by the <unk> of <unk> calcareous matter ; and i collected a very interesting series , beginning with fragments of unaltered <name> , and ending with others , where it was impossible to discover with the naked eye any trace of organic structure .
in some specimens i was unable , even with the aid of a lens , and by wetting them , to distinguish the boundaries of the altered <name> and <unk> limestone .
many even of the blocks of <name> lying loose on the beach , had their central parts altered and <unk> .
the lagoon alone remains to be described ; it is much <unk> than that of most atolls of considerable size .
the southern part is almost filled up with banks of mud and fields of <name> , both dead and alive , but there are considerable spaces , between three and four fathoms , and smaller basins , from eight to ten fathoms deep .
probably about half its area consists of sediment , and half of coral-reefs .
the corals composing these reefs have a very different aspect from those on the outside ; they are very numerous in kind , and most of them are thinly branched .
<unk> , however , lives in the lagoon , and great rounded masses of this <name> are numerous , lying quite or almost loose on the bottom .
the other commonest kinds consist of three closely allied species of true <unk> in thin branches ; of <unk> <unk> ; two species of porites ( this porites has somewhat the habit of p. <unk> , but the branches are not <unk> at their ends .
when alive it is of a yellow colour , but after having been washed in fresh water and placed to dry , a <unk> slimy substance <unk> from the entire surface , so that the specimen now appears as if it had been dipped in ink . )
with cylindrical branches , one of which forms circular clumps , with the exterior branches only alive ; and lastly , a <name> something like an <unk> , but with stars on both surfaces , growing in thin , brittle , stony , foliaceous <unk> , especially in the deeper basins of the lagoon .
the reefs on which these corals grow are very irregular in form , are full of cavities , and have not a solid flat surface of dead rock , like that surrounding the lagoon ; nor can they be nearly so hard , for the inhabitants made with crowbars a channel of considerable length through these reefs , in which a schooner , built on the s.e .
islet , was floated out .
it is a very interesting circumstance , pointed out to us by mr. <unk> , that this channel , although made less than ten years before our visit , was then , as we saw , almost choked up with living <name> , so that fresh excavations would be absolutely necessary to allow another vessel to pass through it .
the sediment from the deepest parts in the lagoon , when wet , appeared <unk> , but when dry , like very fine sand .
large soft banks of similar , but even finer grained mud , occur on the s.e .
shore of the lagoon , affording a thick growth of a <unk> , on which turtle feed : this mud , although discoloured by vegetable matter , appears from its entire solution in acids to be purely calcareous .
i have seen in the museum of the geological society , a similar but more remarkable substance , brought by lieutenant <name> from the reefs of bermuda , which , when shown to several experienced geologists , was mistaken by them for true chalk .
on the outside of the reef much sediment must be formed by the action of the surf on the rolled fragments of <name> ; but in the calm waters of the lagoon , this can take place only in a small degree .
there are , however , other and unexpected agents at work here : large shoals of two species of <unk> , one inhabiting the surf outside the reef and the other the lagoon , subsist entirely , as i was assured by mr. <unk> , the intelligent resident before referred to , by browsing on the living polypifers .
i opened several of these fish , which are very numerous and of considerable size , and i found their intestines distended by small pieces of <name> , and finely ground calcareous matter .
this must daily pass from them as the finest sediment ; much also must be produced by the infinitely numerous vermiform and <unk> animals , which make cavities in almost every block of <name> .
dr. j. <name> , of <unk> , who has enjoyed the best means of observation , informs me in a letter that the <unk> ( a family of <unk> ) subsist on living <name> ; and the singular structure of bone within the anterior extremity of their bodies , certainly appears well adapted for this purpose .
the number of the species of <unk> , and of the individuals which swarm on every part of these coral-reefs , is extraordinarily great ; and many <unk> are annually freighted , as is well-known , for <name> with the <unk> , which is a species of this genus .
the amount of <name> yearly consumed , and ground down into the finest mud , by these several creatures , and probably by many other kinds , must be immense .
these facts are , however , of more importance in another point of view , as showing us that there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs , and that the almost universal law of " consumed and be consumed , " holds good even with the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks , which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean .
considering that keeling atoll , like other <name> formations , has been entirely formed by the growth of organic beings , and the accumulation of their detritus , one is naturally led to inquire how long it has continued , and how long it is likely to continue , in its present state .
mr. <unk> informed me that he had seen an old chart in which the present long island on the s.e .
side was divided by several channels into as many islets ; and he assures me that the channels can still be distinguished by the smaller size of the trees on them .
on several islets , also , i observed that only young cocoa-nut trees were growing on the extremities ; and that older and taller trees rose in regular succession behind them ; which shows that these islets have very lately increased in length .
in the upper and south-eastern part of the lagoon , i was much surprised by finding an irregular field of at least a mile square of branching corals , still upright , but entirely dead .
they consisted of the species already mentioned ; they were of a brown colour , and so rotten , that in trying to stand on them i sank halfway up the leg , as if through decayed brushwood .
the tops of the branches were barely covered by water at the time of lowest tide .
several facts having led me to disbelieve in any elevation of the whole atoll , i was at first unable to imagine what cause could have killed so large a field of <name> .
upon reflection , however , it appeared to me that the closing up of the above-mentioned channels would be a sufficient cause ; for before this , a strong breeze by forcing water through them into the head of the lagoon , would tend to raise its level .
but now this can not happen , and the inhabitants observe that the tide rises to a less height , during a high s.e .
wind , at the head than at the mouth of the lagoon .
the corals , which , under the former condition of things , had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth , would thus occasionally be exposed for a short time to the sun , and be killed .
besides the increase of dry land , indicated by the foregoing facts , the exterior solid reef appears to have grown outwards .
on the western side of the atoll , the " flat " lying between the margin of the reef and the beach , is very wide ; and in front of the regular beach with its conglomerate basis , there is , in most parts , a bed of sand and loose fragments with trees growing out of it , which apparently is not reached even by the spray at high water .
it is evident some change has taken place since the waves formed the inner beach ; that they formerly beat against it with violence was evident , from a remarkably thick and water-worn point of conglomerate at one spot , now protected by vegetation and a bank of sand ; that they beat against it in the same peculiar manner in which the swell from windward now obliquely curls round the margin of the reef , was evident from the conglomerate having been worn into a point projecting from the beach in a similarly oblique manner .
this retreat in the line of action of the breakers might result , either from the surface of the reef in front of the islets having been submerged at one time , and afterward having grown upwards , or from the mounds of <name> on the margin having continued to grow outwards .
that an outward growth of this part is in process , can hardly be doubted from the fact already mentioned of the mounds of porites with their summits apparently lately killed , and their sides only three or four inches lower down thickened by a fresh layer of living <name> .
but there is a difficulty on this supposition which i must not pass over .
if the whole , or a large part of the " flat , " had been formed by the outward growth of the margin , each successive margin would naturally have been coated by the nulliporae , and so much of the surface would have been of equal height with the existing zone of living nulliporae : this is not the case , as may be seen in the woodcut .
it is , however , evident from the abraded state of the " flat , " with its original inequalities filled up , that its surface has been much modified ; and it is possible that the hinder portions of the zone of nulliporae , perishing as the reef grows outwards , might be worn down by the surf .
if this has not taken place , the reef can in no part have increased outwards in breadth since its formation , or at least since the nulliporae formed the convex mound on its margin ; for the zone thus formed , and which stands between two and three feet above the other parts of the reef , is nowhere much above twenty yards in width .
thus far we have considered facts , which indicate , with more or less probability , the increase of the atoll in its different parts : there are others having an opposite tendency .
on the south-east side , lieutenant sulivan , to whose kindness i am indebted for many interesting observations , found the conglomerate projecting on the reef nearly fifty yards in front of the beach : we may infer from what we see in all other parts of the atoll , that the conglomerate was not originally so much exposed , but formed the base of an islet , the front and upper part of which has since been swept away .
the degree to which the conglomerate , round nearly the whole atoll , has been scooped , broken up , and the fragments cast on the beach , is certainly very surprising , even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales to pile up fragments , and of the daily tides to wear them away .
on the western side , also , of the atoll , where i have described a bed of sand and fragments with trees growing out of it , in front of an old beach , it struck both lieutenant sulivan and myself , from the manner in which the trees were being washed down , that the surf had lately recommenced an attack on this line of coast .
appearances indicating a slight <unk> of the water on the land , are plainer within the lagoon : i noticed in several places , both on its windward and leeward shores , old cocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined , and the rotten stumps of others on the beach , where the inhabitants assured us the cocoa-nut could not now grow .
captain fitzroy pointed out to me , near the settlement , the foundation posts of a shed , now washed by every tide , but which the inhabitants stated , had seven years before stood above high <unk> .
in the calm waters of the lagoon , directly connected with a great , and therefore stable ocean , it seems very improbable that a change in the currents , sufficiently great to cause the water to eat into the land on all sides , should have taken place within a limited period .
from these considerations i inferred , that probably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount ; and this inference was strengthened by the circumstance , that in 1834 , two years before our visit , the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake , and by two <unk> ones during the ten previous years .
if , during these subterranean disturbances , the atoll did subside , the downward movement must have been very small , as we must conclude from the fields of dead <name> still <unk> the surface of the lagoon , and from the breakers on the western shore not having yet regained the line of their former action .
the subsidence must , also , have been preceded by a long period of rest , during which the islets extended to their present size , and the living margin of the reef grew either upwards , or as i believe outwards , to its present distance from the beach .
whether this view be correct or not , the above facts are worthy of attention , as showing how severe a struggle is in progress on these low <name> formations between the two nicely balanced powers of land and water .
with respect to the future state of keeling atoll , if left undisturbed , we can see that the islets may still extend in length ; but as they can not resist the surf until broken by rolling over a wide space , their increase in breadth must depend on the increasing breadth of the reef ; and this must be limited by the <unk> of the submarine flanks , which can be added to only by sediment derived from the wear and tear of the <name> .
from the rapid growth of the <name> in the channel cut for the schooner , and from the several agents at work in producing fine sediment , it might be thought that the lagoon would necessarily become quickly filled up .
some of this sediment , however , is transported into the open sea , as appears from the soundings off the mouth of the lagoon , instead of being deposited within it .
the deposition , moreover , of sediment , checks the growth of coral-reefs , so that these two agencies can not act together with full effect in filling it up .
we know so little of the habits of the many different species of corals , which form the <unk> , that we have no more reasons for supposing that their whole surface would grow up as quickly as the <name> did in the <unk> , than for supposing that the whole surface of a <unk> would increase as quickly as parts are known to do in holes , where the peat has been cut away .
these agencies , nevertheless , tend to fill up the lagoon ; but in proportion as it becomes <unk> , so must the polypifers be subject to many injurious agencies , such as impure water and loss of food .
for instance , mr. <unk> informed me , that some years before our visit unusually heavy rain killed nearly all the fish in the lagoon , and probably the same cause would likewise injure the corals .
the reefs also , it must be remembered , can not possibly rise above the level of the lowest <unk> , so that the final conversion of the lagoon into land must be due to the accumulation of sediment ; and in the midst of the clear water of the ocean , and with no surrounding high land , this process must be exceedingly slow .
section <unk>  general description of atolls .
general form and size of atolls , their reefs and <unk>  external <unk>  zone of <unk>  <unk>  depth of <unk>  <unk>  reefs submerged wholly or in <unk>  breaches in the <unk>  <unk> shores round certain <unk>  conversion of lagoons into land .
i <name> here give a sketch of the general form and structure of the many atolls and atoll-formed reefs which occur in the pacific and indian oceans , comparing them with keeling atoll .
the maldiva atolls and the great chagos bank differ in so many respects , that i shall devote to them , besides occasional references , a third section of this chapter .
keeling atoll may be considered as of moderate dimensions and of regular form .
of the thirty-two islands surveyed by captain beechey in the low archipelago , the longest was found to be thirty miles , and the shortest less than a mile ; but <unk> atoll , situated in another part of the same group , appears to be sixty miles long and twenty broad .
most of the atolls in this group are of an elongated form ; thus bow island is thirty miles in length , and on an average only six in width ( see figure 4 , plate i .
) , and <unk> <unk> has nearly the same proportions .
in the <name> archipelago ( the <unk> and <unk> group of kotzebue ) several of the atolls are more than thirty miles in length , and <unk> <unk> is fifty-four long , and twenty wide , at the broadest part of its irregular outline .
most of the atolls in the maldiva archipelago are of great size , one of them ( which , however , bears a double name ) measured in a medial and slightly curved line , is no less than <unk> geographical miles long , its greatest width being under twenty , and its least only nine and a half miles .
some atolls have spurs projecting from them ; and in the <name> group there are atolls united together by linear reefs , for instance <unk> island ( see figure 3 , plate ii .
) , which is sixty miles in length , and consists of three loops tied together .
in far the greater number of cases an atoll consists of a simple elongated ring , with its outline moderately regular .
the average width of the annular wreath may be taken as about a quarter of a mile .
captain beechey ( beechey 's " voyage to the pacific and <unk> straits , " chapter viii . )
says that in the atolls of the low archipelago it exceeded in no instance half a mile .
the description given of the structure and proportional dimensions of the reef and islets of keeling atoll , appears to apply perfectly to nearly all the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans .
the islets are first formed some way back either on the projecting points of the reef , especially if its form be angular , or on the sides of the main entrances into the lagoon  that is in both cases , on points where the breakers can act during gales of wind in somewhat different directions , so that the matter thrown up from one side may accumulate against that before thrown up from another .
in lutke 's chart of the <name> atolls , we see many instances of the former case ; and the occurrence of islets , as if placed for <unk> , on the points where there is a gateway or breach through the reef , has been noticed by several authors .
there are some atoll-formed reefs , rising to the surface of the sea and partly dry at low water , on which from some cause islets have never been formed ; and there are others on which they have been formed , but have subsequently been worn away .
in atolls of small dimensions the islets frequently become united into a single horse-shoe or ring-formed strip ; but <name> garcia , although an atoll of considerable size , being thirteen miles and a half in length , has its lagoon entirely surrounded , except at the northern end , by a belt of land , on an average a third of a mile in width .
to show how small the total area of the annular reef and the land is in islands of this class , i may quote a remark from the voyage of lutke , namely , that if the forty-three rings , or atolls , in the <name> archipelago , were put one within another , and over a steeple in the centre of st. petersburg , the whole world would not cover that city and its suburbs .
the form of the bottom off keeling atoll , which gradually slopes to about twenty fathoms at the distance of between one and two hundred yards from the edge of the reef , and then plunges at an <name> of 45 deg into unfathomable depths , is exactly the same ( the form of the bottom round the <name> atolls in the northern pacific is probably similar : kotzebue ( " first voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 16 ) says : " we had at a small distance from the reef , forty fathoms depth , which increased a little further so much that we could find no bottom . " )
with that of the sections of the atolls in the low archipelago given by captain beechey .
the nature , however , of the bottom seems to differ , for this officer ( i must be permitted to express my obligation to captain beechey , for the very kind manner in which he has given me information on several points , and to own the great assistance i have derived from his excellent published work . )
informs me that all the soundings , even the deepest , were on <name> , but he does not know whether dead or alive .
the slope round christmas atoll ( lat .
1 deg 4 ' n. , 157 deg 45 ' w. ) , described by cook ( cook 's " third voyage , " volume ii. , chapter 10 .
) , is considerably less , at about half a mile from the edge of the reef , the average depth was about fourteen fathoms on a fine <name> bottom , and at a mile , only between twenty and forty fathoms .
it has no doubt been owing to this gentle slope , that the strip of land surrounding its lagoon , has increased in one part to the extraordinary width of three miles ; it is formed of successive ridges of broken shells and corals , like those on the beach .
i know of no other instance of such width in the reef of an atoll ; but mr. <unk> .
<name> informs me that the inclination of the bottom round <name> atoll in the pacific , is like that off christmas island , very gentle .
off the maldiva and chagos atolls , the inclination is much more abrupt ; thus at <unk> <unk> , lieutenant powell ( this fact is taken from a ms. account of these groups lent me by captain moresby .
see also captain moresby 's paper on the maldiva atolls in the " geographical journal " , volume v. , <name> 401 . )
found fifty and sixty fathoms close to the edge of the reef , and at 300 yards distance there was no bottom with a <unk> line .
captain moresby informs me , that at 100 fathoms from the mouth of the lagoon of <name> garcia , he found no bottom with 150 fathoms ; this is the more remarkable , as the slope is generally less abrupt in front of channels through a reef , owing to the accumulation of sediment .
at <unk> island , also , at 150 fathoms from the reef , soundings were struck with 150 fathoms .
lastly , at <unk> atoll , only sixty yards from the reef , no bottom was obtained , as i am informed by captain moresby , with a line of 200 fathoms !
the currents run with great force round these atolls , and where they are strongest , the inclination appears to be most abrupt .
i am informed by the same authority , that wherever soundings were obtained off these islands , the bottom was invariably <name> : nor was there any reason to suspect the existence of submarine cliffs , as there was at keeling island .
( off some of the islands in the low archipelago the bottom appears to descend by ledges .
off <name> island , which , however , consists of raised <name> , captain beechey ( <name> 45 , 4to edition ) describes three ledges : the first had an easy slope from the beach to a distance of about fifty yards : the second extended two hundred yards with twenty-five fathoms on it , and then ended abruptly , like the first ; and immediately beyond this there was no bottom with two hundred fathoms . )
here then occurs a difficulty ; can sand accumulate on a slope , which , in some cases , appears to exceed fifty-five degrees ?
it must be observed , that i speak of slopes where soundings were obtained , and not of such cases , as that of <unk> , where the nature of the bottom is unknown , and where its inclination must be nearly vertical .
m. elie de beaumont ( " <unk> pour <unk> a une description geolog .
de <name> , " tome iv. , <name> 216 . )
has argued , and there is no higher authority on this subject , from the inclination at which snow slides down in avalanches , that a bed of sand or mud can not be formed at a greater <name> than thirty degrees .
considering the number of soundings on sand , obtained round the maldiva and chagos atolls , which appears to indicate a greater <name> , and the extreme abruptness of the <unk> in the west indies , as <name> be mentioned in the appendix , i must conclude that the adhesive property of wet sand <unk> its gravity , in a much greater ratio than has been allowed for by m. elie de beaumont .
from the facility with which calcareous sand becomes <unk> , it is not necessary to suppose that the bed of loose sand is thick .
captain beechey has observed , that the submarine slope is much less at the extremities of the more elongated atolls in the low archipelago , than at their sides ; in speaking of <unk> 's island he says ( beechey 's " voyage , " 4to edition , <name> 44 . )
the <unk> , as it may be called , which " has the most powerful enemy ( the s.w .
swell ) to oppose , is carried out much further , and with less abruptness than the other . "
in some cases , the less inclination of a certain part of the external slope , for instance of the northern extremities of the two keeling atolls , is caused by a prevailing current which there accumulates a bed of sand .
where the water is perfectly tranquil , as within a lagoon , the reefs generally grow up perpendicularly , and sometimes even <unk> their bases ; on the other hand , on the leeward side of mauritius , where the water is generally tranquil , although not invariably so , the reef is very gently inclined .
hence it appears that the exterior <name> varies much ; nevertheless in the close similarity in form between the sections of keeling atoll and of the atolls in the low archipelago , in the general <unk> of the reefs of the maldiva and chagos atolls , and in the <unk> of those rising out of water always tranquil , we may discern the effects of uniform laws ; but from the complex action of the surf and currents , on the growing powers of the <name> and on the deposition of sediment , we can by no means follow out all the results .
where islets have been formed on the reef , that part which i have sometimes called the " flat " and which is partly dry at low water , appears similar in every atoll .
in the <name> group in the north pacific , it may be inferred from chamisso 's description , that the reef , where islets have not been formed on it , slopes gently from the external margin to the shores of the lagoon ; flinders states that the australian barrier has a similar inclination inwards , and i have no doubt it is of general occurrence , although , according to ehrenberg , the reefs of the red sea offer an exception .
chamisso observes that " the red colour of the reef ( at the <name> atolls ) under the breakers is caused by a <unk> , which covers the stone wherever the waves beat ; and , under favourable circumstances , assumes a <unk> form , "  a description perfectly applicable to the margin of keeling atoll .
( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 142 .
near porto praya , in the cape de verde islands , some basaltic rocks , lashed by no inconsiderable surf , were completely enveloped with a layer of nulliporae .
the entire surface over many square inches , was coloured of a <unk> red ; the layer , however , was of no greater thickness than paper .
another kind , in the form of projecting knobs , grew in the same situation .
these nulliporae are closely related to those described on the coral-reefs , but i believe are of different species . )
although chamisso does not state that the masses of nulliporae form points or a mound , higher than the flat , yet i believe that this is the case ; for kotzebue ( kotzebue , " first voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 16 .
lieutenant <name> , in his excellent memoir in the geological transactions ( volume ii. , <name> 105 ) , alludes to the <name> points mentioned by kotzebue , and infers that they consist of <unk> , which compose <unk> masses on the reefs of <unk> , as they likewise do on a sandstone bar off the coast of brazil ( which i have described in " london <name> .
journal , " october 1841 ) .
these masses of <unk> hold the same position , relatively to the action of the sea , with the nulliporae on the coral-reefs in the indian and pacific oceans .
) , in another part , speaks of the rocks on the edge of the reef " as visible for about two feet at low water , " and these rocks we may feel quite certain are not formed of true <name> ( captain moresby , in his valuable paper " on the northern atolls of <unk> " ( " geographical journal " , volume v. ) , says that the edges of the reefs there stand above water at low <unk> . )
whether a smooth convex mound of nulliporae , like that which appears as if artificially constructed to protect the margin of keeling island , is of frequent occurrence round atolls , i know not ; but we shall presently meet with it , under precisely the same form , on the outer edge of the " barrier-reefs " which <unk> the society islands .
there appears to be scarcely a feature in the structure of keeling reef , which is not of common , if not of universal occurrence , in other atolls .
thus chamisso describes ( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 144 . )
a layer of coarse conglomerate , outside the islets round the <name> atolls which " appears on its upper surface uneven and eaten away . "
from drawings , with appended remarks , of <name> garcia in the chagos group and of several of the maldiva atolls , shown me by captain moresby ( see also moresby on the northern atolls of the <unk> , " geographical journal " , volume v. , <name> 400 .
) , it is evident that their outer coasts are subject to the same round of decay and <unk> as those of keeling atoll .
from the description of the atolls in the low archipelago , given in captain beechey 's " voyage , " it is not apparent that any conglomerate coral-rock was there observed .
the lagoon in keeling atoll is shallow ; in the atolls of the low archipelago the depth varies from 20 to 38 fathoms , and in the <name> group , according to chamisso , from 30 to 35 ; in the <name> atolls it is only a little less .
within the maldiva atolls there are large spaces with 45 fathoms , and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms .
the greater part of the bottom in most lagoons , is formed of sediment ; large spaces have exactly the same depth , or the depth varies so insensibly , that it is evident that no other means , excepting aqueous deposition , could have leveled the surface so equally .
in the maldiva atolls this is very conspicuous , and likewise in some of the <name> and <name> islands .
in the former large spaces consist of sand and soft <name> ; and kotzebue speaks of <name> having been found within one of the <name> atolls .
no doubt this <name> is calcareous mud , similar to that at keeling island , and to that at bermuda already referred to , as undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk , and which lieutenant <name> says is called there <unk> .
( i may here observe that on the coast of brazil , where there is much <name> , the soundings near the land are described by admiral <unk> , in the " <unk> du <unk> " , as siliceous sand , mingled with much finely comminuted particles of shells and <name> .
further in the offing , for a space of <unk> miles along the coast , from the <unk> islands to <unk> , the bottom in many places is composed of " <unk> blanc , <unk> ou <unk> de <unk> <unk> . "
this white substance , probably , is analogous to that which occurs within the above-mentioned lagoons ; it is sometimes , according to <unk> , firm , and he compares it to mortar . )
where the waves act with unequal force on the two sides of an atoll , the islets appear to be first formed , and are generally of greater continuity on the more exposed shore .
the islets , also , which are placed to leeward , are in most parts of the pacific liable to be occasionally swept entirely away by gales , equalling <unk> in violence , which blow in an opposite direction to the ordinary trade-wind .
the absence of the islets on the leeward side of atolls , or when present their lesser dimensions compared with those to windward , is a comparatively unimportant fact ; but in several instances the reef itself on the leeward side , retaining its usual defined outline , does not rise to the surface by several fathoms .
this is the case with the southern side of peros banhos ( plate i. , figure 9 ) in the chagos group , with <unk> atoll ( <name> lutke 's " voyage <unk> du <unk> , " volume ii. , <name> 291 .
see also his account of <unk> , below , and the chart of <unk> in the atlas . )
in the <name> archipelago , and with the barrier-reef ( plate i. , figure 8 ) of the gambier islands .
i allude to the latter reef , although belonging to another class , because captain beechey was first led by it to observe the peculiarity in the question .
at peros banhos the submerged part is nine miles in length , and lies at an average depth of about five fathoms ; its surface is nearly level , and consists of hard stone , with a thin covering of loose sand .
there is scarcely any living <name> on it , even on the outer margin , as i have been particularly assured by captain moresby ; it is , in fact , a wall of dead coral-rock , having the same width and transverse section with the reef in its ordinary state , of which it is a continuous portion .
the living and perfect parts terminate abruptly , and <unk> on the submerged portions , in the same manner as on the sides of an ordinary passage through the reef .
the reef to leeward in other cases is nearly or quite obliterated , and one side of the lagoon is left open ; for instance , at <unk> ( <name> archipelago ) , where a <unk> reef is fronted by an irregular bank , on which the other half of the annular reef probably once stood .
at <unk> , in the same archipelago , both these modifications of the reef concur ; it consists of a great flat bank , with from twenty to twenty-five fathoms water on it ; for a length of more than forty miles on its southern side it is open and without any reef , whilst on the other sides it is bounded by a reef , in parts rising to the surface and perfectly characterised , in parts lying some fathoms submerged .
in the chagos group there are annular reefs , entirely submerged , which have the same structure as the submerged and defined portions just described .
the speaker 's bank offers an excellent example of this structure ; its central expanse , which is about twenty-two fathoms deep , is twenty-four miles across ; the external rim is of the usual width of annular reefs , and is well-defined ; it lies between six and eight fathoms beneath the surface , and at the same depth there are scattered knolls in the lagoon .
captain moresby believes the rim consists of dead rock , thinly covered with sand , and he is certain this is the case with the external rim of the great chagos bank , which is also essentially a submerged atoll .
in both these cases , as in the submerged portion of the reef at peros banhos , captain moresby feels sure that the quantity of living <name> , even on the outer edge overhanging the deep-sea water , is quite insignificant .
lastly , in several parts of the pacific and indian oceans there are banks , lying at greater depths than in the cases just mentioned , of the same form and size with the neighbouring atolls , but with their <unk> structure wholly obliterated .
it appears from the survey of freycinet , that there are banks of this kind in the <name> archipelago , and , as is reported , in the low archipelago .
when we discuss the origin of the different classes of <name> formations , we shall see that the submerged state of the whole of some atoll-formed reefs , and of portions of others , generally but not invariably on the leeward side , and the existence of more deeply submerged banks now possessing little or no signs of their original <unk> structure , are probably the effects of a uniform cause ,  namely , the death of the <name> , during the subsidence of the area , in which the atolls or banks are situated .
there is seldom , with the exception of the maldiva atolls , more than two or three channels , and generally only one leading into the lagoon , of sufficient depth for a ship to enter .
in small atolls , there is usually not even one .
where there is deep water , for instance above twenty fathoms , in the middle of the lagoon , the channels through the reef are seldom as deep as the centre ,  it may be said that the rim only of the <unk> hollow forming the lagoon is notched .
mr. lyell ( " principles of geology , " volume iii. , <name> 289 . )
has observed that the growth of the <name> would tend to <unk> all the channels through a reef , except those kept open by discharging the water , which during high tide and the greater part of each ebb is thrown over its circumference .
several facts indicate that a considerable quantity of sediment is likewise discharged through these channels ; and captain moresby informs me that he has observed , during the change of the monsoon , the sea discoloured to a distance off the entrances into the maldiva and chagos atolls .
this , probably , would check the growth of the <name> in them , far more effectually than a mere current of water .
in the many small atolls without any channel , these causes have not prevented the entire ring attaining the surface .
the channels , like the submerged and effaced parts of the reef , very generally though not invariably occur on the leeward side of the atoll , or on that side , according to beechey ( beechey 's " voyage , " 4to edition , volume i. , <name> 189 .
) , which , from running in the same direction with the prevalent wind , is not fully exposed to it .
passages between the islets on the reef , through which boats can pass at high water , must not be confounded with <unk> , by which the annular reef itself is breached .
the passages between the islets occur , of course , on the windward as well as on the leeward side ; but they are more frequent and broader to leeward , owing to the lesser dimensions of the islets on that side .
at keeling atoll the shores of the lagoon <unk> gradually , where the bottom is of sediment , and irregularly or abruptly where there are coral-reefs ; but this is by no means the universal structure in other atolls .
chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 142 .
) , speaking in general terms of the lagoons in the <name> atolls , says the lead generally sinks " from a depth of two or three fathoms to twenty or twenty-four , and you may pursue a line in which on one side of the boat you may see the bottom , and on the other the <unk> deep water . "
the shores of the <unk> channel within the barrier-reef at vanikoro have a similar structure .
captain beechey has described a modification of this structure ( and he believes it is not uncommon ) in two atolls in the low archipelago , in which the shores of the lagoon descend by a few , broad , slightly inclined ledges or steps : thus at <name> atoll ( beechey 's " voyage , " 4to edition , volume i , <name> 160 .
at <unk> island the bottom of the lagoon slopes gradually towards the centre , and then <unk> suddenly , the edge of the bank being nearly perpendicular .
this bank is formed of <name> and dead shells .
) , the great exterior reef , the surface of which is gently inclined towards and beneath the surface of the lagoon , ends abruptly in a little <name> three fathoms deep ; at its foot , a ledge forty yards wide extends , shelving gently inwards like the <unk> , and terminated by a second little <name> five fathoms deep ; beyond this , the bottom of the lagoon slopes to twenty fathoms , which is the average depth of its centre .
these ledges seem to be formed of coral-rock ; and captain beechey says that the lead often descended several fathoms through holes in them .
in some atolls , all the <name> reefs or knolls in the lagoon come to the surface at low water ; in other cases of rarer occurrence , all lie at nearly the same depth beneath it , but most frequently they are quite irregular ,  some with perpendicular , some with sloping sides ,  some rising to the surface , and others lying at all intermediate depths from the bottom upwards .
i can not , therefore , suppose that the union of such reefs could produce even one uniformly sloping ledge , and much less two or three , one beneath the other , and each terminated by an abrupt wall .
at <name> island , which offers the best example of the <unk> structure , captain beechey observes that the <unk> within the lagoon are quite irregular in their height .
we shall hereafter see that the theory which accounts for the ordinary form of atolls , apparently includes this occasional peculiarity in their structure .
in the midst of a group of atolls , there sometimes occur small , flat , very low islands of <name> formation , which probably once included a lagoon , since filled up with sediment and coral-reefs .
captain beechey entertains no doubt that this has been the case with the two small islands , which alone of thirty-one surveyed by him in the low archipelago , did not contain lagoons .
<unk> island ( in lat .
15 deg s. ) is described by chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 221 . )
as formed by a dam of <unk> rock <unk> a flat space , thinly covered with trees , into which the sea on the leeward side occasionally breaks .
north keeling atoll appears to be in a rather less forward stage of conversion into land ; it consists of a horse-shoe shaped strip of land surrounding a muddy flat , one mile in its longest axis , which is covered by the sea only at high water .
when describing south keeling atoll , i endeavoured to show how slow the final process of filling up a lagoon must be ; nevertheless , as all causes do tend to produce this effect , it is very remarkable that not one instance , as i believe , is known of a moderately sized lagoon being filled up even to the low <unk> at <unk> , much less of such a one being converted into land .
it is , likewise , in some degree remarkable , how few atolls , except small ones , are surrounded by a single linear strip of land , formed by the union of separate islets .
we can not suppose that the many atolls in the pacific and indian oceans all have had a late origin , and yet should they remain at their present level , subjected only to the action of the sea and to the growing powers of the <name> , during as many centuries as must have elapsed since any of the earlier tertiary epochs , it can not , i think , be doubted that their lagoons and the islets on their reef , would present a totally different appearance from what they now do .
this consideration leads to the suspicion that some <unk> agency ( namely subsidence ) comes into play at intervals , and <unk> their original structure .

although occasional references have been made to the maldiva atolls , and to the banks in the chagos group , some points of their structure deserve further consideration .
my description is derived from an examination of the admirable charts lately published from the survey of captain moresby and lieutenant powell , and more especially from information which captain moresby has communicated to me in the kindest manner .
the maldiva archipelago is 470 miles in length , with an average breadth of about 50 miles .
the form and dimensions of the atolls , and their singular position in a double line , may be seen , but not well , in the greatly reduced chart ( figure 6 ) in plate ii .
the dimensions of the longest atoll in the group ( called by the double name of <unk> and <unk> ) have already been given ; it is 88 miles in a medial and slightly curved line , and is less than 20 miles in its broadest part .
<unk> , also , is a <name> atoll , being 44 miles across in one direction , and 34 in another , and the great included expanse of water has a depth of between 250 and 300 feet .
the smaller atolls in this group differ in no respect from ordinary ones ; but the larger ones are remarkable from being breached by numerous deep-water channels leading into the lagoon ; for instance , there are 42 channels , through which a ship could enter the lagoon of <unk> .
in the three southern large atolls , the separate portions of reef between these channels have the ordinary structure , and are linear ; but in the other atolls , especially the more northern ones , these portions are ring formed , like miniature atolls .
other ring-formed reefs rise out of the lagoons , in the place of those irregular ones which ordinarily occur there .
in the reduction of the chart of <unk> <unk> ( plate ii. , figure 4 ) , it was not found easy to define the islets and the little lagoons within each reef , so that the ring-formed structure is very imperfectly shown ; in the large published charts of <unk> , the appearance of these rings , from standing further apart from each other , is very remarkable .
the rings on the margin are generally elongated ; many of them are three , and some even five miles , in diameter ; those within the lagoon are usually smaller , few being more than two miles across , and the greater number rather less than one .
the depth of the little lagoon within these small annular reefs is generally from five to seven fathoms , but occasionally more ; and in <unk> atoll many of the central ones are twelve , and some even more than twelve fathoms deep .
these rings rise abruptly from the platform or bank , on which they are placed ; their outer margin is invariably bordered by living <name> ( captain moresby informs me that millepora <unk> is one of the commonest kinds on the outer margin , as it is at keeling atoll . )
within which there is a flat surface of <name> rock ; of this flat , sand and fragments have in many cases accumulated and been converted into islets , clothed with vegetation .
i can , in fact , point out no essential difference between these little ring-formed reefs ( which , however , are larger , and contain deeper lagoons than many true atolls that stand in the open sea ) , and the most perfectly characterised atolls , excepting that the ring-formed reefs are based on a shallow foundation , instead of on the floor of the open sea , and that instead of being scattered irregularly , they are grouped closely together on one large platform , with the marginal rings arranged in a rudely formed circle .
the perfect series which can be traced from portions of simple linear reef , to others including long linear lagoons , and from these again to oval or almost circular rings , renders it probable that the latter are merely modifications of the linear or normal state .
it is conformable with this view , that the ring-formed reefs on the margin , even where most perfect and standing furthest apart , generally have their longest axes directed in the line which the reef would have held , if the atoll had been bounded by an ordinary wall .
we may also infer that the central ring-formed reefs are modifications of those irregular ones , which are found in the lagoons of all common atolls .
it appears from the charts on a large scale , that the <unk> structure is contingent on the marginal channels or breaches being wide ; and , consequently , on the whole interior of the atoll being freely exposed to the waters of the open sea .
when the channels are narrow or few in number , although the lagoon be of great size and depth ( as in <unk> ) , there are no ring-formed reefs ; where the channels are somewhat broader , the marginal portions of reef , and especially those close to the larger channels , are ring-formed , but the central ones are not so ; where they are broadest , almost every reef throughout the atoll is more or less perfectly ring-formed .
although their presence is thus contingent on the <unk> of the marginal channels , the theory of their formation , as we shall hereafter see , is included in that of the parent atolls , of which they form the separate portions .
the lagoons of all the atolls in the southern part of the archipelago are from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part .
this is well exemplified in the case of <unk> , the southernmost atoll in the group , for although only nine miles in its longest diameter , it has a depth of thirty-nine fathoms , whereas all the other small atolls have comparatively shallow lagoons ; i can assign no adequate cause for this difference in depth .
in the central and deepest part of the lagoons , the bottom consists , as i am informed by captain moresby , of stiff <name> ( probably a calcareous mud ) ; nearer the border it consists of sand , and in the channels through the reef , of hard <unk> , sandstone , conglomerate <unk> , and a little live <name> .
close outside the reef and the line joining its detached portions ( where intersected by many channels ) , the bottom is <name> , and it slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths .
in most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in the channels ; but in <unk> , where the marginal ring-formed reefs stand far apart , the same depth is carried across the entire atoll , from the deep-water line on one side to that on the other .
i can not refrain from once again remarking on the <unk> of these atolls ,  a great <name> and generally concave disc rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean , with its central expanse studded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of coral-rock , just <unk> the surface of the sea , sometimes clothed with vegetation , and each containing a little lake of clear water !
in the southern maldiva atolls , of which there are nine large ones , all the small reefs within the lagoons come to the surface , and are dry at low water <unk> ; hence in <unk> them , there is no danger from submarine banks .
this circumstance is very remarkable , as within some atolls , for instance those of the neighbouring chagos group , not a single reef comes to the surface , and in most other cases a few only do , and the rest lie at all intermediate depths from the bottom upwards .
when treating of the growth of <name> i shall again refer to this subject .
although in the neighbourhood of the maldiva archipelago the winds , during the <unk> , blow during nearly an equal time from opposite quarters , and although , as i am informed by captain moresby , the westerly winds are the strongest , yet the islets are almost all placed on the eastern side of the northern atolls , and on the south-eastern side of the southern atolls .
that the formation of the islets is due to detritus thrown up from the outside , as in the ordinary manner , and not from the interior of the lagoons , may , i think be safely inferred from several considerations , which it is hardly worth while to detail .
as the easterly winds are not the strongest , their action probably is aided by some prevailing swell or current .
in groups of atolls , exposed to a trade-wind , the <unk> into the lagoons are almost invariably situated on the leeward or less exposed side of the reef , and the reef itself is sometimes either wanting there , or is submerged .
a strictly analogous , but different fact , may be observed at the maldiva atolls  namely , that where two atolls stand in front of each other , the breaches in the reef are the most numerous on their near , and therefore less exposed , sides .
thus on the near sides of <unk> and the two <unk> atolls , which face s. male , <unk> , and <unk> atolls , there are seventy-three deep-water channels , and only twenty-five on their outer sides ; on the near side of the three latter named atolls there are fifty six openings , and only thirty-seven on their <unk> .
it is scarcely possible to attribute this difference to any other cause than the somewhat different action of the sea on the two sides , which would ensue from the protection afforded by the two rows of atolls to each other .
i may here remark that in most cases , the conditions favourable to the greater accumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect continuity on one side of the atoll than on the other , have concurred , but this has not been the case with the <unk> ; for we have seen that the islets are placed on the eastern or south-eastern sides , whilst the breaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side , where protected by an opposite atoll .
the reef being more continuous on the outer and more exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each other , accords with the fact , that the reef of the southern atolls is more continuous than that of the northern ones ; for the former , as i am informed by captain moresby , are more constantly exposed than the northern atolls to a heavy surf .
the date of the first formation of some of the islets in this archipelago is known to the inhabitants ; on the other hand , several islets , and even some of those which are believed to be very old , are now fast wearing away .
the work of destruction has , in some instances , been completed in ten years .
captain moresby found on one <unk> reef the marks of wells and graves , which were excavated when it supported an islet .
in south <unk> atoll , the natives say that three of the islets were formerly larger : in north <unk> there is one now being washed away ; and in this latter atoll lieutenant <unk> found a reef , about six hundred yards in diameter , which the natives positively affirmed was lately an island covered with cocoa-nut trees .
it is now only partially dry at low water <unk> , and is ( in lieutenant <unk> 's words ) " entirely covered with live <name> and <unk> . "
in the northern part , also , of the maldiva archipelago and in the chagos group , it is known that some of the islets are disappearing .
the natives attribute these effects to variations in the currents of the sea .
for my own part i can not avoid suspecting that there must be some further cause , which gives rise to such a cycle of change in the action of the currents of the great and open ocean .
several of the atolls in this archipelago are so related to each other in form and position , that at the first glance one is led to suspect that they have originated in the disseverment of a single one .
male consists of three perfectly characterised atolls , of which the shape and relative position are such , that a line drawn closely round all three , gives a symmetrical figure ; to see this clearly , a larger chart is required than that of the archipelago in plate ii .
; the channel separating the two northern male atolls is only little more than a mile wide , and no bottom was found in it with 100 fathoms .
powell 's island is situated at the distance of two miles and a half off the northern end of <unk> <unk> ( see figure 4 , plate ii .
) , at the exact point where the two sides of the latter , if prolonged , would meet ; no bottom , however , was found in the channel with 200 fathoms ; in the wider channel between horsburgh atoll and the southern end of <unk> <unk> , no bottom was found with 250 fathoms .
in these and similar cases , the relation consists only in the form and position of the atolls .
but in the channel between the two <unk> atolls , although three miles and a quarter wide , soundings were struck at the depth of 200 fathoms ; the channel between <name> and <unk> atolls is four miles wide , and only 150 fathoms deep .
here then we have , besides the relation of form , a submarine connection .
the fact of soundings having been obtained between two separate and perfectly characterised atolls is in itself interesting , as it has never , i believe , been effected in any of the many other groups of atolls in the pacific and indian seas .
in continuing to trace the connection of adjoining atolls , if a hasty glance be taken at the chart ( figure 4. , plate ii . )
of <unk> <unk> , and the line of unfathomable water be followed , no one <name> hesitate to consider it as one atoll .
but a second look <name> show that it is divided by a <unk> channel , of which the northern arm is about one mile and three-quarters in width , with an average depth of 125 fathoms , and the southern one three-quarters of a mile wide , and rather less deep .
these channels resemble in the slope of their sides and general form , those which separate atolls in every respect distinct ; and the northern arm is wider than that dividing two of the male atolls .
the ring-formed reefs on the sides of this <unk> channel are elongated , so that the northern and southern portions of <unk> <unk> may claim , as far as their external outline is concerned , to be considered as distinct and perfect atolls .
but the intermediate portion , lying in the fork of the channel , is bordered by reefs less perfect than those which surround any other atoll in the group of equally small dimensions .
<unk> <unk> , therefore , is in every respect in so intermediate a condition , that it may be considered either as a single atoll nearly dissevered into three portions , or as three atolls almost perfect and intimately connected .
this is an instance of a very early stage of the apparent disseverment of an atoll , but a still earlier one in many respects is exhibited at <unk> <unk> .
in one part of this atoll , the ring-formed reefs stand so far apart from each other , that the inhabitants have given different names to the northern and southern halves ; nearly all the rings , moreover , are so perfect and stand so separate , and the space from which they rise is so level and unlike a true lagoon , that we can easily imagine the conversion of this one great atoll , not into two or three portions , but into a whole group of miniature atolls .
a perfect series such as we have here traced , impresses the mind with an idea of actual change ; and it <name> hereafter be seen , that the theory of subsidence , with the upward growth of the <name> , modified by accidents of probable occurrence , <name> account for the occasional disseverment of large atolls .
the great chagos bank alone remains to be described .
in the chagos group there are some ordinary atolls , some annular reefs rising to the surface but without any islets on them , and some atoll-formed banks , either quite submerged , or nearly so .
of the latter , the great chagos bank is much the largest , and differs in its structure from the others : a plan of it is given in plate ii. , figure 1 , in which , for the sake of clearness , i have had the parts under ten fathoms deep finely shaded : an east and west vertical section is given in figure 2 , in which the vertical scale has been necessarily exaggerated .
its longest axis is ninety nautical miles , and another line drawn at right angles to the first , across the broadest part , is seventy .
the central part consists of a level muddy flat , between forty and fifty fathoms deep , which is surrounded on all sides , with the exception of some breaches , by the steep edges of a set of banks , rudely arranged in a circle .
these banks consist of sand , with a very little live <name> ; they vary in breadth from five to twelve miles , and on an average lie about sixteen fathoms beneath the surface ; they are bordered by the steep edges of a third narrow and upper bank , which forms the rim to the whole .
this rim is about a mile in width , and with the exception of two or three spots where islets have been formed , is submerged between five and ten fathoms .
it consists of smooth hard rock , covered with a thin layer of sand , but with scarcely any live <name> ; it is steep on both sides , and outwards slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths .
at the distance of less than half a mile from one part , no bottom was found with 190 fathoms ; and off another point , at a somewhat greater distance , there was none with 210 fathoms .
small <unk> banks or knolls , covered with luxuriantly growing <name> , rise from the interior expanse to the same level with the external rim , which , as we have seen , is formed only of dead rock .
it is impossible to look at the plan ( figure 1 , plate ii .
) , although reduced to so small a scale , without at once perceiving that the great chagos bank is , in the words of captain moresby ( this officer has had the kindness to lend me an excellent ms. account of the chagos islands ; from this paper , from the published charts , and from verbal information communicated to me by captain moresby , the above account of the great chagos bank is taken .
) , " nothing more than a <unk> atoll . "
but of what great dimensions , and of how extraordinary an internal structure ?
we shall hereafter have to consider both the cause of its submerged condition , a state common to other banks in the group , and the origin of the singular submarine terraces , which bound the central expanse : these , i think , it can be shown , have resulted from a cause analogous to that which has produced the <unk> channel across <unk> <unk> .
chapter ii.  barrier reefs .
closely resemble in general form and structure <unk>  width and depth of the <unk>  breaches through the reef in front of valleys , and generally on the leeward <unk>  checks to the filling up of the <unk>  size and constitution of the encircled <unk>  number of islands within the same <unk>  barrier-reefs of new caledonia and <unk>  position of the reef relative to the slope of the adjoining <unk>  probable great thickness of barrier-reefs .
the term " barrier " has been generally applied to that vast reef which fronts the n.e .
shore of australia , and by most voyagers likewise to that on the western coast of new caledonia .
at one time i thought it convenient thus to restrict the term , but as these reefs are similar in structure , and in position relatively to the land , to those , which , like a wall with a deep moat within , <unk> many smaller islands , i have classed them together .
the reef , also , on the west coast of new caledonia , circling round the extremities of the island , is an intermediate form between a small encircling reef and the australian barrier , which stretches for a thousand miles in nearly a straight line .
the <unk> <unk> has in effect described those barrier-reefs , which <unk> moderately sized islands , by calling them atolls with high land rising from within their central expanse .
the general resemblance between the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes may be seen in the small , but accurately reduced charts on plate i .
( the authorities from which these charts have been reduced , together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the plates , are given separately .
) , and this resemblance can be further shown to extend to every part of the structure .
beginning with the outside of the reef ; many scattered soundings off gambier , <unk> , and some other encircled islands , show that close to the breakers there exists a narrow shelving margin , beyond which the ocean becomes suddenly unfathomable ; but off the west coast of new caledonia , captain <name> ( <unk> , " hydrog .
mem . "
volume iii . )
found no bottom with 150 fathoms , at two ships ' length from the reef ; so that the slope here must be nearly as precipitous as off the maldiva atolls .
i can give little information regarding the kinds of corals which live on the outer margin .
when i visited the reef at tahiti , although it was low water , the surf was too violent for me to see the living masses ; but , according to what i heard from some intelligent native chiefs , they resemble in their rounded and <unk> forms , those on the margin of keeling atoll .
the extreme verge of the reef , which was visible between the breaking waves at low water , consisted of a rounded , convex , <unk> breakwater , entirely coated with nulliporae , and absolutely similar to that which i have described at keeling atoll .
from what i heard when at tahiti , and from the writings of the <unk> .
w. <name> and j. <name> , i conclude that this peculiar structure is common to most of the encircled islands of the society archipelago .
the reef within this mound or breakwater , has an extremely irregular surface , even more so than between the islets on the reef of keeling atoll , with which alone ( as there are no islets on the reef of tahiti ) it can properly be compared .
at tahiti , the reef is very irregular in width ; but round many other encircled islands , for instance , vanikoro or gambier islands ( figures 1 and 8 , plate i .
) , it is quite as regular , and of the same average width , as in true atolls .
most barrier-reefs on the inner side slope irregularly into the lagoon-channel ( as the space of deep water separating the reef from the included land may be called ) , but at vanikoro the reef slopes only for a short distance , and then terminates abruptly in a submarine wall , forty feet high ,  a structure absolutely similar to that described by chamisso in the <name> atolls .
in the society archipelago , <name> ( consult , on this and other points , the " polynesian researches , " by the rev .
w. <name> , an admirable work , full of curious information . )
states , that the reefs generally lie at the distance of from one to one and a half miles , and , occasionally , even at more than three miles , from the shore .
the central mountains are generally bordered by a fringe of flat , and often marshy , alluvial land , from one to four miles in width .
this fringe consists of <unk> and detritus thrown up from the lagoon-channel , and of soil washed down from the hills ; it is an <unk> on the channel , analogous to that low and inner part of the islets in many atolls which is formed by the accumulation of matter from the lagoon .
at <unk> ( figure 2 , plate i .
) , in the <name> archipelago ( see " <unk> mem . "
and the " atlas of the voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " by captain <unk> d'urville , <name> 428 .
) , the reef on the south side is no less than twenty miles ; on the east side , five ; and on the north side , fourteen miles from the encircled high islands .
the lagoon channels may be compared in every respect with true lagoons .
in some cases they are open , with a level bottom of fine sand ; in others they are choked up with reefs of delicately branched corals , which have the same general character as those within the keeling atoll .
these internal reefs either stand separately , or more commonly skirt the shores of the included high islands .
the depth of the lagoon-channel round the society islands varies from two or three to thirty fathoms ; in cook 's ( see the chart in volume i. of <unk> 's 4to edition of " cook 's first voyage . " )
chart of <unk> , however , there is one sounding laid down of forty-eight fathoms ; at vanikoro there are several of fifty-four and one of fifty-six and a half fathoms ( english ) , a depth which even exceeds by a little that of the interior of the great maldiva atolls .
some barrier-reefs have very few islets on them ; whilst others are surmounted by numerous ones ; and those round part of bolabola ( plate i. , figure 5 ) form a single linear strip .
the islets first appear either on the angles of the reef , or on the sides of the breaches through it , and are generally most numerous on the windward side .
the reef to leeward retaining its usual width , sometimes lies submerged several fathoms beneath the surface ; i have already mentioned gambier island as an instance of this structure .
submerged reefs , having a less defined outline , dead , and covered with sand , have been observed ( see appendix ) off some parts of <unk> and tahiti .
the reef is more frequently breached to leeward than to windward ; thus i find in krusenstern 's " memoir on the pacific , " that there are passages through the encircling reef on the leeward side of each of the seven society islands , which possess <unk> ; but that there are openings to windward through the reef of only three of them .
the breaches in the reef are seldom as deep as the interior <unk> channel ; they generally occur in front of the main valleys , a circumstance which can be accounted for , as <name> be seen in the fourth chapter , without much difficulty .
the breaches being situated in front of the valleys , which descend indifferently on all sides , explains their more frequent occurrence through the windward side of barrier-reefs than through the windward side of atolls ,  for in atolls there is no included land to influence the position of the breaches .
it is remarkable , that the <unk> round mountainous islands have not in every instance been long ago filled up with <name> and sediment ; but it is more easily accounted for than appears at first sight .
in cases like that of <unk> and the gambier islands , where a few small peaks rise out of a great lagoon , the conditions scarcely differ from those of an atoll , and i have already shown , at some length , that the filling up of a true lagoon must be an extremely slow process .
where the channel is narrow , the agency , which on unprotected coasts is most productive of sediment , namely the force of the breakers , is here entirely excluded , and the reef being breached in the front of the main valleys , much of the finer mud from the rivers must be transported into the open sea .
as a current is formed by the water thrown over the edge of atoll-formed reefs , which carries sediment with it through the deep-water breaches , the same thing probably takes place in barrier-reefs , and this would greatly aid in preventing the lagoon-channel from being filled up .
the low alluvial border , however , at the foot of the encircled mountains , shows that the work of filling up is in progress ; and at <name> ( plate i. , figure 6 ) , in the society group , it has been almost effected , so that there remains only one harbour for small craft .
if we look at a set of charts of barrier-reefs , and leave out in imagination the encircled land , we shall find that , besides the many points already noticed of resemblance , or rather of identity in structure with atolls , there is a close general agreement in form , average dimensions , and grouping .
encircling barrier-reefs , like atolls , are generally elongated , with an irregularly rounded , though sometimes angular outline .
there are atolls of all sizes , from less than two miles in diameter to sixty miles ( excluding <unk> , as it consists of a number of almost independent atoll-formed reefs ) ; and there are encircling barrier-reefs from three miles and a half to forty-six miles in diameter ,  turtle island being an instance of the former , and <unk> of the latter .
at tahiti the encircled island is thirty-six miles in its longest axis , whilst at <unk> it is only a little more than two miles .
it <name> be shown , in the last chapter in this volume , that there is the strictest resemblance in the grouping of atolls and of common islands , and consequently there must be the same resemblance in the grouping of atolls and of encircling barrier-reefs .
the islands lying within reefs of this class , are of very various heights .
tahiti is <unk> feet ( the height of tahiti is given from captain beechey ; <unk> from mr. <unk> .
<name> ( " <unk> .
<unk> . "
volume viii. , <name> 220 ) ; <unk> from measurements made on board the " beagle " ; and <unk> or <name> island , from an estimate by the rev .
j. <name> .
the two latter islands , however , are not in some respects well characterised examples of the encircled class .
) ; <unk> about 800 ; <unk> 360 , and <unk> only 50 .
the geological nature of the included land varies : in most cases it is of ancient volcanic origin , owing apparently to the fact that islands of this nature are most frequent within all great seas ; some , however , are of <unk> limestone , and others of primary formation , of which latter kind new caledonia offers the best example .
the central land consists either of one island , or of several : thus , in the society group , <unk> stands by itself ; while <unk> and <unk> ( figure 3 , plate i .
) , both moderately large islands of nearly equal size , are included in one reef .
within the reef of the gambier group there are four large and some smaller islands ( figure 8 , plate i .
) ; within that of <unk> ( figure 2 , plate i . )
nearly a dozen small islands are scattered over the expanse of one vast lagoon .
after the details now given , it may be asserted that there is not one point of essential difference between encircling barrier-reefs and atolls : the latter enclose a simple sheet of water , the former <unk> an expanse with one or more islands rising from it .
i was much struck with this fact , when viewing , from the heights of tahiti , the distant island of <unk> standing within smooth water , and encircled by a ring of snow-white breakers .
remove the central land , and an annular reef like that of an atoll in an early stage of its formation is left ; remove it from bolabola , and there remains a circle of linear <unk> , crowned with tall cocoa-nut trees , like one of the many atolls scattered over the pacific and indian oceans .
the barrier-reefs of australia and of new caledonia deserve a separate notice from their great dimensions .
the reef on the west coast of new caledonia ( figure 5 , plate ii . )
is 400 miles in length ; and for a length of many leagues it seldom approaches within eight miles of the shore ; and near the southern end of the island , the space between the reef and the land is sixteen miles in width .
the australian barrier extends , with a few interruptions , for nearly a thousand miles ; its average distance from the land is between twenty and thirty miles ; and in some parts from fifty to seventy .
the great arm of the sea thus included , is from ten to twenty-five fathoms deep , with a <name> bottom ; but towards the southern end , where the reef is further from the shore , the depth gradually increases to forty , and in some parts to more than sixty fathoms .
flinders ( flinders ' " voyage to <name> australis , " volume ii. , <name> 88 . )
has described the surface of this reef as consisting of a hard white <unk> of different kinds of <name> , with rough projecting points .
the outer edge is the highest part ; it is traversed by narrow gullies , and at rare intervals is breached by <unk> .
the sea close outside is profoundly deep ; but , in front of the main breaches , soundings can sometimes be obtained .
some low islets have been formed on the reef .

the vertical shading shows the section of the land , and the horizontal shading that of the encircling barrier-reef : from the smallness of the scale , the lagoon-channel could not be represented .
<unk>  outer edge of the coral-reefs , where the sea breaks .
<unk>  the shore of the encircled islands . )
there is one important point in the structure of barrier-reefs which must here be considered .
the accompanying diagrams represent north and south vertical sections , taken through the highest points of vanikoro , gambier , and <unk> islands , and through their encircling reefs .
the scale both in the horizontal and vertical direction is the same , namely , a quarter of an inch to a nautical mile .
the height and width of these islands is known ; and i have attempted to represent the form of the land from the shading of the hills in the large published charts .
it has long been remarked , even from the time of <unk> , that considerable degree of relation subsists between the inclination of that part of the land which is beneath water and that above it ; hence the dotted line in the three sections , probably , does not widely differ in inclination from the actual submarine prolongation of the land .
if we now look at the outer edge of the reef ( aa ) , and bear in mind that the <unk> on the right hand represents a depth of 1,200 feet , we must conclude that the vertical thickness of these barrier coral-reefs is very great .
i must observe that if the sections had been taken in any other direction across these islands , or across other encircled islands ( in the fifth chapter an east and west section across the island of bolabola and its barrier-reefs is given , for the sake of illustrating another point .
the unbroken line in it ( woodcut no .
5 ) is the section referred to .
the scale is <unk> of an inch to a mile ; it is taken from the " atlas of the voyage of the 'coquille ' , " by <unk> .
the depth of the lagoon-channel is exaggerated .
) , the result would have been the same .
in the succeeding chapter it <name> be shown that reef-building polypifers can not flourish at great depths ,  for instance , it is highly improbable that they could exist at a quarter of the depth represented by the <unk> on the right hand of the woodcut .
here there is a great apparent difficulty  how were the basal parts of these barrier-reef formed ?
it <name> , perhaps , occur to some , that the actual reefs formed of <name> are not of great thickness , but that before their first growth , the coasts of these encircled islands were deeply eaten into , and a broad but shallow submarine ledge thus left , on the edge of which the <name> grew ; but if this had been the case , the shore would have been invariably bounded by lofty cliffs , and not have sloped down to the lagoon-channel , as it does in many instances .
on this view ( the rev .
d. <unk> and mr. <name> ( " journal of voyage and travels , " volume i. , <name> 215 ) have briefly suggested this explanation of the origin of the encircling reefs of the society islands .
) , moreover , the cause of the reef springing up at such a great distance from the land , leaving a deep and broad moat within , remains altogether unexplained .
a supposition of the same nature , and appearing at first more probable is , that the reefs sprung up from banks of sediment , which had accumulated round the shore previously to the growth of the <name> ; but the extension of a bank to the same distance round an unbroken coast , and in front of those deep arms of the sea ( as in <unk> , see plate ii. , figure 3 ) which penetrate nearly to the heart of some encircled islands , is exceedingly improbable .
and why , again , should the reef spring up , in some cases steep on both sides like a wall , at a distance of two , three or more miles from the shore , leaving a channel often between two hundred and three hundred feet deep , and rising from a depth which we have reason to believe is destructive to the growth of <name> ?
an admission of this nature can not possibly be made .
the existence , also , of the deep channel , utterly <unk> the idea of the reef having grown outwards , on a foundation slowly formed on its outside , by the accumulation of sediment and <name> detritus .
nor , again , can it be asserted , that the reef-building corals <name> not grow , excepting at a great distance from the land ; for , as we shall soon see , there is a whole class of reefs , which take their name from growing closely attached ( especially where the sea is deep ) to the beach .
at new caledonia ( see plate ii. , figure 5 ) the reefs which run in front of the west coast are prolonged in the same line 150 miles beyond the northern extremity of the island , and this shows that some explanation , quite different from any of those just suggested , is required .
the continuation of the reefs on each side of the submarine prolongation of new caledonia , is an exceedingly interesting fact , if this part formerly existed as the northern extremity of the island , and before the attachment of the <name> had been worn down by the action of the sea , or if it originally existed at its present height , with or without beds of sediment on each flank , how can we possibly account for the reefs , not growing on the crest of this submarine portion , but fronting its sides , in the same line with the reefs which front the shores of the lofty island ?
we shall hereafter see , that there is one , and i believe only one , solution of this difficulty .
one other supposition to account for the position of encircling barrier-reefs remains , but it is almost too preposterous to be mentioned ; namely , that they rest on enormous submarine craters , surrounding the included islands .
when the size , height , and form of the islands in the society group are considered , together with the fact that all are thus encircled , such a notion <name> be rejected by almost every one .
new caledonia , moreover , besides its size , is composed of primitive formations , as are some of the <unk> islands ( i have been informed that this is the case by dr. <name> of <unk> , who has visited this group .
) ; and <unk> consists of calcareous rock .
we must , therefore , reject these several explanations , and conclude that the vertical thickness of barrier-reefs , from their outer edges to the foundation on which they rest ( from aa in the section to the dotted lines ) is really great ; but in this , there is no difficulty , for it is not necessary to suppose that the <name> has sprung up from an immense depth , as <name> be evident when the theory of the upward growth of coral-reefs , during the slow subsidence of their foundation , is discussed .
chapter iii.  fringing or <unk> .
reefs of <unk>  shallow channel within the <unk>  its slow filling <unk>  currents of water formed within it.  upraised <unk>  narrow fringing-reefs in deep <unk>  reefs on the coast of east africa and of <unk>  fringing-reefs in very shallow seas , round banks of sediment and on <unk> <unk>  fringing-reefs affected by currents of the sea.  <name> coating the bottom of the sea , but not forming reefs .
fringing-reefs , or , as they have been called by some voyagers , <unk> , whether skirting an island or part of a continent , might at first be thought to differ little , except in generally being of less breadth , from barrier-reefs .
as far as the <unk> of the actual reef is concerned this is the case ; but the absence of an interior deep-water channel , and the close relation in their horizontal extension with the probable slope beneath the sea of the adjoining land , present essential points of difference .
the reefs which fringe the island of mauritius offer a good example of this class .
they extend round its whole circumference , with the exception of two or three parts ( this fact is stated on the authority of the <unk> du roi , in his extremely interesting " voyage a <unk> de <name> , " undertaken in <unk> .
according to captain <unk> ( hooker 's " bot .
<unk> . "
volume ii. , <name> 316 ) on one part of the coast there is a space for sixteen miles without a reef .
) , where the coast is almost precipitous , and where , if as is probable the bottom of the sea has a similar inclination , the <name> would have no foundation on which to become attached .
a similar fact may sometimes be observed even in reefs of the barrier class , which follow much less closely the outline of the adjoining land ; as , for instance , on the south-east and precipitous side of tahiti , where the encircling reef is interrupted .
on the western side of the mauritius , which was the only part i visited , the reef generally lies at the distance of about half a mile from the shore ; but in some parts it is distant from one to two , and even three miles .
but even in this last case , as the <unk> is gently inclined from the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach , and as the soundings outside the reef indicate an equally gentle slope beneath the water , there is no reason for supposing that the basis of the reef , formed by the prolongation of the strata of the island , lies at a greater depth than that at which the polypifers could begin constructing the reef .
some allowance , however , must be made for the outward extension of the corals on a foundation of sand and detritus , formed from their own wear , which would give to the reef a somewhat greater vertical thickness , than would otherwise be possible .
the outer edge of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island is tolerably well defined , and is a little higher than any other part .
it chiefly consists of large strongly branched corals , of the genus <unk> , which also form a sloping bed some way out to sea : the kinds of <name> growing in this part <name> be described in the ensuing chapter .
between the outer margin and the beach , there is a flat space with a <name> bottom and a few tufts of living <name> ; in some parts it is so shallow , that people , by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies , can <name> across it at low water ; in other parts it is deeper , seldom however exceeding ten or twelve feet , so that it offers a safe coasting channel for boats .
on the eastern and windward side of the island , which is exposed to a heavy surf , the reef was described to me as having a hard smooth surface , very slightly inclined inwards , just covered at <unk> , and traversed by gullies ; it appears to be quite similar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes .
the reef of mauritius , in front of every river and <unk> , is breached by a straight passage : at grand port , however , there is a channel like that within a barrier-reef ; it extends parallel to the shore for four miles , and has an average depth of ten or twelve fathoms ; its presence may probably be accounted for by two rivers which enter at each end of the channel , and bend towards each other .
the fact of reefs of the fringing class being always breached in front of streams , even of those which are dry during the greater part of the year , <name> be explained , when the conditions unfavourable to the growth of <name> are considered .
low <unk> , like those on barrier-reefs and atolls , are seldom formed on reefs of this class , owing apparently in some cases to their narrowness , and in others to the gentle slope of the reef outside not yielding many fragments to the breakers .
on the windward side , however , of the mauritius , two or three small islets have been formed .
it appears , as <name> be shown in the ensuing chapter , that the action of the surf is favourable to the vigorous growth of the stronger corals , and that sand or sediment , if agitated by the waves , is injurious to them .
hence it is probable that a reef on a shelving shore , like that of mauritius , would at first grow up , not attached to the actual beach , but at some little distance from it ; and the corals on the outer margin would be the most vigorous .
a shallow channel would thus be formed within the reef , and as the breakers are prevented acting on the shores of the island , and as they do not ordinarily tear up many fragments from the outside , and as every <unk> has its bed prolonged in a straight line through the reef , this channel could be filled up only very slowly with sediment .
but a beach of sand and of fragments of the smaller kinds of <name> seems , in the case of mauritius , to be slowly encroaching on the shallow channel .
on many shelving and <name> coasts , the breakers tend to form a bar of sand a little way from the beach , with a slight increase of depth within it ; for instance , captain grey ( captain grey 's " journal of two expeditions , " volume i. <name> 369 . )
states that the west coast of australia , in latitude 24 <unk> , is fronted by a sand bar about two hundred yards in width , on which there is only two feet of water ; but within it the depth increases to two fathoms .
similar bars , more or less perfect , occur on other coasts .
in these cases i suspect that the shallow channel ( which no doubt during storms is occasionally obliterated ) is scooped out by the flowing away of the water thrown beyond the line , on which the waves break with the greatest force .
at pernambuco a bar of hard sandstone ( i have described this singular structure in the " london and edinburgh <name> .
mag . "
october 1841 .
) , which has the same external form and height as a coral-reef , extends nearly parallel to the coast ; within this bar currents , apparently caused by the water thrown over it during the greater part of each tide , run strongly , and are wearing away its inner wall .
from these facts it can hardly be doubted , that within most fringing-reefs , especially within those lying some distance from the land , a return stream must <name> away the water thrown over the outer edge ; and the current thus produced , would tend to prevent the channel being filled up with sediment , and might even deepen it under certain circumstances .
to this latter belief i am led , by finding that channels are almost universally present within the fringing-reefs of those islands which have undergone recent elevatory movements ; and this could hardly have been the case , if the conversion of the very shallow channel into land had not been counteracted to a certain extent .
a <unk> , if elevated in a perfect condition above the level of the sea , ought to present the singular appearance of a broad dry moat within a low mound .
the author ( " voyage a <unk> de <name> , par <name> <unk> du roi , " part i. , pages 192 , 200 . )
of an interesting pedestrian tour round the mauritius , seems to have met with a structure of this kind : he says " <unk> que la , ou la mer <unk> , <unk> des <unk> du large , il y a terre une <unk> <unk> ou <unk> <unk> <unk> .
on y <unk> <unk> du canon , " etc .
in another place he adds , " <unk> de passer <name> cap , on <unk> <name> <unk> banc de <unk> <unk> de plus de <unk> <unk> : c'est une <unk> de <unk> , que la mer <unk> , il <unk> au pied une <unk> <unk> <unk> , dont on <unk> faire <name> <unk> pour de <unk> <unk> . "
but the margin of the reef , although the highest and most perfect part , from being most exposed to the surf , would generally during a slow rise of the land be either partially or entirely worn down to that level , at which corals could renew their growth on its upper edge .
on some parts of the <unk> of mauritius there are little hillocks of coral-rock , which are either the last remnants of a continuous reef , or of low islets formed on it .
i observed that two such hillocks between <unk> bay and the great black river ; they were nearly twenty feet high , about two hundred yards from the present beach , and about thirty feet above its level .
they rose abruptly from a smooth surface , strewed with worn fragments of <name> .
they consisted in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone , and in their upper of great blocks of several species of <unk> and <unk> , loosely aggregated ; they were divided into irregular beds , dipping seaward , in one hillock at an <name> of 8 <unk> , and in the other at 18 deg .
i suspect that the superficial parts of the reefs , which have been upraised together with the islands they fringe , have generally been much more modified by the wearing action of the sea , than those of mauritius .
many islands are fringed by reefs quite similar to those of mauritius ( i may give cuba , as another instance ; mr. <name> ( " loudon 's mag .
of nat .
hist . "
volume ix. , <name> 449 ) has described a reef several miles in length between <unk> and <unk> , which extends parallel to the shore at the distance of between half and the third part of a mile , and <unk> a space of shallow water , with a <name> bottom and tufts of <name> .
outside the edge of the reef , which is formed of great branching corals , the depth is six and seven fathoms .
this coast has been upheaved at no very distant geological period .
" ) ; but on coasts where the sea <unk> very suddenly the reefs are much narrower , and their limited extension seems evidently to depend on the high inclination of the submarine slope ; a relation , which , as we have seen , does not exist in reefs of the barrier class .
the fringing-reefs on steep coasts are frequently not more than from fifty to one hundred yards in width ; they have a nearly smooth , hard surface , scarcely uncovered at low water , and without any interior shoal channel , like that within those fringing-reefs , which lie at a greater distance from the land .
the fragments torn up during gales from the outer margin are thrown over the reef on the shores of the island .
i may give as instances , <unk> , where the reef is described by cook as being a hundred yards wide ; and <unk> and <name> islands ( <unk> is described by lord <name> in the voyage of h.m.s .
" blonde " , and <name> island by captain beechey .
) , where it is only fifty yards in width : the sea round these islands is very deep .
fringing-reefs , like barrier-reefs , both surround islands , and front the shores of continents .
in the charts of the eastern coast of africa , by captain <name> , many extensive fringing-reefs are laid down ; thus , for a space of nearly forty miles , from latitude 1 deg 15 ' to 1 deg 45 ' s. , a reef fringes the shore at an average distance of rather more than one mile , and therefore at a greater distance than is usual in reefs of this class ; but as the <unk> is not lofty , and as the bottom shoals very gradually ( the depth being only from eight to fourteen fathoms at a mile and a half outside the reef ) , its extension thus far from the land offers no difficulty .
the external margin of this reef is described , as formed of projecting points , within which there is a space , from six to twelve feet deep , with patches of living <name> on it .
at <unk> ( latitude 2 deg <unk> n. ) " the port is formed , " it is said ( <name> 's " africa , " volume i. , <name> 357 , from which work the foregoing facts are likewise taken . )
" by a long reef extending eastward , four or five miles , within which there is a narrow channel , with ten to twelve feet of water at low <unk> ; " it lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the shore .
again , in the plan of <unk> ( latitude 4 deg s. ) , a reef extends for thirty-six miles , at the distance of from half a mile to one mile and a quarter from the shore ; within it , there is a channel navigable " for canoes and small craft , " between six and fifteen feet deep : outside the reef the depth is about thirty fathoms at the distance of nearly half a mile .
part of this reef is very symmetrical , and has a uniform breadth of two hundred yards .
the coast of brazil is in many parts fringed by reefs .
of these , some are not of <name> formation ; for instance , those near bahia and in front of pernambuco ; but a few miles south of this latter city , the reef follows ( see baron <unk> 's " <unk> du <unk> , " and accompanying <unk> memoir . )
so closely every turn of the shore , that i can hardly doubt it is of <name> ; it runs at the distance of three-quarters of a mile from the land , and within it the depth is from ten to fifteen feet .
i was assured by an intelligent pilot that at ports <name> and <unk> , the outer part of the reef consists of living <name> , and the inner of a white stone , full of large irregular cavities , communicating with the sea .
the bottom of the sea off the coast of brazil shoals gradually to between thirty and forty fathoms , at the distance of between nine and ten leagues from the land .
from the description now given , we must conclude that the dimensions and structure of fringing-reefs depend entirely on the greater or less inclination of the submarine slope , conjoined with the fact that reef-building polypifers can exist only at limited depths .
it follows from this , that where the sea is very shallow , as in the persian gulf and in parts of the east indian archipelago , the reefs lose their fringing character , and appear as separate and irregularly scattered patches , often of considerable area .
from the more vigorous growth of the <name> on the outside , and from the conditions being less favourable in several respects within , such reefs are generally higher and more perfect in their marginal than in their central parts ; hence these reefs sometimes assume ( and this circumstance ought not to be overlooked ) the appearance of atolls ; but they differ from atolls in their central expanse being much less deep , in their form being less defined , and in being based on a shallow foundation .
but when in a deep sea reefs fringe banks of sediment , which have accumulated beneath the surface , round either islands or submerged rocks , they are distinguished with difficulty on the one hand from encircling barrier-reefs , and on the other from atolls .
in the west indies there are reefs , which i should probably have arranged under both these classes , had not the existence of large and level banks , lying a little beneath the surface , ready to serve as the basis for the attachment of <name> , been occasionally brought into view by the entire or partial absence of reefs on them , and had not the formation of such banks , through the accumulation of sediment now in progress , been sufficiently evident .
fringing-reefs sometimes coat , and thus protect the foundations of islands , which have been worn down by the surf to the level of the sea .
according to ehrenberg , this has been extensively the case with the islands in the red sea , which formerly ranged parallel to the shores of the mainland , with deep water within them : hence the reefs now coating their bases are situated relatively to the land like barrier-reefs , although not belonging to that class ; but there are , as i believe , in the red sea some true barrier-reefs .
the reefs of this sea and of the west indies <name> be described in the appendix .
in some cases , fringing-reefs appear to be considerably modified in outline by the course of the prevailing currents .
dr. j. <name> informs me that on the east coast of madagascar almost every headland and low point of sand has a coral-reef extending from it in a s.w .
and n.e .
line , parallel to the currents on that shore .
i should think the influence of the currents chiefly consisted in causing an extension , in a certain direction , of a proper foundation for the attachment of the <name> .
round many intertropical islands , for instance the <unk> on the coast of brazil surveyed by captain fitzroy , and , as i am informed by mr. cuming , round the philippines , the bottom of the sea is entirely coated by irregular masses of <name> , which although often of large size , do not reach the surface and form proper reefs .
this must be owing , either to insufficient growth , or to the absence of those kinds of corals which can withstand the breaking of the waves .
the three classes , atoll-formed , barrier , and fringing-reefs , together with the modifications just described of the latter , include all the most remarkable <name> formations anywhere existing .
at the commencement of the last chapter in the volume , where i detail the principles on which the map ( plate iii . )
is coloured , the exceptional cases <name> be enumerated .
chapter iv.  on the distribution and growth of coral-reefs .
in this chapter i <name> give all the facts which i have collected , relating to the distribution of coral-reefs ,  to the conditions favourable to their increase ,  to the rate of their growth ,  and to the depth at which they are formed .
these subjects have an important bearing on the theory of the origin of the different classes of coral-reefs .
section <unk>  on the distribution of coral-reefs , and on the conditions favourable to their increase .
with regard to the limits of latitude , over which coral-reefs extend , i have nothing new to add .
the bermuda islands , in 32 deg 15 ' n. , is the point furthest removed from the equator , in which they appear to exist ; and it has been suggested that their extension so far northward in this instance is owing to the warmth of the gulf stream .
in the pacific , the loo <unk> islands , in latitude 27 deg n. , have reefs on their shores , and there is an atoll in 28 deg 30 ' , situated n.w .
of the sandwich archipelago .
in the red sea there are coral-reefs in latitude 30 deg .
in the southern hemisphere coral-reefs do not extend so far from the equatorial sea .
in the southern pacific there are only a few reefs beyond the line of the tropics , but <unk> <unk> , on the western shores of australia in latitude 29 deg s. , are of <name> formation .
the proximity of volcanic land , owing to the lime generally evolved from it , has been thought to be favourable to the increase of coral-reefs .
there is , however , not much foundation for this view ; for nowhere are coral-reefs more extensive than on the shores of new caledonia , and of <unk> australia , which consist of primary formations ; and in the largest groups of atolls , namely the maldiva , chagos , <name> , <name> , and low archipelagoes , there is no volcanic or other kind of rock , excepting that formed of <name> .
the entire absence of coral-reefs in certain large areas within the tropical seas , is a remarkable fact .
thus no coral-reefs were observed , during the surveying voyages of the " beagle " and her tender on the west coast of south <name> south of the equator , or round the galapagos islands .
it appears , also , that there are none ( i have been informed that this is the case , by lieutenant <unk> , r.n. , and others who have had ample opportunities for observation . )
north of the equator ; mr. <name> , who surveyed the isthmus of panama , remarked to me , that although he had seen corals living in the bay of panama , yet he had never observed any reefs formed by them .
i at first attributed this absence of reefs on the coasts of peru and of the galapagos islands ( the mean temperature of the surface sea from observations made by the direction of captain fitzroy on the shores of the galapagos islands , between the 16th of <name> and the 20th of october , 1835 , was 68 deg fahr .
the lowest temperature observed was <unk> deg at the south-west end of albemarle island ; and on the west coast of this island , it was several times 62 deg and 63 deg .
the mean temperature of the sea in the low archipelago of atolls , and near tahiti , from similar observations made on board the " beagle " , was ( although further from the equator ) <unk> deg , the lowest any day being <unk> deg .
therefore we have here a difference of <unk> deg in mean temperature , and 18 deg in extremes ; a difference doubtless quite sufficient to affect the distribution of organic beings in the two areas .
) , to the coldness of the currents from the south , but the gulf of panama is one of the hottest pelagic districts in the world .
( humboldt 's " personal narrative , " volume vii. , <name> 434 . )
in the central parts of the pacific there are islands entirely free from reefs ; in some few of these cases i have thought that this was owing to recent volcanic action ; but the existence of reefs round the greater part of hawaii , one of the sandwich islands , shows that recent volcanic action does not necessarily prevent their growth .
in the last chapter i stated that the bottom of the sea round some islands is thickly coated with living corals , which nevertheless do not form reefs , either from insufficient growth , or from the species not being adapted to contend with the breaking waves .
i have been assured by several people , that there are no coral-reefs on the west coast of africa ( it might be concluded , from a paper by captain <name> ( " geographical journal " , volume ii. , <name> 89 ) , that the reefs off cape st. <name> and the <unk> ' islands were of <name> , although the author states that they are not purely coralline .
but i have been assured by lieutenant holland , r.n. , that these reefs are not of <name> , or at least that they do not at all resemble those in the west indies .
) , or round the islands in the gulf of guinea .
this perhaps may be attributed , in part , to the sediment brought down by the many rivers <unk> on that coast , and to the extensive mud-banks , which line great part of it .
but the islands of st. <name> , ascension , the cape <unk> , st. <name> 's , and <name> noronha , are , also , entirely without reefs , although they lie far out at sea , are composed of the same ancient volcanic rocks , and have the same general form , with those islands in the pacific , the shores of which are surrounded by gigantic walls of coral-rock .
with the exception of bermuda , there is not a single coral-reef in the central expanse of the atlantic ocean .
it <name> , perhaps , be suggested that the quantity of carbonate of lime in different parts of the sea , may regulate the presence of reefs .
but this can not be the case , for at ascension , the waves charged to excess precipitate a thick layer of calcareous matter on the tidal rocks ; and at st. jago , in the cape <unk> , carbonate of lime not only is abundant on the shores , but it forms the chief part of some upraised <unk> strata .
the apparently capricious distribution , therefore , of coral-reefs , can not be explained by any of these obvious causes ; but as the study of the terrestrial and better known half of the world must convince every one that no station capable of supporting life is lost ,  nay more , that there is a struggle for each station , between the different orders of nature ,  we may conclude that in those parts of the intertropical sea , in which there are no coral-reefs , there are other organic bodies supplying the place of the reef-building polypifers .
it has been shown in the chapter on keeling atoll that there are some species of large fish , and the whole tribe of <unk> which prey on the <unk> parts of the corals .
on the other hand , the polypifers in their turn must prey on some other organic beings ; the decrease of which from any cause would cause a proportionate destruction of the living <name> .
the relations , therefore , which determine the formation of reefs on any shore , by the vigorous growth of the efficient kinds of <name> , must be very complex , and with our imperfect knowledge quite inexplicable .
from these considerations , we may infer that changes in the condition of the sea , not obvious to our senses , might destroy all the coral-reefs in one area , and cause them to appear in another : thus , the pacific or indian ocean might become as barren of coral-reefs as the atlantic now is , without our being able to assign any adequate cause for such a change .
it has been a question with some naturalists , which part of a reef is most favourable to the growth of <name> .
the great mounds of living porites and of millepora round keeling atoll occur exclusively on the extreme verge of the reef , which is washed by a constant succession of breakers ; and living <name> nowhere else forms solid masses .
at the <name> islands the larger kinds of <name> ( chiefly species of <unk> , a genus closely allied to porites ) " which form rocks measuring several fathoms in thickness , " prefer , according to chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage " ( english translation ) , volume iii. , pages 142 , 143 , 331 .
) , the most violent surf .
i have stated that the outer margin of the maldiva atolls consists of living corals ( some of which , if not all , are of the same species with those at keeling atoll ) , and here the surf is so tremendous , that even large ships have been thrown , by a single heave of the sea , high and dry on the reef , all on board thus escaping with their lives .
ehrenberg ( ehrenberg , " uber die natur und <unk> der <unk> <unk> im <unk> <unk> , " <name> 49 . )
remarks , that in the red sea the strongest corals live on the outer reefs , and appear to love the surf ; he adds , that the more branched kinds abound a little way within , but that even these in still more protected places , become smaller .
many other facts having a similar tendency might be adduced .
( in the west indies , as i am informed by captain bird <name> , r.n. , it is the common belief of those , who are best acquainted with the reefs , that the <name> flourishes most , where freely exposed to the swell of the open sea . )
it has , however , been doubted by mm .
quoy and gaimard , whether any kind of <name> can even withstand , much less flourish in , the breakers of an open sea ( " annales des sciences <unk> , " tome vi. , pages 276 , <unk>  " la ou <name> <unk> sont <unk> , <name> <unk> ne <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> leurs <unk> edifices , " etc .
) : they affirm that the <unk> <unk> flourish only where the water is tranquil , and the heat intense .
this statement has passed from one geological work to another ; nevertheless , the protection of the whole reef undoubtedly is due to those kinds of <name> , which can not exist in the situations thought by these naturalists to be most favourable to them .
for should the outer and living margin perish , of any one of the many low coral-islands , round which a line of great breakers is incessantly foaming , the whole , it is scarcely possible to doubt , would be washed away and destroyed , in less than half a century .
but the vital energies of the corals conquer the mechanical power of the waves ; and the large fragments of reef torn up by every storm , are replaced by the slow but steady growth of the innumerable polypifers , which form the living zone on its outer edge .
from these facts , it is certain , that the strongest and most massive corals flourish , where most exposed .
the less perfect state of the reef of most atolls on the leeward and less exposed side , compared with its state to windward ; and the analogous case of the greater number of breaches on the near sides of those atolls in the maldiva archipelago , which afford some protection to each other , are obviously explained by this circumstance .
if the question had been , under what conditions the greater number of species of <name> , not regarding their bulk and strength , were developed , i should answer ,  probably in the situations described by mm .
quoy and gaimard , where the water is tranquil and the heat intense .
the total number of species of <name> in the <unk> seas must be very great : in the red sea alone , 120 kinds , according to ehrenberg ( ehrenberg , " uber die natur , " etc. , etc. , <name> 46 .
) , have been observed .
the same author has observed that the recoil of the sea from a steep shore is injurious to the growth of <name> , although waves breaking over a bank are not so .
ehrenberg also states , that where there is much sediment , placed so as to be liable to be moved by the waves there is little or no <name> ; and a collection of living specimens placed by him on a <name> shore died in the course of a few days .
( <unk> , <name> 49 . )
an experiment , however , <name> presently be related in which some large masses of living <name> increased rapidly in size , after having been secured by stakes on a <unk> .
that loose sediment should be injurious to the living polypifers , appears , at first sight , probable ; and accordingly , in sounding off keeling atoll , and ( as <name> hereafter be shown ) off mauritius , the arming of the lead invariably came up clean , where the <name> was growing vigorously .
this same circumstance has probably given rise to a strange belief , which , according to captain <name> ( captain <name> on the geography of the maldiva islands , " geographical journal " , volume ii. , <name> 88 .
) , is general amongst the inhabitants of the maldiva atolls , namely that corals have roots , and therefore that if merely broken down to the surface , they grow up again ; but , if rooted out , they are permanently destroyed .
by this means the inhabitants keep their harbours clear ; and thus the french governor of st. <name> 's in madagascar , " cleared out and made a beautiful little port at that place . "
for it is probable that sand would accumulate in the hollows formed by tearing out the corals , but not on the broken and projecting stumps , and therefore , in the former case , the fresh growth of the <name> might be thus prevented .
in the last chapter i remarked that fringing-reefs are almost universally breached , where streams enter the sea .
( lieutenant <unk> and others have remarked that this is the case in the red sea ; dr. <unk> ( " reise in abyss . "
band .
i. , <name> 142 ) says that there are pear-shaped harbours in the upraised <unk> , into which periodical streams enter .
from this circumstance , i presume , we must infer that before the upheaval of the strata now forming the <unk> , fresh water and sediment entered the sea at these points ; and the <name> being thus prevented growing , the pear-shaped harbours were produced . )
most authors have attributed this fact to the injurious effects of the fresh water , even where it enters the sea only in small quantity , and during a part of the year .
no doubt brackish water would prevent or retard the growth of <name> ; but i believe that the mud and sand which is deposited , even by rivulets when flooded , is a much more efficient check .
the reef on each side of the channel leading into port <name> at mauritius , ends abruptly in a wall , at the foot of which i sounded and found a bed of thick mud .
this <unk> of the sides appears to be a general character in such breaches .
cook ( cook 's " first voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 271 ( <unk> 's edition ) .
) , speaking of one at <unk> , says , " like all the rest , it is very steep on both sides . "
now , if it were the fresh water mingling with the salt which prevented the growth of <name> , the reef certainly would not terminate abruptly , but as the polypifers nearest the impure stream would grow less vigorously than those farther off , so would the reef gradually thin away .
on the other hand , the sediment brought down from the land would only prevent the growth of the <name> in the line of its deposition , but would not check it on the side , so that the reefs might increase till they overhung the bed of the channel .
the breaches are much fewer in number , and front only the larger valleys in reefs of the encircling barrier class .
they probably are kept open in the same manner as those into the lagoon of an atoll , namely , by the force of the currents and the drifting outwards of fine sediment .
their position in front of valleys , although often separated from the land by deep water <unk> , which it might be thought would entirely remove the injurious effects both of the fresh water and the sediment , <name> receive a simple explanation when we discuss the origin of barrier-reefs .
in the vegetable kingdom every different station has its peculiar group of plants , and similar relations appear to prevail with corals .
we have already described the great difference between the corals within the lagoon of an atoll and those on its outer margin .
the corals , also , on the margin of keeling island occurred in zones ; thus the porites and millepora <unk> grow to a large size only where they are washed by a heavy sea , and are killed by a short exposure to the air ; whereas , three species of <unk> also live amidst the breakers , but are able to survive uncovered for a part of each tide ; at greater depths , a strong <unk> and millepora <unk> are the commonest kinds , the former appearing to be confined to this part , beneath the zone of massive corals , minute <unk> corallines and other organic bodies live .
if we compare the external margin of the reef at keeling atoll with that on the leeward side of mauritius , which are very differently circumstanced , we shall find a corresponding difference in the appearance of the corals .
at the latter place , the genus <unk> is preponderant over every other kind , and beneath the zone of massive corals there are large beds of <unk> .
there is also a marked difference , according to captain moresby ( captain moresby on the northern maldiva atolls , " geographical journal " , volume v. , <name> 401 .
) , between the great branching corals of the red sea , and those on the reefs of the maldiva atolls .
these facts , which in themselves are deserving of notice , bear , perhaps , not very remotely , on a remarkable circumstance which has been pointed out to me by captain moresby , namely , that with very few exceptions , none of the <unk> within the lagoons of peros banhos , <name> garcia , and the great chagos bank ( all situated in the chagos group ) , rise to the surface of the water ; whereas all those , with equally few exceptions , within <name> and <unk> atolls in the same group , and likewise within the large southern maldiva atolls , reach the surface .
i make these statements , after having examined the charts of each atoll .
in the lagoon of peros banhos , which is nearly twenty miles across , there is only one single reef which rises to the surface ; in <name> garcia there are seven , but several of these lie close to the margin of the lagoon , and need scarcely have been reckoned ; in the great chagos bank there is not one .
on the other hand , in the lagoons of some of the great southern maldiva atolls , although thickly studded with reefs , every one without exception rises to the surface ; and on an average there are less than two submerged reefs in each atoll ; in the northern atolls , however , the submerged <unk> are not quite so rare .
the submerged reefs in the chagos atolls generally have from one to seven fathoms water on them , but some have from seven to ten .
most of them are small with very steep sides ( some of these statements were not communicated to me <unk> by captain moresby , but are taken from the ms. account before alluded to , of the chagos group .
) ; at peros banhos they rise from a depth of about thirty fathoms , and some of them in the great chagos bank from above forty fathoms ; they are covered , captain moresby informs me , with living and healthy <name> , two and three feet high , consisting of several species .
why then have not these <unk> reached the surface , like the innumerable ones in the atolls above named ?
if we attempt to assign any difference in their external conditions , as the cause of this diversity , we are at once baffled .
the lagoon of <name> garcia is not deep , and is almost wholly surrounded by its reef ; peros banhos is very deep , much larger , with many wide passages communicating with the open sea .
on the other hand , of those atolls , in which all or nearly all the <unk> have reached the surface , some are small , others large , some shallow , others deep , some <unk> , and others open .
captain moresby informs me that he has seen a french chart of <name> garcia made eighty years before his survey , and apparently very accurate ; and from it he infers , that during this interval there has not been the smallest change in the depth on any of the knolls within the lagoon .
it is also known that during the last fifty-one years , the eastern channel into the lagoon has neither become narrower , nor decreased in depth ; and as there are numerous small knolls of living <name> within it , some change might have been anticipated .
moreover , as the whole reef round the lagoon of this atoll has been converted into land  an unparalleled case , i believe , in an atoll of such large size ,  and as the strip of land is for considerable spaces more than half a mile wide  also a very unusual circumstance ,  we have the best possible evidence , that <name> garcia has remained at its present level for a very long period .
with this fact , and with the knowledge that no sensible change has taken place during eighty years in the <unk> , and considering that every single reef has reached the surface in other atolls , which do not present the smallest appearance of being older than <name> garcia and peros banhos , and which are placed under the same external conditions with them , one is led to conclude that these submerged reefs , although covered with luxuriant <name> , have no tendency to grow upwards , and that they would remain at their present levels for an almost indefinite period .
from the number of these knolls , from their position , size , and form , many of them being only one or two hundred yards across , with a rounded outline , and precipitous sides ,  it is indisputable that they have been formed by the growth of <name> ; and this makes the case much more remarkable .
in peros banhos and in the great chagos bank , some of these almost columnar masses are 200 feet high , and their summits lie only from two to eight fathoms beneath the surface ; therefore , a small proportional amount more of growth would cause them to attain the surface , like those numerous knolls , which rise from an equally great depth within the maldiva atolls .
we can hardly suppose that time has been wanting for the upward growth of the <name> , whilst in <name> garcia , the broad annular strip of land , formed by the continued accumulation of detritus , shows how long this atoll has remained at its present level .
we must look to some other cause than the rate of growth ; and i suspect it <name> be found in the reefs being formed of different species of corals , adapted to live at different depths .
the great chagos bank is situated in the centre of the chagos group , and the pitt and speaker banks at its two extreme points .
these banks resemble atolls , except in their external rim being about eight fathoms submerged , and in being formed of dead rock , with very little living <name> on it : a portion nine miles long of the annular reef of peros banhos atoll is in the same condition .
these facts , as <name> hereafter be shown , render it very probable that the whole group at some former period subsided seven or eight fathoms ; and that the <name> perished on the outer margin of those atolls which are now submerged , but that it continued alive , and grew up to the surface on those which are now perfect .
if these atolls did subside , and if from the suddenness of the movement or from any other cause , those corals which are better adapted to live at a certain depth than at the surface , once got possession of the knolls , supplanting the former occupants , they would exert little or no tendency to grow upwards .
to illustrate this , i may observe , that if the corals of the upper zone on the outer edge of keeling atoll were to perish , it is improbable that those of the lower zone would grow to the surface , and thus become exposed to conditions for which they do not appear to be adapted .
the conjecture , that the corals on the submerged knolls within the chagos atolls have analogous habits with those of the lower zone outside keeling atoll , receives some support from a remark by captain moresby , namely , that they have a different appearance from those on the reefs in the maldiva atolls , which , as we have seen , all rise to the surface : he compares the kind of difference to that of the vegetation under different climates .
i have entered at considerable length into this case , although unable to throw much light on it , in order to show that an equal tendency to upward growth ought not to be attributed to all coral-reefs ,  to those situated at different depths ,  to those forming the ring of an atoll or those on the knolls within a lagoon ,  to those in one area and those in another .
the inference , therefore , that one reef could not grow up to the surface within a given time , because another , not known to be covered with the same species of corals , and not known to be placed under conditions exactly the same , has not within the same time reached the surface , is <unk> .
section <unk>  on the rate of growth of coral-reefs .
the remark made at the close of the last section , naturally leads to this division of our subject , which has not , i think , hitherto been considered under a right point of view .
ehrenberg ( ehrenberg , as before cited , pages 39 , 46 , and 50 . )
has stated , that in the red sea , the corals only coat other rocks in a layer from one to two feet in thickness , or at most to a fathom and a half ; and he <unk> that , in any case , they form , by their own proper growth , great masses , stratum over stratum .
a nearly similar observation has been made by mm .
quoy and gaimard ( " annales des sciences nat . "
<name> .
vi. , <name> 28 .
) , with respect to the thickness of some upraised beds of <name> , which they examined at timor and some other places .
ehrenberg ( ehrenberg , ut <unk> , <name> 42 . )
saw certain large massive corals in the red sea , which he imagines to be of such vast antiquity , that they might have been beheld by pharaoh ; and according to mr. lyell ( <unk> " principles of geology , " book iii. , chapter xviii . )
there are certain corals at bermuda , which are known by tradition , to have been living for centuries .
to show how slowly coral-reefs grow upwards , captain beechey ( beechey 's " voyage to the pacific , " chapter viii . )
has adduced the case of the <unk> reef off tahiti , which has remained at the same depth beneath the surface , namely about two fathoms and a half , for a period of sixty-seven years .
there are reefs in the red sea , which certainly do not appear ( ehrenberg , ut <unk> , <name> 43 . )
to have increased in dimensions during the last <unk> , and from the comparison of old charts with recent surveys , probably not during the last two hundred years .
these , and other similar facts , have so strongly impressed many with the belief of the extreme slowness of the growth of corals , that they have even doubted the possibility of islands in the great oceans having been formed by their agency .
others , again , who have not been overwhelmed by this difficulty , have admitted that it would require thousands , and tens of thousands of years , to form a mass , even of inconsiderable thickness ; but the subject has not , i believe , been viewed in the proper light .
that masses of considerable thickness have been formed by the growth of <name> , may be inferred with certainty from the following facts .
in the deep lagoons of peros banhos and of the great chagos bank , there are , as already described , small <unk> knolls covered with living <name> .
there are similar knolls in the southern maldiva atolls , some of which , as captain moresby assures me , are less than a hundred yards in diameter , and rise to the surface from a depth of between two hundred and fifty and three hundred feet .
considering their number , form , and position , it would be preposterous to suppose that they are based on pinnacles of any rock , not of <name> formation ; or that sediment could have been heaped up into such small and steep isolated cones .
as no kind of living <name> grows above the height of a few feet , we are compelled to suppose that these knolls have been formed by the successive growth and death of many individuals ,  first one being broken off or killed by some accident , and then another , and one set of species being replaced by another set with different habits , as the reef rose nearer the surface , or as other changes supervened .
the spaces between the corals would become filled up with fragments and sand , and such matter would probably soon be consolidated , for we learn from lieutenant <name> ( " geological transactions , " volume v. , <name> 113 .
) , that at bermuda a process of this kind takes place beneath water , without the aid of evaporation .
in reefs , also , of the barrier class , we may feel sure , as i have shown , that masses of great thickness have been formed by the growth of the <name> ; in the case of vanikoro , judging only from the depth of the moat between the land and the reef , the wall of coral-rock must be at least three hundred feet in vertical thickness .
it is unfortunate that the upraised coral-islands in the pacific have not been examined by a geologist .
the cliffs of <name> island , in the low archipelago , are eighty feet high , and appear , from captain <unk> description , to consist of a homogeneous coral-rock .
from the isolated position of this island , we may safely infer that it is an upraised atoll , and therefore that it has been formed by masses of <name> , grown together .
savage island seems , from the description of the younger forster ( <unk> " voyage round the world with cook , " volume ii. , pages 163 , 167 .
) , to have a similar structure , and its shores are about forty feet high : some of the cook islands also appear ( <name> 's " narrative of missionary enterprise , " <name> 30 . )
to be similarly composed .
captain <unk> , r.n. , in a letter which captain beaufort showed me at the admiralty , speaking of bow atoll , says , " i have succeeded in boring forty-five feet through <unk> , when the <unk> became jammed by the falling in of the surrounding creamy matter . "
on one of the maldiva atolls , captain moresby bored to a depth of twenty-six feet , when his <unk> also broke : he has had the kindness to give me the matter brought up ; it is perfectly white , and like finely triturated coral-rock .
in my description of keeling atoll , i have given some facts , which show that the reef probably has grown outwards ; and i have found , just within the outer margin , the great mounds of porites and of millepora , with their summits lately killed , and their sides subsequently thickened by the growth of the <name> : a layer , also , of <unk> had already coated the dead surface .
as the external slope of the reef is the same round the whole of this atoll , and round many other atolls , the <name> of inclination must result from an <unk> between the growing powers of the <name> , and the force of the breakers , and their action on the loose sediment .
the reef , therefore , could not increase outwards , without a nearly equal addition to every part of the slope , so that the original inclination might be preserved , and this would require a large amount of sediment , all derived from the wear of corals and shells , to be added to the lower part .
moreover , at keeling atoll , and probably in many other cases , the different kinds of corals would have to encroach on each other ; thus the nulliporae can not increase outwards without encroaching on the porites and millepora <unk> , as is now taking place ; nor these latter without encroaching on the strongly branched <unk> , the millepora <unk> , and some <unk> ; nor these again without a foundation being formed for them within the requisite depth , by the accumulation of sediment .
how slow , then , must be the ordinary lateral or outward growth of such reefs .
but off christmas atoll , where the sea is much more shallow than is usual , we have good reason to believe that , within a period not very remote , the reef has increased considerably in width .
the land has the extraordinary breadth of three miles ; it consists of parallel ridges of shells and broken corals , which furnish " an <unk> proof , " as observed by cook ( cook 's " third voyage , " book iii. , chapter x .
) , " that the island has been produced by <unk> from the sea , and is in a state of increase . "
the land is fronted by a coral-reef , and from the manner in which islets are known to be formed , we may feel confident that the reef was not three miles wide , when the first , or most backward ridge , was thrown up ; and , therefore , we must conclude that the reef has grown outwards during the accumulation of the successive ridges .
here then , a wall of coral-rock of very considerable breadth has been formed by the outward growth of the living margin , within a period during which ridges of shells and corals , lying on the bare surface , have not decayed .
there can be little doubt , from the account given by captain beechey , that <name> atoll , in the low archipelago , has been converted in the space of thirty-four years , from being , as described by the crew of a wrecked whaling vessel , a " reef of rocks " into a <unk> , fourteen miles in length , with " one of its sides covered nearly the whole way with high trees . "
( beechey 's " voyage to the pacific , " chapter vii .
and viii . )
the islets , also , on keeling atoll , it has been shown , have increased in length , and since the construction of an old chart , several of them have become united into one long islet ; but in this case , and in that of <name> atoll , we have no proof , and can only infer as probable , that the reef , that is the foundation of the islets , has increased as well as the islets themselves .
after these considerations , i attach little importance , as indicating the ordinary and still less the possible rate of outward growth of coral-reefs , to the fact that certain reefs in the red sea have not increased during a long interval of time ; or to other such cases , as that of <unk> atoll in the <name> group , where every islet , described a thousand years before by <unk> was found in the same state by lutke ( f. lutke 's " voyage <unk> du <unk> . "
in the group <unk> , however , it appears that what is now the islet <unk> , is called in <unk> 's chart , the banc de <unk> .
it is not stated whether this has been caused by the growth of <name> , or by the accumulation of sand .
) ,  without it could be shown that , in these cases , the conditions were favourable to the vigorous and <unk> growth of the corals living in the different zones of depth , and that a proper basis for the extent of the reef was present .
the former conditions must depend on many contingencies , and in the deep oceans where <name> formations most abound , a basis within the requisite depth can rarely be present .
nor do i attach any importance to the fact of certain submerged reefs , as those off tahiti , or those within <name> garcia not now being nearer the surface than they were many years ago , as an indication of the rate under favourable circumstances of the upward growth of reefs ; after it has been shown , that all the reefs have grown to the surface in some of the chagos atolls , but that in neighbouring atolls which appear to be of equal antiquity and to be exposed to the same external conditions , every reef remains submerged ; for we are almost driven to attribute this to a difference , not in the rate of growth , but in the habits of the corals in the two cases .
in an <unk> reef , the corals , which are so different in kind on different parts of it , are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy , and hold their places , like other organic beings , by a struggle one with another , and with external nature ; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow , except under peculiarly favourable circumstances .
almost the only natural condition , allowing a quick upward growth of the whole surface of a reef , would be a slow subsidence of the area in which it stood ; if , for instance , keeling atoll were to subside two or three feet , can we doubt that the projecting margin of live <name> , about half an inch in thickness , which surrounds the dead upper surfaces of the mounds of porites , would in this case form a concentric layer over them , and the reef thus increase upwards , instead of , as at present , outwards ?
the nulliporae are now encroaching on the porites and millepora , but in this case might we not confidently expect that the latter would , in their turn , encroach on the nulliporae ?
after a subsidence of this kind , the sea would gain on the islets , and the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon , would be covered by a sheet of clear water ; and might we not then expect that these reefs would rise to the surface , as they anciently did when the lagoon was less confined by islets , and as they did within a period of ten years in the <unk> , cut by the inhabitants ?
in one of the maldiva atolls , a reef , which within a very few years existed as an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees , was found by lieutenant <unk> " entirely covered with live <name> and <unk> . "
the natives believe that the islet was washed away by a change in the currents , but if , instead of this , it had quietly subsided , surely every part of the island which offered a solid foundation , would in a like manner have become coated with living <name> .
through steps such as these , any thickness of rock , composed of a singular <unk> of various kinds of corals , shells , and calcareous sediment , might be formed ; but without subsidence , the thickness would necessarily be determined by the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can exist .
if it be asked , at what rate in years i suppose a reef of <name> favourably circumstanced could grow up from a given depth ; i should answer , that we have no precise evidence on this point , and comparatively little concern with it .
we see , in innumerable points over wide areas , that the rate has been sufficient , either to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface , or , as is more probable , to keep them at the surface , during progressive <unk> ; and this is a much more important standard of comparison than any cycle of years .
it may , however , be inferred from the following facts , that the rate in years under favourable circumstances would be very far from slow .
dr. <name> , of <unk> , has , in his ms. <unk> deposited in the library of the edinburgh university ( extracts from which i owe to the kindness of dr. <unk> ) , the following account of some experiments , which he tried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the east coast of madagascar .
" to ascertain the rise and progress of the <unk> , and fix the number of species met with at foul point ( latitude 17 deg 40 ' ) twenty species of <name> were taken off the reef and planted apart on a <unk> three feet deep at low water .
each portion weighed ten pounds , and was kept in its place by stakes .
similar quantities were placed in a clump and secured as the rest .
this was done in december 1830 .
in july following , each detached mass was nearly level with the sea at low water , quite immovable , and several feet long , stretching as the parent reef , with the coast current from north to south .
the masses accumulated in a clump were found equally increased , but some of the species in such unequal ratios , as to be growing over each other . "
the loss of dr. <unk> magnificent collection by shipwreck , unfortunately prevents its being known to what genera these corals belonged ; but from the <name> experimented on , it is certain that all the more conspicuous kinds must have been included .
dr. <name> informs me , in a letter , that he believes it was a <unk> , which grew most vigorously .
one may be permitted to suspect that the level of the sea might possibly have been somewhat different at the two stated periods ; nevertheless , it is quite evident that the growth of the <unk> masses , during the six or seven months , at the end of which they were found <unk> fixed ( it is stated by de la <unk> ( " geological <name> , " <name> 143 ) , on the authority of mr. <name> , who surveyed the isthmus of panama , that some specimens of polypifers , placed by him in a sheltered pool of water , were found in the course of a few days firmly fixed by the secretion of a stony matter , to the bottom ) and several feet in length , must have been very great .
the fact of the different kinds of <name> , when placed in one clump , having increased in extremely unequal ratios , is very interesting , as it shows the manner in which a reef , supporting many species of <name> , would probably be affected by a change in the external conditions favouring one kind more than another .
the growth of the masses of <name> in n. and s. lines parallel to the prevailing currents , whether due to the drifting of sediment or to the simple movement of the water , is , also , a very interesting circumstance .
a fact , communicated to me by lieutenant <unk> , <unk> , in some degree <unk> the result of dr. <name> 's experiments : it is , that in the persian gulf a ship had her copper bottom encrusted in the course of twenty months with a layer of <name> , two feet in thickness , which it required great force to remove , when the vessel was <unk> : it was not ascertained to what order this <name> belonged .
the case of the <unk> choked up with <name> in an interval of less than ten years , in the lagoon of keeling atoll , should be here borne in mind .
we may also infer , from the trouble which the inhabitants of the maldiva atolls take to root out , as they express it , the <unk> from their harbours , that their growth can hardly be very slow .
( mr. stutchbury ( " west of england journal " , no .
i. , <name> 50 . )
has described a specimen of <unk> , " weighing 2 lbs .
9 <unk> , which surrounds a species of oyster , whose age could not be more than two years , and yet is completely enveloped by this dense <name> . "
i presume that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured ; otherwise the fact tells nothing .
mr. stutchbury also mentions an anchor , which had become entirely encrusted with <name> in fifty years ; other cases , however , are recorded of anchors which have long remained amidst coral-reefs without having become coated .
the anchor of the " beagle " , in 1832 , after having been down exactly one month at rio de janeiro , was so thickly coated by two species of <unk> , that large spaces of the iron were entirely concealed ; the tufts of this horny <unk> were between two and three inches in length .
it has been attempted to <unk> , but i believe erroneously , the rate of growth of a reef , from the fact mentioned by captain beechey , of the <unk> <unk> being embedded in coral-rock .
but it should be remembered , that some species of this genus invariably live , both whilst young and old , in cavities , which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth .
i saw many of these shells thus embedded in the outer " flat " of keeling atoll , which is composed of dead rock ; and therefore the cavities in this case had no relation whatever with the growth of <name> .
m. lesson , also , speaking of this shell ( <unk> zoolog .
" voyage de la 'coquille ' " ) , has remarked , " que <unk> ses valves <unk> engages <unk> dans la <unk> des <unk> . " )
from the facts given in this section , it may be concluded , first , that considerable thicknesses of rock have certainly been formed within the present geological area by the growth of <name> and the accumulation of its detritus ; and , secondly , that the increase of individual corals and of reefs , both outwards or horizontally and upwards or vertically , under the peculiar conditions favourable to such increase , is not slow , when referred either to the standard of the average oscillations of level in the <unk> crust , or to the more precise but less important one of a cycle of years .
section <unk>  on the depths at which reef-building polypifers can live .
i have already described in detail , which might have appeared trivial , the nature of the bottom of the sea immediately surrounding keeling atoll ; and i <name> now describe with almost equal care the soundings off the fringing-reefs of mauritius .
i have preferred this arrangement , for the sake of grouping together facts of a similar nature .
i sounded with the wide <unk> lead which captain fitzroy used at keeling island , but my examination of the bottom was confined to a few miles of coast ( between port <name> and tomb bay ) on the leeward side of the island .
the edge of the reef is formed of great shapeless masses of branching <unk> , which chiefly consist of two species ,  apparently m. <unk> and <unk> ,  mingled with a few other kinds of <name> .
these masses are separated from each other by the most irregular gullies and cavities , into which the lead sinks many feet .
outside this irregular border of <unk> , the water <unk> gradually to twenty fathoms , which depth generally is found at the distance of from half to three-quarters of a mile from the reef .
a little further out the depth is thirty fathoms , and thence the bank slopes rapidly into the depths of the ocean .
this inclination is very gentle compared with that outside keeling and other atolls , but compared with most coasts it is steep .
the water was so clear outside the reef , that i could distinguish every object forming the rugged bottom .
in this part , and to a depth of eight fathoms , i sounded repeatedly , and at each cast pounded the bottom with the broad lead , nevertheless the arming invariably came up perfectly clean , but deeply indented .
from eight to fifteen fathoms a little calcareous sand was occasionally brought up , but more frequently the arming was simply indented .
in all this space the two <unk> above mentioned , and two species of <unk> , with rather large stars , seemed the commonest kinds ( since the preceding pages were printed off , i have received from mr. lyell a very interesting pamphlet , entitled " remarks upon <name> formations , " etc. , by j. couthouy , boston , united states , 1842 .
there is a statement ( <name> 6 ) , on the authority of the rev .
j. <name> , <unk> the remarks made by ehrenberg and lyell ( <name> 71 of this volume ) , on the antiquity of certain individual corals in the red sea and at bermuda ; namely , that at <unk> , one of the navigator islands , " particular clumps of <name> are known to the fishermen by name , derived from either some particular <unk> or tradition attached to them , and handed down from time immemorial . "
with respect to the thickness of masses of coral-rock , it clearly appears , from the descriptions given by mr. couthouy ( pages 34 , 58 ) that <unk> and <name> islands are upraised atolls , composed of <name> rock : the level summit of the former is about three hundred feet , and that of <name> island is two hundred feet above the sea-level .
) ; and it must be noticed that twice at the depth of fifteen fathoms , the arming was marked with a clean impression of an <unk> .
besides these <unk> , some fragments of the millepora <unk> , which occurs in the same relative position at keeling island , were brought up ; and in the deeper parts there were large beds of a <unk> , different from s. <unk> , but closely allied to it .
on the beach within the reef , the rolled fragments consisted chiefly of the corals just mentioned , and of a massive porites , like that at keeling atoll , of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and of numerous fragments of <unk> .
from fifteen to twenty fathoms the bottom was , with few exceptions , either formed of sand , or thickly covered with <unk> : this delicate <name> seems to form at these depths extensive beds <unk> with any other kind .
at twenty fathoms , one sounding brought up a fragment of <unk> apparently m. <unk> , and i believe it is the same species ( for i neglected to bring specimens from both stations ) which mainly forms the upper margin of the reef ; if so , it grows in depths varying from 0 to 20 fathoms .
between 20 and 23 fathoms i obtained several soundings , and they all showed a <name> bottom , with one exception at 30 fathoms , when the arming came up scooped out , as if by the margin of a large <unk> .
beyond 33 fathoms i sounded only once ; and from 86 fathoms , at the distance of one mile and a third from the edge of the reef , the arming brought up calcareous sand with a pebble of volcanic rock .
the circumstance of the arming having invariably come up quite clean , when sounding within a certain number of fathoms off the reefs of mauritius and keeling atoll ( eight fathoms in the former case , and twelve in the latter ) and of its having always come up ( with one exception ) smoothed and covered with sand , when the depth exceeded twenty fathoms , probably indicates a criterion , by which the limits of the vigorous growth of <name> might in all cases be readily ascertained .
i do not , however , suppose that if a vast number of soundings were obtained round these islands , the limit above assigned would be found never to vary , but i conceive the facts are sufficient to show , that the exceptions would be few .
the circumstance of a gradual change , in the two cases , from a field of clean <name> to a smooth <name> bottom , is far more important in indicating the depth at which the larger kinds of <name> flourish than almost any number of separate observations on the depth , at which certain species have been <unk> up .
for we can understand the gradation , only as a prolonged struggle against unfavourable conditions .
if a person were to find the soil clothed with turf on the banks of a stream of water , but on going to some distance on one side of it , he observed the blades of grass growing thinner and thinner , with intervening patches of sand , until he entered a desert of sand , he would safely conclude , especially if changes of the same kind were noticed in other places , that the presence of the water was absolutely necessary to the formation of a thick bed of turf : so may we conclude , with the same feeling of certainty , that thick beds of <name> are formed only at small depths beneath the surface of the sea .
i have endeavoured to collect every fact , which might either <unk> or <unk> this conclusion .
captain moresby , whose opportunities for observation during his survey of the maldiva and chagos archipelagoes have been <unk> , informs me , that the upper part or zone of the <unk> reefs , on the inner and outer coasts of the atolls in both groups , invariably consists of <name> , and the lower parts of sand .
at seven or eight fathoms depth , the bottom is formed , as could be seen through the clear water , of great living masses of <name> , which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from each other , with patches of white sand between them , and at a little greater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope , without any <name> .
captain moresby , also , informs me in support of his statement , that he found only decayed <name> on the <unk> bank ( northern part of the <unk> group ) which has an average depth between twenty-five and thirty-five fathoms , but that on some other banks in the same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them ( for instance , the <unk> bank ) , the <name> was living .
with regard to the coral-reefs in the red sea , ehrenberg has the following passage :  " the living corals do not descend there into great depths .
on the edges of islets and near reefs , where the depth was small , very many lived ; but we found no more even at six fathoms .
the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> asserted that there was no <name> near the <unk> at nine fathoms depth , but only sand .
we were not able to institute any more special researches . "
( ehrenberg , " uber die natur , " etc. , <name> 50 . )
i am , however , assured both by captain moresby and lieutenant <unk> , that in the more northern parts of the red sea , there are extensive beds of living <name> at a depth of twenty-five fathoms , in which the anchors of their vessels were frequently entangled .
captain moresby attributes the less depth , at which the corals are able to live in the places mentioned by ehrenberg , to the greater quantity of sediment there ; and the situations , where they were flourishing at the depth of twenty-five fathoms , were protected , and the water was extraordinarily limpid .
on the leeward side of mauritius where i found the <name> growing at a somewhat greater depth than at keeling atoll , the sea , owing apparently to its tranquil state , was likewise very clear .
within the lagoons of some of the <name> atolls , where the water can be but little agitated , there are , according to kotzebue , living beds of <name> in twenty-five fathoms .
from these facts , and considering the manner in which the beds of clean <name> off mauritius , keeling island , the maldiva and chagos atolls , graduated into a <name> slope , it appears very probable that the depth , at which reef-building polypifers can exist , is partly determined by the extent of inclined surface , which the currents of the sea and the <unk> waves have the power to keep free from sediment .
mm .
quoy and gaimard ( " annales des <unk> .
nat . "
<name> .
<name> . )
believe that the growth of <name> is confined within very limited depths ; and they state that they never found any fragment of an <unk> ( the genus they consider most efficient in forming reefs ) at a depth above twenty-five or thirty feet .
but we have seen that in several places the bottom of the sea is paved with massive corals at more than twice this depth ; and at fifteen fathoms ( or twice this depth ) off the reefs of mauritius , the arming was marked with the distinct impression of a living <unk> .
millepora <unk> lives in from 0 to 12 fathoms , and the genera <unk> and <unk> from 0 to 20 fathoms .
captain moresby has given me a specimen of <unk> <unk> ( porites of lamarck ) brought up alive from 17 fathoms .
mr. couthouy ( " remarks on <name> formations , " <name> 12 . )
states that he has <unk> up on the bahama banks considerable masses of <unk> from 16 fathoms , and he has seen this <name> growing in 20 fathoms .
a <unk> , half an inch in diameter , was <unk> up alive from 80 fathoms off <name> fernandez ( latitude 33 deg s. ) by captain <unk> .
king ( i am indebted to mr. stokes for having kindly communicated this fact to me , together with much other valuable information .
) : this is the most remarkable fact with which i am acquainted , showing the depth at which a genus of corals often found on reefs , can exist .
we ought , however , to feel less surprise at this fact , as <unk> alone of the <unk> genera , ranges far beyond the tropics ; it is found in <unk> ( <unk> 's " british animals , " genus <unk> . )
in latitude 60 deg n. in deep water , and i procured a small species from <name> <name> fuego in latitude 53 deg s. captain beechey informs me , that branches of pink and yellow <name> were frequently brought up from between twenty and twenty-five fathoms off the low atolls ; and lieutenant stokes , writing to me from the n.w .
coast of australia , says that a strongly branched <name> was procured there from thirty fathoms ; unfortunately it is not known to what genera these corals belong .
( i <name> record in the form of a note all the facts that i have been able to collect on the depths , both within and without the tropics , at which those corals and corallines can live , which there is no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a reef .

of coralline , " <name> 96 ) states that <unk> was procured in latitude 79 deg n. sticking to a line from the depth of 236 fathoms ; hence this <name> either must have been floating loose , or was entangled in stray line at the bottom .
off keeling atoll a compound <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought up from 39 fathoms , and a piece of sponge , apparently living , from 70 , and a fragment of <unk> also apparently living from 92 fathoms .
at a greater depth than 90 fathoms off this <name> island , the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of <unk> and small fragments of other nulliporae , but all dead .
captain b. <name> , r.n. , informs me that in the survey of the west indies it was noticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms , the sounding lead very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a <unk> , of which he showed me specimens .
off pernambuco , in brazil , in about twelve fathoms , the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red <unk> , and i infer from <unk> 's chart , that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area .
on the beach , within the coral-reefs of mauritius , vast quantities of fragments of nulliporae were piled up .
from these facts it appears , that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea . )
although the limit of depth , at which each particular kind of <name> ceases to exist , is far from being accurately known ; yet when we bear in mind the manner in which the clumps of <name> gradually became infrequent at about the same depth , and wholly disappeared at a greater depth than twenty fathoms , on the slope round keeling atoll , on the leeward side of the mauritius , and at rather less depth , both without and within the atolls of the maldiva and chagos archipelagoes ; and when we know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other <name> formations in their form and structure , we may , i think , conclude that in ordinary cases , reef-building polypifers do not flourish at greater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms .
it has been argued ( " journal of the <name> geographical society , " 1831 , <name> 218 . )
that reefs may possibly rise from very great depths through the means of small corals , first making a platform for the growth of the stronger kinds .
this , however , is an arbitrary supposition : it is not always remembered , that in such cases there is an antagonist power in action , namely , the decay of organic bodies , when not protected by a covering of sediment , or by their own rapid growth .
we have , moreover , no right to calculate on unlimited time for the accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses .
every fact in geology proclaims that neither the land , nor the bed of the sea retain for indefinite periods the same level .
as well might it be imagined that the british seas would in time become choked up with beds of oysters , or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable shores of <name> <name> fuego would in time form a solid and extensive coral-reef .
chapter v.  theory of the formation of the different classes of coral-reefs .
the atolls of the larger archipelagoes are not formed on submerged craters , or on banks of <unk>  immense areas interspersed with <unk>  their <unk>  the effects of storms and earthquakes on <unk>  recent changes in their <unk>  the origin of barrier-reefs and of <unk>  their relative <unk>  the step-formed ledges and walls round the shores of some <unk>  the ring-formed reefs of the maldiva <unk>  the submerged condition of parts or of the whole of some annular <unk>  the disseverment of large <unk>  the union of atolls by linear <unk>  the great chagos <unk>  objections from the area and amount of subsidence required by the theory , <unk>  the probable composition of the lower parts of atolls .
the naturalists who have visited the pacific , seem to have had their attention riveted by the lagoon-islands , or atolls ,  those singular rings of <unk> which rise abruptly out of the unfathomable ocean  and have passed over , almost unnoticed , the scarcely less wonderful encircling barrier-reefs .
the theory most generally received on the formation of atolls , is that they are based on submarine craters ; but where can we find a crater of the shape of bow atoll , which is five times as long as it is broad ( plate i. , figure 4 ) ; or like that of <unk> island ( plate ii. , figure 3 .
) , with its three loops , together sixty miles in length ; or like <unk> <unk> , narrow , crooked , and fifty-four miles long ; or like the northern maldiva atolls , made up of numerous ring-formed reefs , placed on the margin of a disc ,  one of which discs is <unk> miles in length , and only from ten to twenty in breadth ?
it is , also , not a little improbable , that there should have existed as many craters of immense size crowded together beneath the sea , as there are now in some parts atolls .
but this theory lies under a greater difficulty , as <name> be evident , when we consider on what foundations the atolls of the larger archipelagoes rest : nevertheless , if the rim of a crater afforded a basis at the proper depth , i am far from denying that a reef like a perfectly characterised atoll might not be formed ; some such , perhaps , now exist ; but i can not believe in the possibility of the greater number having thus originated .
an earlier and better theory was proposed by chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 331 .
) ; he supposes that as the more massive kinds of corals prefer the surf , the outer portions , in a reef rising from a submarine basis , would first reach the surface and consequently form a ring .
but on this view it must be assumed , that in every case the basis consists of a flat bank ; for if it were <unk> formed , like a mountainous mass , we can see no reason why the <name> should spring up from the flanks , instead of from the central and highest parts : considering the number of the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans , this assumption is very improbable .
as the lagoons of atolls are sometimes even more than forty fathoms deep , it must , also , be assumed on this view , that at a depth at which the waves do not break , the <name> grows more vigorously on the edges of a bank than on its central part ; and this is an assumption without any evidence in support of it .
i remarked , in the third chapter , that a reef , growing on a detached bank , would tend to assume an <unk> structure ; if , therefore , corals were to grow up from a bank , with a level surface some fathoms submerged , having steep sides and being situated in a deep sea , a reef not to be distinguished from an atoll , might be formed : i believe some such exist in the west indies .
but a difficulty of the same kind with that affecting the crater theory , runners , as we shall presently see , this view <unk> to the greater number of atolls .
no theory worthy of notice has been advanced to account for those barrier-reefs , which <unk> islands of moderate dimensions .
the great reef which fronts the coast of australia has been supposed , but without any special facts , to rest on the edge of a submarine precipice , extending parallel to the shore .
the origin of the third class or of fringing-reefs presents , i believe , scarcely any difficulty , and is simply consequent on the polypifers not growing up from great depths , and their not flourishing close to gently shelving beaches where the water is often turbid .
what cause , then , has given to atolls and barrier-reefs their characteristic forms ?
let us see whether an important deduction <name> not follow from the consideration of these two circumstances , first , the reef-building corals flourishing only at limited depths ; and secondly , the vastness of the areas interspersed with coral-reefs and <unk> , none of which rise to a greater height above the level of the sea , than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds .
i do not make this latter statement vaguely ; i have carefully sought for descriptions of every island in the intertropical seas ; and my task has been in some degree <unk> by a map of the pacific , corrected in 1834 by mm .
d'urville and <unk> , in which the low islands are distinguished from the high ones ( even from those much less than a hundred feet in height ) by being written without a capital letter ; i have detected a few errors in this map , respecting the height of some of the islands , which <name> be noticed in the appendix , where i treat of <name> formations in geographical order .
to the appendix , also , i must refer for a more particular account of the data on which the statements on the next <name> are grounded .
i have ascertained , and chiefly from the writings of cook , kotzebue , <unk> , <unk> , beechey , and lutke , regarding the pacific ; and from moresby ( see also captain <name> 's and lieutenant wood 's papers in the " geographical journal " , on the maldiva and <unk> archipelagoes .
these officers particularly refer to the lowness of the islets ; but i chiefly ground my assertion respecting these two groups , and the chagos group , from information communicated to me by captain moresby . )
with respect to the indian ocean , that in the following cases the term " low island " strictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up by the winds and the waves of an open sea .
if we draw a line ( the plan i have always adopted ) joining the external atolls of that part of the low archipelago in which the islands are numerous , the figure <name> be a pointed ellipse ( reaching from hood to <unk> island ) , of which the longer axis is 840 geographical miles , and the shorter 420 miles ; in this space ( i find from mr. <unk> pamphlet ( <name> 58 ) that <name> island is about two hundred feet in height ; it consists of coral-rock , and seems to have been formed by the elevation of an atoll .
it lies north-east of tahiti , close without the line bounding the space coloured dark blue in the map appended to this volume .
<unk> island , which is situated in the extreme north-west part of the low archipelago , according to measurements made on board the " beagle " , whilst sailing by , is 114 feet from the summit of the trees to the water 's edge .
this island appeared to resemble the other atolls of the group . )
none of the innumerable islets united into great rings rise above the stated level .
the <name> group is very narrow , and 300 miles in length .
in a prolonged line from this group , at the distance of 240 miles , is the <name> archipelago , the figure of which is an irregular square , one end being broader than the other ; its length is 520 miles , with an average width of 240 ; these two groups together are <unk> miles in length , and all their islets are low .
between the southern end of the <name> and the northern end of low archipelago , the ocean is thinly strewed with islands , all of which , as far as i have been able to ascertain , are low ; so that from nearly the southern end of the low archipelago , to the northern end of the <name> archipelago , there is a narrow band of ocean , more than 4,000 miles in length , containing a great number of islands , all of which are low .
in the western part of the <name> archipelago , there is a space of 480 miles in length , and about 100 broad , thinly interspersed with low islands .
lastly , in the indian ocean , the archipelago of the <unk> is 470 miles in length , and 60 in breadth ; that of the <unk> is 150 by 100 miles ; as there is a low island between these two groups , they may be considered as one group of 1,000 miles in length .
to this may be added the chagos group of low islands , situated 280 miles distant , in a line prolonged from the southern extremity of the <unk> .
this group , including the submerged banks , is 170 miles in length and 80 in breadth .
so striking is the uniformity in direction of these three archipelagoes , all the islands of which are low , that captain moresby , in one of his papers , speaks of them as parts of one great chain , nearly <unk> miles long .
i am , then , fully justified in repeating , that enormous spaces , both in the pacific and indian oceans , are interspersed with islands , of which not one rises above that height , to which the waves and winds in an open sea can heap up matter .
on what foundations , then , have these reefs and islets of <name> been constructed ?
a foundation must originally have been present beneath each atoll at that limited depth , which is indispensable for the first growth of the reef-building polypifers .
a conjecture <name> perhaps be hazarded , that the requisite bases might have been afforded by the accumulation of great banks of sediment , which owing to the action of superficial currents ( aided possibly by the undulatory movement of the sea ) did not quite reach the surface ,  as actually appears to have been the case in some parts of the west indian sea .
but in the form and disposition of the groups of atolls , there is nothing to countenance this notion ; and the assumption without any proof , that a number of immense piles of sediment have been heaped on the floor of the great pacific and indian oceans , in their central parts far remote from land , and where the dark blue colour of the limpid water <unk> its purity , can not for one moment be admitted .
the many <unk> atolls must , therefore , rest on <name> bases .
but we can not believe that the broad summit of a mountain lies buried at the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll , and nevertheless throughout the immense areas above-named , with not one point of rock projecting above the level of the sea ; for we may judge with some accuracy of mountains beneath the sea , by those on the land ; and where can we find a single chain several hundred miles in length and of considerable breadth , much less several such chains , with their many broad summits attaining the same height , within from 120 to 180 feet ?
if the data be thought insufficient , on which i have grounded my belief , respecting the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can exist , and it be assumed that they can flourish at a depth of even one hundred fathoms , yet the weight of the above argument is but little diminished , for it is almost equally improbable , that as many submarine mountains , as there are low islands in the several great and widely separated areas above specified , should all rise within six hundred feet of the surface of the sea and not one above it , as that they should be of the same height within the smaller limit of one or two hundred feet .
so highly improbable is this supposition , that we are compelled to believe , that the bases of the many atolls did never at any one period all lie submerged within the depth of a few fathoms beneath the surface , but that they were brought into the requisite position or level , some at one period and some at another , through movements in the earth 's crust .
but this could not have been effected by elevation , for the belief that points so numerous and so widely separated were successively uplifted to a certain level , but that not one point was raised above that level , is quite as improbable as the former supposition , and indeed differs little from it .
it <name> probably occur to those who have read ehrenberg 's account of the reefs of the red sea , that many points in these great areas may have been elevated , but that as soon as raised , the protuberant parts were cut off by the destroying action of the waves : a moment 's reflection , however , on the basin-like form of the atolls , <name> show that this is impossible ; for the upheaval and subsequent <unk> of an island would leave a flat disc , which might become coated with <name> , but not a deeply concave surface ; moreover , we should expect to see , in some parts at least , the rock of the foundation brought to the surface .
if , then , the foundations of the many atolls were not uplifted into the requisite position , they must of necessity have subsided into it ; and this at once <unk> every difficulty ( the additional difficulty on the crater hypothesis before alluded to , <name> now be evident ; for on this view the volcanic action must be supposed to have formed within the areas specified a vast number of craters , all rising within a few fathoms of the surface , and not one above it .
the supposition that the craters were at different times upraised above the surface , and were there abraded by the surf and subsequently coated by corals , is subject to nearly the same objections with those given above in this paragraph ; but i consider it superfluous to detail all the arguments opposed to such a notion .
chamisso 's theory , from assuming the existence of so many banks , all lying at the proper depth beneath the water , is also <unk> defective .
the same observation applies to an hypothesis of lieutenant <name> 's ( " geolog .
trans . "
volume v. , <name> 122 ) , who supposes that the ring-formed structure is caused by a greater number of germs of corals becoming attached to the declivity , than to the central plateau of a submarine bank : it likewise applies to the notion formerly entertained ( forster 's " <unk> . "
<name> 151 ) , that lagoon-islands owe their peculiar form to the instinctive tendencies of the polypifers .
according to this latter view , the corals on the outer margin of the reef instinctively expose themselves to the surf in order to afford protection to corals living in the lagoon , which belong to other genera , and to other families !
) , for we may safely infer , from the facts given in the last chapter , that during a gradual subsidence the corals would be favourably circumstanced for building up their solid frame works and reaching the surface , as island after island slowly disappeared .
thus areas of immense extent in the central and most profound parts of the great oceans , might become interspersed with <unk> , none of which would rise to a greater height than that attained by detritus heaped up by the sea , and nevertheless they might all have been formed by corals , which absolutely required for their growth a solid foundation within a few fathoms of the surface .
it would be out of place here to do more than allude to the many facts , showing that the supposition of a gradual subsidence over large areas is by no means improbable .
we have the clearest proof that a movement of this kind is possible , in the upright trees buried under the strata many thousand feet in thickness ; we have also every reason for believing that there are now large areas gradually sinking , in the same manner as others are rising .
and when we consider how many parts of the surface of the globe have been elevated within recent geological periods , we must admit that there have been <unk> on a corresponding scale , for otherwise the whole globe would have swollen .
it is very remarkable that mr. lyell ( " principles of geology , " sixth edition , volume iii. , <name> 386 .
) , even in the first edition of his " principles of geology , " inferred that the amount of subsidence in the pacific must have exceeded that of elevation , from the area of land being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it , namely , the growth of <name> and volcanic action .
but it <name> be asked , are there any direct proofs of a subsiding movement in those areas , in which subsidence <name> explain a phenomenon otherwise inexplicable ?
this , however , can hardly be expected , for it must ever be most difficult , excepting in countries long civilised , to detect a movement , the tendency of which is to conceal the part affected .
in barbarous and semi-civilised nations how long might not a slow movement , even of elevation such as that now affecting scandinavia , have escaped attention !
mr. <name> ( <name> 's " narrative of missionary enterprise , " <name> 31 . )
insists strongly that the traditions of the natives , which he has taken much pains in collecting , do not indicate the appearance of any new islands : but on the theory of a gradual subsidence , all that would be apparent would be , the water sometimes encroaching slowly on the land , and the land again recovering by the accumulation of detritus its former extent , and perhaps sometimes the conversion of an atoll with <name> islets on it , into a bare or into a sunken annular reef .
such changes would naturally take place at the periods when the sea rose above its usual limits , during a <name> of more than ordinary strength ; and the effects of the two causes would be hardly distinguishable .
in kotzebue 's " voyage " there are accounts of islands , both in the <name> and <name> archipelagoes , which have been partly washed away during <unk> ; and <unk> , the native who was on board one of the russian vessels , said " he saw the sea at <unk> rise to the feet of the cocoa-nut trees ; but it was <unk> in time . "
( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 168 . )
a storm lately entirely swept away two of the <name> islands , and converted them into shoals ; it partly , also , destroyed two other islands .
( m. <unk> in " <unk> rendus , " 1840 , <name> <unk> . )
according to a tradition which was communicated to captain fitzroy , it is believed in the low archipelago , that the arrival of the first ship caused a great inundation , which destroyed many lives .
mr. stutchbury relates , that in 1825 , the western side of chain atoll , in the same group , was completely <unk> by a hurricane , and not less than 300 lives lost : " in this instance it was evident , even to the natives , that the hurricane alone was not sufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean . "
( " west of england journal " , no .
i. , <name> 35 . )
that considerable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in the low archipelago , appears certain from the case already given of <name> island : with respect to <unk> and gloucester islands in this same group , we must either attribute great <unk> to their discoverer , the famous <unk> wallis , or believe that they have undergone a considerable change in the period of <unk> years , between his voyage and that of captain beechey 's .
<unk> island is described by wallis as " about four miles long , and three wide , " now it is only one mile and a half long .
the appearance of gloucester island , in captain beechey 's words ( beechey 's " voyage to the pacific , " chapter vii. , and wallis 's " voyage in the <unk> ' , " chapter iv .
) , has been accurately described by its discoverer , but its present form and extent differ materially . "
<unk> reef , in the chagos group , consists of a <unk> annular reef , thirteen miles in circumference , surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms deep : on its surface there were a few worn patches of conglomerate coral-rock , of about the size of hovels ; and these captain moresby considered as being , without doubt , the last remnants of islets ; so that here an atoll has been converted into an atoll-formed reef .
the inhabitants of the maldiva archipelago , as long ago as <unk> , declared , " that the high tides and violent currents were diminishing the number of the islands " ( see an extract from <unk> 's voyage in captain <name> 's paper on the maldiva archipelago , in the " geographical journal " , volume ii. , <name> 84 .
) : and i have already shown , on the authority of captain moresby , that the work of destruction is still in progress ; but that on the other hand the first formation of some islets is known to the present inhabitants .
in such cases , it would be exceedingly difficult to detect a gradual subsidence of the foundation , on which these <unk> structures rest .
some of the archipelagoes of low coral-islands are subject to earthquakes : captain moresby informs me that they are frequent , though not very strong , in the chagos group , which occupies a very central position in the indian ocean , and is far from any land not of <name> formation .
one of the islands in this group was formerly covered by a bed of mould , which , after an earthquake , disappeared , and was believed by the residents to have been washed by the rain through the broken masses of underlying rock ; the island was thus rendered unproductive .
chamisso ( see chamisso , in <unk> " first voyage , " volume iii. , pages 182 and 136 . )
states , that earthquakes are felt in the <name> atolls , which are far from any high land , and likewise in the islands of the <name> archipelago .
on one of the latter , namely <unk> atoll , admiral lutke , as he had the kindness to inform me , observed several straight fissures about a foot in width , running for some hundred yards obliquely across the whole width of the reef .
fissures indicate a stretching of the earth 's crust , and , therefore , probably changes in its level ; but these coral-islands , which have been shaken and fissured , certainly have not been elevated , and , therefore , probably they have subsided .
in the chapter on keeling atoll , i attempted to show by direct evidence , that the island underwent a movement of subsidence , during the earthquakes lately felt there .
the facts stand thus ;  there are many large tracts of ocean , without any high land , interspersed with reefs and islets , formed by the growth of those kinds of corals , which can not live at great depths ; and the existence of these reefs and low islets , in such <name> and at such distant points , is quite inexplicable , excepting on the theory , that the bases on which the reefs first became attached , slowly and successively sank beneath the level of the sea , whilst the corals continued to grow upwards .
no positive facts are opposed to this view , and some general considerations render it probable .
there is evidence of change in form , whether or not from subsidence , on some of these coral-islands ; and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances beneath them .
<name> then the theory , to which we have thus been led , solve the curious problem ,  what has given to each class of reef its peculiar form ?

let us in imagination place within one of the subsiding areas , an island surrounded by a " <unk> , "  that kind , which alone offers no difficulty in the explanation of its origin .
let the unbroken lines and the oblique shading in the woodcut ( no .
4 ) represent a vertical section through such an island ; and the horizontal shading <name> represent the section of the reef .
now , as the island sinks down , either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly , we may safely infer from what we know of the conditions favourable to the growth of <name> , that the living masses bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef , <name> soon regain the surface .
the water , however , <name> encroach , little by little , on the shore , the island becoming lower and smaller , and the space between the edge of the reef and the beach proportionately broader .
a section of the reef and island in this state , after a subsidence of several hundred feet , is given by the dotted lines : <unk> are supposed to have been formed on the new reef , and a ship is anchored in the lagoon-channel .
this section is in every respect that of an encircling barrier-reef ; it is , in fact , a section taken ( the section has been made from the chart given in the " atlas of the voyage of the 'coquille ' . "
the scale is <unk> of an inch to a mile .
the height of the island , according to m. lesson , is <unk> feet .
the deepest part of the lagoon-channel is 162 feet ; its depth is exaggerated in the woodcut for the sake of clearness . )
east and west through the highest point of the encircled island of bolabola ; of which a plan is given in plate i. , figure 5 .
the same section is more clearly shown in the following woodcut ( no .
5 ) by the unbroken lines .
the width of the reef , and its slope , both on the outer and inner side , <name> have been determined by the growing powers of the <name> , under the conditions ( for instance the force of the breakers and of the currents ) to which it has been exposed ; and the lagoon-channel <name> be deeper or <unk> , in proportion to the growth of the delicately branched corals within the reef , and to the accumulation of sediment , relatively , also , to the rate of subsidence and the length of the intervening stationary periods .
it is evident in this section , that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock , exceeds by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence , that small limit of depth at which the effective polypifers can live  the corals having grown up , as the whole sank down , from a basis formed of other corals and their consolidated fragments .
thus the difficulty on this head , which before seemed so great , disappears .
as the space between the reef and the subsiding shore continued to increase in breadth and depth , and as the injurious effects of the sediment and fresh water borne down from the land were consequently lessened , the greater number of the channels , with which the reef in its fringing state must have been breached , especially those which fronted the smaller streams , <name> have become choked up with the growth of <name> : on the windward side of the reef , where the <name> grows most vigorously , the breaches <name> probably have first been closed .
in barrier-reefs , therefore , the breaches kept open by draining the tidal waters of the lagoon-channel , <name> generally be placed on the leeward side , and they <name> still face the mouths of the larger streams , although removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh water ;  and this , it has been shown , is commonly the case .
referring to the diagram shown above , in which the newly formed barrier-reef is represented by unbroken lines , instead of by dots as in the former woodcut , let the work of subsidence go on , and the doubly pointed hill <name> form two small islands ( or more , according to the number of the hills ) included within one annular reef .
let the island continue subsiding , and the coral-reef <name> continue growing up on its own foundation , whilst the water gains inch by inch on the land , until the last and highest pinnacle is covered , and there remains a perfect atoll .
a vertical section of this atoll is shown in the woodcut by the dotted lines ;  a ship is anchored in its lagoon , but islets are not supposed yet to have been formed on the reef .
the depth of the lagoon and the width and slope of the reef , <name> depend on the circumstances just referred to under barrier-reefs .
any further subsidence <name> produce no change in the atoll , except perhaps a diminution in its size , from the reef not growing vertically upwards ; but should the currents of the sea act violently upon it , and should the corals perish on part or on the whole of its margin , changes would result during subsidence which <name> be presently noticed .
i may here observe , that a bank either of rock or of hardened sediment , level with the surface of the sea , and fringed with living <name> , would ( if not so small as to allow the central space to be quickly filled up with detritus ) by subsidence be converted immediately into an atoll , without passing , as in the case of a reef fringing the shore of an island , through the intermediate form of a barrier-reef .
if such a bank lay a few fathoms submerged , the simple growth of the <name> ( as remarked in the third chapter ) without the aid of subsidence , would produce a structure scarcely to be distinguished from a true atoll ; for in all cases the corals on the outer margin of a reef , from having space and being freely exposed to the open sea , <name> grow vigorously and tend to form a continuous ring whilst the growth of the less massive kinds on the central expanse , <name> be checked by the sediment formed there , and by that washed inwards by the breakers ; and as the space becomes <unk> , their growth <name> , also , be checked by the impurities of the water , and probably by the small amount of food brought by the enfeebled currents , in proportion to the surface of living reefs studded with innumerable craving mouths : the subsidence of a reef based on a bank of this kind , would give depth to its central expanse or lagoon , <unk> to its flanks , and through the free growth of the <name> , symmetry to its outline :  i may here repeat that the larger groups of atolls in the pacific and indian oceans can not be supposed to be founded on banks of this nature .
if , instead of the island in the diagram , the shore of a continent fringed by a reef had subsided , a great barrier-reef , like that on the north-east coast of australia , would have necessarily resulted ; and it would have been separated from the main land by a deep-water channel , broad in proportion to the amount of subsidence , and to the less or greater inclination of the neighbouring <unk> .
the effect of the continued subsidence of a great barrier-reef of this kind , and its probable conversion into a chain of separate atolls , <name> be noticed , when we discuss the apparent progressive disseverment of the larger maldiva atolls .
we now are able to perceive that the close similarity in form , dimensions , structure , and relative position ( which latter point <name> hereafter be more fully noticed ) between fringing and encircling barrier-reefs , and between these latter and atolls , is the necessary result of the transformation , during subsidence of the one class into the other .
on this view , the three classes of reefs ought to graduate into each other .
reefs having intermediate character between those of the fringing and barrier classes do exist ; for instance , on the south-west coast of madagascar , a reef extends for several miles , within which there is a broad channel from seven to eight fathoms deep , but the sea does not deepen abruptly outside the reef .
such cases , however , are open to some doubts , for an old <unk> , which had extended itself a little on a basis of its own formation , would hardly be distinguishable from a barrier-reef , produced by a small amount of subsidence , and with its lagoon-channel nearly filled up with sediment during a long stationary period .
between barrier-reefs , encircling either one lofty island or several small low ones , and atolls including a mere expanse of water , a striking series can be shown : in proof of this , i need only refer to the first plate in this volume , which speaks more plainly to the eye , than any description could to the ear .
the authorities from which the charts have been engraved , together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the plates , are given above .
at new caledonia ( plate ii. , figure 5 . )
the barrier-reefs extend for 150 miles on each side of the submarine prolongation of the island ; and at their northern extremity they appear broken up and converted into a vast atoll-formed reef , supporting a few low <unk> : we may imagine that we here see the effects of subsidence actually in progress , the water always encroaching on the northern end of the island , towards which the mountains slope down , and the reefs steadily building up their massive fabrics in the lines of their ancient growth .
we have as yet only considered the origin of barrier-reefs and atolls in their simplest form ; but there remain some peculiarities in structure and some special cases , described in the two first chapters , to be accounted for by our theory .
these consist  in the inclined ledge terminated by a wall , and sometimes succeeded by a second ledge with a wall , round the shores of certain lagoons and <unk> ; a structure which can not , as i endeavoured to show , be explained by the simple growing powers of the corals ,  in the ring or basin-like forms of the central reefs , as well as of the separate marginal portions of the northern maldiva atolls ,  in the submerged condition of the whole , or of parts of certain barrier and atoll-formed reefs ; where only a part is submerged , this being generally to leeward ,  in the apparent progressive disseverment of some of the maldiva atolls ,  in the existence of irregularly formed atolls , some being tied together by linear reefs , and others with spurs projecting from them ,  and , lastly , in the structure and origin of the great chagos bank .
step-formed ledges round certain lagoons .
if we suppose an atoll to subside at an extremely slow rate , it is difficult to follow out the complex results .
the living corals would grow up on the outer margin ; and likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the bare surface of the annular reef ; the water would encroach on the islets , but the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their entire <unk> .
after a subsidence of this very slow nature , the surface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon , would probably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand , which line the shores of most lagoons .
should , however , the atoll be carried down by a more rapid movement , the whole surface of the annular reef , where there was a foundation of solid matter , would be favourably circumstanced for the fresh growth of <name> ; but as the corals grew upwards on its exterior margin , and the waves broke heavily on this part , the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be checked from the want of water .
consequently , the exterior parts would first reach the surface , and the new annular reef thus formed on the old one , would have its summit inclined inwards , and be terminated by a <unk> wall , formed by the upward growth of the <name> ( before being much checked ) , from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef .
the inner portion of the new reef , from not having grown to the surface , would be covered by the waters of the lagoon .
should a subsidence of the same kind be repeated , the corals would again grow up in a wall , from all the solid parts of the <unk> reef , and , therefore , not from within the <name> shores of the lagoon ; and the inner part of the new annular reef would , from being as before checked in its upward growth , be of less height than the exterior parts , and therefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon .
in this case the shores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges , one beneath the other , and both abruptly terminated by <unk> cliffs .
( according to mr. couthouy ( <name> 26 ) the external reef round many atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces .
he attempts , i doubt whether successfully , to explain this structure somewhat in the same manner as i have attempted , with respect to the internal ledges round the lagoons of some atolls .
more facts are wanted regarding the nature both of the interior and exterior <unk> ledges : are all the ledges , or only the upper ones , covered with living <name> ?
if they are all covered , are the kinds different on the ledges according to the depth ?
do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same atolls ; if so , what is their total width , and is the intervening <unk> narrow , etc. ? )
the ring or <unk> reefs of the northern maldiva atolls .
i may first observe , that the reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within <unk> , would , if favourably circumstanced , grow upwards during subsidence in the same manner as the annular rim ; and , therefore , we might expect that such <unk> , when not surrounded and buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the rate of subsidence , would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which the efficient polypifers can flourish : we see this well exemplified in the small <unk> reefs , with which the deep lagoons of the chagos and southern maldiva atolls are studded .
with respect to the ring or <unk> reefs of the northern maldiva atolls , it is evident , from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the marginal rings , although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of ordinary atolls , are only modified portions of such a reef ; it is also evident that the central rings , although wider than the knolls or reefs which commonly occur in lagoons , occupy their place .
the <unk> structure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the lagoon being broad and numerous , so that all the reefs which are bathed by the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions with the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea .
hence the exterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably circumstanced for growing outwards , and increasing beyond the usual breadth ; and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for growing vigorously upwards , during the subsiding movements , to which by our theory the whole archipelago has been subjected ; and subsidence with this upward growth of the margins would convert the central space of each little reef into a small lagoon .
this , however , could only take place with those reefs , which had increased to a breadth sufficient to prevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up with the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides : hence it is that few reefs , which are less than half a mile in diameter , even in the atolls where the basin-like structure is most strikingly exhibited , include lagoons .
this remark , i may add , applies to all coral-reefs wherever found .
the <unk> reefs of the maldiva archipelago may , in fact , be briefly described , as small atolls formed during subsidence over the separate portions of large and broken atolls , in the same manner as these latter were formed over the barrier-reefs , which encircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged .
submerged and dead reefs .
in the second section of the first chapter , i have shown that there are in the neighbourhood of atolls , some deeply submerged banks , with level surfaces ; that there are others , less deeply but yet wholly submerged , having all the characters of perfect atolls , but consisting merely of dead coral-rock ; that there are barrier-reefs and atolls with merely a portion of their reef , generally on the leeward side , submerged ; and that such portions either retain their perfect outline , or they appear to be quite effaced , their former place being marked only by a bank , <unk> in outline with that part of the reef which remains perfect .
these several cases are , i believe , intimately related together , and can be explained by the same means .
there , perhaps , exist some submerged reefs , covered with living <name> and growing upwards , but to these i do not here refer .
as we see that in those parts of the ocean , where coral-reefs are most abundant , one island is fringed and another neighbouring one is not fringed ; as we see in the same archipelago , that all the reefs are more perfect in one part of it than in another , for instance , in the southern half compared with the northern half of the maldiva archipelago , and likewise on the outer coasts compared with the inner coasts of the atolls in this same group , which are placed in a double row ; as we know that the existence of the innumerable polypifers forming a reef , depends on their sustenance , and that they are preyed on by other organic beings ; and , lastly , as we know that some inorganic causes are highly injurious to the growth of <name> , it can not be expected that during the round of change to which earth , air , and water are exposed , the reef-building polypifers should keep alive for perpetuity in any one place ; and still less can this be expected , during the progressive <unk> , perhaps at some periods more rapid than at others , to which by our theory these reefs and islands have been subjected and are liable .
it is , then , not improbable that the corals should sometimes perish either on the whole or on part of a reef ; if on part , the dead portion , after a small amount of subsidence , would still retain its proper outline and position beneath the water .
after a more prolonged subsidence , it would probably form , owing to the accumulation of sediment , only the margin of a flat bank , marking the limits of the former lagoon .
such dead portions of reef would generally lie on the leeward side ( mr. lyell , in the first edition of his " principles of geology , " offered a somewhat different explanation of this structure .
he supposes that there has been subsidence ; but he was not aware that the submerged portions of reef were in most cases , if not in all , dead ; and he attributes the difference in height in the two sides of most atolls , chiefly to the greater accumulation of detritus to windward than to leeward .
but as matter is accumulated only on the backward part of the reef , the front part would remain of the same height on both sides .
i may here observe that in most cases ( for instance , at peros banhos , the gambier group and the great chagos bank ) , and i suspect in all cases , the dead and submerged portions do not blend or slope into the living and perfect parts , but are separated from them by an abrupt line .
in some instances small patches of living reef rise to the surface from the middle of the submerged and dead parts .
) , for the impure water and fine sediment would more easily flow out from the lagoon over this side of the reef , where the force of the breakers is less than to windward ; and therefore the corals would be less vigorous on this side , and be less able to resist any destroying agent .
it is likewise owing to this same cause , that reefs are more frequently breached to leeward by narrow channels , serving as by <unk> , than to windward .
if the corals perished entirely , or on the greater part of the circumference of an atoll , an <unk> bank of dead rock , more or less entirely submerged , would be produced ; and further subsidence , together with the accumulation of sediment , would often obliterate its <unk> structure , and leave only a bank with a level surface .
in the chagos group of atolls , within an area of 160 miles by 60 , there are two atoll-formed banks of dead rock ( besides another very imperfect one ) , entirely submerged ; a third , with merely two or three very small pieces of living reef rising to the surface ; and a fourth , namely , peros banhos ( plate i. , figure 9 ) , with a portion nine miles in length dead and submerged .
as by our theory this area has subsided , and as there is nothing improbable in the death , either from changes in the state of the surrounding sea or from the subsidence being great or sudden , of the corals on the whole , or on portions of some of the atolls , the case of the chagos group presents no difficulty .
so far indeed are any of the above-mentioned cases of submerged reefs from being inexplicable , that their occurrence might have been anticipated on our theory , and as fresh atolls are supposed to be in progressive formation by the subsidence of encircling barrier-reefs , a weighty objection , namely that the number of atolls must be increasing infinitely , might even have been raised , if proofs of the occasional destruction and loss of atolls could not have been adduced .
the disseverment of the larger maldiva atolls .
the apparent progressive disseverment in the maldiva archipelago of large atolls into smaller ones , is , in many respects , an important consideration , and requires an explanation .
the graduated series which marks , as i believe , this process , can be observed only in the northern half of the group , where the atolls have exceedingly imperfect margins , consisting of detached <unk> reefs .
the currents of the sea flow across these atolls , as i am informed by captain moresby , with considerable force , and drift the sediment from side to side during the <unk> , transporting much of it seaward ; yet the currents sweep with greater force round their flanks .
it is historically known that these atolls have long existed in their present state ; and we can believe , that even during a very slow subsidence they might thus remain , the central expanse being kept at nearly its original depth by the accumulation of sediment .
but in the action of such nicely balanced forces during a progressive subsidence ( like that , to which by our theory this archipelago has been subjected ) , it would be strange if the currents of the sea should never make a direct passage across some one of the atolls , through the many wide breaches in their margins .
if this were once effected , a deep-water channel would soon be formed by the removal of the finer sediment , and the check to its further accumulation ; and the sides of the channel would be worn into a slope like that on the outer coasts , which are exposed to the same force of the currents .
in fact , a channel precisely like that <unk> one which divides <unk> <unk> ( plate ii. , figure 4 .
) , would almost necessarily be formed .
the scattered reefs situated near the borders of the new <unk> , from being favourably placed for the growth of <name> , would , by their extension , tend to produce fresh margins to the dissevered portions ; such a tendency is very evident ( as may be seen in the large published chart ) in the elongated reefs on the borders of the two channels intersecting <unk> <unk> .
such channels would become deeper with continued subsidence , and probably from the reefs not growing up perpendicularly , somewhat broader .
in this case , and more especially if the channels had been formed originally of considerable breadth , the dissevered portions would become perfect and distinct atolls , like <unk> and <name> atolls ( plate ii. , figure 6 ) , or like the two <unk> atolls , which must be considered as distinct , although related in form and position , and separated from each other by channels , which though deep have been sounded .
further subsidence would render such channels unfathomable , and the dissevered portions would then resemble <unk> and <unk> atolls , or <unk> <unk> and horsburgh atolls ( plate ii. , figure 4 ) , which are related to each other in no respect except in proximity and position .
hence , on the theory of subsidence , the disseverment of large atolls , which have imperfect margins ( for otherwise their disseverment would be scarcely possible ) , and which are exposed to strong currents , is far from being an improbable event ; and the several stages , from close relation to entire isolation in the atolls of the maldiva archipelago , are readily explicable .
we might go even further , and assert as not improbable , that the first formation of the maldiva archipelago was due to a barrier-reef , of nearly the same dimensions with that of new caledonia ( plate ii. , figure 5 ) , for if , in imagination , we complete the subsidence of that great island , we might anticipate from the present broken condition of the northern portion of the reef , and from the almost entire absence of reefs on the eastern coast , that the barrier-reef after repeated <unk> , would become during its upward growth separated into distinct portions ; and these portions would tend to assume an <unk> structure , from the <name> growing with vigour round their entire <unk> , when freely exposed to an open sea .
as we have some large islands partly submerged with barrier-reefs marking their former limits , such as new caledonia , so our theory makes it probable that there should be other large islands wholly submerged ; and these , we may now infer , would be surmounted , not by one enormous atoll , but by several large elongated ones , like the atolls in the maldiva group ; and these again , during long periods of subsidence , would sometimes become dissevered into smaller atolls .
i may add , that both in the <name> and <name> archipelagoes , there are atolls standing close together , which have an evident relationship in form : we may suppose , in such cases , either that two or more encircled islands originally stood close together , and afforded bases for two or more atolls , or that one atoll has been dissevered .
from the position , as well as form , of three atolls in the <name> archipelago ( the <unk> and <unk> group ) , which are placed in an irregular circle , i am strongly tempted to believe that they have originated by the process of disseverment .
( the same remark is , perhaps , applicable to the islands of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in the <name> archipelago , of which charts are given in the atlas of <unk> voyage : a line drawn through the linear reefs and lagoons of these three islands forms a semicircle .
consult also , the atlas of lutke 's voyage ; and for the <name> group that of kotzebue ; for the <name> group consult the atlas of <unk> 's voyage .
most of the points here referred to may , however , be seen in krusenstern 's general atlas of the pacific . )
irregularly formed atolls .
in the <name> group , <unk> atoll consists of two loops united in one point ; and <unk> atoll is formed of three loops , two of which ( as may be seen in figure 3 , plate ii . )
are connected by a mere <unk> reef , and the three together are sixty miles in length .
in the <name> group some of the atolls have narrow strips of reef , like spurs , projecting from them .
there occur also in parts of the open sea , a few linear and straight reefs , standing by themselves ; and likewise some few reefs in the form of <unk> , with their extremities more or less curled inwards .
now , the upward growth of a barrier-reef which fronted only one side of an island , or one side of an elongated island with its extremities ( of which cases exist ) , would produce after the complete subsidence of the land , mere strips or crescent or <unk> reefs : if the island thus partially fronted became divided during subsidence into two or more islands , these islands would be united together by linear reefs ; and from the further growth of the <name> along their shores together with subsidence , reefs of various forms might ultimately be produced , either atolls united together by linear reefs , or atolls with spurs projecting from them .
some , however , of the more simple forms above specified , might , as we have seen , be equally well produced by the <name> perishing during subsidence on part of the circumference of an atoll , whilst on the other parts it continued to grow up till it reached the surface .
the great chagos bank .
i have already shown that the submerged condition of the great chagos bank ( plate ii. , figure 1 , with its section figure 2 ) , and of some other banks in the chagos group , may in all probability be attributed to the <name> having perished before or during the movements of subsidence , to which this whole area by our theory has been subjected .
the external rim or upper ledge ( shaded in the chart ) , consists of dead coral-rock thinly covered with sand ; it lies at an average depth of between five and eight fathoms , and perfectly resembles in form the annular reef of an atoll .
the banks of the second level , the boundaries of which are marked by dotted lines in the chart , lie from about fifteen to twenty fathoms beneath the surface ; they are several miles broad , and terminate in a very steep slope round the central expanse .
this central expanse i have already described , as consisting of a level muddy flat between thirty and forty fathoms deep .
the banks of the second level , might at first sight be thought analogous to the internal <unk> ledge of coral-rock which borders the lagoons of some atolls , but their much greater width , and their being formed of sand , are points of essential difference .
on the eastern side of the atoll some of the banks are linear and parallel , resembling islets in a great river , and pointed directly towards a great breach on the opposite side of the atoll ; these are best seen in the large published chart .
i inferred from this circumstance , that strong currents sometimes set directly across this vast bank ; and i have since heard from captain moresby that this is the case .
i observed , also , that the channels or breaches through the rim , were all of the same depth as the central <unk> space into which they lead ; whereas the channels into the other atolls of the chagos group , and as i believe into most other large atolls , are not nearly as deep as their lagoons : for instance at peros banhos , the channels are only of the same depth , namely between ten and twenty fathoms , as the bottom of the lagoon for a space about a mile and a half in width round its shores , whilst the central expanse of the lagoon is from thirty-five to forty fathoms deep .
now , if an atoll during a gradual subsidence once became entirely submerged , like the great chagos bank , and therefore no longer exposed to the surf , very little sediment could be formed from it ; and consequently the channels leading into the lagoon from not being filled up with drifted sand and <name> detritus , would continue increasing in depth , as the whole sank down .
in this case , we might expect that the currents of the open sea , instead of any longer sweeping round the submarine flanks , would flow directly through the breaches across the lagoon , removing in their course the finer sediment , and preventing its further accumulation .
we should then have the submerged reef forming an external and upper rim of rock , and beneath this portion of the <name> bottom of the old lagoon , intersected by deep-water channels or breaches , and thus formed into separate marginal banks ; and these would be cut off by steep slopes , overhanging the central space , worn down by the passage of the oceanic currents .
by these means , i have scarcely any doubt that the great chagos bank has originated ,  a structure which at first appeared to me far more anomalous than any i had met with .
the process of formation is nearly the same with that , by which <unk> <unk> had been <unk> ; but in the chagos bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at several different quarters , have united in a central space .
this great atoll-formed bank appears to be in an early stage of disseverment ; should the work of subsidence go on , from the submerged and dead condition of the whole reef , and the imperfection of the south-east quarter a mere wreck would probably be left .
the pitt 's bank , situated not far southward , appears to be precisely in this state ; it consists of a moderately level , oblong bank of sand , lying from 10 to 20 fathoms beneath the surface , with two sides protected by a narrow ledge of rock which is submerged between 5 and 8 fathoms .
a little further south , at about the same distance as the southern rim of the great chagos bank is from the northern rim , there are two other small banks with from 10 to 20 fathoms on them ; and not far eastward soundings were struck on a <name> bottom , with between 110 and 145 fathoms .
the northern portion with its <unk> margin , closely resembles any one segment of the great chagos bank , between two of the deep-water channels , and the scattered banks , southward appear to be the last wrecks of less perfect portions .
i have examined with care the charts of the indian and pacific oceans , and have now brought before the reader all the examples , which i have met with , of reefs differing from the type of the class to which they belong ; and i think it has been satisfactorily shown , that they are all included in our theory , modified by occasional accidents which might have been anticipated as probable .
in this course we have seen , that in the lapse of ages encircling barrier-reefs are occasionally converted into atolls , the name of atoll being properly applicable , at the moment when the last pinnacle of encircled land sinks beneath the surface of the sea .
we have , also , seen that large atolls during the progressive subsidence of the areas in which they stand , sometimes become dissevered into smaller ones ; at other times , the reef-building polypifers having entirely perished , atolls are converted into atoll-formed banks of dead rock ; and these again through further subsidence and the accumulation of sediment modified by the force of the oceanic currents , pass into level banks with scarcely any distinguishing character .
thus may the history of an atoll be followed from its first origin , through the occasional accidents of its existence , to its destruction and final obliteration .
objections to the theory of the formation of atolls and barrier-reefs .
the vast amount of subsidence , both horizontally or in area , and vertically or in depth , necessary to have submerged every mountain , even the highest , throughout the immense spaces of ocean interspersed with atolls , <name> probably strike most people as a formidable objection to my theory .
but as continents , as large as the spaces supposed to have subsided , have been raised above the level of the sea ,  as whole regions are now rising , for instance , in scandinavia and south <name> ,  and as no reason can be assigned , why <unk> should not have occurred in some parts of the earth 's crust on as great a scale both in extent and amount as those of elevation , objections of this nature strike me as of little force .
the remarkable point is that movements to such an extent should have taken place within a period , during which the polypifers have continued adding matter on and above the same reefs .
another and less obvious objection to the theory <name> perhaps be advanced from the circumstance , of the lagoons within atolls and within barrier-reefs never having become in any one instance during prolonged <unk> of a greater depth than sixty fathoms , and seldom more than forty fathoms ; but we already admit , if the theory be worth considering , that the rate of subsidence has not exceeded that of the upward growth of the <name> on the exterior margin ; we are , therefore , only further required to admit , that the subsidence has not exceeded in rate the filling up of the interior spaces by the growth of the corals living there , and by the accumulation of sediment .
as this filling up must take place very slowly within barrier-reefs lying far from the land , and within atolls which are of large dimensions and which have open lagoons with very few reefs , we are led to conclude that the subsidence thus <unk> , must have been slow in an extraordinary degree ; a conclusion which accords with our only means , namely , with what is known of the rate and manner of recent elevatory movements , of judging by analogy what is the probable rate of subsidence .
in this chapter it has , i think , been shown , that the theory of subsidence , which we were compelled to receive from the necessity of giving to the corals , in certain large areas , foundations at the requisite depth , explains both the normal structure and the less regular forms of those two great classes of reefs , which have justly excited the astonishment of all persons who have sailed through the pacific and indian oceans .
but further to test the truth of the theory , a crowd of questions <name> occur to the reader : do the different kinds of reefs , which have been produced by the same kind of movement , generally lie within the same areas ?
what is their relation of form and position ,  for instance , do adjoining groups of atolls , and the separate atolls in these groups , bear the same relation to each other which islands do in common archipelagoes ?
have we reason to believe , that where there are fringing-reefs , there has not lately been subsidence ; or , for it is almost our only way of ascertaining this point , are there frequently proofs of recent elevation ?
can we by this means account for the presence of certain classes of reefs in some large areas , and their entire absence in others ?
do the areas which have subsided , as indicated by the presence of atolls and barrier-reefs , and the areas which have remained stationary or have been upraised , as shown by fringing-reefs , bear any determinate relation to each other ; and are the dimensions of these areas such as <unk> with the greatness of the subterranean changes , which , it must be supposed , have lately taken place beneath them ?
is there any connection between the movements thus indicated , and recent volcanic action ?
all these questions ought to receive answers in accordance with the theory ; and if this can be satisfactorily shown , not only is the theory confirmed , but as deductions , the answers are in themselves important .
under this latter point of view , these questions <name> be chiefly considered in the following chapter .
( i may take this opportunity of briefly considering the appearances , which would probably be presented by a vertical and deep section across a <name> formation ( referring chiefly to an atoll ) , formed by the upward growth of <name> during successive <unk> .
this is a subject worthy of attention , as a means of comparison with ancient <unk> .
the circumferential parts would consist of massive species , in a vertical position , with their interstices filled up with detritus ; but this would be the part most subject to subsequent denudation and removal .
it is useless to speculate how large a portion of the exterior annular reef would consist of upright <name> , and how much of fragmentary rock , for this would depend on many contingencies ,  such as on the rate of subsidence , occasionally allowing a fresh growth of <name> to cover the whole surface , and on the breakers having force sufficient to throw fragments over this same space .
the conglomerate which <unk> the base of the islets , would ( if not removed by denudation together with the exterior reef on which it rests ) be conspicuous from the size of the fragments ,  the different degrees in which they have been rounded ,  the presence of fragments of conglomerate torn up , rounded , and <unk> ,  and from the oblique stratification .
the corals which lived in the <unk> at each successive level , would be preserved upright , and they would consist of many kinds , generally much branched .
in this part , however , a very large proportion of the rock ( and in some cases nearly all of it ) would be formed of sedimentary matter , either in an excessively fine , or in a moderately coarse state , and with the particles almost blended together .
the conglomerate which was formed of rounded pieces of the branched corals , on the shores of the lagoon , would differ from that formed on the islets and derived from the outer coast ; yet both might have accumulated very near each other .
i have seen a conglomerate limestone from devonshire like a conglomerate now forming on the shores of the maldiva atolls .
the stratification taken as a whole , would be horizontal ; but the conglomerate beds resting on the exterior reef , and the beds of sandstone on the shores of the lagoon ( and no doubt on the external flanks ) would probably be divided ( as at keeling atoll and at mauritius ) by numerous layers dipping at considerable angles in different directions .
the calcareous sandstone and coral-rock would almost necessarily contain innumerable shells , <unk> , and the bones of fish , turtle , and perhaps of birds ; possibly , also , the bones of small <unk> , as these animals find their way to the islands far remote from any continent .
the large shells of some species of <unk> would be found vertically imbedded in the solid rock , in the position in which they lived .
we might expect also to find a mixture of the remains of pelagic and littoral animals in the strata formed in the lagoon , for pumice and the seeds of plants are floated from distant countries into the lagoons of many atolls : on the outer coast of keeling atoll , near the mouth of the lagoon , the case of a pelagic <unk> animal was brought up on the arming of the sounding lead .
all the loose blocks of <name> on keeling atoll were burrowed by vermiform animals ; and as every cavity , no doubt , ultimately becomes filled with <unk> limestone , slabs of the rock taken from a considerable depth , would , if polished , probably exhibit the excavations of such burrowing animals .
the conglomerate and fine-grained beds of coral-rock would be hard , sonorous , white and composed of nearly pure calcareous matter ; in some few parts , judging from the specimens at keeling atoll , they would probably contain a small quantity of iron .
floating pumice and scoriae , and occasionally stones transported in the root of trees ( see my " journal of researches , " <name> <unk> ) appear the only sources , through which foreign matter is brought to <unk> standing in the open ocean .
the area over which sediment is transported from coral-reefs must be considerable : captain moresby informs me that during the change of <unk> the sea is discoloured to a considerable distance off the maldiva and chagos atolls .
the sediment of fringing and barrier coral-reefs must be mingled with the mud , which is brought down from the land , and is transported seaward through the breaches , which occur in front of almost every valley .
if the atolls of the larger archipelagoes were upraised , the bed of the ocean being converted into land , they would form flat-topped mountains , varying in diameter from a few miles ( the smallest atolls being worn away ) to sixty miles ; and from being horizontally stratified and of similar composition , they would , as mr. lyell has remarked , falsely appear as if they had originally been united into one vast continuous mass .
such great strata of coral-rock would rarely be associated with erupted volcanic matter , for this could only take place , as may be inferred from what follows in the next chapter , when the area , in which they were situated , commenced to rise , or at least ceased to subside .
during the enormous period necessary to effect an elevation of the kind just alluded to , the surface would necessarily be denuded to a great thickness ; hence it is highly improbable that any <unk> , or even any barrier-reef , at least of those encircling small islands , would be preserved .
from this same cause , the strata which were formed within the lagoons of atolls and <unk> of barrier-reefs , and which must consist in a large part of sedimentary matter , would more often be preserved to future ages , than the exterior solid reef , composed of massive corals in an upright position ; although it is on this exterior part that the present existence and further growth of atolls and barrier-reefs entirely depend .

it <name> be convenient to give here a short account of the appended map ( plate iii . )
[ inasmuch as the coloured map would have proved too costly to be given in this series , the indications of colour have been replaced by <name> referring to the dotted groups of reefs , etc .
the <unk> original wording , however , is retained in full , as it <name> be easy to refer to the map by the <name> , and thus the flow of the narrative is undisturbed .
] : a fuller one , with the data for colouring each spot , is reserved for the appendix ; and every place there referred to may be found in the index .
a larger chart would have been desirable ; but , small as the <unk> one is , it is the result of many months ' labour .
i have consulted , as far as i was able , every original voyage and map ; and the colours were first laid down on charts on a larger scale .
the same blue colour , with merely a difference in the depth of tint , is used for atolls or lagoon-islands , and barrier-reefs , for we have seen , that as far as the actual coral-formation is concerned , they have no distinguishing character .
fringing-reefs have been coloured red , for between them on the one hand , and barrier-reefs and atolls on the other , there is an important distinction with respect to the depth beneath the surface , at which we are compelled to believe their foundations lie .
the two distinct colours , therefore , <name> two great types of structure .
the dark blue colour [ represented by ( 3 ) in our plate ] represents atolls and submerged annular reefs , with deep water in their centres .
i have coloured as atolls , a few low and small coral-islands , without lagoons ; but this has been done only when it clearly appeared that they originally contained lagoons , since filled up with sediment : when there were not good grounds for this belief , they have been left uncoloured .
the pale blue colour [ represented by ( 2 ) ] represents barrier-reefs .
the most obvious character of reefs of this class is the broad and deep-water moat within the reef : but this , like the lagoons of small atolls , is liable to become filled up with detritus and with reefs of delicately branched corals : when , therefore , a reef round the entire circumference of an island extends very far into a profoundly deep sea , so that it can hardly be confounded with a <unk> which must rest on a foundation of rock within a small depth , it has been coloured pale blue , although it does not include a deep-water moat : but this has only been done rarely , and each case is distinctly mentioned in the appendix .
the red colour ( 4 ) represents reefs fringing the land quite closely where the sea is deep , and where the bottom is gently inclined extending to a moderate distance from it , but not having a deep-water moat or <unk> space parallel to the shore .
it must be remembered that fringing-reefs are frequently breached in front of rivers and valleys by <unk> channels , where mud has been deposited .
a space of thirty miles in width has been coloured round or in front of the reefs of each class , in order that the colours might be conspicuous on the appended map , which is reduced to so small a scale .
the vermillion spots , and streaks ( 1 ) represent volcanoes now in action , or historically known to have been so .
they are chiefly laid down from <name> buch 's work on the canary islands ; and my reasons for making a few alterations are given in the note below .
( i have also made considerable use of the geological part of <unk> " physical atlas . "
beginning at the eastern side of the pacific , i have added to the number of the volcanoes in the southern part of the cordillera , and have coloured <name> fernandez according to observations collected during the voyage of the " beagle " ( " geological transactions , " volume v. , <name> <unk> . )
i have added a volcano to albemarle island , one of the galapagos archipelago ( the author 's " journal of researches , " <name> 457 ) .
in the sandwich group there are no active volcanoes , except at hawaii ; but the rev .
w. <name> informs me , there are streams of lava apparently modern on <unk> , having a very recent appearance , which can be traced to the craters whence they flowed .
the same gentleman informs me , that there is no reason to believe that any active volcano exists in the society archipelago ; nor are there any known in the samoa or navigator group , although some of the streams of lava and craters there appear recent .
in the friendly group , the rev .
j. <name> says ( " narrative of missionary enterprise , " <name> 29 ) that <unk> and <unk> islands are active volcanoes .
i infer from hamilton 's " voyage in the <unk> ' " ( <name> 95 ) , that <unk> island is synonymous with <unk> , but i have not ventured to colour it .
there can be no doubt respecting <unk> , and captain edwards ( <name> buch , <name> 386 ) found the lava of recent eruption at <unk> still smoking .
<unk> marks four active volcanoes actually within the friendly group ; but i do not know on what authority : i may mention that <unk> describes <unk> as having a <unk> appearance : i have marked only <unk> and <unk> .
south of the new hebrides lies matthews rock , which is drawn and described as an active crater in the " voyage of the 'astrolabe ' . "
between it and the volcano on the eastern side of new zealand , lies brimstone island , which from the high temperature of the water in the crater , may be ranked as active ( <unk> " <unk> , " ii lief .
s. 56 ) .
<unk> <unk> , volume <unk> , <name> 231 , says that there is a volcano near port st. <name> in new caledonia .
i believe this to be an error , arising from a smoke seen on the opposite coast by cook ( " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 23 ) which smoke went out at night .
the <name> islands , especially the northern ones , contain many craters ( see freycinet 's " hydrog .
<unk> . " )
which are not active .
<name> buch , however , states ( <name> 462 ) on the authority of la <unk> , that there are no less than seven volcanoes between these islands and japan .
<unk> <unk> ( churchill 's " collect . "
volume iv. , <name> <unk> ) , says there are two active volcanoes in latitude 23 deg 30 ' , and in latitude 24 deg : but i have not coloured them .
from the statements in <unk> " voyage " ( <name> 518 , 4to edition ) i have coloured one in the northern part of the <unk> group .
m. s. <unk> has clearly made out from chinese manuscripts not very ancient ( " <unk> rendus , " 1840 , <name> <unk> ) , that there are two active volcanoes on the eastern side of <unk> .
in <unk> straits , on cap island ( 9 deg 48 ' s. , 142 deg 39 ' e. ) a volcano was seen burning with great violence in 1793 by captain <unk> ( see introduction to flinders ' " voyage , " <name> 41 ) .
mr. <unk> ( report of committee for investigating coal in <name> , <name> 39 ) has shown that the volcanic band passing through barren island must be extended northwards .
it appears by an old chart , that <unk> was once an active volcano ( see also " <unk> north american journal " , volume <unk> , <name> 385 ) .
in <unk> " physical atlas , " 1840 , no .
7 of geological part , a volcano on the coast of <unk> is said to have burst forth in <unk> .
<unk> ( " hist .
nat .
des <unk> , " <name> 218 ) says that there is one at the mouth of the persian gulf , but i have not coloured it , as he gives no particulars .
a volcano in amsterdam , or st. <name> 's , in the southern part of the indian ocean , has been seen ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1838 , <name> <unk> ) in action .
dr. j. <name> , of <unk> , informs me in a letter , that when he was at <name> , he saw at night flames apparently volcanic , issuing from the chief <unk> island , and that the arabs assured him that they were volcanic , adding that the volcano burned more during the wet season .
i have marked this as a volcano , though with some hesitation , on account of the possibility of the flame arising from gaseous sources . )
the uncoloured coasts consist , first and chiefly , of those , where there are no coral-reefs , or such small portions as to be quite insignificant .
secondly , of those coasts where there are reefs , but where the sea is very shallow , for in this case the reefs generally lie far from the land , and become very irregular , in their forms : where they have not become irregular , they have been coloured .
thirdly , if i had the means of ascertaining the fact , i should not colour a reef merely coating the edges of a submarine crater , or of a level submerged bank ; for such superficial formations differ essentially , even when not in external appearance , from reefs whose foundations as well as <unk> have been wholly formed by the growth of <name> .
fourthly , in the red sea , and within some parts of the east indian archipelago ( if the imperfect charts of the latter can be trusted ) , there are many scattered reefs , of small size , represented in the chart by mere dots , which rise out of deep water : these can not be arranged under either of the three classes : in the red sea , however , some of these little reefs , from their position , seem once to have formed parts of a continuous barrier .
there exist , also , scattered in the open ocean , some linear and irregularly formed strips of coral-reef , which , as shown in the last chapter , are probably allied in their origin to atolls ; but as they do not belong to that class , they have not been coloured ; they are very few in number and of insignificant dimensions .
lastly , some reefs are left uncoloured from the want of information respecting them , and some because they are of an intermediate structure between the barrier and fringing classes .
the value of the map is lessened , in proportion to the number of reefs which i have been obliged to leave uncoloured , although , in a theoretical point of view , few of them present any great difficulty : but their number is not very great , as <name> be found by comparing the map with the statements in the appendix .
i have experienced more difficulty in colouring fringing-reefs than in colouring barrier-reefs , as the former , from their much less dimensions , have less attracted the attention of navigators .
as i have had to seek my information from all kinds of sources , and often from indirect ones , i do not venture to <name> that the map is free from many errors .
nevertheless , i trust it <name> give an approximately correct view of the general distribution of the coral-reefs over the whole world ( with the exception of some fringing-reefs on the coast of brazil , not included within the limits of the map ) , and of their arrangement into the three great classes , which , though necessarily very imperfect from the nature of the objects classified , have been adopted by most voyagers .
i may further remark , that the dark blue colour represents land entirely composed of coral-rock ; the pale blue , land with a wide and thick border of coral-rock ; and the red , a mere narrow fringe of coral-rock .
looking now at the map under the theoretical point of view indicated in the last chapter , the two blue tints signify that the foundations of the reefs thus coloured have subsided to a considerable amount , at a slower rate than that of the upward growth of the corals , and that probably in many cases they are still subsiding .
the red signifies that the shores which support fringing-reefs have not subsided ( at least to any considerable amount , for the effects of a subsidence on a small scale would in no case be distinguishable ) ; but that they have remained nearly stationary since the period when they first became fringed by reefs ; or that they are now rising or have been upraised , with new lines of reefs successively formed on them : these latter <unk> are obviously implied , as newly formed lines of shore , after elevations of the land , would be in the same state with respect to the growth of fringing-reefs , as stationary coasts .
if during the prolonged subsidence of a shore , coral-reefs grew for the first time on it , or if an old barrier-reef were destroyed and submerged , and new reefs became attached to the land , these would necessarily at first belong to the fringing class , and , therefore , be coloured red , although the coast was sinking : but i have no reason to believe , that from this source of error , any coast has been coloured wrongly with respect to movement indicated .
well characterised atolls and encircling barrier-reefs , where several occur in a group , or a single barrier-reef if of large dimensions , leave scarcely any doubt on the mind respecting the movement by which they have been produced ; and even a small amount of subsequent elevation is soon betrayed .
the evidence from a single atoll or a single encircling barrier-reef , must be received with some caution , for the former may possibly be based upon a submerged crater or bank , and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment , or of <unk> rock .
from these remarks we may with greater certainty infer that the spaces , especially the larger ones , tinted blue in the map , have subsided , than that the red spaces have remained stationary , or have been upraised .
on the grouping of the different classes of reefs .
having made these preliminary remarks , i <name> consider first how far the grouping of the different kinds of coral-islands and reefs is <unk> of the truth of the theory .
a glance at the map shows that the reefs , coloured blue and red , produced under widely different conditions , are not indiscriminately mixed together .
atolls and barrier-reefs , on the other hand , as may be seen by the two blue tints , generally lie near each other ; and this would be the natural result of both having been produced during the subsidence of the areas in which they stand .
thus , the largest group of encircled islands is that of the society archipelago ; and these islands are surrounded by atolls , and only separated by a narrow space from the large group of low atolls .
in the midst of the <name> atolls , there are three fine encircled islands .
the northern point of the barrier-reef of new caledonia seems itself , as before remarked , to form a complete large atoll .
the great australian barrier is described as including both atolls and small encircled islands .
captain king ( sailing directions , appended to volume ii .
of his " surveying voyage to australia . " )
mentions many atoll-formed and encircling coral-reefs , some of which lie within the barrier , and others may be said ( for instance between latitude 16 deg and 13 deg ) to form part of it .
flinders ( " voyage to <name> australis , " volume ii .
<name> 336 . )
has described an atoll-formed reef in latitude 10 deg , seven miles long and from one to three broad , resembling a boot in shape , with apparently very deep water within .
eight miles westward of this , and forming part of the barrier , lie the <name> islands , which are high and are encircled .
in the <unk> sea , between the two great barriers of australia and new caledonia , there are many low islets and coral-reefs , some of which are annular , or horse-shoe shaped .
observing the smallness of the scale of the map , the parallels of latitude being nine hundred miles apart , we see that none of the large groups of reefs and islands supposed to have been produced by long-continued subsidence , lie near extensive lines of coast coloured red , which are supposed to have remained stationary since the growth of their reefs , or to have been upraised and new lines of reefs formed on them .
where the red and blue circles do occur near each other , i am able , in several instances , to show that there have been oscillations of level , subsidence having preceded the elevation of the red spots ; and elevation having preceded the subsidence of the blue spots : and in this case the <unk> of reefs belonging to the two great types of structure is little surprising .
we may , therefore , conclude that the proximity in the same areas of the two classes of reefs , which owe their origin to the subsidence of the earth 's crust , and their separation from those formed during its stationary or uprising condition , holds good to the full extent , which might have been anticipated by our theory .
as groups of atolls have originated in the upward growth , at each fresh sinking of the land , of those reefs which primarily fringed the shores of one great island , or of several smaller ones ; so we might expect that these rings of coral-rock , like so many rude outline charts , <name> still retain some traces of the general form , or at least general range , of the land , round which they were first modelled .
that this is the case with the atolls in the southern pacific as far as their range is concerned , seems highly probable , when we observe that the three principal groups are directed in north-west and south-east lines , and that nearly all the land in the s. pacific ranges in this same direction ; namely , n. western australia , new caledonia , the northern half of new zealand , the new hebrides , <unk> , navigator , society , <unk> , and <unk> archipelagoes : in the northern pacific , the <name> atolls <unk> against the north-west line of the <name> atolls , much in the same manner as the east and west line of islands from <unk> to new britain do on new ireland : in the indian ocean the <unk> and maldiva atolls extend nearly parallel to the western and mountainous coast of <name> .
in most respects , there is a perfect resemblance with ordinary islands in the grouping of atolls and in their form : thus the outline of all the larger groups is elongated ; and the greater number of the individual atolls are elongated in the same direction with the group , in which they stand .
the chagos group is less elongated than is usual with other groups , and the individual atolls in it are likewise but little elongated ; this is strikingly seen by comparing them with the neighbouring maldiva atolls .
in the <name> and maldiva archipelagoes , the atolls are ranged in two parallel lines , like the mountains in a great double <unk> .
some of the atolls , in the larger archipelagoes , stand so near to each other , and have such an evident relationship in form , that they compose little sub-groups : in the <name> archipelago , one such sub-group consists of <unk> , a lofty island encircled by a barrier-reef , and separated by a channel only four miles and a half wide from <unk> atoll , with a second atoll a little further off .
in all these respects an examination of a series of charts <name> show how perfectly groups of atolls resemble groups of common islands .
on the direct evidence of the blue spaces in the map having subsided during the upward growth of the reefs so coloured , and of the red spaces having remained stationary , or having been upraised .
with respect to subsidence , i have shown in the last chapter , that we can not expect to obtain in countries inhabited only by semi-civilised races , demonstrative proofs of a movement , which invariably tends to conceal its own evidence .
but on the coral-islands supposed to have been produced by subsidence , we have proofs of changes in their external appearance  of a round of decay and <unk>  of the last vestiges of land on some  of its first commencement on others : we hear of storms desolating them to the astonishment of their inhabitants : we know by the great fissures with which some of them are traversed , and by the earthquakes felt under others , that subterranean disturbances of some kind are in progress .
these facts , if not directly connected with subsidence , as i believe they are , at least show how difficult it would be to discover proofs of such movement by ordinary means .
at keeling atoll , however , i have described some appearances , which seem directly to show that subsidence did take place there during the late earthquakes .
vanikoro , according to <unk> <name> ( see captain <name> 's " voyage in search of la <unk> . "
m. <unk> in his " report on the voyage of the 'astrolabe ' " ( <name> <unk> , volume i .
) , speaking of vanikoro , says the shores are surrounded by reefs of <unk> , " <unk> assure <unk> de formation <unk> <unk> . "
i have in vain endeavoured to learn some further particulars about this remarkable passage .
i may here add , that according to our theory , the island of <unk> ( plate i. , figure 7 ) , in the <name> archipelago , being encircled by a barrier-reef , must have subsided .
in the " new s. wales lit .
<unk> . "
february 1835 ( which i have seen through the favour of dr. <unk> ) , there is an account of this island ( subsequently confirmed by mr. campbell ) , in which it is said , " at the n.e .
end , at a place called <unk> , there are ruins of a town , now only accessible by boats , the waves reaching to the steps of the houses . "
judging from this passage , one would be tempted to conclude that the island must have subsided , since these houses were built .
i may , also , here append a statement in <unk> <unk> ( volume ix. , <name> <unk> , given without any authority ) , that the sea gains in an extraordinary manner on the coast of cochin <name> , which lies in front and near the subsiding coral-reefs in the <name> sea : as the coast is granitic , and not alluvial , it is scarcely possible that the <unk> of the sea can be owing to the washing away of the land ; and if so , it must be due to subsidence .
) , is often violently shaken by earthquakes , and there , the unusual depth of the channel between the shore and the reef ,  the almost entire absence of islets on the reef ,  its <unk> structure on the inner side , and the small quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains , all seem to show that this island has not remained long at its present level , with the lagoon-channel subjected to the accumulation of sediment , and the reef to the wear and tear of the breakers .
at the society archipelago , on the other hand , where a slight tremor is only rarely felt , the <unk> of the <unk> round some of the islands , the number of islets formed on the reefs of others , and the broad belt of low land at the foot of the mountains , indicate that , although there must have been great subsidence to have produced the barrier-reefs , there has since elapsed a long stationary period .
( mr. couthouy states ( " remarks , " <name> 44 ) that at tahiti and <unk> the space between the reef and the shore has been nearly filled up by the extension of those coral-reefs , which within most barrier-reefs merely fringe the land .
from this circumstance , he arrives at the same conclusion as i have done , that the society islands since their subsidence , have remained stationary during a long period ; but he further believes that they have recently commenced rising , as well as the whole area of the low archipelago .
he does not give any detailed proofs regarding the elevation of the society islands , but i shall refer to this subject in another part of this chapter .
before making some further comments , i may observe how satisfactory it is to me , to find mr. couthouy <unk> , that " having personally examined a large number of coral-islands , and also residing eight months among the volcanic class , having shore and partially encircling reefs , i may be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a conviction of the correctness of the theory of mr .
<name> . "
this gentleman believes , that subsequently to the subsidence by which the atolls in the low archipelago were produced , the whole area has been elevated to the amount of a few feet ; this would indeed be a remarkable fact ; but as far as i am able to judge , the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong .
he states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited , the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sea-level , and containing imbedded <unk> and corals standing as they grew ; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts , but below a certain line they continued to flourish .
in the lagoons , also , he frequently met with clusters of <unk> , with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water .
now , these appearances are exactly what i should have expected , without any subsequent elevation having taken place ; and i think mr. couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact , that corals , when constantly bathed by the surf , can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water , as in a lagoon .
as long , therefore , as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll , submerged to a small depth , the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon , into which the waves rolled ; but as soon as the outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height , or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height , the force of the breakers would be checked , and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry , and thus be partially or wholly destroyed .
even in atolls , which have not lately subsided , if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward ( each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at keeling atoll ) , the line where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards , and therefore the corals , which when living near the margin , were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide , would cease being so , and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead .
the case of the <unk> in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed , seems to be an analogous fact , to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of keeling atoll ; a condition of things which i have endeavoured to show , has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs , so that during high winds , the rising of the tide ( as observed by the inhabitants ) is checked , and the corals , which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height , are occasionally exposed , and thus are killed : and this is a condition of things , towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending .
or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms , the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef , and the surface of the lagoon would , like the ocean , never be quite at rest , and therefore the corals in the lagoon , from being constantly <unk> by the rippling water , might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could , when the lagoon became enclosed and protected .
christmas atoll ( 2 deg n. latitude ) which has a very shallow lagoon , and differs in several respects from most atolls , possibly may have been elevated recently ; but its highest part appears ( couthouy , <name> 46 ) to be only ten feet above the sea-level .
the facts of a second class , adduced by mr. couthouy , in support of the alleged recent elevation of the low archipelago , are not all ( especially those referring to a shelf of rock ) quite intelligible to me ; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef , must have been moved into their present position , when the reef was at a lower level ; but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level , has not , i think , been borne in mind .
we should , also , not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and <unk> .
mr. couthouy further argues , that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef , they have been elevated ; he infers this from the greatest amount of <unk> not being near their bases , where they are unceasingly washed by the <unk> of the tides , but at some height on their sides , near the line of high-water <name> , as shown in an accompanying diagram .
my former remark again applies here , with this further observation , that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments , their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises , and therefore i should have expected that the chief line of present <unk> would have <unk> with the line of high-water <name> ; and if the reef had grown outwards , that there would have been lines of <unk> at greater heights .
the conclusion , to which i am finally led by the interesting observations of mr. couthouy is , that the atolls in the low archipelago have , like the society islands , remained at a stationary level for a long period : and this probably is the ordinary course of events , subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest . )
turning now to the red colour ; as on our map , the areas which have sunk slowly downwards to great depths are many and large , we might naturally have been led to conjecture , that with such great changes of level in progress , the coasts which have been fringed probably for ages ( for we have no reason to believe that coral-reefs are of short duration ) , would not have remained all this time stationary , but would frequently have undergone movements of elevation .
this supposition , we shall immediately see , holds good to a remarkable extent ; and although a stationary condition of the land can hardly ever be open to proof , from the evidence being only negative , we are , in some degree , enabled to ascertain the correctness of the parts coloured red on the map , by the direct testimony of upraised organic remains of a modern date .
before going into the details on this head ( printed in small type ) , i may mention , that when reading a memoir on <name> formations by mm .
quoy and gaimard ( " annales des sciences nat . "
<name> .
vi. , <name> 279 , etc . )
i was astonished to find , for i knew that they had crossed both the pacific and indian oceans , that their descriptions were applicable only to reefs of the fringing class ; but my astonishment ended satisfactorily , when i discovered that , by a strange chance , all the islands which these eminent naturalists had visited , though several in number , namely , the mauritius , timor , new guinea , the <name> , and sandwich archipelagoes , could be shown by their own statements to have been elevated within a recent geological <name> .
in the eastern half of the pacific , the sandwich islands are all fringed , and almost every naturalist who has visited them , has remarked on the abundance of elevated corals and shells , apparently identical with living species .
the rev .
w. <name> informs me , that he has noticed round several parts of hawaii , beds of <unk> , about twenty feet above the level of the sea , and where the coast is low they extend far inland .
upraised coral-rock forms a considerable part of the borders of oahu ; and at <name> island ( " zoology of captain beechey 's voyage , " <name> 176 .
see also mm .
quoy and gaimard in " annales de <unk> .
nat . "
<name> .
<name> . )
it <unk> three strata , each about ten feet thick .
<unk> , which forms the northern , as hawaii does the southern end of the group ( 350 miles in length ) , likewise seems to consist of <name> and volcanic rocks .
mr. couthouy ( " remarks on <name> formations , " <name> 51 . )
has lately described with interesting details , several upraised beaches , ancient reefs with their surfaces perfectly preserved , and beds of recent shells and corals , at the islands of <unk> , <unk> , oahu , and <unk> ( or <unk> ) in this group .
mr. pierce , an intelligent resident at oahu , is convinced , from changes which have taken place within his memory , during the last sixteen years , " that the elevation is at present going forward at a very perceptible rate . "
the natives at <unk> state that the land is there gaining rapidly on the sea , and mr. couthouy has no doubt , from the nature of the strata , that this has been effected by an elevation of the land .
in the southern part of the low archipelago , <name> island is described by captain beechey ( beechey 's " voyage in the pacific , " <name> 46 , 4to edition .
) , as being quite flat , and about eighty feet in height ; it is entirely composed of dead corals , forming a honeycombed , but compact rock .
in cases like this , of an island having exactly the appearance , which the elevation of any one of the smaller surrounding atolls with a shallow lagoon would present , one is led to conclude ( with little better reason , however , than the improbability of such small and low fabrics lasting , for an immense period , exposed to the many destroying agents of nature ) , that the elevation has taken place at an epoch not geologically remote .
when merely the surface of an island of ordinary formation is strewed with <name> bodies , and that continuously , or nearly so , from the beach to a certain height , and not above that height , it is exceedingly improbable that such organic remains , although they may not have been specially examined , should belong to any ancient period .
it is necessary to bear these remarks in mind , in considering the evidence of the elevatory movements in the pacific and indian oceans , as it does not often rest on specific <unk> , and therefore should be received with caution .
six of the cook and <unk> islands ( s.w .
of the society group ) , are fringed ; of these , five were described to me by the rev .
j. <name> , as formed of coral-rock , associated with some basalt in <unk> ) , and the sixth as lofty and basaltic .
<unk> is nearly three hundred feet high , with a level summit ; and according to mr. s. <name> ( couthouy 's " remarks , " <name> 34 . )
it is an upraised reef ; " and there are in the central hollow , formerly the bed of the lagoon , many scattered patches of coral-rock , some of them raised to a height of forty feet . "
these knolls of coral-rock were evidently once separate reefs in the lagoon of an atoll .
mr. <unk> , at <name> , informed me that this island is surrounded by a <unk> plain at about the height of a hundred feet , which probably marks a pause in its elevation .
from these facts we may infer , perhaps , that the cook and <unk> islands have been upheaved at a period probably not very remote .
savage island ( s.e .
of the friendly group ) , is about forty feet in height .
forster ( " observations made during voyage round the world , " <name> 147 . )
describes the plants as already growing out of the dead , but still upright and spreading trees of <name> ; and the younger forster ( " voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 163 . )
believes that an ancient lagoon is now represented by a central plain ; here we can not doubt that the elevatory forces have recently acted .
the same conclusion may be extended , though with somewhat less certainty , to the islands of the friendly group , which have been well described in the second and third voyages of cook .
the surface of <unk> is low and level , but with some parts a hundred feet high ; the whole consists of coral-rock , " which yet shows the cavities and irregularities worn into it by the action of the tides . "
( cook 's " third voyage " ( 4to edition ) , volume i. , <name> 314 . )
on <unk> the same appearances were noticed at an elevation of between two hundred and three hundred feet .
<unk> , also , at the opposite or northern end of the group , consists , according to the rev .
j. <name> , of coral-rock .
<unk> , with its northern extensive reefs , resembles either an upraised atoll with one half originally imperfect , or one unequally elevated ; and <unk> , an atoll equally elevated .
this latter island contains ( <unk> , volume i. , <name> 235 . )
in its centre a salt-water lake , about a <unk> in diameter , without any communication with the sea , and around it the land rises gradually like a bank ; the highest part is only between twenty and thirty feet ; but on this part , as well as on the rest of the land ( which , as cook observes , rises above the height of true lagoon-islands ) , coral-rock , like that on the beach , was found .
in the navigator archipelago , mr. couthouy ( " remarks on <unk> , " <name> 50 . )
found on <unk> many and very large fragments of <name> at the height of eighty feet , " on a steep hill-side , rising half a mile inland from a low <name> plain abounding in <name> remains . "
the fragments were embedded in a mixture of decomposed lava and sand .
it is not stated whether they were accompanied by shells , or whether the corals resembled recent species ; as these remains were embedded they possibly may belong to a remote epoch ; but i presume this was not the opinion of mr. couthouy .
earthquakes are very frequent in this archipelago .
still proceeding westward we come to the new hebrides ; on these islands , mr. g. <name> ( author of " wanderings in new south wales " ) , informs me he found much <name> at a great altitude , which he considered of recent origin .
respecting <name> <name> , and the <name> archipelago , i have no information ; but at new ireland , which forms the northern point of the latter chain , both <unk> and lesson have described large beds of an apparently very modern <unk> rock , with the form of the corals little altered .
the latter author ( " voyage de la 'coquille ' , " part .
zoolog . )
states that this formation <unk> a newer line of coast , modelled round an ancient one .
there only remains to be described in the pacific , that curved line of fringed islands , of which the <unk> form the main part .
of these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and some islets farther north , are described by quoy and gaimard ( freycinet 's " voyage <unk> du <unk> . "
see also the " <unk> memoir , " <name> 215 .
) , and chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage .
" ) , as chiefly composed of <unk> limestone , which attains a considerable elevation , and is in several cases worn into successively rising cliffs : the two former naturalists seem to have compared the corals and shells with the existing ones , and state that they are of recent species .
<unk> , which lies in the prolonged line of the <unk> , is the only island in this part of the sea which is fringed ; it is ninety feet high , and consists entirely of <unk> rock .
( lutke 's " voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 304 . )
in the east indian archipelago , many authors have recorded proofs of recent elevation .
m. lesson ( <unk> <unk> , " voyage de la 'coquille ' . " )
states , that near port dory , on the north coast of new guinea , the shores are flanked , to the height of 150 feet , by <unk> strata of modern date .
he mentions similar formations at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and timor : at this latter place , mm .
quoy and gaimard ( " <name> .
des <unk> .
nat . "
<name> .
vi. , <name> 281 . )
have likewise described the primitive rocks , as coated to a considerable height with <name> .
some small islets eastward of timor are said in <unk> 's " voyage , " ( translated by windsor <name> , chapters vi. , vii . )
to resemble small <name> islets upraised some feet above the sea .
dr. <unk> informs me that dr. <unk> found in java an extensive formation , containing an abundance of shells , of which the greater part appear to be of existing species .
dr. <name> ( " geolog .
transact . "
2nd series , volume i. , <name> 403 .
on the peninsula of malacca , in front of <unk> , 5 deg 30 ' n. , dr. <name> collected some shells , which dr. <unk> informs me , although not compared with existing species , had a recent appearance .
dr. <name> describes in this neighbourhood ( " trans .
<unk> .
soc . "
volume <unk> , part ii. , <name> 166 ) a single water-worn rock , with a conglomerate of sea-shells at its base , situated six miles inland , which , according to the traditions of the natives , was once surrounded by the sea .
captain low has also described ( <unk> , part i. , <name> 131 ) mounds of shells lying two miles inland on this line of coast . )
has described some upraised shells and corals , apparently recent , on <unk> <unk> off sumatra ; and <unk> relates in his history of this great island , that the names of many promontories , show that they were originally islands .
on part of the west coast of borneo and at the <unk> islands , the form of the land , the nature of the soil , and the <unk> rocks , present appearances ( " notices of the east indian arch . "
singapore , 1828 , <name> 6 , and <unk> , <name> 43 . )
( although it is doubtful whether such vague evidence is worthy of mention ) , of having recently been covered by the sea ; and the inhabitants of the <unk> islands believe that this has been the case .
mr. cuming , who has lately investigated , with so much success , the natural history of the philippines , found near <unk> , in luzon , about fifty feet above the level of the r. <unk> , and seventy miles from its mouth , a large bed of fossil shells : these , he informs me , are of the same species with those now existing on the shores of the neighbouring islands .
from the accounts given us by captain <name> hall and captain beechey ( captain b .
hall , " voyage to loo <unk> , " <unk> , pages xxi .
and xxv .
captain <unk> " voyage , " <name> <unk> . )
of the lines of inland reefs , and walls of coral-rock worn into caves , above the present reach of the waves , at the loo <unk> islands , there can be little doubt that they have been upraised at no very remote period .
dr. davy describes the northern province of ceylon ( " travels in ceylon , " <name> 13 .
this <unk> formation is mentioned by m. <unk> in his report to the institute ( may 4th , 1839 ) , on the voyage of the " <unk> " , as one of immense extent , and belonging to the latest tertiary period . )
as being very low , and consisting of a limestone with shells and corals of very recent origin ; he adds , that it does not admit of a doubt that the sea has retired from this district even within the memory of man .
there is also some reason for believing that the western shores of <name> , north of ceylon , have been upraised within the recent period .
( dr. <unk> , in his " journey through the n. <unk> " ( the " madras lit .
and <unk> .
<unk> . "
volume v. ) has described a formation with recent fresh-water and <name> shells , occurring at the distance of three or four miles from the present shore .
dr. <unk> , in conversation with me , attributed their position to a rise of the land .
dr. <unk> , however ( and there can not be a higher authority on the geology of <name> ) informs me that he suspects that these beds may have been formed by the mere action of the waves and currents accumulating sediment .
from analogy i should much incline to dr. <unk> opinion . )
mauritius has certainly been upraised within the recent period , as i have stated in the chapter on fringing-reefs .
the northern extremity of madagascar is described by captain <name> ( <name> 's " africa , " volume ii. , <name> 37 , for madagascar ; and for s. africa , volume i. , pages 412 and 426 .
lieutenant <unk> 's narrative contains fuller particulars regarding the coral-rock , volume i. , <name> 174 , and volume ii. , pages 41 and 54 .
see also <unk> 's " voyage round the world , " volume i. , <name> 60 . )
as formed of <unk> rock , as likewise are the shores and outlying islands along an immense space of eastern africa , from a little north of the equator for nine hundred miles southward .
nothing can be more vague than the expression " <unk> rock ; " but at the same time it is , i think , scarcely possible to look at the chart of the linear islets , which rise to a greater height than can be accounted for by the growth of <name> , in front of the coast , from the equator to 2 deg s. , without feeling convinced that a line of fringing-reefs has been elevated at a period so recent , that no great changes have since taken place on the surface of this part of the globe .
some , also , of the higher islands of <unk> rock on this coast , for instance <unk> , have very singular forms , which seem to show the combined effect of the growth of <name> round submerged banks , and their subsequent upheaval .
dr. <name> informs me that he never observed any elevated organic remains on the <unk> , which come under our fringed class .
the nature of the formations round the shores of the red sea , as described by several authors , shows that the whole of this large area has been elevated within a very recent tertiary epoch .
a part of this space in the appended map , is coloured blue , indicating the presence of barrier-reefs : on which circumstance i shall presently make some remarks .
<unk> ( <unk> , " reise in <unk> , " band i. , s .

states that the tertiary formation , of which he has examined the organic remains , forms a fringe along the shores with a uniform height of from thirty and forty feet from the mouth of the gulf of suez to about latitude 26 deg ; but that south of 26 deg , the beds attain only the height of from twelve to fifteen feet .
this , however , can hardly be quite accurate ; although possibly there may be a decrease in the elevation of the shores in the middle parts of the red sea , for dr. <unk> ( as he informs me ) collected from the cliffs of <unk> island ( latitude 15 deg 30 ' s. ) shells and corals , apparently recent , at a height between thirty and forty feet ; and mr. salt ( " travels in abyssinia " ) describes a similar formation a little southward on the opposite shore at <unk> .
moreover , near the mouth of the gulf of suez , although on the coast opposite to that on which dr. <unk> says that the modern beds attain a height of only thirty to forty feet , mr. <name> ( lyell 's " principles of geology , " 5th edition , volume iv. , <name> 25 . )
found a deposit replete with existing species of shells , at the height of 200 feet .
in an admirable series of drawings by captain moresby , i could see how continuously the <unk> low plains of this formation extended with a nearly equable height , both on the eastern and western shores .
the southern coast of arabia seems to have been subjected to the same elevatory movement , for dr. <unk> found at <unk> low cliffs containing shells and corals , apparently of recent species .
the persian gulf abounds with coral-reefs ; but as it is difficult to distinguish them from <unk> in this shallow sea , i have coloured only some near the mouth ; towards the head of the gulf mr. ainsworth ( ainsworth 's " <unk> and babylon , " <name> 217 . )
says that the land is worn into terraces , and that the beds contain organic remains of existing forms .
the west indian archipelago of " fringed " islands , alone remains to be mentioned ; evidence of an elevation within a late tertiary epoch of nearly the whole of this great area , may be found in the works of almost all the naturalists who have visited it .

it is very remarkable on reviewing these details , to observe in how many instances fringing-reefs round the shores , have <unk> with the existence on the land of upraised organic remains , which seem , from evidence more or less satisfactory , to belong to a late tertiary period .
it may , however , be objected , that similar proofs of elevation , perhaps , occur on the coasts coloured blue in our map : but this certainly is not the case with the few following and doubtful exceptions .
the entire area of the red sea appears to have been upraised within a modern period ; nevertheless i have been compelled ( though on unsatisfactory evidence , as given in the appendix ) to class the reefs in the middle part , as barrier-reefs ; should , however , the statements prove accurate to the less height of the tertiary bed in this middle part , compared with the northern and southern districts , we might well suspect that it had subsided subsequently to the general elevation by which the whole area has been upraised .
several authors ( <name> , in his " polynesian researches , " was the first to call attention to these remains ( volume i. , <name> 38 ) , and the tradition of the natives concerning them .

there is a passage in <name> <unk> , " <unk> .
<unk> . "
volume x. , <name> 266 , <unk> an uprising at tahiti , from a footpath now used , which was formerly impassable ; but i particularly inquired from several native chiefs , whether they knew of any change of this kind , and they were unanimous in giving me an answer in the negative . )
have stated that they have observed shells and corals high up on the mountains of the society islands ,  a group encircled by barrier-reefs , and , therefore , supposed to have subsided : at tahiti mr. stutchbury found on the apex of one of the highest mountains , between 5,000 and <unk> feet above the level of the sea , " a distinct and regular stratum of <unk> <name> . "
at tahiti , however , other naturalists , as well as myself , have searched in vain at a low level near the coast , for upraised shells or masses of coral-reef , where if present they could hardly have been overlooked .
from this fact , i concluded that probably the organic remains strewed high up on the surface of the land , had originally been embedded in the volcanic strata , and had subsequently been washed out by the rain .
i have since heard from the rev .
w. <name> , that the remains which he met with , were ( as he believes ) interstratified with an argillaceous tuff ; this likewise was the case with the shells observed by the rev .
d. <unk> at <unk> .
these remains have not been specifically examined ; they may , therefore , and especially the stratum observed by mr. stutchbury at an immense height , be contemporaneous with the first formation of the society islands , and be of any degree of antiquity ; or they may have been deposited at some subsequent , but probably not very recent , period of elevation ; for if the period had been recent , the entire surface of the coast land of these islands , where the reefs are so extensive , would have been coated with upraised <name> , which certainly is not the case .
two of the <name> , or cook islands , namely , <unk> and <unk> , are encircled by reefs , which extend so far from the land , that i have coloured them blue , although with much hesitation , as the space within the reef is shallow , and the outline of the land is not abrupt .
these two islands consist of coral-rock ; but i have no evidence of their recent elevation , besides , the improbability of <unk> , a fringed island in the same group ( but distant 170 miles ) , having retained its nearly perfect <unk> structure , during any immense lapse of time after its upheaval .
the red sea , therefore , is the only area in which we have clear proofs of the recent elevation of a district , which , by our theory ( although the barrier-reefs are there not well characterised ) , has lately subsided .
but we have no reason to be surprised at oscillation , of level of this kind having occasionally taken place .
there can be scarcely any doubt that savage , <name> ( <name> island is described by mr. couthouy ( " remarks , " <name> 58 ) ; it lies 120 miles north-east of tahiti ; it is not coloured in the appended map , because it does not appear to be fringed by living reefs .
mr. couthouy describes its summit as " presenting a broad table-land which declines a few feet towards the centre , where we may suppose the lagoon to have been placed . "
it is about two hundred feet in height , and consists of <unk> and conglomerate , with existing species of <name> embedded in it .
the island has been elevated at two successive periods ; the cliffs being marked halfway up with a horizontal water-worn line of deep excavations .
<name> island seems closely to resemble in structure <name> island , at the southern end of the low archipelago .
) , and <unk> islands , and several of the islands in the friendly group , existed originally as atolls , and these have undoubtedly since been upraised to some height above the level of the sea ; so that by our theory , there has here , also , been an oscillation of level ,  elevation having succeeded subsidence , instead of , as in the middle part of the red sea and at the <name> islands , subsidence having probably succeeded recent elevation .
it is an interesting fact , that <unk> , which , from its composition , form , height , and situation at the western end of the <name> archipelago , one is strongly induced to believe existed before its upheaval as an atoll , lies exactly in the prolongation of the curved line of the <name> group , which we know to be a line of recent elevation .
i may add , that <name> island , in the southern part of the low archipelago , which seems to have had the same kind of origin as <unk> , lies near pitcairn island , the only one in this part of the ocean which is high , and at the same time not surrounded by an encircling barrier-reef .
on the absence of active volcanoes in the areas of subsidence , and on their frequent presence in the areas of elevation .
before making some concluding remarks on the relations of the spaces coloured blue and red , it <name> be convenient to consider the position on our map of the volcanoes historically known to have been in action .
it is impossible not to be struck , first with the absence of volcanoes in the great areas of subsidence tinted pale and dark blue ,  namely , in the central parts of the indian ocean , in the <name> sea , in the sea between the barriers of australia and new caledonia , in the <name> , <name> , <name> , and low archipelagoes ; and , secondly , with the coincidence of the principal volcanic chains with the parts coloured red , which indicates the presence of fringing-reefs ; and , as we have just seen , the presence in most cases of upraised organic remains of a modern date .
i may here remark that the reefs were all coloured before the volcanoes were added to the map , or indeed before i knew of the existence of several of them .
the volcano in <unk> strait , at the northern point of australia , is that which lies nearest to a large subsiding area , although situated 125 miles within the outer margin of the actual barrier-reef .
the great <unk> island , which probably contains a volcano , is only twenty miles distant from the barrier-reef of <unk> ; <unk> volcano , in the philippines , is distant only a little more than sixty miles from the atoll-formed <unk> reef : and there are two other volcanoes in the map within ninety miles of circles coloured blue .
these few cases , which thus offer partial exceptions to the rule , of volcanoes being placed remote from the areas of subsidence , lie either near single and isolated atolls , or near small groups of encircled islands ; and these by our theory can have , in few instances , subsided to the same amount in depth or area , as groups of atolls .
there is not one active volcano within several hundred miles of an archipelago , or even a small group of atolls .
it is , therefore , a striking fact that in the friendly archipelago , which owes its origin to the elevation of a group of atolls , two volcanoes , and , perhaps , others are known to be in action : on the other hand , on several of the encircled islands in the pacific , supposed by our theory to have subsided , there are old craters and streams of lava , which show the effects of past and ancient eruptions .
in these cases , it would appear as if the volcanoes had come into action , and had become extinguished on the same spots , according as the elevating or subsiding movements prevailed .
there are some other coasts on the map , where volcanoes in a state of action concur with proofs of recent elevation , besides those coloured red from being fringed by coral-reefs .
thus i <name> to show in a future volume , that nearly the whole line of the west coast of south <name> , which forms the greatest volcanic chain in the world , from near the equator for a space of between 2,000 and 3,000 miles southward , has undergone an upward movement during a late geological period .
the islands on the north-western shores of the pacific , which form the second greatest volcanic chain , are very imperfectly known ; but luzon , in the philippines , and the loo <unk> islands , have been recently elevated ; and at <unk> ( at <unk> , in latitude 58 deg n. ( <name> buch 's " <unk> .
des isles canaries , " <name> 455 ) .
in a forthcoming part , i shall give the evidence referred to with respect to the elevation of new zealand . )
there are extensive tertiary beds of modern date .
evidence of the same nature , but not very satisfactory , may be detected in northern new zealand where there are two volcanoes .
the <unk> in other parts of the world of active volcanoes , with upraised beds of a modern tertiary origin , <name> occur to every geologist .
( during the subterranean disturbances which took place in chile , in 1835 , i have shown ( " geolog .
trans . "
2nd <unk> , vol .
v. , <name> <unk> ) that at the same moment that a large district was upraised , volcanic matter burst forth at widely separated points , through both new and old vents . )
nevertheless , until it could be shown that volcanoes were inactive , or did not exist in subsiding areas , the conclusion that their distribution depended on the nature of the subterranean movements in progress , would have been hazardous .
but now , viewing the appended map , it may , i think , be considered as almost established , that volcanoes are often ( not necessarily always ) present in those areas where the subterranean motive power has lately forced , or is now forcing outwards , the crust of the earth , but that they are invariably absent in those , where the surface has lately subsided or is still subsiding .
( we may infer from this rule , that in any old deposit , which contains interstratified beds of erupted matter , there was at the period , and in the area of its formation , a tendency to an upward movement in the earth 's surface , and certainly no movement of subsidence . )
on the relations of the areas of subsidence and elevation .
the immense surfaces on the map , which , both by our theory and by the plain evidence of upraised <name> remains , have undergone a change of level either downwards or upwards during a late period , is a most remarkable fact .
the existence of continents shows that the areas have been immense which at some period have been upraised ; in south <name> we may feel sure , and on the north-western shores of the indian ocean we may suspect , that this rising is either now actually in progress , or has taken place quite recently .
by our theory , we may conclude that the areas are likewise immense which have lately subsided , or , judging from the earthquakes occasionally felt and from other appearances , are now subsiding .
the smallness of the scale of our map should not be overlooked : each of the squares on it contains ( not allowing for the curvature of the earth ) <unk> square miles .
look at the space of ocean from near the southern end of the low archipelago to the northern end of the <name> archipelago , a length of <unk> miles , in which , as far as is known , every island , except <name> which lies just without the low archipelago , is atoll-formed .
the eastern and western boundaries of our map are continents , and they are rising areas : the central spaces of the great indian and pacific oceans , are mostly subsiding ; between them , north of australia , lies the most broken land on the globe , and there the rising parts are surrounded and penetrated by areas of subsidence ( i suspect that the <unk> and <unk> islands present an included small area of subsidence , like that of the <name> sea , but i have not ventured to colour them from my imperfect information , as given in the appendix .
) , so that the prevailing movements now in progress , seem to accord with the actual states of surface of the great divisions of the world .
the blue spaces on the map are nearly all elongated ; but it does not necessarily follow from this ( a caution , for which i am indebted to mr. lyell ) , that the areas of subsidence were likewise elongated ; for the subsidence of a long , narrow space of the bed of the ocean , including in it a transverse chain of mountains , surmounted by atolls , would only be marked on the map by a transverse blue band .
but where a chain of atolls and barrier-reefs lies in an elongated area , between spaces coloured red , which therefore have remained stationary or have been upraised , this must have resulted either from the area of subsidence having originally been elongated ( owing to some tendency in the earth 's crust thus to subside ) , or from the subsiding area having originally been of an irregular figure , or as broad as long , and having since been narrowed by the elevation of neighbouring districts .
thus the areas , which subsided during the formation of the great north and south lines of atolls in the indian ocean ,  of the east and west line of the <name> atolls ,  and of the north-west and south-east line of the barrier-reefs of new caledonia and <unk> , must have originally been elongated , or if not so , they must have since been made elongated by elevations , which we know to belong to a recent period .
i infer from mr. hopkins ' researches ( " researches in physical geology , " transact .
cambridge <name> .
<unk> , volume <name> , part i .
) , that for the formation of a long chain of mountains , with few lateral spurs , an area elongated in the same direction with the chain , must have been subjected to an elevatory movement .
<unk> , however , when already formed , although running in very different directions , it seems ( for instance in s. <name> from latitude 34 deg , for very many degrees southward there are upraised beds containing recent species of shells , on both the atlantic and pacific side of the continent , and from the gradual ascent of the land , although with very unequal slopes , on both sides towards the cordillera , i think it can hardly be doubted that the entire width has been upraised in mass within the recent period .
in this case the two <unk> .
and <unk> .
<unk> , namely the <name> ventana and the s. tapalguen , and the great north and south line of the cordillera have been together raised .
in the west indies the n. and s. line of the eastern <unk> , and the e. and w. line of jamaica , appear both to have been upraised within the latest geological period . )
may be raised together by a <unk> force : so , perhaps , <unk> may subside together .
hence , we can not tell , whether the <name> and <name> archipelagoes , two groups of atolls running in different directions and meeting each other , have been formed by the subsidence of two areas , or of one large area , including two distinct lines of mountains .
we have , however , in the southern prolongation of the <name> islands , probable evidence of a line of recent elevation having intersected one of recent subsidence .
a view of the map <name> show that , generally , there is a tendency to alternation in the parallel areas undergoing opposite kinds of movement ; as if the sinking of one area balanced the rising of another .
the existence in many parts of the world of high table-land , proves that large surfaces have been upraised in mass to considerable heights above the level of the ocean ; although the highest points in almost every country consist of upturned strata , or erupted matter : and from the immense spaces scattered with atolls , which indicate that land originally existed there , although not one pinnacle now remains above the level of the sea , we may conclude that wide areas have subsided to an amount , sufficient to bury not only any formerly existing table-land , but even the heights formed by fractured strata , and erupted matter .
the effects produced on the land by the later elevatory movements , namely , successively rising cliffs , lines of <unk> , and beds of literal shells and pebbles , all requiring time for their production , prove that these movements have been very slow ; we can , however , infer this with safety , only with respect to the few last hundred feet of rise .
but with reference to the whole vast amount of subsidence , necessary to have produced the many atolls widely scattered over immense spaces , it has already been shown ( and it is , perhaps , the most interesting conclusion in this volume ) , that the movements must either have been uniform and exceedingly slow , or have been effected by small steps , separated from each other by long intervals of time , during which the <unk> polypifers were able to bring up their solid <unk> to the surface .
we have little means of judging whether many considerable oscillations of level have generally occurred during the elevation of large tracts ; but we know , from clear geological evidence , that this has frequently taken place ; and we have seen on our map , that some of the same islands have both subsided and been upraised .
i conclude , however , that most of the large blue spaces , have subsided without many and great elevatory oscillations , because only a few upraised atolls have been observed : the supposition that such elevations have taken place , but that the upraised parts have been worn down by the surf , and thus have escaped observation , is overruled by the very considerable depth of the lagoons of all the larger atolls ; for this could not have been the case , if they had suffered repeated elevations and <unk> .
from the comparative observations made in these latter pages , we may finally conclude , that the subterranean changes which have caused some large areas to rise , and others to subside , have acted in a very similar manner .
recapitulation .
in the three first chapters , the principal kinds of coral-reefs were described in detail , and they were found to differ little , as far as relates to the actual surface of the reef .
an atoll differs from an encircling barrier-reef only in the absence of land within its central expanse ; and a barrier-reef differs from a <unk> , in being placed at a much greater distance from the land with reference to the probable inclination of its submarine foundation , and in the presence of a deep-water <unk> space or moat within the reef .
in the fourth chapter the growing powers of the <unk> polypifers were discussed ; and it was shown , that they can not flourish beneath a very limited depth .
in accordance with this limit , there is no difficulty respecting the foundations on which fringing-reefs are based ; whereas , with barrier-reefs and atolls , there is a great apparent difficulty on this head ; in barrier-reefs from the improbability of the rock of the coast or of banks of sediment extending , in every instance , so far seaward within the required depth ;  and in atolls , from the immensity of the spaces over which they are interspersed , and the apparent necessity for believing that they are all supported on <unk> , which although rising very near to the <unk> of the sea , in no one instance emerge above it .
to escape this latter most improbable admission , which implies the existence of submarine chains of mountains of almost the same height , extending over areas of many thousand square miles , there is but one alternative ; namely , the prolonged subsidence of the foundations , on which the atolls were primarily based , together with the upward growth of the <unk> corals .
on this view every difficulty vanishes ; fringing reefs are thus converted into barrier-reefs ; and barrier-reefs , when encircling islands , are thus converted into atolls , the instant the last pinnacle of land sinks beneath the surface of the ocean .
thus the ordinary forms and certain peculiarities in the structure of atolls and barrier-reefs can be explained ;  namely , the <unk> structure on their inner sides , the basin or <unk> shape both of the marginal and central reefs in the maldiva atolls  the union of some atolls as if by a ribbon  the apparent disseverment of others  and the occurrence , in atolls as well as in barrier-reefs , of portions of reef , and of the whole of some reefs , in a dead and submerged state , but retaining the outline of living reefs .
thus can be explained the existence of breaches through barrier-reefs in front of valleys , though separated from them by a wide space of deep water ; thus , also , the ordinary outline of groups of atolls and the relative forms of the separate atolls one to another ; thus can be explained the proximity of the two kinds of reefs formed during subsidence , and their separation from the spaces where fringing-reefs abound .
on searching for other evidence of the movements supposed by our theory , we find marks of change in atolls and in barrier-reefs , and of subterranean disturbances under them ; but from the nature of things , it is scarcely possible to detect any direct proofs of subsidence , although some appearances are strongly in favour of it .
on the fringed coasts , however , the presence of upraised <name> bodies of a recent epoch , plainly show , that these coasts , instead of having remained stationary , which is all that can be directly inferred from our theory , have generally been elevated .
finally , when the two great types of structure , namely barrier-reefs and atolls on the one hand , and fringing-reefs on the other , were laid down in colours on our map , a magnificent and harmonious picture of the movements , which the crust of the earth has within a late period undergone , is presented to us .
we there see vast areas rising , with volcanic matter every now and then bursting forth through the vents or fissures with which they are traversed .
we see other wide spaces slowly sinking without any volcanic outburst , and we may feel sure , that this sinking must have been immense in amount as well as in area , thus to have buried over the broad face of the ocean every one of those mountains , above which atolls now stand like monuments , marking the place of their former existence .
reflecting how powerful an agent with respect to denudation , and consequently to the nature and thickness of the deposits in accumulation , the sea must ever be , when acting for prolonged periods on the land , during either its slow emergence or subsidence ; reflecting , also , on the final effects of these movements in the <unk> of land and <unk> on the climate of the earth , and on the distribution of organic beings , i may be permitted to <name> , that the conclusions derived from the study of <unk> , originally attempted merely to explain their peculiar forms , may be thought worthy of the attention of geologists .
appendix .
containing a detailed description of the reefs and islands in plate iii .
in the beginning of the last chapter i stated the principles on which the map is coloured .
there only remains to be said , that it is an exact copy of one by m. c. <unk> , published by the depot general de la <name> , in 1835 .
the names have been altered into english , and the longitude has been reduced to that of greenwich .
the colours were first laid down on accurate charts , on a large scale .
the data , on which the volcanoes historically known to have been in action , have been marked with vermillion , were given in a note to the last chapter .
i <name> commence my description on the eastern side of the map , and <name> describe each group of islands <unk> , proceeding westward across the pacific and indian oceans , but ending with the west indies .
the western shores of <name> appear to be entirely without coral-reefs ; south of the equator the survey of the " beagle " , and north of it , the published charts show that this is the case .
even in the bay of panama , where corals flourish , there are no true coral-reefs , as i have been informed by mr. <name> .
there are no coral-reefs in the galapagos archipelago , as i know from personal inspection ; and i believe there are none on the <unk> , <unk> , and other neighbouring islands .
<unk> rock , 10 deg n. , 109 deg w. , has lately been surveyed by captain <unk> ; in form it is like the crater of a volcano .
from a drawing appended to the ms. plan in the admiralty , it evidently is not an atoll .
the eastern parts of the pacific present an enormous area , without any islands , except <name> , and <unk> , and <unk> islands , which do not appear to be surrounded by reefs .
the low archipelago .
this group consists of about eighty atolls : it <name> be quite superfluous to refer to descriptions of each .
in d'urville and <unk> 's chart , one island ( <unk> ) is written with a capital letter , <unk> , as explained in a former chapter , that it is a high island ; but this must be a mistake , as the original chart by <unk> shows that it is a true atoll .
captain beechey says of the thirty-two groups which he examined ( of the greater number of which i have seen beautiful ms. charts in the admiralty ) , that twenty-nine now contain lagoons , and he believes the other three originally did .
<unk> ( see an account of his russian voyage , in the " <unk> .
des voyages , " 1834 , <name> 443 ) says , that the seventeen islands which he discovered resembled each other in structure , and he has given charts on a large scale of all of them .
kotzebue has given plans of several ; cook and <unk> mention others ; a few were seen during the voyage of the " beagle " ; and notices of other atolls are scattered through several publications .
the <unk> group in this archipelago has lately been discovered ( " geographical journal " , volume vii. , <name> 454 ) ; it consists of three small and low islets , one of which has a lagoon .
another <unk> has been discovered ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1839 , <name> <unk> ) , in 22 deg 4 ' s. , and 136 deg 20 ' w. towards the s.e .
part of the group , there are some islands of different formation : <name> island is described by beechey ( <name> 46 , 4to edition ) as fringed by reefs , at the distance of between two and three hundred yards ; coloured red .
pitcairn island , in the immediate neighbourhood , according to the same authority , has no reefs of any kind , although numerous pieces of <name> are thrown up on the beach ; the sea close to its shore is very deep ( see " zool .
of beechey 's voyage , " <name> 164 ) ; it is left uncoloured .
gambier islands ( see plate i. , figure 8 ) , are encircled by a barrier-reef ; the greatest depth within is thirty-eight fathoms ; coloured pale blue .
<name> island , which lies n.e .
of tahiti close to the large space coloured dark blue in the map , has been already described in a note ( <name> 71 ) , on the authority of mr. couthouy ; it is an upraised atoll , but as it does not appear to be fringed by living reefs , it is left uncoloured .
the society archipelago is separated by a narrow space from the low archipelago ; and in their parallel direction they manifest some relation to each other .
i have already described the general character of the reefs of these fine encircled islands .
in the " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage " there is a good general chart of the group , and separate plans of some of the islands .
tahiti , the largest island in the group , is almost surrounded , as seen in cook 's chart , by a reef from half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore , with from ten to thirty fathoms within it .
some considerable submerged reefs lying parallel to the shore , with a broad and deep space within , have lately been discovered ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1836 , <name> 264 ) on the n.e .
coast of the island , where none are laid down by cook .
at <unk> the reef " which like a ring surrounds it , is in some places one or two miles distant from the shore , in others united to the beach " ( <name> , " polynesian researches , " volume i. , <name> 18 , 12mo edition ) .
cook found deep water ( twenty fathoms ) in some of the harbours within the reef .
mr. couthouy , however , states ( " remarks , " <name> 45 ) that both at tahiti and <unk> , the space between the barrier-reef and the shore , has been almost filled up ,  " a nearly continuous <unk> surrounding the island , and varying from a few yards to rather more than a mile in width , the lagoons merely forming canals between this and the <unk> , " that is the barrier-reef .
<unk> is surrounded by a reef at a considerable distance from the shore ; from the island being small it is breached , as i am informed by the rev .
w. <name> , only by a narrow and crooked boat channel .
this is the lowest island in the group , its height probably not exceeding 500 feet .
a little way north of tahiti , the low <unk> of <unk> are situated ; from the description of them given me by the rev .
j. <name> ( the author of the " narrative of missionary enterprise " ) , i should have thought they had formed a small atoll , and likewise from the description given by the rev .
d. <unk> and g. <name> ( " journal of voyage and travels , " volume i. , <name> 183 ) , who say that ten low <unk> " are comprehended within one general reef , and separated from each other by <unk> lagoons ; " but as mr. stutchbury ( " west of england journal , " volume i. , <name> 54 ) describes it as consisting of a mere narrow ridge , i have left it uncoloured .
<unk> , eastward of the group , is classed by forster as a high encircled island ; but from the account given by the rev .
d. <unk> and g. <name> ( volume i. , <name> 57 ) it appears to be an exceedingly abrupt cone , rising from the sea without any reef ; i have left it uncoloured .
it would be superfluous to describe the northern islands in this group , as they may be well seen in the chart accompanying the 4to edition of cook 's " voyages , " and in the " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage . "
<unk> is the only one of the northern islands , in which the water within the reef is not deep , being only four and a half fathoms ; but the great width of the reef , stretching three miles and a half southward of the land ( which is represented in the drawing in the " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage " as descending abruptly to the water ) shows , on the principle explained in the beginning of the last chapter , that it belongs to the barrier class .
i may here mention , from information communicated to me by the rev .
w. <name> , that on the n.e .
side of <unk> there is a bank of sand , about a quarter of a mile wide , extending parallel to the shore , and separated from it by an extensive and deep lagoon ; this bank of sand rests on coral-rock , and undoubtedly was originally a living reef .
north of bolabola lies the atoll of <unk> ( <unk> of the " 'coquille 's ' atlas " ) which is coloured dark blue ; the other islands , surrounded by barrier-reefs , are pale blue ; three of them are represented in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 , in plate i .
there are three low <unk> lying a little e. of the society archipelago , and almost forming part of it , namely <unk> , which is said by kotzebue ( " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 255 ) , to be a <unk> ; <unk> , which , from <unk> description ( " second voyage , " book iii. , chapter i .
) , no doubt is an atoll ; and the <unk> islands , which are said by wallis ( " voyage , " chapter ix . )
to form a group of low islets and shoals , and , therefore , probably , they compose an atoll : the two former have been coloured blue , but not the latter .
<unk> or <unk> group .
these islands are entirely without reefs , as may be seen in <unk> atlas , making a remarkable contrast with the adjacent group of the society islands .
mr. <unk> .
<name> has given some account of this group , in the seventh volume of the " geographical journal " .
he informs me that all the islands have the same general character , and that the water is very deep close to their shores .
he visited three of them , namely , <unk> , <name> , and <unk> ; their beaches are strewed with rounded masses of <name> , and although no regular reefs exist , yet the shore is in many places lined by coral-rock , so that a boat grounds on this formation .
hence these islands ought probably to come within the class of fringed islands and be coloured red ; but as i am determined to err on the cautious side , i have left them uncoloured .
cook or <name> and <unk> island .
<unk> island is minutely described as an atoll by captain cook during his voyage in <unk> ; coloured blue .
<unk> was partially surveyed by the " beagle " ( see map accompanying " voyages of <unk> ' and 'beagle ' " ) ; the land is hilly , sloping gently to the beach ; the highest point is 360 feet ; on the southern side the reef projects five miles from the land : off this point the " beagle " found no bottom with 270 fathoms : the reef is surmounted by many low <unk> .
although within the reef the water is exceedingly shallow , not being more than a few feet deep , as i am informed by the rev .
j. <name> , nevertheless , from the great extension of this reef into a profoundly deep ocean , this island probably belongs , on the principle lately <unk> to , to the barrier class , and i have coloured it pale blue ; although with much <unk>  <unk> or <name> island .
the highest point is about fifty feet : the rev .
j. <name> informs me that the reef here , although it lies far from the shore , is less distant than at <unk> , but the water within the reef is rather deeper : i have also coloured this pale blue with many <unk>  round <unk> island , as i am informed by mr. <name> , the reef is attached to the shore ; coloured red .
 <unk> or <unk> ; the reef round this island ( under the name of parry island , in the " voyage of h.m.s .
<unk> ' , " <name> 209 ) is described as a <unk> , only fifty yards wide , and two feet under water .
this statement has been corroborated by mr. <name> , who calls the reef attached ; coloured red.  <unk> , or <unk> ; a moderately elevated hilly island , like the others of this group .
the reef is described in <unk> " voyage , " as attached to the shore , and about one hundred yards wide ; coloured red.  <unk> ; cook describes this island as very low , not more than six or seven feet high ( volume i. , book ii. , chapter iii , <unk> ) ; in the chart published in the " 'coquille 's ' atlas , " a reef is engraved close to the shore : this island is not mentioned in the list given by mr. <name> ( <name> 16 ) in the " narrative of missionary enterprise ; " nature doubtful .
as it is so near <unk> , it has been <unk> coloured red.  <unk> ; mr. <name> informs me that it is a lofty basaltic island with an attached reef ; coloured red.  there are three islands , <unk> , <unk> , and hull , of which i have not been able to obtain any account , and have left them uncoloured .
hull island , in the french chart , is written with small letters as being <unk>  <unk> ; height about three hundred feet ; " the surrounding reef joins the shore " ( <name> , " narrative , " <name> 18 ) ; coloured red.  <unk> ; mr. <name> informs me that the reef is rather close to the shore ; but , from information given me by mr. <name> , the reef does not appear to be quite so closely attached to it as in the foregoing cases : the island is about three hundred feet high ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1839 , <name> <unk> ) ; coloured red.  <unk> ; mr. <name> and mr. <name> inform me that this island has an attached reef ; coloured red .
it is described by cook under the name of <unk> : he says it is not surrounded , like the neighbouring islands by a reef ; he must have meant a distant <unk>  <unk> ; in cook 's chart ( " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 2 ) the reef is laid down in part one mile , and in part two miles from the shore .
mr. <name> ( " <unk> .
res . "
volume iii. , <name> 381 ) says the low land round the base of the island is very extensive ; and this gentleman informs me that the water within the reef appears deep ; coloured blue.  <unk> , or <unk> ; mr. <name> informs me that the reef is here distant : mr. <name> , however , says that this is certainly not the case on one side of the island ; and he believes that the water within the reef is not deep ; hence i have left it <unk>  lancaster reef , described in " <unk> .
mag . "
1833 ( <name> <unk> ) , as an extensive <unk> coral-reef .
i have not coloured it.  <unk> , or <unk> ; from the accounts given of it by <name> and vancouver , there does not appear to be any <unk>  i .
de bass is an adjoining island , of which i can not find any <unk>  <unk> island ; krusenstern seems hardly to know its position , and gives no further particulars .
islands between the low and <name> archipelagoes .
<name> island ( 10 deg s. , 150 deg w. ) is described by mr. <unk> .
<name> ( " geographical journal " , volume vii. , <name> 225 ) as containing a fine lagoon ; coloured blue.  flint island ( 11 deg s. , 151 deg w. ) ; krusenstern believes that it is the same with <unk> , which is described by <unk> ( <unk> 's " <unk> .
hist . "
volume ii. , <name> 283 ) as " a cluster of small islands connected by a reef , and forming a lagoon in the middle ; " coloured blue.  <unk> is an island a little more than half a mile in diameter , and apparently quite flat and low , and was discovered by <unk> ; it is situated a little west of <name> island , but it is not placed on the french charts ; i have not coloured it , although i entertain little doubt from the chart of <unk> , that it originally contained a small <unk>  <unk> island ( 9 deg s. , 158 deg w. ) ; a plan of it in the " atlas of the first voyage " of kotzebue , shows that it is an atoll ; blue.  <unk> island ( 5 deg s. , 156 deg w. ) is described in <name> 's " voyage in the <unk> ' " ( <name> 206 ) as formed of a flat coral-rock , with no trees ; the height not given ; not <unk>  <unk> island ( 4 deg s. , 154 deg w. ) ; in the same voyage ( <name> 205 ) this island is said to be of <name> formation , and no part above forty feet high ; i have not ventured to colour it , although , from being of coral-formation , it is probably fringed ; in which case it should be red.  <name> , or bunker island ( 0 deg 20 ' s. , 160 deg w. ) is described by mr. <unk> .
<name> ( " geographical journal " , volume vii. , <name> 227 ) as a narrow , low strip of coral-formation ; not <unk>  <name> , is a small low island between the two latter ; the position , and perhaps even the existence of it is doubtful ; not <unk>  <unk> and humphrey islands ; i can find out nothing about these islands , except that the latter appears to be small and low ; not <unk>  <unk> , or grand duke <name> 's ( 10 s. , 161 deg w. ) ; an atoll , of which a plan is given by <unk> ; blue.  <unk> islands ( 13 deg s. , 163 deg w. ) ; admiral krusenstern , in the most obliging manner , obtained for me an account of these islands from admiral <unk> , who discovered them .
they consist of five very low islands of coral-formation , two of which are connected by a reef , with deep water close to it .
they do not surround a lagoon , but are so placed that a line drawn through them includes an oval space , part of which is shallow ; these islets , therefore , probably once ( as is the case with some of the islands in the <name> archipelago ) formed a single atoll ; but i have not coloured them.  danger island ( 10 deg s. , 166 deg w. ) ; described as low by commodore <name> , and more lately surveyed by <unk> ; it is a small atoll with three islets on it ; blue.  <name> island ( 9 deg s. , 172 deg w. ) ; discovered in the " <name> " ( g. hamilton 's " voyage , " <name> 75 ) : it is said , " in running along the land , we saw several canoes crossing the lagoons ; " as this island is in the close vicinity of other low islands , and as it is said , that the natives make <unk> of water in old cocoa-nut trees ( which shows the nature of the land ) , i have no doubt it is an atoll , and have coloured it blue .
york island ( 8 deg s. , 172 deg w. ) is described by commodore <name> ( chapter x. of his " voyage " ) as an atoll ; blue.  <name> island ( 4 deg s. , 172 deg w. ) is about three miles in diameter , with its interior occupied by a lagoon ( captain <unk> , " <unk> .
<unk> . "
1829 , <name> 297 ) ; blue.  <unk> island ( 4 deg s. , 171 deg w. ) is nearly circular , low , <name> , not more than two miles in diameter , and very steep outside ( <unk> , " <unk> .
<unk> . "
1829 , <name> 297 ) ; it may be inferred that this island originally contained a lagoon , but i have not coloured it.  new nantucket ( 0 deg 15 ' n. , 174 deg w. ) .
from the french chart it must be a low island ; i can find nothing more about it or about <name> island ; both <unk>  gardner island ( 5 deg s. , 174 deg w. ) from its position is certainly the same as <unk> island described ( krusenstern , <name> 435 , <unk> .
to <unk> , published 1827 ) as having a lagoon in its centre ; blue .
islands south of the sandwich archipelago .
christmas island ( 2 deg n. , 157 deg w. ) .
captain cook , in his " third voyage " ( volume ii. , chapter x .
) , has given a detailed account of this atoll .
the breadth of the islets on the reef is unusually great , and the sea near it does not deepen so suddenly as is generally the case .
it has more lately been visited by mr. <unk> .
<name> ( " geographical journal , " volume vii. , <name> 226 ) ; and he assures me that it is low and of coral-formation : i particularly mention this , because it is engraved with a capital letter , <unk> a high island , in d'urville and <unk> 's chart .
mr. couthouy , also , has given some account of it ( " remarks , " <name> 46 ) from the hawaiian " spectator " ; he believes it has lately undergone a small elevation , but his evidence does not appear to me satisfactory ; the deepest part of the lagoon is said to be only ten feet ; nevertheless , i have coloured it blue.  fanning island ( 4 deg n. , 158 deg w. ) according to captain <unk> ( " <name> .
<unk> . "
1829 , <name> 283 ) , is an atoll : his account as observed by krusenstern , differs from that given in <unk> " voyage " ( <name> 224 ) , which , however , is far from clear ; coloured blue.  washington island ( 4 deg n. , 159 deg w. ) is engraved as a low island in d'urville 's chart , but is described by fanning ( <name> 226 ) as having a much greater elevation than fanning island , and hence i presume it is not an atoll ; not <unk>  palmyra island ( 6 deg n. , 162 deg w. ) is an atoll divided into two parts ( krusenstern 's " mem .

<name> 50 , also <unk> " voyage , " <name> 233 ) ; blue.  <unk> 's or <unk> 's islands ( 17 deg n. , 170 deg w. ) .
captain <unk> , r.n. , has had the kindness to inform me that they consist of two very low , small islands , with a dangerous reef off the east end of them .
captain <unk> does not recollect whether these islets , together with the reef , surrounded a lagoon ; uncoloured .
sandwich archipelago .
hawaii ; in the chart in freycinet 's " atlas , " small portions of the coast are fringed by reefs ; and in the accompanying " hydrog .
memoir , " reefs are mentioned in several places , and the <name> is said to injure the cables .
on one side of the islet of <unk> there is a bank of sand and <name> with five feet water on it , running parallel to the shore , and leaving a channel of about fifteen feet deep within .
i have coloured this island red , but it is very much less perfectly fringed than others of the <unk>  <unk> ; in freycinet 's chart of the anchorage of <unk> , two or three miles of coast are seen to be fringed ; and in the " hydrog .
memoir , " " banks of <name> along shore " are spoken of .
mr. <unk> .
<name> informs me that the reefs , on an average , extend about a quarter of a mile from the beach ; the land is not very steep , and outside the reefs the sea does not become deep very suddenly ; coloured red.  <unk> , i presume , is fringed : freycinet speaks of the breakers extending along the shore at a little distance from it .
from the chart , i believe it is fringed ; coloured red.  oahu ; freycinet , in his " hydrog .
memoir , " mentions some of the reefs .
mr. <unk> .
<name> informs me that the shore is skirted for forty or fifty miles in length .
there is even a harbour for ships formed by the reefs , but it is at the mouth of a valley ; red.  <unk> , in la <unk> 's charts , is represented as fringed by a reef , in the same manner as oahu and <unk> ; and this , as i have been informed by mr. <name> , on part at least of the shore , is of coral-formation : the reef does not leave a deep channel within ; red.  <unk> ; mr. <name> believes that this island is also fringed by a coral-reef : considering its close proximity to the other islands , i have ventured to colour it red .
i have in vain consulted the works of cook , vancouver , la <unk> , and <unk> , for any satisfactory account of the small islands and reefs , which lie scattered in a n.w .
line prolonged from the sandwich group , and hence have left them uncoloured , with one exception ; for i am indebted to mr. <unk> .
<name> for informing me of an atoll-formed reef , in latitude 28 deg 22 ' , longitude 178 deg 30 ' w. , on which the " <unk> " was wrecked in 1837 .
it is apparently of large size , and extends in a n.w .
and s.e .
line : very few islets have been formed on it .
the lagoon seems to be shallow ; at least , the deepest part which was surveyed was only three fathoms .
mr. couthouy ( " remarks , " <name> 38 ) describes this island under the name of ocean island .
considerable doubts should be entertained regarding the nature of a reef of this kind , with a very shallow lagoon , and standing far from any other atoll , on account of the possibility of a crater or flat bank of rock lying at the proper depth beneath the surface of the water , thus affording a foundation for a ring-formed coral-reef .
i have , however , thought myself compelled , from its large size and symmetrical outline , to colour it blue .
samoa or navigator group .
kotzebue , in his " second voyage , " contrasts the structure of these islands with many others in the pacific , in not being furnished with harbours for ships , formed by distant coral-reefs .
the rev .
j. <name> , however , informs me , that coral-reefs do occur in irregular patches on the shores of these islands ; but that they do not form a continuous band , as round <unk> , and other such perfect cases of fringed islands .
from the charts accompanying la <unk> 's " voyage , " it appears that the north shore of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are fringed by reefs .
la <unk> , speaking of <unk> ( <name> 126 ) , says that the coral-reef surrounding its shores , almost touches the beach ; and is breached in front of the little <unk> and streams , forming passages for canoes , and probably even for boats .
further on ( <name> 159 ) , he extends the same observation to all the islands which he visited .
mr. <name> in his " narrative , " speaks of a reef going round a small island attached to <unk> , and returning again to it : all these islands have been coloured red.  a chart of rose island , at the extreme west end of the group , is given by freycinet , from which i should have thought that it had been an atoll ; but according to mr. couthouy ( " remarks , " <name> 43 ) , it consists of a reef , only a league in circuit , surmounted by a very few low islets ; the lagoon is very shallow , and is strewed with numerous large boulders of volcanic rock .
this island , therefore , probably consists of a bank of rock , a few feet submerged , with the outer margin of its upper surface fringed with reefs ; hence it can not be properly classed with atolls , in which the foundations are always supposed to lie at a depth , greater than that at which the <unk> polypifers can live ; not coloured .
<unk> reef , 20 deg s. , 167 deg w. , is described in the " <unk> .
mag . "
( may 1833 , <name> 442 ) as ten miles long in a n. and s. line , and eight wide ; " in the inside of the reef there appears deep water ; " there is a passage near the s.w .
corner : this therefore seems to be a submerged atoll , and is coloured blue .
savage island , 19 deg s. , 170 deg w. , has been described by cook and forster .
the younger forster ( volume ii. , <name> 163 ) says it is about forty feet high : he suspects that it contains a low plain , which formerly was the lagoon .
the rev .
j. <name> informs me that the reef fringing its shores , resembles that round <unk> ; coloured red .
friendly archipelago .
<unk> island .
judging from the chart in freycinet 's " atlas , " i should have supposed that it had been regularly fringed ; but as nothing is said in the " hydrog .
memoir " ( or in the " voyage " of <unk> , the discoverer ) about coral-reefs , i have left it <unk>  <unk> : in the " atlas of the voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " the whole south side of the island is represented as narrowly fringed by the same reef which forms an extensive platform on the northern side .
the origin of this latter reef , which might have been mistaken for a barrier-reef , has already been attempted to be explained , when giving the proofs of the recent elevation of this <unk>  in cook 's charts the little outlying island also of <unk> , is represented as fringed ; coloured red.  <unk> .
i can not make out from captain <unk> charts and descriptions , that this island has any reef , although the bottom of the neighbouring sea seems to be <unk> , and the island itself is formed of coral-rock .
forster , however , distinctly ( " observations , " <name> 14 ) classes it with high islands having reefs , but it certainly is not encircled by a barrier-reef and the younger forster ( " voyage , " volume i. , <name> 426 ) says , that " a bed of <unk> surrounded the coast towards the landing-place . "
i have therefore classed it with the fringed islands and coloured it red .
the several islands lying n.w .
of <unk> , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. , are seen in captain <unk> chart to be fringed by reefs , in several of them are connected together .
from the various statements in the first volume of cook 's " third voyage , " and especially in the fourth and sixth chapters , it appears that these reefs are of coral-formation , and certainly do not belong to the barrier class ; coloured red.  <unk> and <unk> , forming the western part of the group , according to forster have no reefs ; the former is an active <unk>  <unk> .
there is a chart of this singularly formed island , by <unk> : according to mr. <name> it consists of coral-rock : the <unk> <name> informs me that it is not fringed ; not coloured .
nor are the islands of <unk> and <unk> , for i have not seen plans on a large scale of them , and do not know whether they are fringed .
<unk> , 16 deg s. , 174 deg w. , or <unk> island of wallis , or <unk> island .
from a view and chart of this island given in wallis 's " voyage " ( 4to edition ) it is evidently encircled by a reef ; coloured blue : it is however remarkable that <unk> island , immediately adjoining , has no reef of any kind ; uncoloured .
wallis island , 13 deg s. , 176 deg w. , a chart and view of this island in wallis 's " voyage " ( 4to edition ) shows that it is encircled .
a view of it in the " <unk> .
mag . "
july 1833 , <name> 376 , shows the same fact ; blue .
<unk> , or horn island , <unk> , or <unk> island , and <name> islands , lie between the navigator and <unk> groups .
i can find no distinct accounts of them .
<unk> or <unk> group .
the best chart of the numerous islands of this group , <name> be found in the " atlas of the 'astrolabe 's ' voyage . "
from this , and from the description given in the " hydrog .
memoir , " accompanying it , it appears that many of these islands are bold and mountainous , rising to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet .
most of the islands are surrounded by reefs , lying far from the land , and outside of which the ocean appears very deep .
the " <unk> " sounded with ninety fathoms in several places about a mile from the reefs , and found no bottom .
although the depth within the reef is not laid down , it is evident from several expressions , that captain d'urville believes that ships could anchor within , if passages existed through the outer barriers .
the <unk> <name> informs me that this is the case : hence i have coloured this group blue .
in the s.e .
part lies <unk> , or turtle island of cook ( " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 23 , and chart , 4to edition ) surrounded by a coral-reef , " which in some places extends two miles from the shore ; " within the reef the water appears to be deep , and outside it is unfathomable ; coloured pale blue .
at the distance of a few miles , captain cook ( <unk> , <name> 24 ) found a circular coral-reef , four or five leagues in circuit , with deep water within ; " in short , the bank wants only a few little islets to make it exactly like one of the <unk> isles so often mentioned , "  namely , atolls .
south of <unk> , lies the high island of <unk> , which appears in <unk> 's " atlas " to be encircled ; as do some other small islands to the south ; coloured pale blue ; near <unk> , there is an annular reef , quite similar to the one just described in the words of captain cook ; coloured dark blue .
<unk> , 13 deg s. , 179 deg e.  from the chart in <unk> 's " atlas , " i thought this island was encircled , and had coloured it blue , but the <unk> <name> assures me that the reef is only a shore or fringing one ; red .
independence island , 10 deg s. , 179 deg e. , is described by mr. g. <name> , ( " united service journal , " 1831 , part ii. , <name> 197 ) as a low island of coral-formation , it is small , and does not appear to contain a lagoon , although an opening through the reef is referred to .
a lagoon probably once existed , and has since been filled up ; left uncoloured .
<unk> group .
<name> , <unk> , and <unk> islands are figured in <unk> 's " chart of the pacific " ( corrected to 1832 ) as atolls , and are said to be very low ; blue.  <unk> island .
i am greatly indebted to the kindness of admiral krusenstern , for sending me the original documents concerning this island .
from the plans given by captains <unk> and <unk> , and from the detailed account given by the former , it appears that it is a narrow <unk> , about two miles long , containing a small lagoon .
the sea is very deep close to the shore , which is fronted by sharp <unk> .
captain <unk> compares the lagoon with that of other coral-islands ; and he distinctly says , the land is " very low . "
i have therefore coloured it blue .
admiral krusenstern ( " memoir on the pacific , " <unk> , 1835 ) states that its shores are eighty feet high ; this probably arose from the height of the cocoa-nut trees , with which it is covered , being mistaken for land .
 gran <unk> is said in krusenstern 's " memoir , " to be low , and to be surrounded by a reef ; it is small , and therefore probably once contained a lagoon ; <unk>  st .
<unk> .
from a chart and view of it , given in the " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage , " it appears to be a small atoll , with its lagoon partly filled up ; coloured blue .
<name> group .
the chart of this group , given in the " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage , " at once shows that it is composed of ten well characterised atolls .
in d'urville and <unk> 's chart , <unk> is written with a capital letter , <unk> that it is high ; but this certainly is not the case , for it is a perfectly characterised atoll , and a sketch , showing how low it is , is given in the " 'coquille 's ' atlas . "
some narrow <unk> reefs project from the southern side of <unk> atoll , and render it irregular .
the southern island of the group is called <name> ( in some charts , <unk> ) ; of this i can find no account , but mr. <unk> .
<name> discovered ( " geographical journal " , volume vii. , <name> 229 ) , a low extensive island in nearly the same latitude , about three degrees westward of the longitude assigned to <unk> , but very probably it is the same island .
mr. <name> informs me that the man at the masthead reported an appearance of <unk> in the centre ; and , therefore , considering its position , i have coloured it blue .
 pitt island , at the extreme northern point of the group , is left uncoloured , as its exact position and nature is not <unk>  <name> island , which lies a little to the eastward , does not appear to have been visited since commodore <name> 's voyage , and it was then seen only from a distance of eighteen miles ; it is said to be low ; uncoloured .
ocean , pleasant , and atlantic islands all lie considerably to the west of the <name> group : i have been unable to find any distinct account of them .
ocean island is written with small letters in the french chart , but in krusenstern 's " memoir " it is said to be high .
<name> group .
we are well acquainted with this group from the excellent charts of the separate islands , made during the two voyages of kotzebue : a reduced one of the whole group may be easily seen in krusenstern 's " atlas , " and in kotzebue 's " second voyage . "
the group consists ( with the exception of two little islands which probably have had their lagoon filled up ) of a double row of twenty-three large and <unk> atolls , from the examination of which chamisso has given us his well-known account of <unk> .
i include <unk> <name> , or <unk> island in this group , which is described by chamisso ( kotzebue 's " first voyage , " volume iii. , <name> 179 ) " as a low <unk> group , with mould only on the windward side . "
gaspard island is considered by some <unk> as a distinct island lying n.e .
of the group , but it is not entered in the chart by krusenstern ; left uncoloured .
in the s.w .
part of this group lies <unk> island , of which little is known ( see krusenstern 's " appendix , " 1835 , <name> 149 ) .
i have left it uncoloured ; but boston island i have coloured blue , as it is described ( ibid . )
as consisting of fourteen small islands , which , no doubt , enclose a lagoon , as represented in a chart in the " <unk> atlas . "
 two islands , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <name> , are written in the french chart with capital letters ; but this is an error , for from the account given by chamisso in kotzebue 's " first voyage , " they are certainly low .
the nature , position , and even existence , of the shoals and small islands north of the <name> group , are doubtful .
new hebrides .
any chart , on even a small scale , of these islands , <name> show that their shores are almost without reefs , presenting a remarkable contrast with those of new caledonia on the one hand , and the <unk> group on the other .
nevertheless , i have been assured by mr. g. <name> , that <name> grows vigorously on their shores ; as indeed , <name> be further shown in some of the following notices .
as , therefore , these islands are not encircled , and as <name> grows vigorously on their shores , we might almost conclude , without further evidence , that they were fringed , and hence i have applied the red colour with rather greater freedom than in other <unk>  <unk> rock , an active volcano , some way south of the group ( of which a plan is given in the " atlas of the 'astrolabe 's ' voyage " ) does not appear to have reefs of any kind about it.  <unk> , the southernmost of the hebrides ; from a rough woodcut given in the " united service journal " ( 1831 , part iii. , <name> 190 ) , accompanying a paper by mr. <name> , it appears that the shore is fringed ; coloured red.  <name> .
forster , in his " observations " ( <name> 22 ) , says <name> has on its shores coral-rock and <unk> ; and the younger forster , in his account ( volume ii. , <name> 269 ) speaking of the harbour says , the whole s.e .
side consists of coral-reefs , which are overflowed at high-water ; part of the southern shore in cook 's chart is represented as fringed ; coloured red.  <unk> is described ( " united service journal , " 1831 , part iii. , <name> 192 ) by mr. <name> as being of moderate elevation , with cliffs appearing like sandstone : <name> grows in patches on its shore , but i have not coloured it ; and i mention these facts , because <unk> might have been thought from forster 's classification ( " observations , " <name> 14 ) , to have been a low island or even an <unk>  <unk> island ; cook ( " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 45 , 4to edition ) speaks of rocks everywhere lining the coast , and the natives offered to haul his boat over the breakers to the <name> beach : mr. <name> , in a letter to the editor of the " singapore <unk> , " alludes to the reefs on its shores .
it may , i think , be safely inferred from these passages that the shore is fringed in parts by coral-reefs ; coloured red.  sandwich island .
the east coast is said ( cook 's " second voyage , " volume ii. , <name> 41 ) to be low , and to be guarded by a chain of breakers .
in the accompanying chart it is seen to be fringed by a reef ; coloured red.  <unk> .
forster speaks of the <unk> shore : the reef is about thirty yards wide , and so shallow that a boat can not pass over it .
forster also ( " observations , " <name> 23 ) says , that the rocks of the sea-shore consist of <unk> .
in the plan of sandwich harbour , the headlands are represented as fringed ; coloured red.  <name> and <unk> islands , according to <unk> , apparently have no reefs ; nor has the large island of s. <unk> , nor <unk> island or banks ' islands , which latter lie to the n.e .
of the hebrides .
but in none of these cases , have i met with any detailed account of their shores , or seen plans on a large scale ; and it <name> be evident , that a <unk> of only thirty or even a few hundred yards in width , is of so little importance to navigation , that it <name> seldom be noticed , excepting by chance ; and hence i do not doubt that several of these islands , now left uncoloured , ought to be red .
<name> <name> group .
vanikoro ( figure 1 , plate i . )
offers a striking example of a barrier-reef : it was first described by the <unk> <name> , in his voyage , and was surveyed in the " <unk> " ; coloured pale blue.  <unk> and <unk> islands appear , from the descriptions of <name> and d'urville , to have no reefs ; <unk> is a low , flat island , surrounded by cliffs ( " <unk> hydrog . "
and krusenstern , " mem . "
volume ii. , <name> 432 ) ; these are uncoloured .
<unk> ( <unk> of <name> ) is stated by captain <unk> ( " annales <unk> . "
1829 , <name> 289 ) to be almost entirely included in a reef , lying at the distance of two miles from the shore .
there is a space of three miles without any reef , which , although indented with bays , offers no anchorage from the extreme depth of the water close to the shore : captain <name> also speaks of the reefs fronting this island ; coloured blue.  <unk> .
i have carefully examined the works of <unk> , <unk> , <name> , and <unk> , and i can not discover any mention of reefs on its shores ; left <unk>  <unk> is a constantly active volcano without <unk>  <unk> isles ( mentioned by <name> under the name of <unk> , etc .

as i have no reason for supposing there is deep water within these reefs , i have coloured them red .
kennedy island , n.e .

new caledonia .
the great barrier-reefs on the shores of this island have already been described ( figure 5 , plate ii . ) .
they have been visited by <unk> , cook , and the northern point by d'urville ; this latter part so closely resembles an atoll that i have coloured it dark blue .
the loyalty group is situated eastward of this island ; from the chart and description given in the " voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " they do not appear to have any reefs ; north of this group , there are some extensive low reefs ( called <unk> and <unk> , ) which do not seem to be atoll-formed ; these are left uncoloured .
australian barrier-reef .
the limits of this great reef , which has already been described , have been coloured from the charts of flinders and king .
in the northern parts , an atoll-formed reef , lying outside the barrier , has been described by <unk> , and is coloured dark blue .
in the space between australia and new caledonia , called by flinders the <unk> sea , there are numerous reefs .
of these , some are represented in krusenstern 's " atlas " as having an <unk> structure ; namely , <unk> shoal , <name> , vine or horse-shoe , and alert reefs ; these have been coloured dark blue .
<unk> .
the dangerous reefs which front and surround the western , southern , and northern coasts of this so-called peninsula and archipelago , seem evidently to belong to the barrier class .
the land is lofty , with a low fringe on the coast ; the reefs are distant , and the sea outside them profoundly deep .
nearly all that is known of this group is derived from the labours of <unk> and <unk> : the latter has represented one continuous reef ninety miles long , parallel to the shore , and in places as much as ten miles from it ; coloured pale blue .
a little distance northward we have the <unk> islands , the reefs round which are engraved in the " atlas of the voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " in the same manner as in the encircled islands of the <name> archipelago , the reef is , in parts , a mile and a half from the shore , to which it does not appear to be attached ; coloured blue .
at some little distance from the extremity of the <unk> lies the wells reef , described in g. hamilton 's " voyage in h.m.s .
<unk> ' " ( <name> 100 ) : it is said , " we found we had got <unk> in a double reef , which <name> soon be an island . "
as this statement is only intelligible on the supposition of the reef being crescent or horse-shoe formed , like so many other submerged annular reefs , i have ventured to colour it blue .
<name> archipelago .
the chart in krusenstern 's " atlas " shows that these islands are not encircled , and as <name> appears from the works of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to grow on their shores , this circumstance , as in the case of the new hebrides , is a presumption that they are fringed .
i can not find out anything from <unk> 's " voyage , " regarding the southern islands of the group , so have left them <unk>  <unk> island in a rough ms. chart in the admiralty has its northern shore <unk>  <unk> island , the n.e .
part of this island , in the same chart , is also fringed : <unk> , speaking ( <unk> , volume i. , <name> 280 ) of an islet adjoining the northern coast , says it is surrounded by reefs ; the shores , also of port <unk> appear regularly <unk>  <unk> island .
in <unk> " chart of <unk> bay , " parts of the shores are fringed by <unk>  <unk> island .
according to <unk> the western shore abounds with coral-reefs , and the smaller islands are said to be attached to the larger ones by reefs ; all the <unk> islands have been coloured red.  <unk> islands .
captain <unk> has kindly informed me in a letter that he passed close round the northern side of this island ( of which a plan is given in his " atlas of the 'coquille 's ' voyage " ) , and that it was " <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> au <unk> ; " and he infers , from the abundance of <name> on the islands north and south of <unk> , that the reef probably is of <name> ; coloured red .
off the north coast of the <name> archipelago there are several small groups which are little known ; they appear to be low , and of coral-formation ; and some of them probably have an <unk> structure ; the <unk> <name> , however , informs me that this is not the case with the b. de <unk>  <unk> java , according to the spanish navigator , <unk> , is thus characterised ; but this is the only one which i have ventured to colour blue .
new ireland .
the shores of the s.w .
point of this island and some adjoining islets , are fringed by reefs , as may be seen in the " <unk> of the voyages of the 'coquille ' and 'astrolabe ' . "
m. lesson observes that the reefs are open in front of each <unk> .
the duke of york 's island is also fringed ; but with regard to the other parts of new ireland , new hanover , and the small islands lying northward , i have been unable to obtain any information .
i <name> only add that no part of new ireland appears to be fronted by distant reefs .
i have coloured red only the above specified portions .
new britain and the northern shore of new guinea .
from the charts in the " voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " and from the " hydrog .

admiralty group .
from the accounts by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the scattered notices collected by horsburgh , it appears , that some of the many islands composing it , are high , with a bold outline ; and others are very low , small and interlaced with reefs .
all the high islands appear to be fronted by distant reefs rising abruptly from the sea , and within some of which there is reason to believe that the water is deep .
i have therefore little doubt they are of the barrier <unk>  in the southern part of the group we have <name> island , which is surrounded by a reef at the distance of a mile ; and two miles eastward of it ( krusenstern , " append . "
1835 , <name> 42 ) there is a little island containing a <unk>  near here , also lies <unk> ( horsburgh , " direct . "
volume i. , <name> <unk> , 4th edition ) , " three or four miles in diameter having deep water inside with an opening at the <unk> .
part , and on the outside steep to . "
i have from these data , coloured the group pale blue , and <unk> dark blue.  the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , consist of innumerable low islands of coral-formation , which probably have <unk> forms ; but not being able to ascertain this , i have not coloured them , nor <unk> island , which is described by <unk> as low .
the <name> archipelago is now well-known , chiefly from the <unk> labours of lutke ; it contains about forty groups of atolls , and three encircled islands , two of which are engraved in figures 2 and 7 , plate i. commencing with the eastern part ; the encircling reef round <unk> appears to be only about half a mile from the shore ; but as the land is low and covered with <unk> ( " voyage <unk> du <unk> , " par f. lutke , volume i. , <name> 339 ) , the real margin has not probably been ascertained .
the extreme depth in one of the harbours within the reef is thirty-three fathoms ( see charts in " atlas of 'coquille 's ' voyage " ) , and outside at half a mile distant from the reef , no bottom was obtained with two hundred and fifty fathoms .
the reef is surmounted by many islets , and the <unk> channel within is mostly shallow , and appears to have been much <unk> on by the low land surrounding the central mountains ; these facts show that time has allowed much detritus to accumulate ; coloured pale blue.  <unk> , or <unk> .
in the greater part of the circumference of this island , the reef is about one mile and three quarters distant ; on the north side it is five miles off the included high islets .
the reef is broken in several places ; and just within it , the depth in one place is thirty fathoms , and in another , twenty-eight , beyond which , to all appearance , there was " <name> <unk> <unk> et sur " ( lutke , volume ii. , <name> 4 ) ; coloured pale blue.  <unk> or <unk> .
this wonderful group contains at least sixty-two islands , and its reef is one hundred and thirty-five miles in circuit .
of the islands , only a few , about six or eight ( see " hydrog .
<unk> . "
<name> 428 , of the " voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " and the large accompanying chart taken chiefly from that given by <unk> ) are high , and the rest are all small , low , and formed on the reef .
the depth of the great interior lake has not been ascertained ; but captain d'urville appears to have entertained no doubt about the possibility of taking in a frigate .
the reef lies no less than fourteen miles distant from the northern coasts of the interior high islands , seven from their western sides , and twenty from the southern ; the sea is deep outside .
this island is a likeness on a grand scale to the gambier group in the low archipelago .
of the groups of low ( in d'urville and <unk> 's chart , <unk> is written with capital letters ; but this evidently is an error , for it is one of the low islets on the reef of <unk> ( see lutke 's charts )  a regular atoll . )
islands forming the chief part of the <name> archipelago , all those of larger size , have the true <unk> ( as may be seen in the " atlas " by captain lutke ) , and some even of the very small ones , as <unk> and <unk> , of which plans are given in the " atlas of the <unk> voyage . "
there are , however , some low small islands of coral-formation , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which do not contain lagoons ; but it is probable that lagoons originally existed , but have since filled up : lutke ( volume ii. , <name> 304 ) seems to have thought that all the low islands , with only one exception , contained lagoons .
from the sketches , and from the manner in which the margins of these islands are engraved in the " atlas of the voyage of the 'coquille ' , " it might have been thought that they were not low ; but by a comparison with the remarks of lutke ( volume ii. , <name> 107 , regarding <unk> ) and of freycinet ( " hydrog .
memoir <unk> ' voyage , " <name> 188 , regarding <unk> , <unk> , etc .
) , it <name> be seen that the artist must have represented the land <unk> .
the most southern island in the group , namely <unk> , is not coloured , because i have found no account of it .
<unk> , or <name> <unk> , which was not visited by lutke , is described and figured by mr. <name> ( " united service journal , " <name> 1832 ) as an atoll .
all the above-mentioned islands have been coloured blue .

krusenstern speaks of some of the islands being mountainous ; the reefs are distant from the shore , and there are spaces within them , and not opposite valleys , with from ten to fifteen fathoms .
according to a ms. chart of the group by lieutenant <name> in the admiralty , there is a large space within the reef with <unk> water ; although the high land does not hold a central position with respect to the reefs , as is generally the case , i have little doubt that the reefs of the <unk> islands ought to be ranked with the barrier class , and i have coloured them pale blue .
in lieutenant <unk> chart there is a <unk> shoal , laid down thirteen miles n.w .
of <unk> , with fifteen fathoms within the reef , and some dry banks on it ; coloured dark blue.  spanish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <name> and <unk> islands are not coloured , because i know nothing about them , excepting that according to krusenstern , the second , third , and fourth mentioned , are low , placed on coral-reefs , and therefore , perhaps , contain lagoons ; but <unk> <unk> is a little higher .

almost the whole of this island is fringed by reefs , which extend in most parts about a third of a mile from the land .
even where the reefs are most extensive , the water within them is shallow .
in several parts there is a navigable channel for boats and canoes within the reefs .

these reefs project about a quarter of a mile from the shore ; coloured red.  <unk> .
the eastern coast is precipitous , and is without reefs ; but the western side is fringed like the last island ; coloured red.  <unk> .
the n.e .

the several islands which form the northern part of the group are volcanic ( with the exception perhaps of <unk> , which resembles in form the <unk> island of <unk> ) , and appear to be without <unk>  <unk> , however , is described ( by freycinet , <name> 219 , " hydrog . " )
from some spanish charts , as formed of small islands placed " au <unk> des <unk> <unk> ; " and as these reefs in the general chart of the group do not project so much as a mile ; and as there is no appearance from a double line , of the existence of deep water within , i have ventured , although with much hesitation , to colour them red .
respecting <unk> and <name> islands which lie some way east of the <unk> , i can find out nothing , excepting that they are probably low .
krusenstern says this of <name> island ; and <unk> island is written with small letters in d'urville 's chart ; uncoloured .

peel island has been examined by captain beechey , to whose kindness i am much indebted for giving me information regarding it : " at port <name> there is a great deal of <name> ; and the inner harbour is entirely formed by coral-reefs , which extend outside the port along the coast . "
captain beechey , in another part of his letter to me , alludes to the reefs fringing the island in all directions ; but at the same time it must be observed that the surf washes the volcanic rocks of the coast in the greater part of its circumference .
i do not know whether the other islands of the archipelago are fringed ; i have coloured peel island red.  grampus island to the eastward , does not appear ( <unk> 's " voyage , " <name> 95 ) to have any reefs , nor does <name> island ( from lutke 's chart ) , which lies to the westward .
respecting the few other islands in this part of the sea , namely the sulphur islands , with an active volcano , and those lying between <unk> and japan ( which are situated near the extreme limit in latitude , at which reefs are formed ) , i have not been able to find any clear account .

from the charts in the " voyage of the 'coquille ' , " it would appear that the coast in this part is fringed by coral-reefs ; m. lesson , however , remarks that the <name> is sickly ; coloured red.  <unk> .
a considerable portion of the northern shores of these islands is seen in the charts ( on a large scale ) in freycinet 's " atlas " to be fringed by coral-reefs .
<name> ( <name> 21 , " voyage to new guinea " ) alludes to the coral-reefs lining the heads of <unk> bay ; and horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> <unk> , 4th edition ) , speaking of the islands in <unk> strait , says " sharp <unk> line their shores ; " coloured red.  in the sea north of these islands , we have <unk> ( or <unk> , or st. <name> 's ) , which from the chart given in the 4to edition of <unk> 's " voyage , " must be an atoll .
krusenstern says the islets are very low ; coloured blue.  <unk> 's shoals , in 2 deg 53 ' n. , are described as circular , with stony points showing all round , with deeper water in the middle ; coloured blue.  <unk> ; the plan of this group , given in the " atlas of the voyage of the 'astrolabe ' , " shows that it is an atoll ; and , from a chart in <name> 's " voyage , " it appears that there is twelve fathoms within the circular reef ; coloured blue.  the s.w .
coast of new guinea appears to be low , muddy , and devoid of reefs .
the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> groups have lately been examined by captain <unk> , the ms. translation of which , by mr. w. <name> , i have been permitted to read , through the kindness of captain washington , <unk> .
these islands are mostly rather low , and are surrounded by distant reefs ( the <unk> islands , however , are lofty , and , from mr. <name> 's survey , appear without reefs ) ; the sea in some parts is shallow , in others profoundly deep ( as near <unk> ) .
from the imperfection of the published charts , i have been unable to decide to which class these reefs belong .
from the distance to which they extend from the land , where the sea is very deep , i am strongly inclined to believe they ought to come within the barrier class , and be coloured blue ; but i have been forced to leave them <unk>  the <unk> groups are connected with the east end of <unk> by a chain of small islands , of which the small groups of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are surrounded by very extensive reefs , projecting into deep water , which , as in the last case , i strongly suspect belong to the barrier class ; but i have not coloured them .
from the south side of <unk> , the reefs project five miles ( windsor <name> 's " sailing direct .

in various charts which i have examined , several parts of the coast are represented as fringed by <unk>  <unk> island , between <unk> and <unk> , in an old ms. chart in the admiralty , is fringed by a very irregular reef , partly dry at low water , which i do not doubt is of coral-formation ; both islands coloured red.  <unk> ; parts of this island appear fringed by coral-reefs , namely , the eastern coast , as seen in freycinet 's chart ; and <unk> bay , which is said by horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 630 ) to be lined by coral-reefs , that stretch out a little way , and have only a few feet water on them .
in several charts , portions of the islands forming the <unk> group are fringed by reefs ; for instance , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in freycinet 's charts .
the above-mentioned islands have been coloured red , although the evidence is not very <unk>  north of <unk> the parallel line of the <unk> isles extends : i have not been able to find out anything about them , excepting that horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> <unk> ) says that the northern shore is surrounded by a reef at the distance of two or three miles ; <unk>  <unk> group ; the <unk> islands are said by <name> ( " voyage , " <name> 130 ) to be divided from each other by deep straits , and are lined with <unk> ; coloured red.  <unk> , lying between <unk> and <unk> , is engraved as if fringed ; and it is said by freycinet , that all the soundings under five fathoms were on <name> ; coloured red.  <unk> .
in a chart published by <unk> , the numerous islands on the western , southern ( <unk> and the strait of <unk> ) , and eastern sides appear fringed by narrow reefs ; these reefs , i suppose , are of <name> , for it is said in " <unk> <unk> " ( volume <unk> , <name> 156 ) , " sur <name> <unk> ( of <unk> ) comme dans <name> <unk> des iles de <unk> <unk> , il y a de <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
<name> , also ( <name> 50 ) , says <unk> , near <unk> , is a little island with reefs of <name> ; coloured red.  <unk> island ( north of <unk> ) .
horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> <unk> ) says the northern coast is lined by reefs , projecting one or two miles , and having no soundings close to them ; i have left it uncoloured , although , as in some former cases , it ought probably to be pale blue.  <unk> .
the western and northern coasts appear in the charts to be bold and without reefs .
near the extreme northern point , however , an islet in the straits of <unk> , and parts of the adjoining shore , appear to be fringed : the east side of the bay of <unk> , has deep water , and is fringed by sand and <name> ( " <unk> . '
voyage , " hydrog .
part , pages <unk> ) ; this extreme point , therefore , i have coloured red.  of the islands leading from this point to <unk> , i have not been able to find any account , except of <unk> , which appears surrounded by narrow reefs ; and <name> ( " voyage , " <name> 164 ) speaks of <name> on its shores ; i have , therefore , coloured this island red .
to the eastward of this chain lie several islands ; of which i can not find any account , except of <unk> , which is said by horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 504 ) to be lined by a dangerous reef , projecting several miles from the northern shore ; not coloured .
islands near timor .
the account of the following islands is taken from captain d. <unk> " voyage , " in 1825 , translated by mr. w. <name> , from the <unk>  <unk> has " reefs extending along shore at the distance of half a mile from the land . "
 <unk> has reefs on the s.w .

n.w .
coast of australia .
it appears , in captain king 's sailing directions ( " narrative of survey , " volume ii , pages <unk> ) , that there are many extensive coral-reefs skirting , often at considerable distances , the n.w .
shores , and <unk> the small adjoining islets .
deep water , in no instance , is represented in the charts between these reefs and the land ; and , therefore , they probably belong to the fringing class .
but as they extend far into the sea , which is generally shallow , even in places where the land seems to be somewhat precipitous ; i have not coloured them .
<unk> 's <unk> ( latitude 28 deg s. on west coast ) have lately been surveyed by captain <unk> ( as described in " <unk> .
mag . "
1841 , <name> 511 ) : they lie on the edge of a steeply shelving bank , which extends about thirty miles seaward , along the whole line of coast .
the two southern reefs , or islands , enclose a <unk> space of water , varying in depth from five to fifteen fathoms , and in one spot with twenty-three fathoms .
the greater part of the island has been formed on their inland sides , by the accumulation of fragments of <name> ; the seaward face consisting of nearly bare ledges of rock .
some of the specimens , brought home by captain <unk> , contained fragments of <name> shells , but others did not ; and these closely resembled a formation at king <name> 's sound , principally due to the action of the wind on calcareous dust , which i shall describe in a forthcoming part .
from the extreme irregularity of these reefs with their lagoons , and from their position on a bank , the usual depth of which is only thirty fathoms , i have not ventured to class them with atolls , and hence have left them <unk>  <unk> shoals .
these lie some way from the n.w .
coast of australia : according to captain king ( " narrative of survey , " volume i. , <name> 60 ) , they are of coral-formation .
they rise abruptly from the sea , and captain king had no bottom with 170 fathoms close to them .
three of them are <unk> ; they are mentioned by mr. lyell , on the authority of captain king , with reference to the direction of their open sides .
" a third oval reef of the same group is entirely submerged " ( " principles of geology , " book iii .
chapter xviii .
) ; coloured blue.  <name> 's reefs , lying north of <unk> shoals , are briefly described by captain <unk> ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1841 , <name> 440 ) : they appear to be of great size , of a circular form , and " with smooth water within , forming probably a lagoon of great extent . "
there is a break on the western side , where there probably is an entrance : the water is very deep off these reefs ; coloured blue .
proceeding westward along the great volcanic chain of the east indian archipelago , <unk> strait is represented in a chart published by <unk> from a dutch ms. , as fringed ; as are parts of <unk> , of <unk> , and of <unk> .
horsburgh speaks of <name> growing on these shores ; and therefore i have no doubt that the reefs are of <name> , and accordingly have coloured them red .
we hear from horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> <unk> ) that a <unk> bounds the shores of <unk> bay .
from the same authority it appears ( <name> <unk> ) that reefs fringe the island of <unk> , on the n. shore of <unk> ; and , likewise ( <name> 600 ) , that <unk> town in <unk> , is fronted by a reef , stretching along the shore at a distance of a hundred fathoms , with channels through it for boats ; these places , therefore , have been coloured red.  <unk> island .
in a dutch ms. chart on a large scale of java , which was brought from that island by dr. <unk> , who had the kindness to show it me at the <name> house , its western , northern , and southern shores appear very regularly fringed by a reef ( see also horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> <unk> ) ; and as <name> is found abundantly there , i have not the least doubt that the reef is of <name> , and therefore have coloured it red .
java .
my information regarding the reefs of this great island is derived from the chart just mentioned .
the greater part of <unk> is represented in it as regularly fringed , and likewise portions of the coast of java immediately south of it .
dr. <unk> informs me that <name> is very abundant near <unk> .
the islets and parts of the n. coast of java , west of point <unk> , or <unk> , are fringed by reefs , said to be of <name> .
<unk> , or <unk> islands , lying at some distance from the shore of java , are regularly fringed by coral-reefs .
<unk> java appears equally so , though it is not directly said that the reefs are of <name> ; there is a depth between thirty and forty fathoms round these islands .
parts of the shores of <unk> strait , where the water is from forty to eighty fathoms deep , and the islets near <unk> appear in several charts to be fringed .
in the dutch chart the southern shore , in the narrowest part of the island , is in two places fringed by reefs of <name> .
west of <unk> bay , and the extreme s.e .
and e. portions are likewise fringed by coral-reefs ; all the above-mentioned places coloured red .
<unk> strait .
the east coast of borneo appears , in most parts , free from reefs , and where they occur , as on the east coast of <unk> , the sea is very shallow ; hence no part is coloured .
in <unk> strait itself , in about latitude 2 deg s. , there are many small islands with <unk> projecting far from them .
there are also ( old charts by <unk> ) numerous little flats of <name> , not rising to the surface of the water , and shelving suddenly from five fathoms to no bottom with fifty fathoms ; they do not appear to have a <unk> structure .
there are similar <unk> a little farther south ; and in latitude 4 deg 55 ' there are two , which are engraved from modern surveys , in a manner which might represent an annular reef with deep water inside : captain moresby , however , who was formerly in this sea , doubts this fact , so that i have left them uncoloured : at the same time i may remark , that these two shoals make a nearer approach to the <unk> structure than any other within the e. indian archipelago .
southward of these shoals there are other low islands and irregular coral-reefs ; and in the space of sea , north of the great volcanic chain , from timor to java , we have also other islands , such as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. , which are chiefly low , and are surrounded by very irregular and distant reefs .
from the imperfect charts i have seen , i have not been able to decide whether they belong to the atoll or <unk> , or whether they merely fringe submarine banks , and gently sloping land .
in the bay of <unk> , between the two southern arms of <unk> , there are numerous <name> reefs ; but none of them seem to have an <unk> structure .
i have , therefore , not coloured any of the islands in this part of the sea ; i think it , however , exceedingly probable that some of them ought to be blue .
i may add that there is a harbour on the s.e .
coast of <unk> which , according to an old chart , is formed by a reef , parallel to the shore , with deep water within ; and in the " voyage of the 'coquille ' , " some neighbouring islands are represented with reefs a good way distant , but i do not know whether with deep water within .
i have not thought the evidence sufficient to permit me to colour them .
sumatra .
commencing with the west coast and outlying islands , <unk> island is represented in the published chart as surrounded by a narrow reef , and <unk> , in his " sailing directions , " speaks of the reef being of <name> ( also horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 115 ) ; coloured red.  rat island ( 3 deg 51 ' s. ) is surrounded by reefs of <name> , partly dry at low water , ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 96 ) .  <unk> island ( 4 deg 2 ' s. ) .
the shore is represented in a chart which i saw at the <name> house , as fringed in such a manner , that i feel sure the fringe consists of <name> ; but as the island is so low , that the sea sometimes flows quite over it ( <unk> , " voyage , " volume i. , <name> <unk> ) , i have not coloured it.  <unk> <unk> ( latitude 3 deg ) .
in an old chart it is said there are chasms in the reefs round the island , admitting boats to the <unk> , and that the southern islet consists of a mass of sand and <unk>  <unk> <unk> ; horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 86 ) says that the <name> <unk> , which stretches about forty yards from the shore , is steep to all round : in a chart , also , which i have seen , the island is represented as regularly <unk>  <unk> <unk> is lined with reefs on its west side ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 107 ) .  <unk> <unk> ; the same authority ( volume ii. , <name> 105 ) , speaking of a part , says it is faced with <unk>  <unk> ( 3 deg 36 ' n. ) .
a coral-reef fronts this place , and projects into the sea nearly a quarter of a mile ( " notices of the indian arch . "
published at singapore , <name> 105 ) .  <unk> <unk> ( 5 deg 46 ' n. ) .
a reef surrounds it at a cable 's length ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 60 ) .
i have coloured all the above-specified points red .
i may here add , that both horsburgh and mr. moor ( in the " notices " just alluded to ) frequently speak of the numerous reefs and banks of <name> on the west coast of sumatra ; but these nowhere have the structure of a barrier-reef , and <unk> ( " history of sumatra " ) states , that where the coast is flat , the fringing-reefs extend furthest from it .
the northern and southern points , and the greater part of the east coast , are low , and faced with mud banks , and therefore without <name> .
<unk> islands .
the chart represents the islands of this group as fringed by reefs .
with regard to great <unk> , captain moresby informs me , that it is fringed by reefs of <name> , extending between two and three hundred yards from the shore .
the northern <unk> appear so regularly fringed in the published charts , that i have no doubt the reefs are of <name> .
this group , therefore , is coloured red .
<unk> islands .
from an examination of the ms. chart , on a large scale , of this island , by captain arch .
<name> , in the admiralty , several portions of the coast appear fringed ; and as horsburgh speaks of coral-reefs being numerous in the vicinity of these islands , i should have coloured them red , had not some expressions in a paper in the " asiatic researches " ( volume iv. , <name> 402 ) led me to doubt the existence of reefs ; uncoloured .
the coast of malacca , <unk> and the coasts northward , appear in the greater part to be low and muddy : where reefs occur , as in parts of malacca straits , and near singapore , they are of the fringing kind ; but the water is so shoal , that i have not coloured them .
in the sea , however , between malacca and the west coast of borneo , where there is a greater depth from forty to fifty fathoms , i have coloured red some of the groups , which are regularly fringed .
the northern <unk> and the <unk> islands are represented in the charts on a large scale , published in the " atlas of the voyage of the <unk> ' , " as fringed by reefs of <name> , with very shoal water within them.  <unk> and <unk> islands ( 1 deg n. ) are represented in the english charts as surrounded by a very regular <unk>  st. <unk> ( 0 deg 15 ' n. ) is said by horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 279 ) to be fronted by a reef , over which boats can land only at high <unk>  the shore of borneo at <unk> <unk> is also fronted by a reef , extending not far from the land ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 468 ) .
these places i have coloured red ; although with some hesitation , as the water is shallow .
i might perhaps have added <unk> <unk> , in <unk> strait , <unk> , and <unk> ; but as the sea is confined and shallow , and the reefs not very regular , i have left them uncoloured .
the water shoals gradually towards the whole west coast of borneo : i can not make out that it has any reefs of <name> .
the islands , however , off the northern extremity , and near the s.w .
end of <unk> , are fringed by very distant coral-reefs ; thus the reefs in the case of <unk> are no less than five miles from the land ; but the sea , in the whole of this district , is so shallow , that the reefs might be expected to extend very far from the land .
i have not , therefore , thought myself <unk> to colour them .
the n.e .
point of borneo , where the water is very shoal , is connected with <unk> by a chain of islands called the <unk> archipelago , about which i have been able to obtain very little information ; <unk> , although ten miles long , entirely consists of a bed of coral-rock ( " notices of e. indian arch . "
<name> 58 ) : i believe from horsburgh that the island is low ; not <unk>  <unk> bank , in some old charts , appears like a submerged atoll ; not coloured .
<name> ( " voyage , " <name> 21 ) states that one of the islands near <unk> is surrounded by <unk> ; but there is no distant reef .
near the s. end of <unk> , some of the islets in the chart accompanying <name> 's " voyage , " appear fringed with reefs ; hence i have coloured , though unwillingly , parts of the <unk> group red .
the sea between <unk> and <unk> , near the shoal coast of borneo , is interspersed with irregular reefs and shoal patches ; not coloured : but in the northern part of this sea , there are two low islets , <unk> and <unk> , surrounded by extensive coral-reefs ; the breakers round the latter ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 513 ) extend five or six miles from a <unk> , which forms the only dry part ; these breakers are steep to outside ; there appears to be an opening through them on one side , with four or five fathoms within : from this description , i strongly suspect that <unk> ought to be considered an atoll ; but , as i have not seen any chart of it , on even a moderately large scale , i have not coloured it .
the islets off the northern end of <unk> , are in the same case as those off the southern end , namely they are fringed by reefs , some way distant from the shore , but the water is exceedingly shallow ; uncoloured .
the western shore of <unk> <name> be treated of under the head of <name> sea .
philippine archipelago .
a chart on a large scale of <unk> shoal , which lies near the s.e .
coast of <unk> , has been executed by captain d. <name> : it appears atoll-formed , but with rather an irregular outline ; its diameter is about ten miles ; there are two well-defined passages leading into the interior lagoon , which appears open ; close outside the reef all round , there is no bottom with seventy fathoms ; coloured blue.  <unk> : the n.w .
coast is represented in several charts , as fringed by a reef , and <unk> island is said , by horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 436 ) , to be " lined by a reef . "
 luzon : mr. cuming , who has lately investigated with so much success the natural history of the philippines , informs me , that about three miles of the shore north of point st. jago , is fringed by a reef ; as are ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 437 ) the three friars off <unk> bay .
between point <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the coast is " lined by a coral-reef , stretching out nearly a mile in some places , " ( horsburgh ) ; and mr. cuming visited some fringing reefs on parts of this coast , namely , near <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
in the neighbourhood of <unk> bay , the shore is lined ( horsburgh ii. , <name> 439 ) by coral-reefs , stretching out a great way : there are also reefs about the islets off <unk> ; and as i am informed by mr. cuming , near st. <name> , and a little north of it .
the same gentleman informs me there are reefs on the s.e .
point of this island in front of <unk> , extending from <unk> to <unk> .
these appear to be the principal fringing-reefs on the coasts of luzon ; and they have all been coloured red .
mr. cuming informs me that none of them have deep water within ; although it appears from horsburgh that some few extend to a considerable distance from the shore .
within the philippine archipelago , the shores of the islands do not appear to be commonly fringed , with the exception of the s. shore of <unk> , and nearly the whole of <unk> ; which are both coloured red .
on the s. shore of <unk> , <unk> island is surrounded ( according to <name> , " voyage , " <name> 253 ) , by a coral-reef , which in the chart appears one of the fringing class .
with respect to the eastern coasts of the whole archipelago , i have not been able to obtain any account .
<unk> islands .
horsburgh says ( volume ii. , <name> 442 ) , coral-reefs line the shores of the harbour in <unk> ; and the charts show there are other reefs about these islands .
<unk> has its shore in parts lined by coral-rock ( horsburgh , <name> 443 ) ; about a mile off shore there is between thirty and thirty-five fathoms .
the plan of port san <unk> <unk> shows that its shores are fringed with <name> ; coloured red.  <unk> islands : horsburgh , speaking of the southern part of the group ( volume ii. , <name> 445 ) says the shores of both islands are fortified by a reef , and through some of the gaps in it , the natives can pass in their boats in fine weather ; the bottom near the land is coral-rock .
from the published charts , it is evident that several of these islands are most regularly fringed ; coloured red .
the northern islands are left uncoloured , as i have been unable to find any account of them.  <unk> .
the shores , especially the western one , seem chiefly composed of mud and sand , and i can not make out that they are anywhere lined by reefs ; except in a harbour ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 449 ) at the extreme northern point : hence , of course , the whole of this island is left uncoloured .
the small adjoining islands are in the same <unk>  <unk> , or <unk> groups .
<unk> has been described by captain <unk> ( " <unk> .
to the n. pacific , " <name> 191 ) ; he says , the boats , with some difficulty , found a passage through the coral-reefs , which extend along the coast , nearly half a mile off it .
the boats were well sheltered within the reef ; but it does not appear that the water is deep there .
outside the reef the depth is very irregular , varying from five to fifty fathoms ; the form of the land is not very abrupt ; coloured red.  <unk> san ; from the description given ( <name> 195 ) by the same author , it appears that a very irregular reef extends , to the distance of several miles , from the southern island ; but whether it <unk> a space of deep water is not evident ; nor , indeed , whether these outlying reefs are connected with those more immediately adjoining the land ; left uncoloured .
i may here just add that the shore of <unk> ( lying west of <unk> ) , has a narrow reef attached to it in the plan of it , in la <unk> 's " atlas ; " but it does not appear in the account of the voyage that it is of <name> ; <unk>  loo <unk> .
the greater part of the coast of this moderately hilly island , is skirted by reefs , which do not extend far from the shore , and which do not leave a channel of deep water within them , as may be seen in the charts accompanying captain b .
hall 's voyage to loo <unk> ( see also remarks in appendix , pages xxi .
and xxv . ) .
there are , however , some ports with deep water , formed by reefs in front of valleys , in the same manner as happens at mauritius .
captain beechey , in a letter to me , compares these reefs with those encircling the society islands ; but there appears to me a marked difference between them , in the less distance at which the loo <unk> reefs lie from the land with relation to the probable submarine inclination , and in the absence of an interior deep <unk> or channel , parallel to the land .
hence , i have classed these reefs with fringing-reefs , and coloured them red.  <unk> ( west of <unk> ) .
<unk> ( volume i. , <name> 416 ) , has compared the appearance of the land to the southern parts of england .
the islands are interlaced with coral-reefs ; but as the water is very shoal , and as spits of sand and gravel ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 450 ) extend far out from them , it is impossible to draw any inferences regarding the nature of the reefs .
<name> sea.  proceeding from north to south , we first meet the <unk> shoal ( latitude 20 deg n. ) which , according to horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 335 ) , is composed of <name> , is of a circular form , and has a low islet on it .
the reef is on a level with the water 's edge , and when the sea runs high , there are breakers mostly all round , " but the water within seems pretty deep in some places ; although <unk> in most parts outside , there appear to be several parts where a ship might find anchorage outside the breakers ; " coloured blue.  the <unk> have been accurately surveyed by captain d. <name> , and charts on a large scale published : but few low islets have been formed on these shoals , and this seems to be a general circumstance in the <name> sea ; the sea close outside the reefs is very deep ; several of them have a <unk> structure ; or separate islets ( <unk> , <name> , <unk> , etc . )
are so arranged round a moderately shallow space , as to appear as if they had once formed one large <unk>  bombay shoal ( one of the <unk> ) has the form of an annular reef , and is " apparently deep within ; " it seems to have an entrance ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 332 ) on its west side ; it is very steep <unk>  discovery shoal , also is of an oval form , with a <unk> space within , and three openings leading into it , in which there is a depth from two to twenty fathoms .
outside , at the distance ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 333 ) of only twenty yards from the reef , soundings could not be obtained .
the <unk> are coloured blue.  <unk> bank : this is a <unk> of great size , lying east of the <unk> ; some parts of the bank are level , with a <name> bottom , but , generally , the depth is very irregular .
it is intersected by deep cuts or channels .
i am not able to perceive in the published charts ( its limits , however , are not very accurately known ) whether the central part is deeper , which i suspect is the case , as in the great chagos bank , in the indian ocean ; not <unk>  <unk> shoal : this <unk> is engraved with a double row of crosses , forming a circle , as if there was deep water within the reef : close outside there was no bottom , with a hundred fathoms ; coloured blue.  the sea off the west coast of <unk> and the northern part of borneo is strewed with shoals : swallow shoal , according to horsburgh ( volume ii. , <name> 431 ) " is formed , like most of the shoals hereabouts , of a belt of <unk> , " with a basin of deep water within . "
 <unk> shoal has a similar structure ; captain d. <name> describes it , as a narrow belt of coral-rock , " with a basin of deep water in the centre , " and deep sea close <unk>  bombay shoal appears ( horsburgh , volume ii. , <name> 432 ) " to be a basin of smooth water surrounded by breakers . "
these three shoals i have coloured blue.  the <unk> shoals are of a circular form , with deep gaps running through them ; not <unk>  a bank gradually <unk> to the depth of thirty fathoms , extends to a distance of about twenty miles from the northern part of borneo , and to thirty miles from the northern part of <unk> .
near the land this bank appears tolerably free from danger , but a little further out it is thickly studded with <unk> , which do not generally rise quite to the surface ; some of them are very <unk> , and others have a fringe of <unk> round them .
i should have thought that these shoals had level surfaces , had it not been for the statement made by horsburgh " that most of the shoals hereabouts are formed of a belt of <name> . "
but , perhaps that expression was more particularly applied to the shoals further in the offing .
if these reefs of <name> have a <unk> structure , they should have been coloured blue , and they would have formed an imperfect barrier in front of <unk> and the northern part of borneo .
but , as the water is not very deep , these reefs may have grown up from inequalities on the bank : i have not coloured them.  the coast of <name> , <unk> , and <unk> , forming the western boundary of the <name> sea , appear to be without reefs : with regard to the two <unk> coasts , i speak after examining the charts on a large scale in the " atlas of the voyage of the <unk> ' . "
indian ocean .
south keeling atoll has been specially described .
nine miles north of it lies north keeling , a very small atoll , surveyed by the " beagle , " the lagoon of which is dry at low <unk>  christmas island , lying to the east , is a high island , without , as i have been informed by a person who passed it , any reefs at <unk>  ceylon : a space about eighty miles in length of the south-western and southern shores of these islands has been described by mr. <unk> ( " <unk> .
mag . "
1836 , pages 365 and 518 ) ; parts of this space appear to be very regularly fringed by coral-reefs , which extend from a quarter to half a mile from the shore .
these reefs are in places breached , and afford safe anchorage for the small trading craft .
outside , the sea gradually <unk> ; there is forty fathoms about six miles off shore : this part i have coloured red .
in the published charts of ceylon there appear to be fringing-reefs in several parts of the south-eastern shores , which i have also coloured red.  at <unk> bay the shore is likewise fringed .
north of <unk> there are also reefs of the same kind .
the sea off the northern part of ceylon is exceedingly shallow ; and therefore i have not coloured the reefs which fringe portions of its shores , and the adjoining islets , as well as the indian promontory of <unk> .
chagos , maldiva , and <unk> archipelagoes .
these three great groups which have already been often noticed , are now well-known from the admirable surveys of captain moresby and lieutenant powell .
the published charts , which are worthy of the most attentive examination , at once show that the chagos and maldiva groups are entirely formed of great atolls , or <unk> reefs , surmounted by islets .
in the <unk> group , this structure is less evident ; the islets are low , not exceeding the usual height of <unk> ( see lieutenant <unk> account , " geographical journal " , volume vi. , <name> 29 ) , and most of the reefs are circular , as may be seen in the published charts ; and within several of them , as i am informed by captain moresby , there is <unk> water ; these , therefore , have been coloured blue .
directly north , and almost forming part of this group , there is a long , narrow , slightly curved bank , rising out of the depths of the ocean , composed of sand , shells , and decayed <name> , with from twenty-three to thirty fathoms on it .
i have no doubt that it has had the same origin with the other <unk> banks ; but as it does not deepen towards the centre i have not coloured it .
i might have referred to other authorities regarding these three archipelagoes ; but after the publication of the charts by captain moresby , to whose personal kindness in giving me much information i am exceedingly indebted , it would have been superfluous .
<unk> de <unk> bank consists of a series of narrow banks , with from eight to sixteen fathoms on them ; they are arranged in a semicircular manner , round a space about forty fathoms deep , which slopes on the s.e .
quarter to unfathomable depths ; they are <unk> on both sides , but more especially on the <unk> .
hence this bank closely resembles in structure , and i may add from captain moresby 's information in composition , the pitt 's bank in the chagos group ; and the pitt 's bank , must , after what has been shown of the great chagos bank , be considered as a sunken , <unk> atoll ; hence coloured blue.  <unk> <unk> bank .
its southern portion consists of a large , curved , <unk> , with some low islets on its eastern edge , and likewise some on the western side , between which there is a depth of about twelve fathoms .
northward , a great bank extends .
i can not ( probably owing to the want of perfect charts ) refer this reef and bank to any class ;  therefore not <unk>  <unk> de sable is a little island , lying west of c. <unk> , only some <unk> in height ( " voyage of the <unk> ' , " volume i. , <name> 130 ) ; it is surrounded by reefs ; but its structure is unintelligible to me .
there are some small banks north of it , of which i can find no clear <unk>  mauritius .
the reefs round this island have been described in the chapter on fringing-reefs ; coloured red .
 <unk> .
the coral-reefs here are exceedingly extensive ; in one part they project even five miles from the shore .
as far as i can make out , there is no deep-water moat within them ; and the sea outside does not deepen very suddenly .
the outline , however , of the land appears to be ( " life of sir j. <unk> , " volume ii. , <name> 165 ) hilly and rugged .
i am unable to decide whether these reefs belong to the barrier class ; as seems probable from their great extension , or to the fringing class ; uncoloured .
 bourbon .
the greater part of the shores of this island are without reefs ; but captain <unk> ( hooker 's " bot .
<unk> . " )
states that a portion , fifteen miles in length , on the s.e .
side , is imperfectly fringed with <name> reefs : i have not thought this sufficient to colour the island .
<unk> .
the <name> islands of primary formation , composing this group , rise from a very extensive and tolerably level bank , having a depth between twenty and forty fathoms .
in captain <name> 's chart , and in that in the " atlas of the voyage of the <unk> ' , " it appears that the east side of <unk> and the adjoining islands of st. <name> and <unk> , are regularly fringed by coral-reefs .
a portion of the s.e .
part of <unk> island , the n. , and part of the s.w .
shore of <unk> island , and the whole west side of <unk> island , appear fringed .
from a ms. account of these islands by captain f. moresby , in the admiralty , it appears that <unk> is also fringed ; he states that all these islands are formed of granite and quartz , that they rise abruptly from the sea , and that " coral-reefs have grown round them , and project for some distance . "
dr. <name> , of <unk> , who visited these islands , informs me that there is no deep water between the reefs and the shore .
the above specified points have been coloured red .
<unk> islands : the small islands of this neighbouring group , according to the ms. account of them by captain f. moresby , are situated on an extensive bank ; they consist of the debris of corals and shells ; are only about twenty feet in height , and are <unk> by reefs , some attached to the shore , and some rather distant from it.  i have taken great pains to procure plans and information regarding the several islands lying between s.e .
and s.w .
of the <unk> , and the <unk> ; relying chiefly on captain f. moresby and dr. <name> , it appears that the greater number , namely  platte , <name> , <unk> , <unk> , providence , st. <name> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are low , formed of sand or coral-rock , and irregularly shaped ; they are situated on very extensive banks , and are connected with great coral-reefs .
<unk> is said by dr. <name> , to be rather higher than the other islands ; and st. <name> is described by captain f. moresby , as being cavernous throughout , and as not consisting of either limestone or granite .
these islands , as well as the <unk> , certainly are not atoll-formed , and they differ as a group from every other group with which i am acquainted ; i have not coloured them ; but probably the reefs belong to the fringing class .
their formation is attributed , both by dr. <name> and captain f. moresby , to the action of the currents , here exceedingly violent , on banks , which no doubt have had an independent geological origin .
they resemble in many respects some islands and banks in the west indies , which owe their origin to a similar agency , in conjunction with an elevation of the entire area .
in close vicinity to the several islands , there are three others of an apparently different nature : first , <name> de <name> , which appears from some plans and accounts to be an atoll ; but from others does not appear to be so ; not coloured .
secondly <unk> ; " this group consists of a ring of <name> , ten leagues in circumference , and a quarter of a mile broad in some places , enclosing a magnificent lagoon , into which there did not appear a single opening " ( horsburgh , volume i. , <name> 151 ) ; coloured blue .
thirdly , <unk> ; it consists of three islets , about twenty-five feet in height , with red cliffs ( horsburgh , volume i. , <name> 176 ) surrounding a very shallow basin or lagoon .
the sea is profoundly deep close to the shore .
viewing this island in a chart , it would be thought an atoll ; but the foregoing description shows that there is something different in its nature ; dr. <name> also states that it is cavernous , and that the coral-rock has a <unk> appearance .
is it an upheaved atoll , or the crater of a volcano ?  uncoloured .
<unk> group .
<unk> , according to horsburgh ( volume i. , <name> 216 , 4th edition ) , is completely surrounded by a reef , which runs at the distance of three , four , and in some places even five miles from the land ; in an old chart , published by <unk> , a depth in many places of thirty-six and thirty-eight fathoms is laid down within the reef .
in the same chart , the space of open water within the reef in some parts is even more than three miles wide : the land is bold and peaked ; this island , therefore , is encircled by a <unk> barrier-reef , and is coloured pale blue.  <name> ; horsburgh says ( volume i. <name> 217 ) this island from the n.w .
to the s.w .
point , is bounded by a reef , at the distance of two miles from the shore ; in some parts , however , the reef must be attached , since lieutenant <unk> ( " <unk> . "
volume i. , <name> 161 ) describes a passage through it , within which there is room only for a few boats .
its height , as i am informed by dr. <name> , is about <unk> feet ; it is very precipitous , and is composed of granite , greenstone , and quartz ; coloured blue.  <unk> ; on the s. side of this island there is anchorage , in from thirty to forty-five fathoms , between a reef and the shore ( horsburgh , volume i. , <name> 214 ) ; in captain <name> 's chart of madagascar , this island is represented as encircled ; coloured blue.  great <unk> island is , as i am informed by dr. <name> , about <unk> feet high , and apparently volcanic ; it is not regularly encircled ; but reefs of various shapes and dimensions , <unk> out from every headland on the w. , s. , and s.e .
coasts , inside of which reefs there are channels , often parallel with the shore , with deep water .
on the north-western coasts the reefs appear attached to the shores .
the land near the coast is in some places bold , but generally speaking it is flat ; horsburgh says ( volume i. , <name> 214 ) the water is profoundly deep close to the shore , from which expression i presume some parts are without reefs .
from this description i apprehend the reef belongs to the barrier class ; but i have not coloured it , as most of the charts which i have seen , represent the reefs round it as very much less extensive than round the other islands in the group .
madagascar .
my information is chiefly derived from the published charts by captain <name> , and the accounts given by him and by lieutenant <unk> .
commencing at the s.w .
extremity of the island ; towards the northern part of the <name> bank ( in latitude 25 deg s. ) the coast for ten miles is fringed by a reef ; coloured red .
the shore immediately s. of st. <name> 's bay appears fringed ; but <unk> harbour , directly n. of it , is formed by a narrow reef ten miles long , extending parallel to the shore , with from four to ten fathoms within it .
if this reef had been more extensive , it must have been classed as a barrier-reef ; but as the line of coast falls inwards here , a submarine bank perhaps extends parallel to the shore , which has offered a foundation for the growth of the <name> ; i have left this part uncoloured .
from latitude 22 deg 16 ' to 21 deg 37 ' , the shore is fringed by coral-reefs ( see lieutenant <unk> 's " narrative , " volume ii. , <name> 106 ) , less than a mile in width , and with shallow water within .
there are outlying <unk> in several parts of the offing , with about ten fathoms between them and the shore , and the depth of the sea one mile and a half seaward , is about thirty fathoms .
the part above specified is engraved on a large scale ; and as in the charts on rather a smaller scale the same fringe of reef extends as far as latitude 33 deg 15 ' ; i have coloured the whole of this part of the coast red .
the islands of <name> de <name> ( in latitude 17 deg s. ) appear in the charts on a large scale to be fringed , but i have not been able to ascertain whether the reefs are of <name> ; uncoloured .
the main part of the west coast appears to be low , with outlying <unk> , which , lieutenant <unk> ( volume ii. , <name> 106 ) says , " are faced on the edge of deep water by a line of <unk> <unk> . "
nevertheless i have not coloured this part , as i can not make out by the charts that the coast itself is fringed .
the headlands of <unk> and <unk> bays ( 14 deg 40 ' ) and the islands in front of <unk> harbour are represented in the plans as regularly fringed , and have accordingly been coloured red .
with respect to the east coast of madagascar , dr. <name> informs me in a letter , that the whole line of coast , from <unk> , in 18 deg 12 ' , to c. <name> , at the extreme northern point of the island , is bordered by coral-reefs .
the land is low , uneven , and gradually rising from the coast .
from captain <name> 's charts , also , the existence of these reefs , which evidently belong to the fringing class , on some parts , namely n. of british sound , and near <unk> , of the above line of coast might have been inferred .
lieutenant <unk> ( volume i. , <name> 155 ) speaks of " the reef surrounding the island of st. <name> 's at a small distance from the shore . "
in a previous chapter i have described , from the information of dr. <name> , the manner in which the reefs extend in n.e .
lines from the headlands on this coast , thus sometimes forming rather deep channels within them , this seems caused by the action of the currents , and the reefs spring up from the submarine prolongations of the <name> headlands .
the above specified portion of the coast is coloured red .
the remaining s.e .
portions do not appear in any published chart to possess reefs of any kind ; and the rev .
w. <name> , whose means of information regarding this side of madagascar have been extensive , informs me he believes there are none .
east coast of africa .
proceeding from the northern part , the coast appears , for a considerable space , without reefs .
my information , i may here observe , is derived from the survey by captain <name> , together with his narrative ; and that by lieutenant <unk> .
at <unk> ( 10 deg 1 ' n. ) there is a coral-reef extending four or five miles along the shore ( <name> 's " <unk> . "
volume i , <name> 357 ) which in the chart lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the shore , and has within it from six to ten feet water : this then is a <unk> , and is coloured red .
from <unk> , a little s. of the equator , to <unk> ( in 2 deg 20 ' s. ) " the coast and islands are formed of <unk> " ( <name> 's " narrative , " volume i. , <name> 363 ) .
the chart of this part ( entitled <unk> islands ) , presents an extraordinary appearance ; the coast of the mainland is quite straight and it is fronted at the average distance of two miles , by exceedingly narrow , straight islets , fringed with reefs .
within the chain of islets , there are extensive tidal flats and muddy bays , into which many rivers enter ; the depths of these spaces varies from one to four fathoms  the latter depth not being common , and about twelve feet the average .
outside the chain of islets , the sea , at the distance of a mile , varies in depth from eight to fifteen fathoms .
lieutenant <unk> ( " <unk> . "
volume i. , <name> 369 ) describes the muddy bay of <unk> , which seems to resemble other parts of this coast , as fronted by small , narrow , level islets formed of decomposing <name> , the margin of which is seldom of greater height than twelve feet , overhanging the <name> surface from which the islets rise .
knowing that the islets are formed of <name> , it is , i think , scarcely possible to view the coast , and not at once conclude that we here see a <unk> , which has been upraised a few feet : the unusual depth of from two to four fathoms within some of these islets , is probably due to muddy rivers having prevented the growth of <name> near the shore .
there is , however , one difficulty on this view , namely , that before the elevation took place , which converted the reef into a chain of islets , the water must apparently have been still deeper ; on the other hand it may be supposed that the formation of a nearly perfect barrier in front , of so large an extent of coast , would cause the currents ( especially in front of the rivers ) , to deepen their muddy beds .
when describing in the chapter on fringing-reefs , those of mauritius , i have given my reasons for believing that the shoal spaces within reefs of this kind , must , in many instances , have been deepened .
however this may be , as several parts of this line of coast are undoubtedly fringed by living reefs , i have coloured it red.  <unk> ( 3 deg 20 ' s. ) .
in the plan of the harbour , the south headland appears fringed ; and in <name> 's chart on a larger scale , the reefs are seen to extend nearly thirty miles southward ; coloured red.  <unk> ( 4 deg <unk> s. ) .
the island which forms the harbour , " is surrounded by cliffs of <unk> , capable of being rendered almost impregnable " ( <name> 's " <unk> . "
volume i. , <name> 412 ) .
the shore of the mainland n. and s. of the harbour , is most regularly fringed by a coral-reef at a distance from half a mile to one mile and a quarter from the land ; within the reef the depth is from nine to fifteen feet ; outside the reef the depth at rather less than half a mile is thirty fathoms .
from the charts it appears that a space about thirty-six miles in length , is here fringed ; coloured red.  <unk> ( 5 deg s. ) is an island of coral-formation , level , and about two hundred feet in height ( <name> 's " <unk> . "
volume i. , <name> 425 ) ; it is thirty-five miles long , and is separated from the mainland by a deep sea .
the outer coast is represented in the chart as regularly fringed ; coloured red .
the mainland in front of <unk> is likewise fringed ; but there also appear to be some outlying reefs with deep water between them and the shore .
i do not understand their structure , either from the charts or the description , therefore have not coloured them.  zanzibar resembles <unk> in most respects ; its southern half on the western side and the neighbouring islets are fringed ; coloured red .
on the mainland , a little s. of zanzibar , there are some banks parallel to the coast , which i should have thought had been formed of <name> , had it not been said ( <unk> 's " <unk> . "
volume ii. , <name> 39 ) that they were composed of sand ; not <unk>  <unk> 's bank is a small island , fringed by coral-reefs ; but being only ten feet high , it has not been <unk>  <unk> is an island of the same character as <unk> ; its outer shore is fringed , and its southern extremity is connected with <unk> point on the mainland by a chain of islands fringed by reefs ; coloured red .
the four <unk> islands resemble in many respects some of the islands in the red sea , which <name> presently be <unk>  <unk> .
in a plan of the shore , a space of twenty miles n. and s. of this place is fringed by reefs , apparently of <name> : these reefs are prolonged still further southward in <name> 's general chart .
the coast in the plans of the rivers <name> and <unk> ( 9 deg 59 ' and 10 deg 7 ' s. ) has the same structure ; coloured red.  <unk> islands ( from 10 deg 40 ' to 13 deg s. ) .
a chart on a large scale is given of these islands ; they are low , and of coral-formation ( <unk> 's " <unk> . "
volume ii. , <name> 54 ) ; and generally have extensive reefs projecting from them which are dry at low water , and which on the outside rise abruptly from a deep sea : on their insides they are separated from the continent by a channel , or rather a succession of bays , with an average depth of ten fathoms .
the small headlands on the continent also have <unk> attached to them ; and the <unk> islands and banks are placed on the lines of prolongation of these headlands , and are separated from them by very shallow channels .
it is evident that whatever cause , whether the drifting of sediment or subterranean movements , produced the headlands , likewise produced , as might have been expected , submarine prolongations to them ; and these towards their outer extremities , have since afforded a favourable basis for the growth of coral-reefs , and subsequently for the formation of islets .
as these reefs clearly belong to the fringing class , the <unk> islands have been coloured red.  <unk> ( 13 deg 32 ' s. ) .
in the plan of this harbour , the headlands outside are fringed by reefs apparently of <name> ; coloured red.  <unk> ( 150 deg s. ) the outer part of the island on which the city is built , and the neighbouring islands , are fringed by coral-reefs ; coloured red .
from the description given in <name> 's " <unk> . "
( volume i. , <name> 162 ) , the shore from <unk> to <unk> bay appears to be low and <name> ; many of the shoals and islets off this line of coast are of coral-formation ; but from their small size and lowness , it is not possible , from the charts , to know whether they are truly fringed .
hence this portion of coast is left uncoloured , as are likewise those parts more northward , of which no mention has been made in the foregoing pages from the want of information .
persian gulf .
from the charts lately published on a large scale by the east <name> company , it appears that several parts , especially the southern shores of this gulf , are fringed by coral-reefs ; but as the water is very shallow , and as there are numerous <unk> , which are difficult to distinguish on the chart from reefs , i have not coloured the upper part red .
towards the mouth , however , where the water is rather deeper , the islands of <unk> and <unk> , appear so regularly fringed , that i have coloured them red .
there are certainly no atolls in the persian gulf .
the shores of <unk> , and of the promontory forming the southern headland of the persian gulf , seem to be without reefs .
the whole s.w .
part ( except one or two small patches ) of arabia <name> , and the shores of <unk> appear from the charts and memoir of captain <unk> ( " geographical journal , " 1839 , <name> 125 ) to be without any reefs .
i believe there are no extensive coral-reefs on any part of the coasts of <name> , except on the low promontory of <unk> ( as already mentioned ) in front of ceylon .
red sea .
my information is chiefly derived from the admirable charts published by the east <name> company in 1836 , from personal communication with captain moresby , one of the <unk> , and from the excellent memoir , " uber die natur der <unk> des <unk> <unk> , " by ehrenberg .
the plains immediately bordering the red sea seem chiefly to consist of a sedimentary formation of the newer tertiary period .
the shore is , with the exception of a few parts , fringed by coral-reefs .
the water is generally profoundly deep close to the shore ; but this fact , which has attracted the attention of most voyagers , seems to have no necessary connection with the presence of reefs ; for captain moresby particularly observed to me , that , in latitude 24 deg 10 ' on the eastern side , there is a piece of coast , with very deep water close to it , without any reefs , but not differing in other respects from the usual nature of the <unk> .
the most remarkable feature in the red sea is the chain of submerged banks , reefs , and islands , lying some way from the shore , chiefly on the eastern side ; the space within being deep enough to admit a safe navigation in small vessels .
the banks are generally of an oval form , and some miles in width ; but some of them are very long in proportion to their width .
captain moresby informs me that any one , who had not made actual plans of them , would be apt to think that they were much more elongated than they really are .
many of them rise to the surface , but the greater number lie from five to thirty fathoms beneath it , with irregular soundings on them .
they consist of sand and living <name> ; <name> on most of them , according to captain moresby , covering the greater part of their surface .
they extend parallel to the shore , and they are not unfrequently connected in their middle parts by short transverse banks with the mainland .
the sea is generally profoundly deep quite close to them , as it is near most parts of the coast of the mainland ; but this is not universally the case , for between latitude 15 deg and 17 deg the water <unk> quite gradually from the banks , both on the eastern and western shores , towards the middle of the sea .
islands in many parts arise from these banks ; they are low , flat-topped , and consist of the same horizontally stratified formation with that forming the <unk> margin of the mainland .
some of the smaller and lower islands consist of mere sand .
captain moresby informs me , that small masses of rock , the remnants of islands , are left on many banks where there is now no dry land .
ehrenberg also asserts that most of the islets , even the lowest , have a flat abraded basis , composed of the same tertiary formation : he believes that as soon as the surf wears down the protuberant parts of a bank , just beneath the level of the sea , the surface becomes protected from further <unk> by the growth of <name> , and he thus accounts for the existence of so many banks standing on a level with the surface of this sea .
it appears that most of the islands are certainly decreasing in size .
the form of the banks and islands is most singular in the part just referred to , namely , from latitude 15 deg to 17 deg , where the sea <unk> quite gradually : the <unk> group , on the western coast , is surrounded by an intricate archipelago of islets and shoals ; the main island is very irregularly shaped , and it includes a bay seven miles long , by four across , in which no bottom was found with 252 feet : there is only one entrance into this bay , half a mile wide , and with an island in front of it .
the submerged banks on the eastern coast , within the same latitudes , round <unk> island , are , likewise , penetrated by many narrow creeks of deep water ; one is twelve miles long , in the form of a hatchet , in which , close to its broad upper end , soundings were not struck with 360 feet , and its entrance is only half a mile wide : in another creek of the same nature , but even with a more irregular outline , there was no bottom with 480 feet .
the island of <unk> , itself , has as singular a form as any of its surrounding banks .
the bottom of the sea round the <unk> and <unk> islands consists chiefly of sand and <unk> fragments , but , in the deep and narrow creeks , it consists of mud ; the islands themselves consist of thin , horizontally stratified , modern tertiary beds , containing but little broken <name> ( <unk> , " reise in <unk> , " band .
i. , s .
247 .
) , their shores are fringed by living coral-reefs .
from the account given by <unk> ( <unk> , s .
245 . )
of the manner in which <unk> has been rent by fissures , the opposite sides of which have been unequally elevated ( in one instance to the amount of fifty feet ) , it seems probable that its irregular form , as well as probably that of <unk> , may have been partly caused by unequal elevations ; but , considering the general form of the banks , and of the deep-water creeks , together with the composition of the land , i think their <unk> is more probably due in great part to strong currents having drifted sediment over an uneven bottom : it is almost certain that their form can not be attributed to the growth of <name> .
whatever may have been the precise origin of the <unk> and <unk> archipelagoes , the greater number of the banks on the eastern side of the red sea seem to have originated through nearly similar means .
i judge of this from their similarity in <unk> ( in proof of which i may instance a bank on the east coast in latitude 22 deg ; and although it is true that the northern banks generally have a less complicated outline ) , and from their similarity in composition , as may be observed in their upraised portions .
the depth within the banks northward of latitude 17 deg , is usually greater , and their outer sides <unk> more abruptly ( circumstances which seem to go together ) than in the <unk> and <unk> archipelagoes ; but this might easily have been caused by a difference in the action of the currents during their formation : moreover , the greater quantity of living <name> , which , according to captain moresby , exists on the northern banks , would tend to give them steeper margins .
from this account , brief and imperfect as it is , we can see that the great chain of banks on the eastern coast , and on the western side in the southern portion , differ greatly from true barrier-reefs wholly formed by the growth of <name> .
it is indeed the direct conclusion of ehrenberg ( " uber die , " etc. , pages 45 and 51 ) , that they are connected in their origin quite secondarily with the growth of <name> ; and he remarks that the islands off the coast of norway , if worn down level with the sea , and merely coated with living <name> , would present a nearly similar appearance .
i can not , however , avoid suspecting , from information given me by dr. <unk> and captain moresby , that ehrenberg has rather <unk> the influence of corals , in some places at least , on the formation of the tertiary deposits of the red sea .
the west coast of the red sea between latitude 19 deg and 22 deg .
there are , in this space , reefs , which , if i had known nothing of those in other parts of the red sea , i should unhesitatingly have considered as barrier-reefs ; and , after deliberation , i have come to the same conclusion .
one of these reefs , in 20 deg 15 ' , is twenty miles long , less than a mile in width ( but expanding at the northern end into a disc ) , slightly sinuous , and extending parallel to the mainland at the distance of five miles from it , with very deep water within ; in one spot soundings were not obtained with 205 fathoms .
some leagues further south , there is another linear reef , very narrow , ten miles long , with other small portions of reef , north and south , almost connected with it ; and within this line of reefs ( as well as outside ) the water is profoundly deep .
there are also some small linear and <unk> reefs , lying a little way out at sea .
all these reefs are covered , as i am informed by captain moresby , by living corals .
here , then , we have all the characters of reefs of the barrier class ; and in some outlying reefs we have an approach to the structure of atolls .
the source of my doubts about the classification of these reefs , arises from having observed in the <unk> and <unk> groups the narrowness and <unk> of several spits of sand and rock : one of these spits in the <unk> group is nearly fifteen miles long , only two broad , and it is bordered on each side with deep water ; so that , if worn down by the surf , and coated with living corals , it would form a reef nearly similar to those within the space under consideration .
there is , also , in this space ( latitude 21 deg ) a peninsula , bordered by cliffs , with its extremity worn down to the level of the sea , and its basis fringed with reefs : in the line of prolongation of this peninsula , there lies the island of <unk> ( formed , according to captain moresby , of the usual tertiary deposit ) , and some smaller islands , large parts of which likewise appear to have been worn down , and are now coated with living corals .
if the removal of the strata in these several cases had been more complete , the reefs thus formed would have nearly resembled those <unk> ones now under discussion .
notwithstanding these facts , i can not persuade myself that the many very small , isolated , and <unk> reefs and others , long , nearly straight , and very narrow , with the water <unk> deep close round them , could possibly have been formed by corals merely coating banks of sediment , or the abraded surfaces of irregularly shaped islands .
i feel compelled to believe that the foundations of these reefs have subsided , and that the corals , during their upward growth , have given to these reefs their present forms : i may remark that the subsidence of narrow and <unk> <unk> and islands , such as those existing on the coasts of the red sea , would afford the requisite foundations for the reefs in question .
the west coast from latitude 22 deg to 24 deg .
this part of the coast ( north of the space coloured blue on the map ) is fronted by an irregularly shelving bank , from about ten to thirty fathoms deep ; numerous little reefs , some of which have the most singular shapes , rise from this bank .
it may be observed , respecting one of them , in latitude 23 deg 10 ' , that if the promontory in latitude 24 deg were worn down to the level of the sea , and coated with corals , a very similar and <unk> formed reef would be produced .
many of the reefs on this part of the coast may thus have originated ; but there are some <unk> , and almost atoll-formed reefs lying in deep water off the promontory in latitude 24 deg , which lead me to suppose that all these reefs are more probably allied to the barrier or atoll classes .
i have not , however , ventured to colour this portion of coast .
on the west coast from latitude 19 deg to 17 deg ( south of space coloured blue on the map ) , there are many low islets of very small dimensions , not much elongated , and rising out of great depths at a distance from the coast ; these can not be classed either with atolls , or barrier or fringing-reefs .
i may here remark that the outlying reefs on the west coast , between latitude 19 deg and 24 deg , are the only ones in the red sea , which approach in structure to the true atolls of the indian and pacific oceans , but they present only imperfect miniature <unk> of them .
eastern coast .
i have felt the greatest doubt about colouring any portion of this coast , north of the fringing-reefs round the <unk> islands in 16 deg 10 ' .
there are many small outlying coral-reefs along the whole line of coast ; but as the greater number rise from banks not very deeply submerged ( the formation of which has been shown to be only secondarily connected with the growth of <name> ) , their origin may be due simply to the growth of knolls of corals , from an irregular foundation situated within a limited depth .
but between latitude 18 deg and 20 deg , there are so many linear , elliptic , and extremely small reefs , rising abruptly out of profound depths , that the same reasons , which led me to colour blue a portion of the west coast , have induced me to do the same in this part .
there exist some small outlying reefs rising from deep water , north of latitude 20 deg ( the northern limit coloured blue ) , on the east coast ; but as they are not very numerous and scarcely any of them linear , i have thought it right to leave them uncoloured .
in the southern parts of the red sea , considerable spaces of the mainland , and of some of the <unk> islands , are skirted by reefs , which , as i am informed by captain moresby , are of living <name> , and have all the characters of the fringing class .
as in these latitudes , there are no outlying linear or <unk> reefs , rising out of unfathomable depths , i have coloured these parts of the coast red .
on similar grounds , i have coloured red the northern parts of the western coast ( north of latitude 24 deg 30 ' ) , and likewise the shores of the chief part of the gulf of suez .
in the gulf of <unk> , as i am informed by captain moresby there are no coral-reefs , and the water is profoundly deep .
west indies .
my information regarding the reefs of this area , is derived from various sources , and from an examination of numerous charts ; especially of those lately executed during the survey under captain <name> , <unk> .
i lay under particular obligation to captain bird <name> , r.n. , one of the members of the late survey , for many personal communications on this subject .
as in the case of the red sea , it is necessary to make some preliminary remarks on the submerged banks of the west indies , which are in some degree connected with coral-reefs , and cause considerable doubts in their classification .
that large accumulations of sediment are in progress on the west indian shores , <name> be evident to any one who examines the charts of that sea , especially of the portion north of a line joining <unk> and <name> .
the area of deposition seems less intimately connected with the <unk> of the great rivers , than with the course of the <unk> ; as is evident from the vast extension of the banks from the promontories of <unk> and mosquito .
besides the <unk> , there are many of various dimensions which stand quite isolated ; these closely resemble each other , they lie from two or three to twenty or thirty fathoms under water , and are composed of sand , sometimes firmly <unk> , with little or no <name> ; their surfaces are smooth and nearly level , shelving only to the amount of a few fathoms , very gradually all round towards their edges , where they plunge abruptly into the unfathomable sea .
this steep inclination of their sides , which is likewise characteristic of the <unk> , is very remarkable : i may give as an instance , the <unk> bank , on the edges of which the soundings change in 250 fathoms horizontal distance , from 11 to 210 fathoms ; off the northern point of the bank of old providence , in 200 fathoms horizontal distance , the change is from 19 to 152 fathoms ; off the great bahama bank , in 160 fathoms horizontal distance , the inclination is in many places from 10 fathoms to no bottom with 190 fathoms .
on coasts in all parts of the world , where sediment is accumulating , something of this kind may be observed ; the banks <unk> very gently far out to sea , and then terminate abruptly .
the form and composition of the banks standing in the middle parts of the w. indian sea , clearly show that their origin must be chiefly attributed to the accumulation of sediment ; and the only obvious explanation of their isolated position is the presence of a nucleus , round which the currents have collected fine drift matter .
any one who <name> compare the character of the bank surrounding the hilly island of old providence , with those banks in its neighbourhood which stand isolated , <name> scarcely doubt that they surround submerged mountains .
we are led to the same conclusion by examining the bank called thunder knoll , which is separated from the great mosquito bank by a channel only seven miles wide , and 145 fathoms deep .
there can not be any doubt that the mosquito bank has been formed by the accumulation of sediment round the promontory of the same name ; and thunder knoll resembles the mosquito bank , in the state of its surface submerged twenty fathoms , in the inclinations of its sides , in composition , and in every other respect .
i may observe , although the remark is here irrelevant , that geologists should be cautious in concluding that all the <unk> of any formation have once been connected together , for we here see that deposits , doubtless of exactly the same nature , may be deposited with large <unk> spaces between them .
linear strips of coral-reefs and small knolls project from many of the isolated , as well as <unk> ; sometimes they occur quite irregularly placed , as on the mosquito bank , but more generally they form <unk> on the windward side , situated some little distance within the outer edge of the banks :  thus on the <unk> bank they form an interrupted chain which ranges between two and three miles within the windward margin : generally they occur , as on <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> banks , nearer the line of deep water .
their occurrence on the windward side is conformable to the general rule , of the efficient kinds of corals flourishing best where most exposed ; but their position some way within the line of deep water i can not explain , without it be , that a depth somewhat less than that close to the outer margin of the banks , is most favourable to their growth .
where the corals have formed a nearly continuous rim , close to the windward edge of a bank some fathoms submerged , the reef closely resembles an atoll ; but if the bank surrounds an island ( as in the case of old providence ) , the reef resembles an encircling barrier-reef .
i should undoubtedly have classed some of these fringed banks as imperfect atolls , or barrier-reefs , if the sedimentary nature of their foundations had not been evident from the presence of other neighbouring banks , of similar forms and of similar composition , but without the <unk> marginal reef : in the third chapter , i observed that probably some <unk> reefs did exist , which had originated in the manner here supposed .
proofs of elevation within recent tertiary periods abound , as referred to in the sixth chapter , over nearly the whole area of the west indies .
hence it is easy to understand the origin of the low land on the coasts , where sediment is now accumulating ; for instance on the northern part of <unk> , and on the n.e .
part of mosquito , where the land is low , and where extensive banks appear to be in progressive formation .
hence , also , the origin of the great bahama banks , which are bordered on their western and southern edges by very narrow , long , singularly shaped islands , formed of sand , shells , and coral-rock , and some of them about a hundred feet in height , is easily explained by the elevation of banks fringed on their windward ( western and southern ) sides by coral-reefs .
on this view , however , we must suppose either that the chief part of the surfaces of the great bahama <unk> were all originally deeply submerged , and were brought up to their present level by the same elevatory action , which formed the linear islands ; or that during the elevation of the banks , the superficial currents and swell of the waves continued wearing them down and keeping them at a nearly uniform level : the level is not quite uniform ; for , in proceeding from the n.w .
end of the bahama group towards the s.e .
end , the depth of the banks increases , and the area of land decreases , in a very gradual and remarkable manner .
the latter view , namely , that these banks have been worn down by the currents and swell during their elevation , seems to me the most probable one .
it is , also , i believe , applicable to many banks , situated in widely distant parts of the west indian sea , which are wholly submerged ; for , on any other view , we must suppose , that the elevatory forces have acted with astonishing uniformity .
the shores of the gulf of mexico , for the space of many hundred miles , is formed by a chain of lagoons , from one to twenty miles in breadth ( " <unk> navigator , " <name> 178 , etc .
) , containing either fresh or salt water , and separated from the sea by linear strips of sand .
great spaces of the shores of southern brazil ( in the " london and edinburgh philosophical journal , " 1841 , <name> 257 , i have described a singular bar of sandstone lying parallel to the coast off pernambuco in brazil , which probably is an analogous formation .
) , and of the united states from long island ( as observed by professor rogers ) to <name> have the same character .
professor rogers , in his " report to the british association " ( volume iii. , <name> 13 ) , <unk> on the origin of these low , <name> , linear islets ; he states that the layers of which they are composed are too homogeneous , and contain too large a proportion of shells , to permit the common supposition of their formation being simply due to matter thrown up , where it now lies , by the surf : he considers these islands as upheaved bars or shoals , which were deposited in lines where opposed currents met .
it is evident that these islands and spits of sand parallel to the coast , and separated from it by shallow lagoons , have no necessary connection with <unk> .
but in southern <name> , from the accounts i have received from persons who have resided there , the upraised islands seem to be formed of strata , containing a good deal of <name> , and they are extensively fringed by living reefs ; the channels within these islands are in some places between two and three miles wide , and five or six fathoms deep , though generally ( in the ordinary <unk> , no lagoons appear on the coast of <name> , north of 26 deg ; but <name> whiting ( " <unk> journal , " volume <unk> , <name> 54 ) says that many are formed by sand thrown up along the whole line of coast from st. <name> 's to jupiter inlet . )
they are less in depth than width .
after having seen how frequently banks of sediment in the west indian sea are fringed by reefs , we can readily conceive that bars of sediment might be greatly aided in their formation along a line of coast , by the growth of corals ; and such bars would , in that case , have a deceptive resemblance with true barrier-reefs .
having now endeavoured to remove some sources of doubt in classifying the reefs of the west indies , i <name> give my authorities for colouring such portions of the coast as i have thought myself warranted in doing .
captain bird <name> informs me , that most of the islands on the bahama banks are fringed , especially on their windward sides , with living reefs ; and hence i have coloured those , which are thus represented in captain <name> 's late chart , red .
the same officer informs me , that the islands along the southern part of <name> are similarly fringed ; coloured red .
cuba : proceeding along the northern coast , at the distance of forty miles from the extreme s.e .
point , the shores are fringed by reefs , which extend westward for a space of 160 miles , with only a few breaks .
parts of these reefs are represented in the plans of the harbours on this coast by captain <name> ; and an excellent description is given of them by mr. <name> ( <unk> " mag .
of nat .
hist . "
volume ix. , <name> 449 ) ; he states that they enclosed a space called the " <unk> , " from half to three-quarters of a mile in width , with a <name> bottom , and a little <name> .
in most parts people can <name> , at low water , to the reef ; but in some parts the depth is between two and three fathoms .
close outside the reef , the depth is between six and seven fathoms ; these <unk> fringing-reefs are coloured red .
westward of longitude 77 deg 30 ' , on the northern side of cuba , a great bank commences , which extends along the coast for nearly four degrees of longitude .
in the place of its commencement , in its structure , and in the " <unk> , " or low islands on its edge , there is a marked correspondence ( as observed by humboldt , " <unk> .
<unk> . "
volume vii. , <name> 88 ) between it and the great bahama and <name> banks , which lie directly in front .
hence one is led to attribute the same origin to both these sets of banks ; namely , the accumulation of sediment , conjoined with an elevatory movement , and the growth of <name> on their outward edges ; those parts which appear fringed by living reefs are coloured red .
westward of these banks , there is a portion of coast apparently without reefs , except in the harbours , the shores of which seem in the published plans to be fringed .
the colorado shoals ( see captain <name> 's charts ) , and the low land at the western end of cuba , correspond as closely in relative position and structure to the banks at the extreme point of <name> , as the banks above described on the north side of cuba , do to the <unk> , the depth within the islets and reefs on the outer edge of the <unk> , is generally between two and three fathoms , increasing to twelve fathoms in the southern part , where the bank becomes nearly open , without islets or coral-reefs ; the portions which are fringed are coloured red .
the southern shore of cuba is deeply concave , and the included space is filled up with mud and <unk> , low islands and coral-reefs .
between the mountainous isle of pines and the southern shore of cuba , the general depth is only between two and three fathoms ; and in this part small islands , formed of fragmentary rock and broken <unk> ( humboldt , " <unk> .
<unk> . "
volume vii .
pages 51 , 86 to 90 , 291 , 309 , 320 ) , rise abruptly , and just reach the surface of the sea .
from some expressions used in the " <unk> navigator " ( volume i. , part ii. , <name> 94 ) , it appears that considerable spaces along the outer coast of southern cuba are bounded by cliffs of coral-rock , formed probably by the upheaval of coral-reefs and <unk> .
the charts represent the southern part of the isle of pines as fringed by reefs , which the " <unk> .
<unk> . "
says extend some way from the coast , but have only from nine to twelve feet water on them ; these are coloured red.  i have not been able to procure any detailed description of the large groups of banks and " <unk> " further eastward on the southern side of cuba ; within them there is a large expanse , with a muddy bottom , from eight to twelve fathoms deep ; although some parts of this line of coast are represented in the general charts of the west indies , as fringed , i have not thought it prudent to colour them .
the remaining portion of the south coast of cuba appears to be without coral-reefs .
<unk> .
the n.e .
part of the promontory appears in captain <name> 's charts to be fringed ; coloured red .
the eastern coast , from 20 deg to 18 deg is fringed .
south of latitude 18 deg , there commences the most remarkable reef in the west indies : it is about one hundred and thirty miles in length , ranging in a n. and s. line , at an average distance of fifteen miles from the coast .
the islets on it are all low , as i have been informed by captain b. <name> ; the water <unk> suddenly on the outside of the reef , but not more abruptly than off many of the sedimentary banks : within its southern extremity ( off <unk> ) the depth is twenty-five fathoms ; but in the more northern parts , the depth soon increases to ten fathoms , and within the <unk> part , for a space of twenty miles , the depth is only from one to two fathoms .
in most of these respects we have the characteristics of a barrier-reef ; nevertheless , from observing , first , that the channel within the reef is a continuation of a great irregular bay , which penetrates the mainland to the depth of fifty miles ; and secondly , that considerable spaces of this <unk> reef are described in the charts ( for instance , in latitude 16 deg 45 ' and 16 deg 12 ' ) as formed of pure sand ; and thirdly , from knowing that sediment is accumulating in many parts of the west indies in banks parallel to the shore ; i have not ventured to colour this reef as a barrier , without further evidence that it has really been formed by the growth of corals , and that it is not merely in parts a spit of sand , and in other parts a worn down promontory , partially coated and fringed by reefs ; i <name> , however , to the probability of its being a barrier-reef , produced by subsidence .
to add to my doubts , immediately on the outside of this <unk> reef , <unk> , lighthouse , and <unk> reefs are situated , and these reefs have so completely the form of atolls , that if they had occurred in the pacific , i should not have hesitated about colouring them blue .
<unk> reef seems almost entirely filled up with low mud islets ; and the depth within the other two reefs is only from one to three fathoms .
from this circumstance and from their similarity in form , structure , and relative position , both to the bank called northern triangles , on which there is an islet between seventy and eighty feet , and to <unk> island , the level surface of which is likewise between seventy and eighty feet in height , i consider it more probable that the three foregoing banks are the worn down bases of upheaved shoals , fringed with corals , than that they are true atolls , wholly produced by the growth of <name> during subsidence ; left uncoloured .
in front of the eastern mosquito coast , there are between latitude 12 deg and 16 deg some extensive banks ( already mentioned , <name> 148 ) , with high islands rising from their centres ; and there are other banks wholly submerged , both of which kinds of banks are bordered , near their windward margins , by <unk> coral-reefs .
but it can hardly be doubted , as was observed in the preliminary remarks , that these banks owe their origin , like the great bank extending from the mosquito promontory , almost entirely to the accumulation of sediment , and not to the growth of corals ; hence i have not coloured them .
<unk> island : this island appears in the charts to be fringed ; and captain b. <name> informs me that the reefs extend about a mile from the shore , and have only from five to twelve feet water within them ; coloured red.  jamaica : judging from the charts , about fifteen miles of the s.e .
extremity , and about twice that length on the s.w .
extremity , and some portions on the s. side near kingston and port <name> , are regularly fringed , and therefore are coloured red .
from the plans of some harbours on the n. side of jamaica , parts of the coast appear to be fringed ; but as these are not represented in the charts of the whole island , i have not coloured them.  st .
<name> : i have not been able to obtain sufficient information , either from plans of the harbours , or from general charts , to enable me to colour any part of the coast , except sixty miles from port de plata westward , which seems very regularly fringed ; many other parts , however , of the coast are probably fringed , especially towards the eastern end of the <unk>  <unk> <name> : considerable portions of the southern , western , and eastern coasts , and some parts of the northern coast , appear in the charts to be fringed ; coloured red.  some miles in length of the southern side of the island of st. <name> is fringed ; most of the virgin gorda islands , as i am informed by mr. schomburgk , are fringed ; the shores of <unk> , as well as the bank on which it stands , are likewise fringed ; these islands have been coloured red .
the greater part of the southern side of <name> <name> appears in the danish survey to be fringed ( see also prof. <unk> 's account of this island , in " silliman 's journal , " volume <unk> , <name> 74 ) ; the reefs extend along the shore for a considerable space , and project rather more than a mile ; the depth within the reef is three fathoms ; coloured red.  the <unk> , as remarked by <name> buch ( " <unk> .
iles canaries , " <name> <unk> ) , may be divided into two linear groups , the western row being volcanic , and the eastern of modern calcareous origin ; my information is very defective on the whole group .
of the eastern islands , <unk> and the western coasts of <unk> and <unk> appear to be fringed : this is also the case with <unk> , as i have been informed by a resident ; these islands are coloured red .
on the shores of the western <unk> , of volcanic origin , very few coral-reefs appear to exist .
the island of <unk> , of which there are beautifully executed french charts , on a very large scale , alone presents any appearance worthy of special notice .
the south-western , southern , and eastern coasts , together forming about half the circumference of the island , are skirted by very irregular banks , projecting generally rather less than a mile from the shore , and lying from two to five fathoms submerged .
in front of almost every valley , they are breached by narrow , crooked , <unk> passages .
the french engineers ascertained by boring , that these submerged banks consisted of <unk> rocks , which were covered in many parts by thin layers of mud or sand .
from this fact , and especially from the structure of the narrow breaches , i think there can be little doubt that these banks once formed living reefs , which fringed the shores of the island , and like other reefs probably reached the surface .
from some of these submerged banks reefs of living <name> rise abruptly , either in small detached patches , or in lines parallel to , but some way within the outer edges of the banks on which they are based .
besides the above banks which skirt the shores of the island , there is on the eastern side a range of linear banks , similarly constituted , twenty miles in length , extending parallel to the coast line , and separated from it by a space between two and four miles in width , and from five to fifteen fathoms in depth .
from this range of detached banks , some linear reefs of living <name> likewise rise abruptly ; and if they had been of greater length ( for they do not front more than a sixth part of the circumference of the island ) , they would necessarily from their position have been coloured as barrier-reefs ; as the case stands they are left uncoloured .
i suspect that after a small amount of subsidence , the corals were killed by sand and mud being deposited on them , and the reefs being thus prevented from growing upwards , the banks of <unk> rock were left in their present submerged condition .
the bermuda islands have been carefully described by lieutenant <name> , in an excellent memoir in the " geological transactions " ( volume v. , part i. , <name> 103 ) .
in the form of the bank or reef , on one side of which the islands stand , there is a close general resemblance to an atoll ; but in the following respects there is a considerable difference ,  first , in the margin of the reef not forming ( as i have been informed by mr. <unk> , <unk> . )
a flat , solid surface , laid bare at low water , and regularly bounding the internal space of shallow water or lagoon ; secondly , in the border of gradually <unk> water , nearly a mile and a half in width , which surrounds the entire outside of the reef ( as is laid down in captain <unk> chart ) ; and thirdly , in the size , height , and extraordinary form of the islands , which present little resemblance to the long , narrow , simple islets , seldom exceeding half a mile in breadth , which <unk> the annular reefs of almost all the atolls in the indian and pacific oceans .
moreover , there are evident proofs ( <name> , <unk> , <name> 118 ) , that islands similar to the existing ones , formerly extended over other parts of the reef .
it would , i believe , be difficult to find a true atoll with land exceeding thirty feet in height ; whereas , mr. <name> estimates the highest point of the bermuda islands to be 260 feet ; if , however , mr. <name> 's view , that the whole of the land consists of sand drifted by the winds , and <unk> together , were proved correct , this difference would be immaterial ; but , from his own account ( <name> 118 ) , there occur in one place , five or six layers of red earth , interstratified with the ordinary calcareous rock , and including stones too heavy for the wind to have moved , without having at the same time utterly dispersed every grain of the accompanying drifted matter .
mr. <name> attributes the origin of these several layers , with their embedded stones , to as many violent <unk> ; but further investigation in such cases has generally succeeded in explaining phenomena of this kind by ordinary and simpler means .
finally , i may remark , that these islands have a considerable resemblance in shape to <unk> in the west indies , and to <unk> on the eastern coast of africa , which latter island is about two hundred feet in height , and consists of coral-rock .
i believe that the bermuda islands , from being fringed by living reefs , ought to have been coloured red ; but i have left them uncoloured , on account of their general resemblance in external form to a <unk> or atoll .
