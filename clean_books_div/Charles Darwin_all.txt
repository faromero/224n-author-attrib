my duty , in acknowledging the great obligations under which i lie to many naturalists , affords me most sincere pleasure .
i had originally intended to have described only a single abnormal cirripede , from the shores of south <name> , and was led , for the sake of comparison , to examine the internal parts of as many genera as i could procure .
under these circumstances , mr. j. e. gray , in the most disinterested manner , suggested to me making a monograph on the entire class , although he himself had already collected materials for this same object .
furthermore , mr. gray most kindly gave me his strong support , when i applied to the trustees of the british museum for the use of the public collection ; and i here most respectfully beg to offer my grateful <unk> to the trustees , for their most liberal and unfettered permission of examining , and when necessary , <unk> the specimens in the magnificent collection of cirripedes , commenced by dr. leach , and steadily added to , during many years , by mr. gray .
considering the difficulty in determining the species in this class , had it not been for this most liberal permission by the trustees , the public collection would have been of no use to me , or to any other naturalist , in systematically classifying the cirripedes .
previously to mr. gray suggesting to me the present monograph , mr. stutchbury , of bristol , had offered to intrust to me his truly beautiful collection , the fruit of many years ' labour .
at that time i refused this most generous offer , intending to confine myself to anatomical observations ; but i have since accepted it , and still have the entire splendid collection for my free use .
mr. stutchbury , with unwearied kindness , further supplied me with fresh specimens for dissection , and with much valuable information .
at about the same period , mr. cuming strongly urged me to take up the subject , and his advice had more weight with me than that of almost any other person .
he placed his whole magnificent collection at my disposal , and urged me to treat it as if it were my own : whenever i told him that i thought it necessary , he permitted me to open unique specimens of great value , and <unk> the included animal .
i shall always feel deeply honoured by the confidence reposed in me by mr. cuming and mr. stutchbury .
i lie under obligations to so many naturalists , that i am , in truth , at a loss how to express my gratitude .
mr. peach , over and over again , sent me fresh specimens of several species , and more especially of scalpellum vulgare , which were of invaluable assistance to me in making out the singular sexual relations in that species .
mr. peach , furthermore , made for me observations on several living individuals .
mr. w. thompson , the distinguished natural historian of ireland , has sent me the finest collection of british species , and their varieties , which i have seen , together with many very valuable ms. observations , and the results of experiments .
prof. <name> procured for me the <name> of some very interesting specimens in the college of surgeons , and has always given me his invaluable advice and opinion , when consulted by me .
professor e. forbes has been , as usual , most kind in obtaining for me specimens and information of all kinds .
to the rev .
r. t. lowe i am indebted for his particularly interesting collection of cirripedes from the island of madeira  a collection offering a singular proof what treasures skill and industry can discover in the most confined locality .
the well-known <unk> , mr. j. g. <unk> , has sent for my examination a very fine collection of british specimens , together with a copious ms. list of <unk> , with the authorities quoted .
to the kindness of messrs. <unk> <name> , <unk> reeve , g. <unk> , g. b. sowerby , <unk> , d. sharpe , <unk> , hancock , <name> white , dr. <unk> , sir <name> richardson , and several other gentlemen , i am greatly indebted for specimens and information : to mr. hancock i am further indebted for several long and interesting letters on the burrowing of cirripedes .
nor are my obligations confined to british naturalists .
dr. aug. gould , of boston , has most kindly transmitted to me some very interesting specimens ; as has prof. agassiz other specimens collected by himself in the southern states .
to mr. j. d. <name> , i am much indebted for several long letters , containing original and valuable information on points connected with the anatomy of the cirripedia .
to mr. <name> i am likewise indebted for information and assistance .
both the celebrated professors , milne edwards and müller , have lent me , from the great public collections under their charge , specimens which i should not otherwise have seen .
to professor w. <unk> , of <unk> , i am indebted for the examination of his whole collection .
i have , in a former publication , expressed my thanks to professor steenstrup , but i must be permitted here to repeat them , for a truly valuable present of a specimen of the anelasma <unk> of this work .
i <name> conclude my thanks to all the above british and foreign naturalists , by stating my firm conviction , that if a person wants to ascertain how much true kindness exists amongst the disciples of natural history , he should undertake , as i have done , a monograph on some tribe of animals , and let his wish for assistance be generally known .
had it not been for the <name> society , i know not how the present volume could have been published ; and therefore i beg to return my most sincere thanks to the council of this distinguished institution .
to mr. g. b. sowerby , <unk> , i am under obligations for the great care he has taken in making preparatory drawings , and in subsequently engraving them .
i believe naturalists <name> find that the ten plates here given are faithful <unk> of nature .
in <unk> , it is the usual and excellent custom to give a history of the subject , but this has been so fully done by <unk> , in his <unk> zur <unk> der <unk> , ' and by m. g. <name> st. <unk> , in his <unk> sur <unk> des <unk> , ' that it would be superfluous here to repeat the same list of authors .
i <name> only add , that since the date , 1834 , of the above works , the only important papers with which i am acquainted , are , 1st .
dr. <unk> 'on the structure of the shell in sessile cirripedes , ' in the <unk> of anatomy and physiology ; ' 2d .

mr. c. spence bate 's valuable paper on the same subject , lately published , ( oct. 1851 , ) in the 'annals of natural history ; ' and lastly , m. <unk> has described , in the <unk> journal of natural history , jan. 1851 , ' the lithotrya nicobarica , and has discussed its powers of burrowing into rocks .
i have given the specific or <unk> characters , deduced from the external parts alone , in both latin and english .
as i found , during the progress of this work , that a similarly <unk> character of the softer internal parts , was very useful in discriminating the species , i have inserted it after the ordinary specific character .
in those cases in which a genus includes only a single species , i have followed the practice of some botanists , and given only the generic character , believing it to be impossible , before a second species is discovered , to know which characters <name> prove of specific , in <unk> to generic , value .
in accordance with the rules of the british association , i have faithfully endeavoured to give to each species the first name attached to it , subsequently to the introduction of the <unk> system , in <unk> , in the tenth edition [ 1 ] of the <unk> <unk> . '
in accordance with the rules , i have rejected all names before this date , and all ms. names .
in one single instance , for reasons fully assigned in the proper place , i have broken through the great law of priority .
i have given much fewer <unk> than is usual in <unk> works ; this partly arises from my conviction that giving references to works , in which there is not any original matter , or in which the plates are not of a high order of excellence , is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history , and partly , from the impossibility of feeling certain to which species the short descriptions given in most works are applicable ;  thus , to take the commonest species , the lepas anatifera , i have not found a single description ( with the exception of the anatomical description by m. <name> st. <unk> ) by which this species can be certainly <unk> from the almost equally common lepas <unk> .
i have , however , been fortunate in having been permitted to examine a considerable number of <unk> named specimens , ( to which i have attached the sign ( ! )
used by botanists , ) so that several of my <unk> are certainly correct .
[ 1 ] in the rules published by the british association , the 12th edition , ( <unk> , ) is specified , but i am informed by mr. strickland that this is an error , and that the <unk> method was followed in the 10th edition .
the lepadidæ , or pedunculated cirripedes , have been neglected under a systematic point of view , to a degree which i can not quite understand : no doubt they are subject to considerable variation , and as long as the internal surfaces of the valves and all the organs of the animal 's body , are passed over as unimportant , there <name> occasionally be some difficulty in the identification of the several forms , and still more in settling the limits of the variability of the species .
but i suspect the pedunculated cirripedes have , in fact , been neglected owing to their close affinity , and the consequent necessity of their being included in the same work with the sessile cirripedes ; for these latter <name> ever present , i am fully convinced , insuperable difficulties in their identification by external characters alone .
i <name> here only further remark , that in the introduction i have given my reasons for assigning distinct names to the several valves , and to some parts of the included animal 's body ; and that in the introductory remarks , under the general description of the lepadidæ , i have given an abstract of my anatomical observations .

monograph on the cirripedia .
introduction .
i should have been enabled to have made this volume more complete , had i deferred its publication until i had finished my examination of all the other known cirripedes ; but my work would thus have been rendered <unk> large .
until this examination is completed , it <name> be more prudent not to discuss , in detail , the position of the lepadidæ amongst the cirripedia , or of these latter in the great class of crustacea , to which they now , by almost universal consent , have been assigned .
i may , however , remark that i believe the cirripedia do not approach , by a single character , any animal beyond the confines of the crustacea : where such an approach has been imagined , it has been founded on erroneous observations ; for instance , the closed tube within the stomach , described by m. <name> st. <unk> ( to whose excellent paper i am greatly indebted ) , as indicating an affinity to the <unk> , is , i am convinced , nothing but a strong <unk> lining , which i have often seen ejected with the excrement .
again , a most distinguished author has stated that the cirripedia differ from the crustacea :  1st .
in having " a calcareous shell and true mantle ; " but there is no essential difference , as shown by <unk> , in the shells in these two classes ; and cirripedes certainly have no more claim to a mantle than have the <unk> <unk> .
2d .
" in the sexes joined in one individual ; " but this , as we shall see , is not constant , nor of very much weight , even if constant .
3d .
" in the body not being ringed ; " but if the outer integument of the thorax of any cirripede be well cleaned , it <name> be seen , ( as was long ago shown by <name> st. <unk> ) , to be most distinctly articulated .
4th .
" in having <unk> glands ; " but these glands are , in truth , the ovaria .
5th .
" in the liver being formed on the <unk> type ; " i do not think this is the case , but i do not quite understand the point in question .
6th .
" in not having a head or organs of sense ; " this is singularly erroneous : professor <unk> has shown the existence of eyes in the mature cirripede ; the antennæ , though preserved , certainly become functionless soon after the last metamorphosis ; but there exist other organs of sense , which i believe serve for smelling and hearing : and lastly , so far from there being no head , the whole of the cirripede externally visible , consists exclusively of the three anterior segments of the head .
the <unk> , cirripedia , can be divided into three orders ; the first of which , mainly characterised by having six pair of thoracic cirri , includes all common cirripedes : these latter may be divided into three families ,  the lepadidæ , or pedunculated cirripedes , the subject of the present memoir ; the <unk> containing the single genus <unk> or <unk> ; and , lastly , the <unk> , which consist of two very distinct sub-families , the <unk> and <unk> .
of the other two orders above alluded to , one <name> , i believe , contain the remarkable burrowing genus <unk> , lately described by mr. hancock , and a second burrowing genus , or rather family , obtained by me on the coast of south <name> .
the third order is highly singular , and differs as much from all other cirripedes as does a <unk> from other crustaceans ; it has a <unk> mouth , but is destitute of an anus ; it has not any limbs , and is as plainly articulated as the larva of a fly ; it is entirely naked , without valves , carapace , or capitulum , and is attached to the cirripede , in the sack of which it is parasitic , by two distinct threads , terminating in the usual larval , prehensile antennæ .
i intend to call this cirripede , proteolepas .
i mention it here for the sake of calling attention to any parasite at all answering to this description .
nomenclature of the valves .
[ illustration : figure i .
capitulum . ]
[ illustration : figure ii .
scutum of lepas . ]
[ illustration : figure iii .
tergum of lepas . ]
although the present volume is strictly systematic , i <name> , under the general description of the lepadidæ , give a very brief abstract of some of the most interesting points in their internal anatomy , and in the metamorphoses of the whole class , which i <name> hereafter to treat , with the necessary illustrations , in detail .
i enter on the subject of the metamorphoses the more readily , as by this means alone can the homologies of the different parts be clearly understood .
on the names given to the different parts of <unk> i have unwillingly found it indispensable to give names to several valves , and to some few of the softer parts of cirripedes .
the accompanying figure of an imaginary scalpellum includes every valve ; the two most important valves of lepas are also given , in which the direction of the lines of growth and general shape differ from those of scalpellum as much as they do in any genus .
the names which i have imposed <name> , i <name> , be thus acquired without much difficulty .
whoever <name> refer to the published descriptions of recent and fossil cirripedia , <name> find the utmost confusion in the existing nomenclature : thus , the valve named in the woodcut the scutum , has been designated by various well-known naturalists as the " ventral , " the " anterior , " the " inferior , " the " <unk> , " and the " <unk> " valve ; the first two of these titles have , moreover , been applied to the rostrum or rostral valve of sessile cirripedes .
the tergum has been called the " dorsal , " the " posterior , " the " superior , " the " central , " the " terminal , " the " <unk> , " and the " <unk> " valve .
the <name> has received the first two of these identical epithets , viz .
the " dorsal " and the " posterior ; " and likewise has been called the " <unk> . "
the confusion , however , becomes far worse , when any individual valve is described , for the very same margin which is anterior or inferior in the eyes of one author , is the posterior or superior in those of another ; it has often happened to me that i have been quite unable even to conjecture to which margin or part of a valve an author was referring .
moreover , the length of these double titles is inconvenient .
hence , as i have to describe all the recent and fossil species , i trust i may be thought justified in giving short names to each of the more important valves , these being common to the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes .
the part supported by the peduncle , and which is generally , though not always , protected by valves , i have designated the capitulum .
the title of peduncle , which is either naked or <unk> , requires no explanation ; the scales on it , and the lower valves of the capitulum , are arranged in whorls , which , in the latin specific descriptions , i have called by the botanical term of <unk> .
i have applied the term scutum to the most important and persistent of the valves , and which can generally be recognised by the hollow giving attachment to the adductor scutorum muscle , from the resemblance which the two valves taken together bear to a shield , and from their office of protecting the front side of the body .
from the protection afforded by the two terga to the <unk> surface of the animal , these valves have been thus called .
the term <name> [ 2 ] is a mere translation of the name already used by some authors , of <unk> .
[ 2 ] in the <name> of fossil species of scalpellum , i have found it necessary to distinguish different parts , viz. , a , the <unk> , of which half is seen ; b , the <unk> ; and c , the <unk> .
the rostrum has been so called from its relative position to the <name> or keel .
there is often a sub-carina and a sub-rostrum .
the remaining valves , when present , have been called latera ; there is always one large upper one inserted between the lower halves of the scuta and terga , and this i have named the upper latus or latera ; the other latera in pollicipes are numerous , and require no special names ; in scalpellum , where there are at most only three pair beneath the upper latera , it is convenient to speak of them ( <unk> woodcut , i , ) as the carinal , infra-median , and rostral latera .
as each valve often requires ( especially amongst the fossil species ) a distinct description , i have found it indispensable to give names to each margin .
these have mostly been taken from the name of the adjoining valve , ( see fig .
i . )
in lepas , pollicipes , & c. , the margin of the scutum adjoining the tergum and upper latus , is not divided ( fig .
ii ) into two distinct lines , as it is in scalpellum , and is therefore called the <unk> margin .
in scalpellum ( fig .
i ) these two margins are separately named tergal and lateral .
the <name> formed by the meeting of the basal and lateral or <unk> margins , i call the <unk> <name> ; that formed by the basal and occludent margins , i call , from its <unk> to the rostrum , the rostral <name> .
in pollicipes the carinal margin of the tergum can be divided into an upper and lower carinal margin ; of this there is only a trace ( fig .
i ) in scalpellum .
that margin in the scuta and terga which opens and shuts for the <unk> and retraction of the cirri , i have called the occludent margin .
in the terga of lepas ( fig .
iii ) and some other genera , the occludent margin is highly protuberant and arched , or even formed of two distinct sides .
occasionally , i have referred to what i have called the primordial valves : these are not calcified ; they are formed at the first exuviation , when the larval integuments are shed : in mature cirripedes they are always seated , when not worn away , on the umbones of the valves .
the membrane connecting the valves , and forming the peduncle , and sometimes in a harder condition replacing the valves , i have often found it convenient to designate by its proper chemical name of chitine , instead of by horny , or other such equivalents .
when this membrane at any articulation sends in rigid projections or crests , for the attachment of muscles or any other purpose , i call them , after <unk> , <unk> .
for the underlying true skin , i use the term corium .
the animal 's body is included within the capitulum , within what i call the sack ( see pl .
iv , figs .
2 and <unk> a , and pl .
ix , fig .
4 ) .
the body consists of the thorax supporting the cirri , and of an especial enlargement , or downward prolongation of the thorax , which includes the stomach , and which i have called the prosoma .
( pl .
ix , fig .
4 n ) .
the cirri are composed of two arms or rami , supported on a common segment or support , which i call the pedicel .
the caudal appendages are two little projections , either <unk> <unk> ( pl .
iv , fig .
<unk> a ) , on each side of the anus , and just above the long <unk> penis .
on the thorax and prosoma , or on the pedicels of the cirri , there are in several genera , long , thin , tapering filaments , which have generally been supposed to serve as branchiæ ; these i call simply filaments , or filamentary appendages ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 <unk> ) .
the mouth ( fig .
4 b ) is prominent , and consists of palpi soldered to the labrum ; mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , these latter serve as an under lip ; to these several organs i sometimes apply the title used by entomologists , of " trophi . "
beneath the outer maxillæ , there are either two simple orifices or tubular projections ; these , i believe , serve as organs of smell , and have hence called them the olfactory orifices .
within the sack , there are often two sheets of ova ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 b ) , these i call ( after steenstrup , and other authors ) the ovigerous lamellæ ; they are united to two little folds of skin ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) , which i call the ovigerous fræna .
from the peculiar curved position which the animal 's body occupies within the capitulum , i have found it far more convenient ( not to mention the confusion of nomenclature already existing ) to apply the term rostral instead of ventral , and carinal instead of dorsal , to almost all the external and internal parts of the animal .
cirripedes have generally been figured with their surfaces of attachment downwards , hence i speak of the lower or basal margins and angles , and of those pointing in an opposite direction as the upper ; strictly speaking , as we shall presently see , the exact centre of the usually broad and flat surface of attachment is the anterior end of the animal , and the upper tips of the terga , the posterior end of that part of the animal which is externally visible ; but in some cases , for instance in <unk> , where the base is deeply concave , and where the width of the shell far exceeds the depth , it seemed almost ridiculous to call this , the anterior extremity ; as likewise does it in balanus to call the united tips of the terga , lying deeply within the shell , the most posterior point of the animal , as seen externally .
i have followed the example of botanists , and added the <unk> [ ! ]
to <unk> , when i have seen an authentic specimen bearing the name in question .
every locality , under each species , is given from specimens <unk> in a manner and under circumstances appearing to me worthy of full confidence ,  the specific determination being in each case made by myself .

<unk>  i <name> here briefly describe the metamorphoses , as far as known , common to all cirripedia , but more especially in relation to the present family .
i may premise , that since vaughan thompson 's capital discovery of the larvæ in the last stage of development in balanus , much has been done on this subject : this same author subsequently published [ 4 ] in the 'philosophical transactions , ' an account of the larvæ of lepas and conchoderma ( <unk> ) in the first stage ; and seeing how totally distinct they were from the larva of the latter stage in balanus , he erroneously attributed the difference to the difference in the two families , instead of to the stage of development .
<unk> [ 5 ] first showed , and the discovery is an important one , that in lepas the larvæ pass through two totally different stages .
this has subsequently been proved by implication to be the case in balanus , by <unk> , [ 6 ] who has given excellent drawings of the larva in the first stage ; and quite lately , mr. c. spence bate , of <unk> , has made other detailed observations and drawings of the larvæ of five species in this same early stage , and has most kindly permitted me to quote from his unpublished paper [ 7 ] .
i am enabled to confirm and <unk> these observations , in all the cirripedes in the order containing the <unk> and lepadidæ .

[ 7 ] this <name> appear in the october number ( 1851 ) of the 'annals of natural history . '
the ova , and consequently the larvæ of the lepadidæ , in the first stage , whilst within the sack of the parent , vary in length from .007 to <unk> in lepas , to <unk> of an inch in scalpellum : my chief examination of these larvæ has been confined to those of scalpellum vulgare ; but i saw them in all the other genera .
the larva is somewhat depressed , but nearly globular ; the carapace <unk> is truncated , with lateral horns ; the sternal surface is flat and broad , and formed of thinner membrane than the dorsal .
the horns just alluded to are long in lepas and short in scalpellum ; their ends are either rounded and excessively transparent , or , as in ibla , furnished with an abrupt , minute , sharp point : within these horns , i distinctly saw a long <unk> organ , bearing excessively fine hairs in lines , so exactly like the long plumose spines on the prehensile antennæ of the larvæ in the last stage ; that i have not the least doubt , that these horns are the cases in which antennæ are in process of formation .
<unk> to them , on the sternal surface , near each other , there are two other minute , doubly curved , pointed horns , about <unk> in length , directed <unk> ; and within these i again saw a most delicate articulated <unk> organ on a thicker pedicel : in an excellent drawing , by mr. c. s. bate , of the larva of a chthamalus ( balanus <unk> of british authors ) , after having kept alive and moulted once , these organs are distinctly shown as articulated antennæ ( without a case ) , directed forwards : hence , before the first moult in scalpellum , we have two pair of antennæ in process of formation .
<unk> to the bases of these smaller antennæ is seated the <unk> eye , ( as i believe it to be , ) <unk> in diameter , with apparently a single lens , surrounded , except at the apex , by <unk> <unk> .
in some cases , as in some species of lepas , the larvæ , when first excluded from the egg , have not an eye , or a very imperfect one .
there are three pairs of limbs , seated close together in a longitudinal line , but some way apart in a transverse direction : the first pair always consists of a single spinose ramus , it is not articulated in scalpellum , but is <unk> in some genera ; it is directed forwards .
the other two pair have each two rami , supported on a common <unk> or pedicel : in both pair , the longer ramus is <unk> , and the shorter ramus is without articulations , or with only traces of them : the longer spines borne on these limbs ( at least , in scalpellum and chthamalus , ) are finely plumose .
the abdomen terminates , a little beyond the posterior end of the carapace , in a slightly upturned horny point ; a short distance <unk> to this point , a strong , spinose , forked projection depends from the abdominal surface .
messrs. v. thompson , <unk> , and bate , have kept alive for several days the larvæ of lepas , conchoderma , balanus , <unk> , and chthamalus , and have described the changes which <unk> between the first and third <unk> .
the most conspicuous new character is the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace into an almost <unk> , spinose point in lepas , conchoderma , chthamalus , and balanus , but not according to <unk> , in one of the species of the latter genus .
the posterior point , also , of the abdomen becomes developed in balanus ( <unk> ) into two very long , <unk> processes , serrated on their outer sides ; in lepas and conchoderma , according to thompson , into a single , tapering spinose projection ; and in chthamalus , as figured by mr. bate , the posterior bifid point , as well as the depending ventral fork , increase much in size .
another important change , which has been particularly attended to by mr. bate , is the appearance of spinose projections and spines ( some of which are thick , curved , and strongly plumose , or , almost pectinated along their inner sides ) on the pedicels and lower segments of the shorter rami of the two posterior pairs of limbs .
the mouth in its earliest condition alone remains to be described ; in s .
vulgare , it is seated on a very slight prominence , in a most remarkable situation , namely , in a central point between the bases of the three pairs of legs .
i traced by dissection the oesophagus for some little way , until lost in the cellular and oily matter filling the whole animal , and it was directed <unk> , which is the direction that might have been expected , from the course followed by the oesophagus in the larva in the last stage , and in mature cirripedes .
mr. a. hancock has called my attention to a probosciformed projection on the under side of the larva of lepas fascicularis , when just escaped from the egg .
mr. bate has described this same proboscis in balanus and chthamalus , and states the important fact , that it is capable of being moved by the animal ; and , lastly , i have seen it in an australian chthamalus , and in ibla , of remarkable size .
this proboscis , which is always directed <unk> , ( like the mouth in the mature animal , ) certainly answers to the mouth as made out by dissection in scalpellum ; and i believe i saw , as has mr. bate , a terminal orifice : it certainly does not possess any trophi .
in ibla ( in which the larva is large enough for dissection ) , the base of the proboscis arises <unk> to the first pair of legs , and the orifice at the other end reaches beyond or <unk> to the point , where the mouth in scalpellum opens , namely between the middle pair of legs .
the mouth being either so largely probosciformed or seated only on a slight eminence , in two genera so closely allied as ibla and scalpellum , and ( judging from mr. thompson 's figures , and from what i have seen myself , ) in the species of the same genus lepas , is a singular difference : in the cases in which , at first , the proboscis is absent , it would probably soon be developed .
i can not but suppose that the inwardly directed spines on the bases of the two posterior legs , which are so rapidly developed , serve some important end , namely , as organs of prehension for the larvæ , like the mandibles and maxillæ of mature cirripedes , for seizing their prey , and conveying it to their <unk> mouths , conveniently seated for this purpose .
the first pair of legs answers , as i believe from reasons hereafter to be assigned , to the outer pair of <unk> in the higher crustacea ; and the other four legs to the first two pair of thoracic limbs in these same crustacea ; this being the case , the highly remarkable position of the mouth in the larva , either between the bases of the two posterior pair of legs , or at least <unk> to the first pair , together with the probable functions of the <unk> points springing from the basal segments of the two hinder pair of true thoracic limbs , forcibly bring to mind the anomalous structure of the mouth being situated in the middle of the under side of the thorax , in <unk> ,  that most ancient of crustaceans , and therefore one likely to exhibit a structure now embryonic in other orders .
i <name> only further remark , that i suspect that the <unk> of the anterior end of the carapace , has been effected by the segments having been driven inwards , and consequently , that the larger antennæ within the lateral horns , though standing more in front than the little approximate pair , are normally the posterior of the two pair .
according to milne edwards , the posterior pair are normally seated outside the anterior pair , and this is the case with those within the lateral horns .
larva in the second <unk>  notwithstanding the considerable changes , already briefly given , which the larva undergoes during the first two or three <unk> after leaving the egg , all these forms may be conveniently classed under the first stage .
the larva in the second stage is known only from a single specimen described , figured , and found by <unk> , [ 8 ] adhering to sea-weed in the midst of other larvæ of lepas in the last stage .
in its general shape and compressed form , it seems to come nearer to the last than to the first stage .
it has only three pair of legs , situated much more <unk> on the body than in the first stage , and all directed <unk> ; they are much shorter than heretofore , and resemble rather closely those of the last stage , with the important exception that the first pair has only one ramus .
it is this circumstance which leaves no doubt on my mind , that we here have the three pair of limbs , of the first stage , metamorphosed .
the body is prolonged some way behind these limbs , and ends in a blunt , rounded point , in which , probably , are developed the three posterior pair of legs and the abdomen of the larva in the last stage .
the mouth is now seated some way <unk> to the limbs , is large and probosciformed , and is , i presume , still destitute of trophi .
there are now two closely approximate eyes , but as yet both are simple .
the smaller pair of antennæ has disappeared .
the whole animal was attached to the sea-weed by a ( i presume , pair of , ) " <unk> <unk> , " which <unk> considers as the prehensile antennæ , to be presently described , in an early state of development .
i have little doubt that this is correct , for in an abnormal cirripede of another order , in which the larva appears in the first stage with prehensile antennæ , the eggs have two great projecting horns including these organs , and attached by their tips , through some unknown means , to the sack of the parent , apparently in the same manner as <unk> 's larva was attached to the sea-weed .
i <name> only further remark on the larva of this second stage , that its chief development since the first stage , has been towards its anterior end .
the next great development , to be immediately described , is towards the posterior end of the animal .

larva , last <unk>  my chief examination has been directed , at this stage of development , to the larvæ of lepas australis , which are of unusual size , namely , from <unk> to even almost <unk> of an inch in length ; i examined , however , the larvæ of several other species of lepas , of ibla and of balanus , with less care , but sufficiently to show that in all essential points of organisation they were identical ; this , indeed , might have been inferred from the similarity of the larval prehensile antennæ , preserved in the bases of all mature cirripedes , and which i have carefully inspected in almost every genus .
the larvæ in this final stage , in most of the genera , have increased many times in size since their exclusion from the egg ; for instance , in lepas australis , from .007 to <unk> , or even to <unk> of an inch .
they are now much compressed , nearly of the shape of a <unk> or <unk> , with the anterior end the thickest , the sternal surface nearly or quite straight , and the dorsal arched .
almost the whole of what is externally visible consists of the carapace ; for the thorax and limbs are hidden and enclosed by its backward prolongation ; and even at the anterior end of the animal , the narrow sternal surface can be drawn up , so as to be likewise enclosed .
as in several <unk> crustaceans , the part of the head bearing the antennæ and organs of sense , in front of the mouth , equals , or even exceeds in length , and more than exceeds in bulk , the posterior part of the body , consisting of the enclosed thorax and abdomen .
i <name> now briefly describe , in the following order , the carapace , the organs of sense , mouth , thorax and limbs , abdomen , and internal viscera .
the form of the carapace has been sufficiently described ; it consists of thick chitine membrane , marked with lines , and sometimes with stars and other patterns ; it is obscurely divided into two halves by a line or suture along part of the dorsal margin ; these halves or two valves are drawn together by an adductor muscle , in the same relative position as in the mature cirripede .
the part overhanging and enclosing the thorax is lined by an excessively delicate membrane , obviously homologous with the lining of the sack in the mature animal , and is nothing but a <unk> of the carapace , rendered very thin from being on the under or protected side : a layer of true skin or corium , probably double , separates these two folds .
acoustic <unk>  on the borders of the carapace , at the anterior end , on the sternal surface , there are two minute orifices , in l .
australis <unk> in diameter , sometimes having a distinct border round them ; the membrane of the carapace on the inside is prolonged upwards and inwards in two short <unk> tubes , lodged in closed sacks of the corium : within these sacks on each side a delicate bag is suspended , and hangs in the mouth of the above funnel ; at the upper end a large nerve could be distinctly seen to enter the bag : i can not doubt that this is a <unk> ; from its position and from the animal not feeding ( as we shall presently see ) , i conclude that it is an acoustic organ .
<unk>  these are large and conspicuous ; they are attached very obliquely on the sternal surface , a little way from the anterior end of the carapace , beyond which , when exserted , they extend ; [ 9 ] they can ( at least in ibla ) be retracted within the carapace .
they consist of three segments : the first or basal one is much larger than the others , and apparently always has a single spine on the outer distal margin .
the second segment consists either of a large , thin , circular , sucking disc , or is hoof-like ( tab .
v , figs .
5 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) ; in all cases it is furnished with one or more spines , ( seven very long ones in lepas , ) on the <unk> margin .
the third and ultimate segment is small ; it is articulated on the upper surface of the disc , and is directed rectangularly outwards ; it is sometimes notched , and even shows traces of being bifid ; it bears about seven spines at the end ; some of these spines are hooked , others simple , and in lepas and conchoderma , two or three are very long , highly flexible , and plumose , a double row of excessively fine hairs being articulated on them .
i can hardly doubt that these latter spines , ( within which the purple corium could be seen to enter a little way , ) floating laterally outwards , serve as <unk> .
the antennæ , at first , are well furnished with muscles .
they serve , in lepas , according to mr. king , and in balanus , according to mr. bate , and as i saw myself in another unnamed order , for the purpose of walking , one limb being stretched out before the other ; but their main function is to attach the larva for its final metamorphosis into a cirripede .
the disc can adhere even to so smooth a surface as a glass tumbler .
[ 10 ] the attachment is at first manifestly voluntary , but soon becomes involuntary and permanent , being effected by special and most remarkable means , which <name> be most conveniently described in a later part of this introduction .
i <name> here only state that i traced with ease the two cement-ducts running from two large glandular bodies , to within the antennæ up to the discs .
[ 9 ] mr. j. d. <name> , who has examined these organs in the larvæ of lepas , informs me in a letter , that in his opinion they " correspond with the inferior antennæ , the superior being wanting , as in most <unk> . "
he continues  " i know of no case in which the inferior are obsolete when the superior are developed ; but the reverse is often true . "
in position these antennæ certainly correspond to the inferior and central pair of the larva in the first stage , which belong , as it would appear , to the first segment of the body ; but judging from the drawing by <unk> of the larva in the second stage , i am , in some respects , more inclined to consider that they correspond to the larger pair seen within the lateral horns of the carapace in the first stage .

<unk>  close behind the basal articulations of the antennæ , the sternal surface consists of two approximate , elongated , narrow , flat pieces , or segments .
these <unk> considers as the basal segments of the antennæ : as they are not cylindrical , i do not see the grounds for this conclusion : their posterior ends are rounded , and the membrane forming them is reflected inwards , in the form of two , forked , horny <unk> , together resembling two letters , <unk> , close together ; these project up , inside the animal , for at least one third of its thickness from the sternal to the dorsal surface .
the two great , almost spherical eyes in l .
australis , each <unk> of an inch in diameter , are attached to the outer arms , thus , <unk> , in the position of the two full stops .
hence the eyes are included within the carapace .
each eye consists of eight or ten lenses , varying in diameter in the same individual from <unk> to <unk> of an inch , enclosed in a common membranous bag or <unk> , and thus attached to the outer <unk> .
the lenses are surrounded half way up by a layer of dark <unk> .
the nerve does not enter the <unk> basal end of the common eye , but on one side of the <unk> .
the structure here described is exactly that found , according to milne edwards , in certain crustacea .
in specimens just attached , in which no absorption has taken place , two long muscles with transverse striæ may be found attached to the <unk> tips of the two middle arms of the two <unk> , and running up to the <unk> surface of the carapace , where they are attached ; other muscles ( without transverse striæ ) are attached round the bases , on both sides of both forks .
the action of these muscles would inevitably move the eyes , but i suspect that their function may be to draw up the narrow , deeply folded , sternal surface , and thus cause the retraction of the great prehensile antennæ within the carapace .
mouth.  this is seated in exactly the same position as in the mature cirripede , on a slight prominence , fronting the thoracic limbs , and so far within the carapace , that it was obviously quite <unk> for the seizure of prey ; and it was equally obvious , that the limbs were natatory , and incapable of carrying food to the mouth .
this enigma was at once explained by an examination of the mouth , which was found to be in a rudimentary condition and absolutely closed , so that there would be no use in prey being seized .
underneath this slightly prominent and closed mouth , i found all the <unk> organs of a cirripede , in an immature condition .
the state of the mouth <name> be at once understood , if we suppose very fluid matter to be poured over the protuberant mouth of a cirripede , so as to run a little way down , in the shape of internal crests , between the different parts , and in the shape of a short , shrivelled , certainly closed tube , a little way ( <unk> of an inch in l .
australis ) down the oesophagus .
hence , the larva in this , its last stage , can not eat ; it may be called a locomotive <unk> ; [ 11 ] its whole organisation is apparently adapted for the one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final metamorphosis .
[ 11 ] m. <unk> has lately ( 'comptes rendus , ' feb. 5 , 1850 , as cited in 'annals of nat .
history , ' vol .
v , p. 318 , ) discovered that the " <unk> are <unk> with eight feet , without either mouth or intestine , and which , being deprived of all means of <unk> , fix themselves at <name> , so as to undergo a final metamorphosis , and they become <unk> or <unk> . "
here , then , we have an almost exactly analogous case .
m. <unk> asks  " ought , therefore , the <unk> to be called larvæ , when , under that denomination , have hitherto been comprised animals capable of nourishing themselves ? "
thorax and <unk>  the thorax is much compressed , and consists of six segments , corresponding with the six pair of natatory legs ; the anterior segments are much plainer ( even the first being distinctly separated by a fold from the mouth ) , than the posterior segments , which is exactly the reverse of what takes place in the mature cirripede ; in the latter , the first segment is confounded with the part bearing the mouth .
the <unk> elements of the thorax are distinguishable ; the sternal surface is very narrow , and is covered with complicated folds and ridges .
the six pair of legs are all close , one behind the other , and all are alike in having a <unk> or pedicel of two segments , directed forwards , bearing two arms or rami , each composed of two segments , the outer ramus being a little longer than the inner one .
on the lower segments in both rami of all the limbs , there is a single spine .
in all the limbs , the obliquely truncated summit of the terminal segment of the inner ramus bears three very long , beautifully plumose spines : in the first pair , the summit of the outer ramus bears four , and in the five succeeding pair , six similar spines .
this difference , small as it is , is interesting , as recalling the much greater difference between the first and succeeding pairs , in the first and second stage of development .
the terminal segments of all the rami , bearing the long plumose spines , are directed backwards .
the limbs and thorax are well furnished with <unk> muscles .
the animal , according to mr. king , swims with great rapidity , back downwards .
the limbs can be withdrawn within the carapace .
abdomen and caudal appendages.  the abdomen is small , and its structure might easily be overlooked without careful dissection of the different parts : it consists of three segments ; the first can be seen to be distinct from the last thoracic segment , bearing the sixth pair of limbs , only from the fold of the <unk> element , and from its difference in shape ; the second segment is very short , but quite distinct ; the third is four or five times as long as the second , and bears at the end two little appendages , each consisting of two segments , the lower one with a single spine , and the upper one with three , very long , plumose spines , like those on the rami of the thoracic limbs .
the abdomen contains only the <unk> and two delicate muscles running into the two appendages , between the bases of which the anus is seated .
internal <unk>  within the body , in front of the mouth , it was easy to find the stomach ( with two pear-shaped cæca at the upper end ) , running first <unk> , and then curving back and reaching the anus by a long <unk> , difficult to be followed : it appeared , however , to me , that this stomach had more relation to the young cirripede , of which every part could now generally be traced , than to the larva , with its closed and rudimentary mouth : the fact , however , of its being prolonged to the anus , which is in a different position in the larva and mature state , shows that the stomach serves , at least , as an <unk> channel .
besides the stomach , the several muscles already alluded to , and much pulpy and oily matter , the only other internal organs consist of two long , rather thick , <unk> masses , into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts running from the prehensile antennæ could be traced .
these masses are formed of irregular orange balls , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , made up of rather large cells , so to have a <unk> appearance , held together by a transparent pale yellowish substance , but apparently not enclosed in a membrane : these masses lie rather obliquely , and approach each other at their anterior ends ; they extend from above the compound eyes , to the cæca of the stomach to which they cohere , but in young specimens , they extend some way beyond the cæca , between the folds of the carapace .
the two cement-ducts , at the points where they enter these bodies , expand and are lost ; at this point , also , the little orange-coloured masses of cells have the appearance of being broken down into a finer substance .
within the cement-ducts i saw a distinct chord of rather opaque cellular matter .
we shall presently see , that these <unk> masses are the incipient ovaria .
the young cirripede within the <unk>  several times i succeeded in <unk> off the integuments of the <unk> larva , and in displaying the young lepas australis entire .
the following description applies to the cirripede in this state ; but for convenience sake , i shall occasionally refer to its condition when a little more advanced .
i may premise , and the fact in itself is curious , that the <unk> shell of the larva , together with the compound eyes , is first moulted , and some time afterwards , the inner lining of the sack , together with the integuments of the thorax and of the natatory legs : hence , i often found specimens , which externally seemed to have perfected their metamorphoses , but which , within their sacks , retained all the characters of the natatory larva .
according to mr. king , the larva of lepas throws off its external shell five days after becoming attached .
whilst the young lepas is closely packed within the larva , the capitulum , as known by the five valves , about equals in length the peduncle .
the peduncle occupies the anterior half of the larva ; when fully stretched , it becomes narrower and slightly longer than the capitulum ; the separation between the capitulum and peduncle is almost arbitrary in the mature animal , and corresponds with no particular line in the larva .
even at this early period , the muscles of the peduncle are quite distinct .
no vestige is preserved in the outer integument , of the sternal and dorsal <unk> of the larval carapace ; but in the corium of the peduncle , three coloured marks which occur near the eyes , and two little curled marks which occur near the acoustic orifices of the larva , are all preserved for some time after maturity .
the compound eyes , as we have seen , are attached to <unk> , springing from the sternal surface of the larval carapace , and are consequently cast off with it : whilst the young cirripede is packed within the larva , the outer integument of its peduncle necessarily forms a deep transverse fold passing over the eyes and <unk> , and this , as we shall presently see , plays an important part in the future position of the animal .
the antennæ are not moulted with the carapace , but left cemented to the surface of attachment ; their muscles are converted into <unk> fibres , the corium after a short period is absorbed , and they are then preserved in a functionless condition .
no trace of the two acoustic sacks can be perceived in the corium of the young cirripede , excepting the coloured marks above alluded to .
in the young capitulum , the five valves stand some way apart from each other ; they are elegant objects under the microscope ; they are not calcified , but consist exclusively of chitine ; they are rather thick , composed of an outer membrane lined by hexagonal prisms , quite unlike any other membrane in the animal .
these valves , which i have called primordial valves , resemble pretty closely in shape the valves of the mature animal ; the fork of the <name> , however , is indicated only by a slight <unk> above the lower end .
after the exuviation of the larval integuments , and when <unk> commences , the first layer of shell is deposited under , and then round these primordial valves .
the latter , in well preserved old specimens , may often be detected on the umbones of the scuta , terga , and <name> , but not on the umbones of any other valves .
the mouth seems one of the earliest parts developed : in the youngest larva dissected , i could make out at least points corresponding with each organ ; and , at the period when the young cirripede could be dissected out of its larval envelopes , their general details were quite plain .
the labrum , however , had not become bullate .
the mouth , as we have seen , is formed under the rudimentary mouth of the larva , and at the same relative spot occupied by the probosciformed mouth of the larva in the second stage .
thus far , in the young cirripede and larva , there has been no great change in the relative positions of the parts : the rudimentary eyes , however , of the former are developed <unk> to ( or above , as applied to a cirripede , ) the cast-off compound eyes of the larva ; but the position of the mouth , of the antennæ , and of the several coloured marks in the corium , prove to demonstration , the correspondence in both of part to part .
the case is rather different with what follows .
the cirri are developed at first of considerable length , so that the young animal may soon provide itself with food ; in lepas australis they are of great length , the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments .
the extreme tips of the twenty-four rami of the six pair of cirri , are formed within the twenty-four , corresponding , little , <unk> rami of the six pair of natatory legs ; but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs , they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva ; no part whatever of the thorax of the cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva , but ( together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri ) within the <unk> cavity .
as a consequence of this , the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva ; and the cirripede , from this transverse position of its thorax , comes to be , as it were , internally , almost cut in twain , and the sack thus produced .
as soon as the young cirripede is free and can move itself , the cirri are curled up , and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum , its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body , which it had in the larval condition .
the reader <name> , perhaps , understand what i mean , if he <name> look at the mature cirripede , figured in pl .
ix , fig .
4 .
in this , he <name> see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth ; on the other hand , if he imagines the whole bottom of the body ( as high up as the letter h ) united and blended into the peduncle , he <name> see the state in which these parts exist in the larva .
now , let him greatly shorten the cirri , so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva , and then imagine a young cirripede , with cirri of full length , formed within the old one , he <name> see that the new thorax supporting the cirri <name> have to be developed in an almost transverse position ,  the animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain .
of the internal organs , whilst the cirripede is still within the larva , i have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca : from the retracted position of the thorax and rudimentary abdomen , and consequently of the anus , compared with these parts in the larva , the alimentary canal is not above half its former length .
there is , as yet , no trace of the filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ , at the base of the first pair of cirri .
nor could i perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales : the penis is represented by a minute , apparently <unk> projection .
i have already briefly described the pair of large , <unk> bodies in the larva , into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts ran , and evidently derived their slightly opaque , cellular contents .
at a very early age , before the young cirripede can be distinctly made out , the posterior ends of these <unk> bodies are absorbed , so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach .
when the young cirripede is plainly developed within the larva , these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca , and at the opposite or anterior end ( i .
e. lower , in the position in which cirripedes are usually figured ) , they have branched out into a sheet of delicate <unk> tubes ; these could be traced by every stage , until , in the young perfected cirripede , they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes .
in the larva , the two <unk> bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end , but in the mature cirripede , the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small , glandular , <unk> masses , near the <unk> , are connected only by a delicate tube ; this i failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description .
the larva fixes itself with its sternal surface parallel and close to the surface of attachment , and the antennæ become cemented to it : if the cirripede , after its metamorphosis had remained in this position , the cirri could not have been exserted , or only against the surface of attachment ; but there is a special provision , that the young cirripede shall immediately assume its proper position at right angles to the position which it held whilst within the larva , namely with its posterior end upwards .
this is effected in a singular manner by the exuviation of the great compound eyes , which we have seen are fastened to the outer arms of the double <unk> , sternal <unk> : these together with the eyes stretch transversely across , and internally far up into , the body of the larva ; and , as the whole has to be rejected or moulted , the membrane of the peduncle of the young cirripede has necessarily to be formed with a wide and deep inward fold , extending transversely across it ; this when stretched open , after the exuviation of the larval carapace and <unk> , necessarily causes the sternal side of the peduncle to be longer than the dorsal , and , as a consequence , gives to the young cirripede its normal position , at right angles to that of the larva when first attached .
* * * * * i may here state , that i have examined the larvæ in this the final or perfect stage in four species of lepas , in <unk> , ibla quadrivalvis , and , though rather less minutely , in balanus <unk> , and i find all essential points of organisation similar .
with the exception of diversities in the proportional sizes of the different parts , and in the patterns on the carapace , the differences , even in the arrangement of the spines on the limbs and antennæ , are less than i should have anticipated .
i have in this abstract treated the metamorphoses at greater length than i should otherwise have done , on account of the great importance of arriving at a correct homological interpretation of the different parts of the mature animal .
in crustacea , according to the ordinary view , there are twenty-one segments ; of these i can recognise in the cirripede , on evidence as good as can generally be obtained , all with the exception of the four terminal abdominal segments ; these do not occur in any species known to me , in any stage of its development .
if that part of the larva in front of the mouth , bearing the eyes , the prehensile antennæ , and in an earlier stage two pair of antennæ , be formed , as is admitted in all other crustacea , of three segments , then beyond a doubt , from the absolute correspondence of every part , and even every coloured <name> , the peduncle of the lepadidæ is likewise thus formed .
the peduncle being filled by the branching ovarian tubes is no objection to this view , for i am informed on the high authority of mr. j. d. <name> , [ 12 ] that this is the case with the <unk> in some true crustaceans , for instance , in <unk> .
to proceed , the mouth , formed of mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , correspond with the fourth , fifth , and sixth segments of the <unk> crustacean .
<unk> to the mouth , we come , in the larva , to a rather wide interspace without any apparent articulation or organ , and then to the thorax , formed of six segments , bearing the six pair of limbs , of which the first pair differs slightly from the others .
the thorax is succeeded by three small segments , differently shaped , with the posterior one alone bearing appendages ; these segments , i can not doubt , from their appearance alone , and from their apparent function of steering the body , are abdominal segments .
if this latter view be correct , the thoracic segments are the six posterior ones of the normal seven segments , and there must be two segments missing between the outer maxillæ and first thoracic pair of legs , which latter on this view springs from the ninth segment .
now , in a very singular cirripede , already alluded to under the name of proteolepas , the two missing segments are present , the mouth being actually succeeded by eight segments , and these by the three usual abdominal segments ,  every segment in the body being as distinct as in an <unk> : hence in proteolepas , adding the three segments for the mouth and three for the carapace , we have altogether seventeen segments , which , as i stated , is the full number ever observed in any cirripede , the four missing ones being abdominal , and , i presume , the four terminal segments .
that the cavity in which the thorax is lodged , in the larva and therefore in the mature cirripede , is simply formed by the backward production of the carapace , does not require any discussion .
the valves have no homological signification .
[ 12 ] this distinguished naturalist has given his opinion in the 'american journal of science , ' march , 1846 , that " the pedicel of anatifa corresponds to a pair of antennæ in the young ; " although the peduncle or pedicel is undoubtedly thus terminated , even in mature individuals , i think it has been shown that it is the whole of the anterior part of the larva in front of the mouth , which is directly converted into the peduncle .
professor e. forbes , in his lectures , and professor steenstrup , in his <unk> <unk> das <unk> des <unk> in der natur , ' ch .
v , have considered the peduncle as a pair of fused legs .
<unk> has taken , judging from a single sentence , the same view of the homologies of the external parts as i have done ; in his description of alepas <unk> , ( <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , & c. , <unk> , 1844 , pp .
<unk> ) , he uses the following words : " <unk> <unk> <unk> , ut in <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> et <unk> , " & c. ; his <unk> is the same as the capitulum of this work .
as we have just seen that the first pair of natatory legs is borne on the ninth segment of the body , so it must be with the first pair of cirri , which consequently correspond to the outer <unk> ( the two inner pair of <unk> or <unk> being here aborted ) of the higher crustacea , and hence their difference from the five posterior pair , which correspond with the five , ordinary pair of <unk> legs in these same crustacea .
the part of the body , which i have called the prosoma , that is the protuberant , <unk> , lower part of the thorax ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 n ) , is a special development , either of the ninth segment , bearing the first pair of cirri , or of the segments corresponding with the organs of the mouth .
the three abdominal segments of the larva are represented in the mature cirripede , in the order containing the lepadidæ , only by a minute , triangular <unk> , let in between the <unk> tergal arches of the last thoracic segment : in this <unk> , small as it is , is seated the anus , and on each side the caudal appendages , often rudimentary and sometimes absent .
in another order , i may remark , ( including , probably , the <unk> of mr. hancock , ) the cirri , of which there are only three pair , are abdominal .
i feel much confidence , that the homologies here given are correct .
the cause of their having been generally overlooked arises , i believe , from the peculiar manner , already described , in which the animal , during its last metamorphosis , is internally almost intersected : even for some little time after discovering that the larval antennæ were always embedded in the centre of the surface of attachment , i did not perceive , that this was the anterior end of the whole animal .
the accompanying woodcut gives at a glance , a view of the homologies of the external parts : the upper figure ( from milne edwards ) is a <unk> crustacean , <unk> of vaughan thompson , and the abdomen , which we know becomes in cirripedes , after the metamorphosis , rudimentary , and therefore does not fairly enter into the comparison , is given only in faint lines : the lower figure is a mature lepas , with the antennæ and eyes , which are actually present in the larva , retained and supposed to have gone on growing .
all that we externally see of a cirripede , whether pedunculated or sessile , is the three anterior segments of the head of a crustacean , with its anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment , and with its posterior end projecting vertically from it .
[ illustration : [ m.  mouth . ] ]
capitulum .
i <name> now proceed to a general description of the different parts and organs in the lepadidæ .
the capitulum is usually much flattened , but sometimes broadly oval in section .
it is generally formed of five or more valves , connected together by very narrow or broad strips of membrane ; sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent , when the whole consists of membrane .
when the valves are numerous , and they occasionally exceed a hundred in number , they are arranged in whorls , with each valve generally so placed as to cover the interval between the two valves above .
of all the valves , the scuta are the most persistent ; then come the terga , and then the <name> ; the rostrum and latera occur only in scalpellum and pollicipes , and in a rudimentary condition in lithotrya , and , perhaps , in the fossil genus <unk> .
the valves are formed sometimes of chitine ( as in ibla and alepas ) , but usually of shell , which varies from transparency to entire <unk> .
the shell is generally white , occasionally reddish or purple ; exteriorly , the valves are covered by more or less persistent , generally yellow , strong membrane .
the scuta and terga are always considerably larger than the other valves : in the different genera the valves differ so much in shape that little can be <unk> of them in common ; even the direction of their lines of growth differs ,  thus , in lepas and some allied genera , the chief growth of the scuta and of the <name> is upwards , whereas in pollicipes and lithotrya , it is entirely downwards ; in <unk> , and some species of scalpellum , it is both upwards and downwards .
even in the same species , there is often very considerable variation in the exact shape of the valves , more especially of the terga .
the adductor muscle is always attached to a point not far from the middle of the scuta , and it generally has a pit for its attachment .
in several genera , namely , pæcilasma , dichelaspis , conchoderma , and alepas , the scuta show a tendency to be <unk> or <unk> .
the valves are placed either at some distance from each other , or close together ; but their growing margins very rarely overlap each other , though this is sometimes the case with their upper , free , <unk> apices ; in a few species the scuta and terga are articulated together , or united by a fold .
the membrane connecting the valves , where they do not touch each other , is like that forming the peduncle , and is sometimes brilliantly coloured <unk> ; generally , it appears <unk> , from the corium being seen through .
small pointed spines , connected with the underlying corium by tubuli , are not unfrequently articulated on this membrane : the tubuli , however , are often present where there are no spines .
to allow of the growth of the capitulum , the membrane between the valves splits at each period of exuviation , when a new strip of membrane is formed beneath , connected on each side with a fresh layer of shell ,  the old and outer slips of membrane <unk> and disappearing : when there are many valves , the line of splitting is singularly complicated .
this membrane consists of chitine , [ 13 ] and is composed of numerous fine laminæ .
after the valves have been placed in acid , a residue , very different in bulk in different genera , is left , also composed of successive laminæ of chitine .
it appears to me that each single lamina of calcified chitine , composing the shell , must once have been continuous with a <unk> lamina in the membrane connecting the several valves : at the line where this change in <unk> <unk> , the chitine generally assumes some colour , and becomes much harder and more persistent ; and as the whole valve is formed of component laminæ thus edged ( the once continuous laminæ of <unk> chitine connecting the valves , having disintegrated and disappeared ) the surfaces of the valves are generally left covered by a persistent membrane , constituted of these <unk> : this membrane has been called the <unk> .
in some genera , as in lepas , this so-called <unk> is seldom preserved , excepting on the last zone of growth : in scalpellum and pollicipes it usually covers the whole valves .
it appears to me that the laminæ of chitine , and of calcified chitine composing the valves , are both formed not by secretion , but by the metamorphosis of an outer layer of corium into these substances .
[ 13 ] chitine is confined to the articulata .
it was dr. c. schmidt ( contributions , & c. , being a <unk> investigation : in <name> 's <unk> memoirs , ' vol .
v ) , who discovered that the membrane connecting the valves and forming the peduncle , and the tissues of the internal animal , were composed of this substance .
but dr. schmidt says that the valves in lepas are composed of <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> residue ; i can not but think that the existence of the <unk> is an error caused by dr. schmidt 's belief that the cirripedia were intermediate between crustacea and mollusca , in the shells of which latter , the animal basis consists of <unk> .
for after placing the valves of lepas and pollicipes in cold acid , i found that the membrane left could not be dissolved in boiling caustic potash , but could , though slowly , ( and without change of colour , ) in boiling muriatic acid ; and these are the main <unk> characters of chitine , compared with albuminous substances .
i may add , that schmidt was also induced to consider the shells of cirripedia as having the same nature with those of mollusca , from finding that in the above <unk> of <unk> matter , <unk> consisted of carbonate and only <unk> of phosphate of lime ; but dr. schmidt 's own <unk> prove how extremely variable the proportions of these salts are in the crustacea , as the following instance shows :  <unk> <unk> phosphate of lime <unk> <unk> carbonate of lime <unk> <unk> and , therefore , it is not very surprising that cirripedia should have still less phosphate of lime in their shells , than has a lobster compared with a <unk> .
within the capitulum is the sack , which , together with the upper internal part of the peduncle , <unk> the animal 's body .
the sack is lined by a most delicate membrane of chitine , under which there is a double layer of corium ; this double layer is united together by short , strong , transverse bundles of fibres , branched at both ends : [ 14 ] in some genera , the ovarian tubes extend between these two layers .
we have seen , under the head of the metamorphoses , that the delicate tunic lining the sack is simply a <unk> of the thick membrane and valves forming the capitulum , the whole being the posterior portion of the carapace of the larva slightly modified .
[ 14 ] i am much indebted to mr. <unk> of liverpool for having kindly sent me excellent specimens illustrating this structure .
<unk>  its length varies greatly in different species , and even in the same species , according to the situation occupied by the individual ; its lower end is sometimes pointed , but generally only a little narrower than the upper end .
in outline , the peduncle is usually flattened , but sometimes quite cylindrical .
it is composed of very strong , generally thick , transparent membrane , rarely coloured reddish , and often penetrated by numerous tubuli .
the underlying corium is sometimes coloured in longitudinal bands .
at each period of growth a new and larger integument is formed under the old one , which gradually <unk> and disappears ; the extreme lower point is often deserted by the corium , and ceases to grow , whilst the whole upper part still continues increasing in diameter : in length the chief addition is made ( as is clearly seen in those genera having calcified scales ) , round the upper margin , at the base of the capitulum .
the surface of the membrane is either naked or <unk> clothed with minute , pointed , articulated spines , or it is penetrated by calcified scales or styles , ( in ibla alone formed of chitine , ) which pass through it to the corium , and are added to at their bases , like the valves , at each period of growth .
in lithotrya alone the scales of the peduncle are moulted together with the connecting membrane .
these scales on the peduncle are generally placed symmetrically in whorls , with each scale corresponding with the <unk> of two scales , both above and below .
except in scalpellum ornatum and the fossil <unk> <unk> , they are very small compared with the valves of the capitulum .
when the scales are symmetrical , new ones are first formed only round the summit of the peduncle , and only those in the few uppermost whorls continue to grow or to be added to at their bases ; afterwards membrane is deposited under them .
the <name> matter of the scales resembles that of the valves , and the manner of growth is the same ; tubuli generally run to and through them from the corium .
from the continued enlargement of the membrane of the peduncle , the scales come to stand , in the lower portion , some way apart .
in ibla , new horny styles are formed indifferently in all parts of the peduncle .
in some species of pollicipes , the calcareous styles are not symmetrical or symmetrically arranged ; and besides those first formed round the top of the peduncle , there are other and larger ones formed near its base .
lastly , in lithotrya we have a row of calcareous discs or an irregular , basal cup , formed in the same manner as the valves of the capitulum : in this genus alone ( as already stated , ) the calcified scales are moulted , and here alone their edges are serrated .
the peduncle is lined within by three layers of muscles , longitudinal , transverse , and oblique , all destitute of the transverse striæ , characteristic of voluntary muscles ; they run from the bottom of the peduncle to the base of the capitulum , as in lepas , or half way up it , as in conchoderma ; in alepas alone they surround the whole capitulum up to its summit .
in lithotrya there are two little , <unk> , transverse muscles ( involuntary ) , extending from the basal points of the terga to a central line on the under side of the <name> .
the gentle swaying to and fro movements , and the great power of longitudinal contraction ,  movements apparently common , as i infer from facts communicated to me by mr. peach , to all the <unk> ,  are produced by these muscles .
the interior of the peduncle is filled up with a great mass of branching ovarian tubes ; but in ibla and lithotrya , the upper part of the peduncle is occupied by the animal 's body .
means of <unk>  if the peduncle be very carefully removed ( tab .
ix , fig .
7 and tab .
i , fig .
6 b ) , from the surface of attachment , quite close to the end , but not at the actual apex , the larval prehensile antennæ can always be found : these have been sufficiently described for our present purpose under the head of the metamorphoses ; but i may add , that the <unk> differences between them in the several genera are briefly given , for a special purpose , in a discussion on the sexes of scalpellum at the end of that genus .
we have seen in the larva , that the cement-ducts , with their opaque cellular contents , can be traced from within the discs of the antennæ to the anterior or lower ends of the two <unk> bodies , which it can be demonstrated are the incipient ovaria .
in mature cirripedes these ducts can be followed , in a slightly sinuous course , along the muscles on each side within the peduncle , till they expand into two small organs , which i have called <unk> .
these glands are found with great difficulty , except in conchoderma aurita , where they are placed on each side under the inner layer of corium , at the bottom of the sack , so as to be just above the top of the peduncle ; they resemble in shape a retort , ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 . ) .
in pollicipes mitella and polymerus they lie half way down the peduncle , close together , and apparently enclosed within a common membrane ; in these two species the broad end of the gland is bent towards the neck of the retort .
in scalpellum the position is the same , but the shape is more globular .
in ibla the structure is more simple , namely , a tube slightly enlarged , running downwards , bent a little upwards , and then resuming its former downward course , the lower portion forming the <unk> .
the gland contains a strongly coherent , pulpy , opaque , cellular mass , like that in the cement-ducts ; but in some instances , presently to be mentioned , this cellular mass becomes converted within either the ducts or gland , or within both , into transparent , yellow , tough cement .
generally in conchoderma , pollicipes , and scalpellum , two ovarian tubes , but in one specimen of conchoderma aurita , three tubes , and in ibla one tube could be seen running into or forming the gland ; of the nature of the tubes there could not be the least doubt , for at a little distance from the glands they gave out branches ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 ) , containing ova in every state of development .
in some specimens as in that figured of conchoderma aurita , the ovarian tube on one side of the gland is larger than on the other , and has rather the appearance of being deeply embedded in the gland than of forming it ; but , in other specimens , the two ovarian tubes first formed a little pouch , into which their cellular contents could be clearly seen to enter ; and then this pouch expanded into the gland ; thus quite removing a doubt which i had sometimes felt , whether the ovarian tube was not simply attached to or embedded in the gland , without any further connection .
by dissection the multiple external coats of the gland and ovarian tubes could be seen to be continuous .
the cellular contents of the tubes passed into the more opaque cellular contents of the gland , by a layer of transparent , pulpy , pale , yellowish substance .
there appeared in several instances to be a relation , between the state of fulness and condition of the contents of the gland , and of the immediately adjoining portions of the ovarian tubes .
in one specimen of pollicipes mitella it was clear that the altered , tough , yellow , transparent , <unk> contents of the two glands and ducts , had actually invaded for some little distance , the two ovarian tubes which ran into them , thus showing the continuity of the whole .
from these facts i conclude , without hesitation , that the gland itself is a part of an ovarian tube specially modified ; and further , that the cellular matter , which in the ovarian tubes serves for the development of the ova , is , by the special action of the walls of the gland , changed into the <unk> cellular matter in the ducts , and this again subsequently into that tissue or substance , which <unk> the cirripede to its surface of attachment .
as the individuals grow and increase in size , so do the glands and cement-ducts ; but it seems often to happen , that when a specimen is <unk> attached , the <unk> apparatus ceases to act , and the cellular contents of the <unk> become converted into a thread of transparent tough cement ; the investing membrane , also , of the ducts , in conchoderma sometimes becomes hard and <unk> .
i have already alluded to the case of a pollicipes , in which both glands and ducts , and even a small portion of the two adjoining ovarian tubes , had become thus filled up .
as in sessile cirripedes , at every fresh period of growth a new cement gland is formed , it has occurred to me , that possibly in pollicipes something similar may take place .
in sessile cirripedes , the old <unk> are all preserved in a functionless condition , adhering to the membranous or calcareous basis , each new larger one attached to that last formed , and each giving out cement-ducts , which , <unk> in the most complicated manner , pass outside the shell and thus attach it to some foreign body .
the cement , removed from the outside of a cirripede , consists of a thin layer of very tough , <unk> , transparent , laminated substance , exhibiting no structure under the highest powers , or at most a very fine dotted appearance , like a <unk> drawing .
it is of the nature of chitine ; but boiling caustic potash has rather more effect on it than on true chitine ; and i think boiling nitric acid rather less effect .
in one single instance , namely , in <unk> , the cement comes out of the four orifices of the two <unk> ducts , in the shape of distinct cells , which , between the whale 's skin and the basal membrane , arrange themselves so as to make a circular , continuous slip of cement ; then the cells blend together , and are converted into transparent , <unk> cement .
<unk> tissue or membrane would , perhaps , have been a more correct title than cement ; but , in ordinary cases , its appearance is so little like that of an organised tissue , that i have for this reason , and for <unk> , preferred the simple term of cement .
in the larva the cement always escapes through the prehensile antennæ ; and it thus continues to do throughout life in most or all of the species of lepas , conchoderma , dichelaspis and ibla .
in the first two of these genera , the cement escapes from the borders of the lower side of the disc or penultimate segment of the antennæ , and can be there seen radiating out like spokes , which at their ends divide into finer and finer branches , till a uniform sheet of cement is formed , fastening the antennæ and the adjoining part of the peduncle down to the surface of attachment .
in dichelaspis <unk> and scalpellum peronii , the cement , or part at least , comes out of the ultimate segment of the antennæ , in the shape of one tube , within another tube of considerable diameter and length .
in scalpellum vulgare , and probably in some of the other species , which live attached to corallines , the cement soon ceases to <unk> from the antennæ , but instead , bursts through a row of orifices on the rostral margin of the peduncle ( pl .
ix , fig .
7 ) , by which means this margin is symmetrically fastened down to the delicate , horny branches of the <unk> .
in pollicipes , the two cement-ducts , either together or separately ( pl .
ix , fig .
2 , 2 a´ ) , wind about the bottom of the peduncle in the most tortuous course , at each bend pouring out cement through a hole in the membrane of the peduncle .
in ibla the lower part of the peduncle is internally filled by cement , and thus rendered rigid .
in lepas fascicularis a vesicular ball of cement surrounding the peduncle is thus formed ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , and serves as a float !
all these curious , special adaptations are described under the respective genera .
how the cement forces its way through the antennæ , and often through apertures in the thick membrane of the peduncle , i do not understand .
i do not believe , though some appearances favoured the notion , that the <unk> itself <unk> and divides , at least this is not the case in <unk> , but only that the internal chord of cellular matter thus acts and spreads itself out ; nor do i understand how , when the antennæ and immediately adjoining parts are once cemented down , any more cement can escape ; yet this must take place , as may be inferred from the breadth of the cemented , terminal portion of the peduncle in lepas and conchoderma ; and from the often active condition in old individuals of the <unk> organs .
i have entered on this subject at some length , ( and i wish i had space for more illustrations , ) from its offering , perhaps , the most curious point in the natural history of the cirripedia .
it is the one chief character of the <unk> .
i am well aware how extremely improbable it must appear , that part of an ovarian tube should be converted into a gland , in which cellular matter is modified , so that instead of aiding in the development of new beings , it forms itself into a tissue or substance , which leaves the body [ 15 ] in order to fasten it to a foreign support .
but on no other view can the structure , clearly seen by me both in the mature cirripede and in the larva , be explained , and i feel no hesitation in advancing it .
i may here venture to quote the substance of a remark made by professor <name> , when i communicated to him the foregoing facts , namely , that there was a new problem to solve ,  new work to perform ,  to attach permanently a crustacean to a foreign body ; and that hence no one could , a priori , tell by what singular and novel means this would be effected .
[ 15 ] the protrusion of the <unk> pouches in <unk> and its kindred genera , outside the body , offers a feeble analogy with what takes place in cirripedes .
professor <unk> ( 'annals of natural history , ' vol .
xx , p. 7 , ) who has attended to the subject , says that the external <unk> pouches are " a portion of the membrane of the true ovaries : " if the membrane of these pouches had been specially made adhesive , the analogy would have been closer .
filamentary appendages.  these have generally been considered to act as branchiæ ; they occur at the bases of the first pair of cirri in lepas , alepas , conchoderma , and in three species of pollicipes : in conchoderma there are similar appendages attached to the pedicels of the cirri ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 , <unk> ) ; and in the above three species of pollicipes there is a double row of them on the prosoma : their <name> differ in different species ( in some there being none ) of the same genus , and even in different individuals of the same species ; they are entirely absent in the majority of the genera .
these facts would indicate that they are not of high functional importance ; and they seem so generally occupied by testes ( pl .
iv , fig .
5 ) , that i suspect their function is quite as much to give room for the development of these glands , as to serve for respiratory purposes .
with the exception of the four above-named genera , the mere surface of the body and of the sack must be sufficient for respiration : in conchoderma aurita the two great <unk> of surface , afforded by the folded , tubular , <unk> projections , aid , as i believe , towards this end .
the shape of the body varies , owing to the greater or less development of the lower part of the prosoma , the greater or less distance of the first from the second pair of cirri , and of the mouth from the adductor scutorum muscle , ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 , and pl .
iv , 8 a´ ) .
in all the genera , the body is much flattened .
i may here mention a few particulars about the muscular system .
one of the largest muscular masses is formed by the adductor scutorum , and by the muscles which surround in a double layer ( the <unk> being oblique to each other ) the whole of the upper part of the prosoma .
from under the adductor , a pair of delicate muscles runs to the basal edge of the labrum , so as to retract the whole mouth , and two other pair to the integument between the mouth and the adductor , so as to fold it : again , there are other delicate muscles in some ( for instance in lepas <unk> ) if not in all the lepadidæ , crossing each other in the most singular loops , and serving apparently to fold the membrane between the occludent edges of the scuta .
within the prosoma there is a strong adductor muscle , running straight from side to side , for the purpose , as it appears , of <unk> the body .
the thorax , on the dorsal and ventral surfaces , is well furnished with straight and oblique muscles ( without striæ ) , which straighten and curl up this part of the body .
the muscles running into the pedicels of the cirri , cross each other on the ventral surface of the thorax ; the muscles within the rami are attached to the upper segments of the pedicels .
finally , i may remark that the whole of the body and the cirri are capable of many diversified movements .
mouth.  this is prominent , and almost probosciformed ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 b ) , and in the abnormal anelasma ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 d ) , quite probosciformed ,  such , also , was its character in the larval condition .
in outline , it is either sub-triangular , or oval with the longer axis transverse ; the whole is capable , as well as the separate organs , of considerable movement , as i have seen in living sessile cirripedes .
it is composed ( tab .
v , fig .
2 ) of a labrum , swollen or bullate , often to such an extent as to equal in its longitudinal axis the rest of the mouth ; of palpi soldered to the labrum ; of mandibles , maxillæ , and outer maxillæ , the latter serving as a lower lip .
these organs have only their upper segments free , but there are traces , clearly seen in the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
1 , a , b ) , of their being formed of three segments .
the two lower segments are laterally united , and open into each other , the prominence of the mouth being thus caused : this condition appears to me curious , and is , to a certain limited extent , intermediate between those articulated animals which have their trophi soldered into a proboscis , and those furnished with entirely free <unk> or prehensile organs .
the palpi adhere to the corners of the labrum ; and i call them palpi only from seeing that they spring laterally from above the upper articulation of the mandibles .
the prominence of the mouth , measured from the basal fold by which the whole is separated from the body , is much greater on the half formed by the labrum and mandibles , than on the other half facing the cirri .
the trophi surround a cavity  the supra-oesophageal cavity  in the middle of which , between the mandibles is seated the orifice of the oesophagus .
the oesophagus is surrounded by long , fine , muscular <unk> , radiating in all directions , opposing the <unk> muscles , and is capable of violent swallowing movements ,  <unk> after <unk> being seen to run down its whole course : there are also some fine muscles attached to the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal cavity .
the trophi serve merely for the prehension of prey , and not for <unk> .
the labrum , as stated , is always bullate or swollen ; and sometimes the upper exterior part forms , as in ibla ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a , c ) , and dichelaspis , an overhanging blunt point .
the object , i suspect , of this bullate form is to give , in the upper part , attachment to longer muscles running to the lateral surfaces of the mandibles , and lower down to the oesophagus .
the crest close over the supra-oesophageal cavity , is generally furnished with small , often bead-like teeth .
the palpi are small , their apices never actually touching each other ; they are more or less blunt , not differing much in shape in the different genera ( pl .
x , figs .
6 to 8 ) , and clothed with spines .
they are not capable of movement ; their function seems to be to prevent prey , brought by the cirri , escaping over the labrum ; i infer this from finding in anelasma and in the male of ibla , which have the cirri functionless , that the palpi are rudimentary .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , figs .
<unk> ) have from two to ten strong teeth in a single row ; where the number exceeds five , several of the teeth are small ; the inferior <name> is generally pectinated with fine spines ; in lithotrya ( fig .
2 ) , the interspaces between the teeth are also pectinated .
in the same individual there is not unfrequently one tooth , more or less , on opposite sides of the mouth .
internally , the mandibles are furnished on their outer and inner sides with several <unk> <unk> , in lithotrya roughened with points ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , for the attachment of the muscles ; of these ( fig .
1 ) , there is a chief <unk> and elevator , attached at their lower ends to near the basal fold of the mouth , and a lateral muscle , attached to the broad basal end of the palpi , and serving , apparently , to oppose the edge of mandible to mandible .
the maxillæ in the different genera ( pl .
x , figs .
9 to 15 ) differ considerably in outline ; they are generally about half the size of the mandibles ; at the upper corner , there are always two or three spines larger than the others , and often separated from them by a notch ; the rest of the spinose edge is straight , or irregular , or step-formed , or with the lowest part projecting , or with one or two narrow prominences bearing fine spines .
all these spines , quite differently from the teeth of the mandibles , are articulated on the edge of the organ , and stand in a double row .
at a point corresponding with the upper articulation of the mandibles , a long , thin , narrow , rigid <unk> , projects inwards ( fig .
10 ) , and running down nearly parallel to the thin , outer , flexible membrane of the mouth , is attached to the corium , and thus serves as a support to the whole organ .
this <unk> is embedded in muscles ( pl .
x , fig .
10 ) ; there are other large muscles attached to the inner side of the organ , and again others running laterally towards the mandibles .
the <unk> , of course , is moulted with the integuments of the mouth .
the outer maxillæ ( pl .
x , figs .
16 , 17 ) serve as a lower lip ; they are thicker than the other trophi ; they have their inner surfaces clothed with spines , sometimes divided into an upper and lower group , and occasionally separated by a deep notch : there are often long bristles outside .
they are furnished with at least two muscles ; in sessile cirripedes i have seen that they are capable of a rapid to and fro movement , and i have no doubt that their function is to brush any small creature , caught by the cirri , towards the maxillæ , which are well adapted to aid in securing the prey , and to hand it over to the mandibles , by them to be forced down the oesophagus .
on the exterior face of the outer maxillæ , above a trace of an upper articulation , either two small orifices or two large tubular projections can always be discovered ; and these , as <name> presently be mentioned , i believe to be olfactory organs .
cirri.  the five posterior pair are seated close to each other and equidistant ; the first pair is generally seated at a little distance , and sometimes at a considerable distance from the second pair .
the first pair is the shortest ; the others , proceeding backwards , increase gradually in length .
the rami of each pair are either equal in length or slightly unequal : those of the first pair are oftenest unequal .
the number of segments in the posterior cirri is sometimes very great ; in one species of alepas , there were above sixty segments in one ramus , the other ramus being in this unique case ( pl .
x , fig .
28 ) small and rudimentary .
the pedicels consist of two segments , a lower , longer , and upper short one ( fig .
18 , c , d . )
in the usual arrangement of the spines on the segments of the three posterior pair of cirri , there are ( figs .
26 , 27 ) from three to six pair of long spines on the anterior face , with generally some minute spines ( occasionally forming a tuft ) intermediate between them : on the dorsal surface , in the uppermost part of each segment , there is a tuft of short spines generally mingled with some longer , finer ones : on the inner side of each segment , on the upper rim , there are generally a few extremely minute and short spines .
from the increase of these latter and of the intermediate spines , the <unk> faces of the segments of the first cirrus , and of the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus ( pl .
x , fig .
25 ) , are almost always thickly paved with <unk> masses of spines .
the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the third cirrus is generally , though not always , thus paved : these paved segments are much broader than the others .
the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are often in some slight degree paved , though in other cases they resemble the three posterior pair of cirri .
the two segments of the pedicels have bristles on their anterior faces , essentially arranged on the same plan as on the segments of the rami : the bristles are generally not so symmetrically arranged on the pedicels of the second and third cirri , as on the three posterior pair .
there are some exceptions to the foregoing general rules : in the posterior cirri of alepas cornuta , there is only one pair of long spines to each segment ( fig .
28 ) ; in dichelaspis <unk> , there are eight pair ; in lepas fascicularis , in old specimens , the segments are paved with a triangular brush of spines ; the upper segments in pæcilasma eburnea support small oblong brushes ; and , lastly , in pæcilasma fissa ( fig .
29 ) , and crassa , the spines form a single circle round each segment , interrupted on the two sides .
these spines are often doubly serrated or plumose : many of them on the protuberant segments of the first three pair of cirri , are sometimes coarsely and doubly pectinated .
caudal appendages.  these are present ( pl .
x , figs .
18 to 24 ) seated on each side of the anus , in all the genera , except in conchoderma , anelasma , and scalpellum villosum ; they consist of a very small single segment , destitute of spines in lepas , and spinose in pæcilasma , dichelaspis , <unk> , scalpellum , and some species of pollicipes ; they consist of several segments in alepas , ibla , lithotrya , and in some species of pollicipes .
in the latter genus , some species have their caudal appendages <unk> , though so obscurely articulated , that the passage ( fig .
22 ) from several to one segment is seen to be easily effected .
when the appendage consists of many articulations , it is generally about as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus ; but in ibla quadrivalvis , it is four times as long .
the segments are narrow , slightly flattened , much tapering ; each ( fig .
24 ) is surmounted by a ring of short spines , which are generally longest on the apex of the terminal segment .
i could never trace muscles into these appendages .
alimentary <unk>  the oesophagus is of considerable length : it is formed of strong , transparent , much folded membrane , continuous with the outer integuments , and moulted with them : it is surrounded by corium , and as already stated , by numerous muscles : at its lower end it expands into a <name> , with the edges reflexed , and sometimes sinuous : this <name> lies within the stomach , and keeps the upper broad end expanded .
according to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle , the oesophagus runs in a more or less parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri , and enters the stomach more or less obliquely .
in ibla alone , it passes exteriorly to , and over the adductor scutorum muscle .
the stomach lies in a much curved , almost doubled course ; it is often a little constricted where most bent ; it is broadest at the upper end , and here , in lepas and conchoderma , there are some deep branching cæca ; in the latter of these two genera , the whole surface is , in addition , pitted in transverse lines .
the stomach is coated by small , opaque , pulpy , slightly <unk> glands , believed to be <unk> ; these are arranged in longitudinal lines , in all the genera , except in alepas , in which they are transverse and <unk> : the whole stomach is thus coated .
there is , also , a coating of excessively delicate , longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ .
the <unk> varies in length , extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri : it is narrow , and formed of much folded transparent membrane , resembling the oesophagus , continuous with the outer integuments , with which it is periodically moulted .
the anus is a small longitudinal slit , in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen , let in between the last thoracic tergal arches , as already mentioned under the head of the metamorphoses ; it lies almost between the caudal appendages , and opens on the dorsal surface .
within the stomach , there can generally be plainly seen , in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken , a thin , yet strong , perfectly transparent <unk> membrane , not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure : it enters the branching cæca , and extends from the edge of the <name> of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed <unk> , and consequently terminates in a point : it consists of chitine , like the outer integuments of the animal , and by placing the whole body in caustic potash , i have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach , and seen the bag open at its upper end , perfectly preserved , floating in the middle of the body , and full of the debris of the food .
in most of the specimens which i have examined , preserved in spirits of wine , this <unk> lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach ; and hence was thought by m. <name> st. <unk> to be a distinct organ , like the closed tube in certain <unk> .
occasionally , i have seen one imperfect <unk> bag or tube within another and <unk> one .
digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach ; if there be any difference , the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part .
the prey , consisting generally of crustacea , infusoria , minute spiral <unk> , and often of the larvæ of cirripedes , is not triturated : when the nutritious <unk> have been absorbed , the <unk> are cast out through the anus , all kept together in the <unk> bag , which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach , with the exception of that part coated by the <name> of the oesophagus .
i have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong , for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire , so as not to <unk> the sack .
i believe lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus ; at least , i found in one case , many <unk> small crustaceans in the sack , and others of the same kind in the stomach .
<unk> system.  i can add hardly anything to what little has been given by m. <name> st. <unk> : like others , i have failed , as yet , in discovering a heart .
the whole body is <unk> by channels , which have not any proper coat : there is one main channel along the ventral surface of the thorax , dividing and surrounding the mouth , and giving out branches which enter the inner of the two channels in each cirrus : as <unk> has shown , there are also two channels in the penis .
there are two <unk> channels in the prosoma , which are in direct connection with the great main channel , running down the rostral ( i .
e. , ventral ) side of the peduncle .
this latter main channel branches out in the lower part , and transmits the fluid through the ovarian tubes , whence , i believe , it flows upwards and round the sack , <unk> the body near the sides of the adductor scutorum muscle .
the main rostral channel ( or artery ? )
in the uppermost part of the peduncle , has a depending curtain , which , i think , must act as a valve , so as to prevent the circulating fluid <unk> into the animal 's body during the <unk> of the peduncle .
nervous system and organs of <unk>  in most of the genera , there are six main ganglia , namely , the supra-oesophageal , and five thoracic ganglia ; but in pollicipes mitella there are only four thoracic ganglia .
of these , the first thoracic or <unk> ganglion is considerably the largest and most massive ; it is <unk> , or oval , or <unk> ; it presents no trace of being formed by the union of two lateral ganglia .
two great nerves spring from its under side ( a ) , represented in the woodcut on <name> 49 , by dotted lines , and run straight down amongst the viscera in the prosoma : these nerves are about as large as those forming the collar and those running to the second ganglion ; hence , six great nerves meet here , two in front , two behind , and two on the under side .
at the anterior end , over the junction with the collar chord , three <unk> nerves rise on each side , with a fourth , smaller one , outside ; these go to the trophi and to the two olfactory sacks .
at the posterior end , on each side , a pair of nerves branch out rectangularly , one of which ( a , ) goes to the first cirrus , and there divides into two branches ; of these , the upper runs up the cirrus , and the lower one downwards .
the other nerve ( b ) , proceeding on each side from this first thoracic ganglion , runs to the muscles beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus .
the collar surrounding the oesophagus is generally very long , sometimes equalling the whole thoracic chord ; at a middle point , a small branch is sent off , and at the anterior end ( e , e ) , close to the supra-oesophageal ganglia , double or treble fine branches run to the true ovaria , lying close to the upper end of the stomach .
the four ( or only three ) other thoracic ganglia , when viewed as transparent bodies , are seen to be solid ; but in some of the genera , as in conchoderma , the outline plainly shows , that each consists of a lateral pair fused together .
the second thoracic ganglion ( b ) is rather small ; it is either close to the first , as in pollicipes mitella and lepas fascicularis , or far distant , as in ibla .
the third ( c ) and fourth are of about the same size with the second : these three ganglia send large branches to the second , third , and fourth pair of cirri : other minute branches spring from their under sides , and from the intermediate double chords .
the fifth ganglion is larger and longer than the three preceding ones , and gives off nerves to the fifth and sixth pair of cirri ; it is clearly formed by the union of the fifth , with what ought to have formed a sixth ganglion .
the two nerves going to the sixth cirrus give off on their inner sides , each a great branch to the penis .
in pollicipes mitella , in which there are only four instead of five thoracic ganglia , it is evident from the outline and position of the nerves going to the fourth pair of cirri , that the fourth ganglion is fused into the fifth , itself , as we have just seen , normally composed of two consecutive ganglia .
in this pollicipes there is other evidence of concentration in the nervous system , for none of the ganglia show signs of being formed of lateral pairs ; the second is close to the first ; and the abdominal double chord is in part separated by a mere cleft ; lastly , as we shall immediately see , the same remark is applicable to the supra-oesophageal ganglia .
the latter ( d ) alone remain to be described ; they present far more diversity in shape than do the thoracic ganglia ; they are almost always seen in outline to be laterally distinct , and usually resemble two pears with their tapering ends cut off and united ; in a transverse line they are as long as the <unk> ganglion , but are much less massive .
in lepas fascicularis ( d ) , they are pear-shaped ; in pollicipes mitella they are globular , and separated by a third globular ganglion , which i believe is the ophthalmic ganglion , presently to be described ; in pollicipes spinosus , however , the ophthalmic ganglion is , as usual , placed in advance of the supra-oesophageal ganglion , which latter , in this one species , shows no sign of being formed of a lateral pair fused together .
in alepas cornuta the supra-oesophageal ganglion consists of two quite distinct ganglia , elongated in the longitudinal axis of the body , and separated from each other by the whole width of the mouth ; the chord which unites them is of the same thickness as the rest of the collar .
in all the genera , from the front of each of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia , a pair of nerves , ( f , f , ) united and together as large as the collar nerve , rises , and can be traced running <unk> , in a nearly straight line , for a length equalling the whole rest of the nervous chord , so as to supply the peduncle and the inside of the capitulum or sack .
at the inner ends of these two same ganglia , from a central point where they are united , a little central branch runs in front to the adductor scutorum and other adjoining muscles ; and still smaller <unk> run behind to the <unk> muscles .

ophthalmic ganglia and <unk>  owing to professor <unk> 's [ 16 ] discovery of eyes in a balanus , i was led to look for them in the lepadidæ .
extending from the front of the two supra-oesophageal ganglia , two chords may be seen in lepas fascicularis ( of which a rude diagram is here given ) , to run into two small , perfectly distinct oval ganglia ( e ) , which are not united by any transverse <unk> .
from the opposite ends of these two ganglia smaller nerves run , and , bending inwards at right angles , enter , beyond the middle , an elongated ( f ) , almost black , eye , composed of two eyes united together .
although in outline the eye appears single , two lenses can be distinctly seen at the end , directed upwards and towards the ganglia ; two <unk> can also be distinguished ; these are deep and <unk> , and of a dark <unk> .

in conchoderma aurita the ophthalmic ganglia are much smaller , and nearer to the supra-oesophageal ganglion , than in l .
fascicularis .
in alepas cornuta the ophthalmic chords run towards each other from the two distant and separate supra-oesophageal ganglia ; and the ophthalmic ganglia , ( instead of being quite separate , as in l .
fascicularis , ) are united by their front ends , and the two eyes instead of standing some way in front , with nerves running to them , are embedded on the double ophthalmic ganglion ; the <unk> here , also , have the shape of mere saucers , and are joined back to back , with the two lenses projecting far out of them .
in neither sex of ibla could i perceive that the eye was double .
in pollicipes spinosus the ophthalmic ganglion stands in front of the single supra-oesophageal ganglion , and shows no signs of being formed of a lateral pair ; the eyes themselves , however , differently from , in all the foregoing cases , are , though approximate , quite distinct .
in pollicipes mitella i did not see the eyes ; but the ophthalmic ganglion consists , as i believe , of a single globular one , placed exactly between the two globular , supra-oesophageal ganglia , all three being of nearly equal size .
professor <unk> does not mention the ophthalmic ganglia ; hence i infer that in balanus , which is a more highly organised cirripede , they are fused into the supra-oesophageal ganglion .
in all the genera , the double eye is seated deep within the body ; it is attached by fibrous tissue to the radiating muscles of the lowest part of the oesophagus , and lies actually on the upper part of the stomach ; consequently , a <name> of light , to reach the eye , has to pass through the exterior membrane and underlying corium connecting the two scuta , and to penetrate deeply into the body .
in living sessile cirripedes , vision seems confined to the perception of the shadow of an object passing between them and the light ; they instantly perceived a hand passed quickly at the distance of several feet between a candle and the basin in which they were placed .
as the <unk> ganglion sends nerves to the trophi and to the first pair of cirri , it must correspond to the segments , from the fourth to the ninth inclusive , of the <unk> crustacean .
the state of the supra-oesophageal and ophthalmic ganglia appears to me very interesting : i do not believe that in any mature ordinary crustacean , the first or ophthalmic ganglion can be shown to be distinct from the two succeeding ganglia , or to be itself composed of a pair laterally distinct .
the ganglia , corresponding with the second and third segments of the body , which should normally support two pair of antennæ , are in the lepadidæ united together ; but laterally they are generally distinct in outline , and are actually separate in alepas : the supra-oesophageal ganglion shows also its double nature , by giving rise to a pair of large double nerves , evidently corresponding with the two pair of <unk> nerves in ordinary crustaceans .
the embryonic condition of the whole supra-oesophageal portion of the nervous system in the lepadidæ , corresponds with the rudimentary state of the only organ of sense supplied by it , namely , the eye , which in size and general appearance has <unk> to the state in which it was in , during the first stage of development of the larva ;  i have used the term embryonic , because , in the embryos of ordinary crustacea , all the ganglia are at first longitudinally distinct , and laterally quite separate .
the conclusion at which we before arrived from studying the metamorphoses , namely , that the whole peduncle and capitulum consisted of the first three segments of the head , is beautifully supported by the structure of the nervous system , in which these parts are seen to be supplied with nerves exclusively from the supra-oesophageal ganglion : now in ordinary crustacea the supra-oesophageal ganglion sends nerves to the eyes and the two pair of antennæ corresponding , as is known by embryological <unk> , to the first three segments of the body .
moreover , it is asserted that the carapace which covers the thorax in crustacea , is not formed by the development of the first segment ; and this , likewise , may be inferred to be the case with the peduncle and capitulum in the lepadidæ , as the nerves of the ophthalmic ganglia go exclusively to the eyes .
finally , i may remark that in pollicipes , looking to the whole nervous system , the state of concentration nearly equals that in certain <unk> <unk> crustaceans , for instance the <unk> <unk> , of which a figure is given by milne edwards .
olfactory <unk>  in the outer maxillæ , at their bases where united together , but above the basal fold separating the mouth from the body , there are , in all the genera , a pair of orifices ( pl .
x , fig .
16 ) ; these are sometimes seated on a slight prominence , as in lithotrya , or on the summit of flattened tubes ( pl .
x , fig .
17 ) , projecting upwards and towards each other , as in ibla , scalpellum , and pollicipes .
in ibla these tubular projections rise from almost between the outer and inner maxillæ .
it is impossible to behold these organs , and doubt that they are of high functional importance to the animal .
the orifice leads into a deep sack lined by pulpy corium , and closed at the bottom .
the outer integument is inflected inwards , ( hence periodically moulted , ) and becoming of excessive tenuity , runs to near the bottom of the sack , where it ends in an open tube : so excessively thin is this inflected membrane , that , until examining anelasma , i was not quite certain that i was right in believing that the outer integument did not extend over the whole bottom .
i several times saw a nerve of considerable size entering and blending into a pulpy layer at the bottom of the sack of corium ; but i failed in tracing to which of the three pair of nerves , springing from the front end of the <unk> ganglion , it joined .
i can hardly avoid concluding , that this closed sack , with its naked bottom , is an organ of sense ; and , considering that the outer maxillæ serve to <name> the prey entangled by the cirri towards the maxillæ and mandibles , the position seems so admirably adapted for an olfactory organ , whereby the animal could at once perceive the nature of any floating object thus caught , that i have ventured provisionally to designate the two orifices and sacks as olfactory .
acoustic ( ? )
<unk>  a little way beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 d , and pl .
iv , fig .
2 e ) , on each side , there may be seen a slight swelling , and on the under side of this , a transverse <unk> orifice , <unk> of an inch in length in conchoderma , but often only half that size .
in ibla this orifice is seated lower down ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , e ) , between the bases of the first and second cirri , which are here far apart : in alepas cornuta it is placed rather nearer to the adductor scutorum muscle , namely , beneath the mandibles .
the orifice leads into a rather deep and wide meatus ; the external integument is turned in for a short distance , widening a little , and then ends abruptly .
the meatus , enlarging upwards , is lined by thick pulpy corium , and is closed at the upper end ; from its summit is suspended a flattened sack of singular and different shapes in the different genera .
this , the so-called acoustic sack of conchoderma virgata , is figured pl .
ix , fig .
6 .
the deep and wide notch faces towards the posterior end of the animal ; the inferior lobe , thus almost cut off , is flattened in a different plane from the upper part ; the lobe is lodged in a little pouch of corresponding form , leading from the open meatus in which the upper part is included .
in conchoderma aurita , the top of the acoustic sack is narrower and more constricted , the whole more rounded , and the lobe more turned down .
in lepas fascicularis the notch is not so deep or wide , and the lobe larger .
in ibla cumingii the sack is of the shape of a vase , with one corner folded over .
in scalpellum vulgare it is small , oval , with the lower end much pushed in , and furnished with a little crest .
lastly , in pollicipes mitella it is simply oval .
in all cases the sack is empty , or contains only a little pulpy matter : it consists of brownish , thick , and remarkably elastic tissue , formed , apparently , of transverse little pillars , becoming fibrous on the outside , and with their inner ends appearing like <unk> points .
the mouth of the acoustic sack ( removed in the drawing ) is closed by a tender diaphragm , through which i saw what i believe was a <unk> nerve enter ; i have not yet succeeded in tracing this nerve .
the first pair of cirri seem , to a certain extent , to serve as antennæ , and therefore the position of an acoustic organ at their bases , is analogous to what takes place in crustacea ; but there are not here any <unk> , or the siliceous particles and hairs , as described by dr. <unk> , in that class .
nevertheless , the sack is so highly elastic , and its suspension in a meatus freely open to the water , seems so well adapted for an acoustic organ , that i have provisionally thus called it .
in the larva , as i have shown , a pouch , certainly serving for some sense , i believe for hearing , is seated in quite a different position at the anterior end of the carapace .
i may mention that i found sessile cirripedes very sensitive of vibrations in objects adjoining them , though not , apparently , of noises in the air or water .
in a group of specimens , i could not touch one even most delicately with a needle , without all the adjoining ones instantly withdrawing their cirri ; it made no difference if the one touched had its <unk> already closed and motionless .
reproductive system ,  male <unk>  all the cirripedia which i have hitherto examined , with the exception of certain species of ibla and scalpellum , are hermaphrodite or <unk> .
[ 17 ] i shall so fully describe the sexual relations of the several species of these two genera , under their respective headings , and at the end of the genus of scalpellum , that i <name> not here give even an abstract of the grounds on which my firm belief is based , that the masculine power of certain hermaphrodite species of ibla and scalpellum , is rendered more efficient by certain parasitic males , which , from their not pairing , as in all hitherto known cases , with females , but with hermaphrodites , i have designated complemental males .
[ 17 ] i am compelled to differ greatly from the account given by prof. steenstrup of the reproductive system in the cirripedia , in his <unk> <unk> das <unk> des <unk> , ch .
v , 1846 ;  a translation of which i have seen , owing to the great kindness of mr. <unk> .
mr. <unk> has described ( <unk> .
new <name> .
journal , ' july 1843 , ) what he considers the male of balanus ; but i have seen this same parasitic creature charged with ova , including larvæ !
from the resemblance of the larvæ to the little crustacean described by mr. <unk> , in the same paper , as a distinct parasite , i believe the latter to be the male of his so-called male balanus , and that all belong to the same species , allied to <unk> .
this genus , as is well known , is parasitic on other crustacea ; and it is a rather interesting fact thus to find , that this new parasite which is allied to <unk> , in structure , is likewise allied to it in habits , living attached to cirripedia , a <unk> of the crustacea .
the male organs have been well described by m. <name> st. <unk> , whose observations have since been confirmed by r .
wagner .
[ 18 ] the testes are small , often <unk> , either pear or <unk> , or branched like <unk> ,  these several forms sometimes occurring in the same individual ; they coat the stomach , enter the pedicels , and even the basal segments of the rami of the cirri , and in some genera occupy certain <unk> on the thorax and prosoma , and in others the filamentary appendages : the testes seen in the apex in one of these appendages in conchoderma , is represented in pl .
ix , fig .
5 .
the two vesiculæ seminales are very large ; they lie along the abdominal surface of the thorax , and generally ( but not in some species of scalpellum ) enter the prosoma , where their broad ends are often reflexed ; here the branched vessels leading from the testes enter .
the membrane of the vesiculæ seminales is formed of circular fibres ; and is , i presume , <unk> , for i have seen the spermatozoa expelled with force from the cut end of a living specimen .
the two canals leading from the vesiculæ generally unite in a single <unk> at the base of the penis ; but in conchoderma aurita , half-way up it .
the probosciformed penis , except in certain species of scalpellum , is very long ; it is capable of the most varied movements ; it is generally hairy , especially at the end ; it is supported on a straight <unk> basis , which in ibla quadrivalvis alone ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) , is of considerable length ; in this species , the upper part is seen to be as plainly articulated as one of the cirri ; in alepas , the articulations are somewhat less plain , and in the other genera , the organ can be said only to be finely ringed , but these rings no doubt are in fact obscure articulations .
in the females of ibla cumingii and scalpellum ornatum , there is , of course , no penis .
[ 18 ] in <unk> 's <unk> , ' 1834 , p. 467 .
i have already several times referred to m. <name> st. <unk> 's excellent memoir , read before the academy of sciences , and subsequently , in 1835 , published separately .
female <unk>  m. <name> st. <unk> has described how the peduncle [ 19 ] is gorged with an inextricable mass of branching ovarian tubes , filled with granular matter and immature ova .
in conchoderma and alepas , the ovarian tubes run up in a single plane ( pl .
ix , fig .
3 , ) between the two folds of corium round the sack .
here the development of the ova can be well followed : a minute point first branches out from one of the tubes ; its head then enlarges , like the <name> of a <unk> on a footstalk ; becomes globular ; shows traces of dividing , and at last splits into three , four , or five <unk> balls , which finally separate as perfect ova .
within the peduncle , the ovarian tubes branch out in all directions , and within the footstalks of the branches ( differently from what takes place round the sack ) , ova are developed , as well as at their ends .
close together , along the rostral ( i .
e. , ventral ) edge of the peduncle , two nearly straight , main ovarian tubes or ducts may be detected , which do not give out any branches till about half way down the peduncle , where they <unk> into branches , which <unk> together , and give rise to the mass filling the peduncle , and sometimes , as we have just seen , sending up branches round the sack .
these two main <unk> ovarian ducts , followed up the peduncle , are seen to enter the body of the cirripede ( close along side the great double <unk> nerves ) , and then separating , they sweep in a large curve along each flank of the prosoma , under the superficial muscles , towards the bases of the first pair of cirri ; and then rising up , they run into two glandular masses .
these latter rest on the upper edge of the stomach , and touch the cæca where such exist ; they were thought by cuvier to be <unk> glands .
they are of an orange colour , and form two , parallel , <unk> masses , having , in conchoderma , a great flexure , and generally dividing at the end near the mouth into a few blunt branches .
i was not able to ascertain whether the two main ducts , coming from the peduncle , expanded to envelope them , or what the precise connection was .
the state of these two masses varied much ; sometimes they were hollow , with only their walls spotted with a few cellular little masses ; at other times they contained or rather were formed of , more or less globular or <unk> <unk> of pulpy matter ; and lastly , the whole consisted of separate pointed little balls , each with a large inner cell , and this again with two or three included granules .
these so closely resembled , in general appearance and size , the <unk> with their <unk> vesicles and spots , which i have often seen at the first commencement of the formation of the ova in the ovarian tubes in the peduncle , that i can not doubt that such is their nature .
hence i conclude , that these two <unk> masses are the true ovaria .
i may add , that several times i have seen in the two long , <unk> ducts , connecting the true ovaria and the ovarian tubes in the peduncle , pellets of orange-coloured cellular matter ( i .
e. , <unk> ) forming at short intervals little <unk> in the ducts , and apparently travelling into the peduncle .
[ 19 ] i may here mention , that in all sessile cirripedes , the ovarian branching tubes lie between the calcareous or membranous basis and the inner basal lining of the sack , and to a certain height upwards round the sack : the true ovaria and the two ducts occupy the same position as in the lepadidæ .
the structure here described is quite conformable with that which we have seen in the larva ; in the latter , two <unk> masses of equal thickness extended from the cæca of the stomach to within the future peduncle , where the cement-ducts entered them , and where , after a short period , they were seen to expand into a mass of ovarian tubes .
in the mature cirripede , the cement-ducts can still be found united to the ovarian tubes in the middle of peduncle ; and the cause of the wide separation of the true ovaria and ovarian tubes , can be simply accounted for by the internal , almost complete intersection of the animal , which takes place during the last metamorphosis .
the ova , when excluded , remain in the sack of the animal until the larvæ are hatched ; they are very numerous , and generally form two concave , nearly circular , leaves , which i have called after steenstrup and other authors , the ovigerous lamellæ ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 b ) .
these lamellæ lie low down on each side of the sack : in conchoderma virgata , however , there is often only a single <unk> , forming a deeply concave cup : in c .
aurita there are generally on each side four lamellæ , one under the other .
the ova lie in a layer from two to four deep ; and all are held together by a most delicate transparent membrane , which separately <unk> each <unk> : this membrane is often thicker and stronger round the margins of the lamellæ , where they are united , in a peculiar manner , presently to be described , to a fold of skin , on each side of the sack : these two folds , i have called the ovigerous fræna ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) .
m. <name> st. <unk> , describes an orifice under the <name> , by which he supposes the ova to enter the sack ; this , after repeated and most careful examinations , i venture to affirm does not exist ; on the contrary , i have every reason to believe that the ova enter the sack in the following curious manner .
immediately before one of the periods of exuviation , the ova burst forth from the the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and round the sack , and , carried along the open <unk> channels , are collected ( by means unknown to me ) beneath the <unk> of the sack , in the corium , which is at this period remarkably spongy and full of cavities .
the corium then forms or rather ( as i believe ) resolves itself into the very delicate membrane separately enveloping each <unk> , and uniting them together into two lamellæ ; the corium having thus far retreated , then forms under the lamellæ the <unk> of the sack , which <name> of course be of larger size than the <unk> one , now immediately to be moulted with the other integuments of the body .
as soon as this exuviation is effected , the tender ova , united into two lamellæ , and adhering , as yet , to the bottom of the sack , are exposed : as the membranes <unk> , the lamellæ become detached from the bottom of the sack , and are attached to the ovigerous fræna .
to demonstrate this view , an individual should have been found , with both the old and new chitine tunic of the sack , and with the lamellæ lying between them ; this , i believe , i have seen , but it was before i understood the full importance of the fact : a great number of specimens would have to be examined in order to succeed again , for the changes connected with exuviation <unk> very quickly .
i have , however , several times found the ova so loose under the sack , as to be detached with a touch from the ovarian tubes ; and i have twice carefully examined specimens , which had just moulted , as shown by even the mandibles being flexible , in which the lamellæ had not become united to the fræna , but still adhered to the <unk> chitine tunic of the sack ; in these , the ova were so tender , that they broke into pieces rather than be separated from the membrane of the <unk> , itself hardly perfectly developed , for pulpy cellular matter adhered outside some of the ova .
these and other facts are quite inexplicable on any other view than that advanced .
as the lamellæ are formed without organic union with the parent , they would be liable to be washed out of the widely open sack of the lepadidæ , if they had not been specially attached to the fræna .
these fræna consist of a pair of more or less semicircular folds of skin , depending inside the sack , on each side of the point of attachment of the body .
the fræna are often of considerable size , but in ibla , they are very minute ; they are formed of chitine tunic with underlying corium , like the rest of the sack ; on their crests , there is a row , or a set of circular groups , or a broad surface , covered , either with minute , pointed , bead-like bodies mounted on long <unk> footstalks , or with <unk> bodies on very short footstalks .
i measured some of the bead-like bodies , in lepas anserifera , and they were <unk> of an inch in diameter , and the footstalks three or four times as long as the elongated heads .
these heads , of whatever shape they may be , have an opaque , and , i believe , glandular centre ; i could not make out with certainty an aperture at their ends , but , i believe , such exists , and they seem to secrete a substance , which <unk> into a strong membrane , serving to unite the crest of the <unk> to the edges of the lamellæ .
in one case , this bit of membrane seemed formed of a woven mass of threads .
these little glandular bodies , with the membrane formed by them , are cast off at each exuviation , and new glands formed on the crest of the <unk> underneath .
in some species of pollicipes , ( viz. , p .
cornucopia and elegans , ) the fræna , though present and large , are functionless and destitute of the glands : i believe , they exist in this same functionless condition , and in rather a different position in the sessile cirripedes , and that in this family they serve as branchiæ .
the above-described method by which cirripedia lay their eggs , namely , united together in a common membrane , placed between their old outer and new inner integuments , and the manner in which the lamellæ , when thus formed , are retained for a time fastened to the fræna , and are then cast off , appears to me very curious .
in some of the lower crustacea , it is known , that the ova escape by <unk> the <unk> formed by the protruded ovarian tubes , and this is the nearest analogy with which i am acquainted .
the ova are impregnated ( as i infer from the state of the vesiculæ seminales ) , when first brought into the sack , and whilst the membrane of the lamellæ is very tender : the long probosciformed penis seems well adapted for this end .
in the male of ibla cumingii , which has not a probosciformed penis , the whole flexible body , probably , performs the function of the penis : in scalpellum ornatum , however , the spermatozoa must be brought in by the action of the cirri , or of the currents produced by them .
that cross impregnation may and sometimes does take place , i infer from the singular case of an individual , in a group of <unk> , in which the penis had been cut off , and had healed without any perforation ; notwithstanding which fact , larvæ were included in the ova .
exuviation ; rate of growth ; size.  i have had occasion repeatedly to allude to the exuviation of the lepadidæ : with the exception of the genus lithotrya , [ 20 ] in which the calcareous scales on the peduncle , together with the membrane connecting them , is cast off , neither the valves nor the membrane uniting them , nor that forming the peduncle with its scales and styles , are moulted ; but the surface gradually <unk> and is removed , perhaps sometimes in flakes , whilst new and larger layers are formed beneath .
in scalpellum , i ascertained that the new membrane , connecting together the <unk> calcified rims under the valves of the capitulum , was formed as a fold , with the articulated spines which it bears , all <unk> in certain definite directions .
this fold of new membrane , when the old membrane splits and yields , of course expands , and thus the size of the capitulum is increased .
in the peduncle , lines of splitting can seldom be perceived , except , indeed , in the <unk> , embedded , <unk> peduncle of anelasma , as described under that genus .
i do not understand what determines the complicated lines of splitting of the old membrane between the several valves of the capitulum ,  without it be simply , that along these lines alone , the old membrane is not strengthened by the new membrane being closely applied under it , the new being formed , as we have just said , in a fold , in order to allow of increase in size .
although , as i believe , there is strictly no exuviation in the outer membranes of mature lepadidæ , it seems that narrow strips of membrane are cast off from between the valves , for the few first moults , after the final metamorphosis of the larva .
i may here remark that , in most sessile cirripedes , the outside membrane connecting the <unk> and shell , is regularly moulted .
[ 20 ] the external integuments being moulted in crustacea , but not in the cirripedia , may appear , at first , an important difference : but we here see that <unk> is not universal amongst the lepadidæ , and , on the other hand , according to m. <unk> , ( 'annales des sciences <unk> , ' 2d series , zoolog .
) , there is one true crustacean , the <name> <unk> , which has a persistent <unk> shell .
the delicate tunic lining the sack , ( a mere <unk> of that thick one , forming the outside of the capitulum , and generally transformed into valves , ) and the integuments of the whole body , are regularly moulted .
with these integuments , the membrane lining the oesophagus , the <unk> , and the deep olfactory pouches , and the horny <unk> of the maxillæ , are all cast together .
i have seen a specimen of lepas , in which , from some morbid adhesion , the old membrane lining one of the olfactory pouches had not been moulted , but remained projecting from the orifice as a brown shrivelled scroll .
the new spines on the cirri ( and on the maxillæ ) are formed within the old ones ; but as they have to be a little longer than the latter , and as they can not enter these up to their very points , their basal portions are not thus included , but are formed , running obliquely across the segments of the cirri ; and what is curious , these same basal portions are turned inside out , like the fingers of a glove when hastily drawn off .
after the exuviation of the old spines , the new spines have their inverted basal portions drawn out from within the segments , and turned outside in , so as to assume their proper positions .
all cirripedia grow rapidly : the yawl of h. m. s. beagle was lowered into the water , at the galapagos archipelago , on the 15th of <name> , and , after an interval of exactly thirty-three days , was hauled in : i found on her bottom , a specimen of conchoderma virgata with the capitulum and peduncle , each half an inch in length , and the former <unk> in width : this is half the size of the largest specimen i have seen of this species : several other individuals , not half the size of the above , contained numerous ova in their lamellæ , ready to burst forth .
supposing the larva of the largest specimen became attached the first day the boat was put into the water , we have the metamorphosis , an increase of length from about <unk> , the size of the larva , to an whole inch , and the laying of probably several sets of eggs , all effected in thirty-three days .
from this rapid growth , repeated <unk> must be requisite .
mr. w. thompson , of belfast , kept twenty specimens of balanus <unk> , a form of much slower growth , alive , and on the twelfth day he found the <unk> integument , showing that all had moulted once , and one individual twice within this period .
i may here add , that the pedunculated cirripedes never attain so large a bulk as the sessile ; lepas anatifera is sometimes sixteen inches in length , but of this , the far greater portion consists of the peduncle .
pollicipes mitella is the most massive kind ; i have seen a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch in width .
affinities.  considering the close affinity between the several genera , there are , i conceive , no grounds for dividing the lepadidæ into sub-families , as has been proposed by some authors , who have trusted exclusively to external characters .
in establishing the eleven genera in the lepadidæ , no one part or set of organs affords sufficient <unk> characters : the number of the valves is the most obvious , and one of the most useful characters , but it fails when the valves are nearly rudimentary , and when they are numerous : the direction of their lines of growth is more important , and fails to be characteristic only in scalpellum : with the same exception , the presence or <unk> of calcified or horny scales on the peduncle is a good generic character .
for this same end , the shape of the scuta and <name> , but not of the other valves , comes into play .
in three genera , the presence of filamentary appendages on the animal 's body is generic ; in pollicipes , however , they are found only on three out of the six species .
the number of teeth in the mandibles , and the shape of the maxillæ , often prove serviceable for this end ; as does more generally the presence of caudal appendages , and whether they be naked or spinose , <unk> or <unk> ; in pollicipes alone this part is variable , being <unk> <unk> ; and in one species of scalpellum they are absent , though present in all the others .
the shape of the body , the absence or presence of teeth on the labrum , the inner edge of the outer maxillæ being notched or straight , the prominence of the olfactory orifices , the arrangement of the spines on the cirri , and the number and form of their segments , are only of specific value .
comparing the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes , it is , i think , impossible to assign them a higher rank than that of families .
the chief difference between them consists , in the lepadidæ , in the presence of three layers of <unk> muscles , longitudinal , transverse and oblique , continuously surrounding the peduncle , but not specially attached to the scuta and terga ; and on the other hand , in the <unk> , of five longitudinal bundles of voluntary muscles , with transverse striæ , fixed to the scuta and terga , and giving them powers of independent movement .
in the lepadidæ , the lower valves , or when such are absent , the membranous walls of the capitulum , move with the scuta and terga when opened or shut ; and the lower part of the capitulum is separated by a <unk> peduncle from the surface of attachment ; in the sessile cirripedes , the lower valves are firmly united together into an immovable ring , fixed <unk> on the surface of attachment .
i <name> not compare the softer parts , such as the cirri and trophi , of the lepadidæ with those of the <unk> , as my examination of this latter family is not fully completed : i <name> only remark , that there is a very close general resemblance , more especially with the <unk> <unk> .
geographical range ; <unk>  the pedunculated cirripedes extend over the whole world ; and most of the individual species have large ranges , more especially , as might have been expected , those attached to floating objects ; excepting these latter , the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate , and tropical seas .
of those attached to fixed objects , or to littoral animals , it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality .
on the shores of europe i know of only three , viz. , a scalpellum , pollicipes , and alepas .
at madeira ( owing to the admirable researches of the rev .
r. t. lowe ) , two <unk> , a dichelaspis , and an <unk> are known .
in new zealand , there are two pollicipes and an alepas , and , perhaps , a fourth form .
from the philippine archipelago , in the great collection made by mr. cuming , there are a pæcilasma , an ibla , a scalpellum , pollicipes , and lithotrya .
of all the lepadidæ , nearly half are attached to floating objects , or to animals which are able to change their positions ; the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies , and more frequently to the former than to the latter .
most of the species of scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water ; on the other hand , most of pollicipes , [ 21 ] of ibla , and lithotrya are littoral forms .
the species of lithotrya have the power of <unk> burrows in calcareous rocks , shells , and corals ; and the singular manner in which this is effected , is described under that genus .
anelasma has its <unk> peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of northern sharks ; and i have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of conchoderma aurita , being sunk into the skin of <unk> ; in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of ibla , is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female .
i believe in all these cases , the <unk> substance affects and <unk> the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic , whilst the surrounding parts , being not injured , continue to grow upwards , thus causing the partial <unk> of the cirripede .
in the case of anelasma , we have growth at the end of the peduncle , and consequently downward pressure , and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on .
[ 21 ] i am informed by mr. l. reeve that pollicipes mitella is eaten on the coast of <name> ; and <name> states ( <unk> .
<unk> , ' <unk> ) that this is the case with p .
cornucopia on the shores of <name> .
it is well known that the gigantic balanus <unk> on the chilian coast , is sought after as a delicacy ; and i am assured , by mr. cuming , that it deserves its reputation .
geological <unk>  having treated this subject at length , in the volume of the <unk> society for 1851 , i <name> not here enter on it : i <name> only remark , that the lepadidæ or pedunculated cirripedes are much more ancient , according to our present state of knowledge , than the <unk> .
the former seem to have been at their <unk> point during the cretaceous period , when many species of scalpellum and pollicipes , and a singular new genus , <unk> , existed ; pollicipes is the oldest genus , having been found in the lower <unk> , and , perhaps , even in the <unk> .
the fossil species do not appear to have differed widely from existing forms .

[ 22 ] linnæus , as is well known , included under this genus both the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes .
according to the rules of the british association , the name lepas must be retained for part of the genus ; and as the sessile division was named balanus , by <unk> and hill , even before the invention of the <unk> system , and subsequently , in <unk> , by da <unk> , and again , in <unk> , by <unk> , there can be no question that lepas must be applied to the pedunculated section of the genus .
in this instance it is particularly desirable to recur to the linnean name , as no other name has been generally adopted .
had not <unk> and sir j. hill published before the <unk> system , their names of anatifera and <unk> would have had prior claims to lepas .
[ 23 ] the date of this publication is almost universally given as <unk> , apparently caused by an error in the title-page of the first part , which has consequently been <unk> .
the first part contains anatifa and balanus , and was published in <unk> .
the second part was published in <unk> , and has a corrected title-page for the whole volume .
<unk> 5 , <unk> : <name> <unk> inter terga <unk> , <unk> aut <unk> <unk> aut <unk> <unk> <unk> : scuta <unk> , <unk> ad <unk> <unk> <unk> valves 5 , approximate : <name> extending up between the terga , terminating downwards in an embedded fork , or in an external disc : scuta sub-triangular , with their umbones at the rostral <name> .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulation of the first cirri ; mandibles with five teeth ; maxillæ step-formed ; caudal appendages <unk> , smooth .
<unk>  mundane ; attached to floating objects .
<unk>  capitulum flattened , sub-triangular , composed of five approximate valves .
the valves are either moderately thick and translucent , or very thin and transparent ; and hence , though themselves colourless , they are often coloured by the underlying corium .
their surfaces are either smooth and polished , or <unk> , or furrowed , and sometimes pectinated .
they are not subject to disintegration ; they are generally naked , except on the borders , where they are coated , and held together by membrane ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the valves are covered with thin membrane , bearing very minute spines .
the manner of growth of the valves <name> be best described under each .
all the valves , even in the same species , are subject to considerable variation in shape , more especially the terga .
<unk>  these valves are sub-triangular in outline , with the basal margin straight and rather short ; and with occludent and <unk> margins more or less protuberant ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the basal ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , and occludent margins are slightly reflexed and prominent .
a ridge , generally runs from the umbo to the upper point .
internally , there is no conspicuous pit for the adductor muscle ; under the umbones , there is generally either on both valves , or only on the right-hand side ( pl .
i , fig .
1 c ) , a small calcareous projection or tooth , of variable size and shape , even in the same species ; it is generally largest on the right-hand valve ; these teeth at first sight appear to form a hinge , uniting the opposite scuta at their umbones , but this is not really the case , and their use appears to be only to give attachment to the membrane uniting the valves together , and to the peduncle .
the basal margin is internally strengthened by a calcified rim , more or less developed .
the umbones ( and primordial valves when distinguishable , ) are seated at the rostral angles ; during growth the basal margin is not added to , and the occludent margin only to small extent ; hence the main growth of the valve is at the upper end , and along the <unk> margin .
in l .
fascicularis , however , the basal reflexed margin is slightly added to beneath the umbo .
terga ,  flat , small compared with the scuta , usually of an irregular quadrilateral figure , with the two upper or occludent margins very short , in proportion to the two ( carinal and scutal ) lower margins ; all the margins are nearly straight .
the two occludent margins , generally meet each other at about right angles , forming a small triangular projection ; in l .
fascicularis , however , the occludent margin is formed by a single , slightly curved line .
the umbones ( and primordial valves when distinguishable ) are not seated at the uppermost point , but at the <name> where the carinal margin unites to the upper of the two occludent margins : during growth the terga are added to , both on the occludent and on the scutal margins , and slightly along the carinal margin ; hence their growth is unequally <unk> , except at one <name> of the irregular quadrilateral figure .
<unk>  this is always very narrow and curved , concave within , often <unk> and barbed exteriorly ; it extends upwards between the terga for one half or two thirds of their length : at the lower extremity it ends ( with the exception of l .
fascicularis ) , in a small fork ( pl .
i , fig .
1 , a , b ) rectangularly inflected and embedded in the membrane , beneath the basal margin of the scuta .
from comparing this lower part of the <name> in l .
australis ( fig .
5 a ) , with the same part in some of the species of the allied genus pæcilasma , it would appear that the fork is formed by an oblong disc , more and more notched at the end , and with the rim between the two points more or less folded backwards : conformably with this view , in very young specimens of l .
australis , instead of a large and sharp fork , there is a small disc .
the only use of the fork appears to be to give firm attachment to the membrane uniting the valves and peduncle .
in l .
fascicularis , instead of a fork , there is a broad , oblong disc ( figs .
6 , 6 a ) , rectangularly inflected ; it is much longer than the fork , in proportion to the upper part of the <name> ; the disc is not more deeply embedded than the upper part .
the umbo ( and primordial valve when distinguishable , ) of the <name> is seated just above the embedded fork ( or disc in l .
fascicularis ) , at the point where the inflection takes place ; hence the main growth of the <name> is upwards ,  the fork , however , being of course , likewise added to at its point : in l .
fascicularis , the growth is both upwards and downwards .
peduncle and <unk>  the peduncle is generally quite smooth : though with a high power its surface may be seen to be studded with minute beads , or larger discs , of yellowish and hard chitine ; in the young of l .
australis , and i suspect of some other species , it is covered with very minute spines .
the peduncle in this genus attains its greatest development .
the <unk> <unk> , i believe , only through the functionless larval antennæ , except in one species , l .
fascicularis , in which a ball of this substance is formed in a most peculiar manner round the peduncle ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , apparently for the purpose of serving as a float , as <name> be presently described .
size and <unk>  the species of this genus are the largest of the <unk> , with the exception of some pollicipes : even in the smallest species ( l .
<unk> ) , the capitulum sometimes attains a length of about half an inch .
the peduncle varies much in length in the same species : in l .
anatifera , it is occasionally above a foot long .
the colours of l .
anatifera , l .
<unk> , and l .
anserifera , are very bright and striking ; the membrane bordering the valves and that round the top of peduncle in two of the species , is of the brightest <unk> ; the valves , owing to the underlying corium , are pale <unk> , and the interspaces between them dark <unk> .
the cirri and trophi are generally dark purple or <unk> .
filamentary appendages.  these are attached to beneath the basal articulation of first pair of cirri ; they vary in the several species , from one to five or six on each side , the lowest being always the longest .
several of them are occupied by testes .
in l .
<unk> , generally , not even one is developed .
they are subject to great variation in their proportional lengths , and in number , in the same species .
these organs have generally been considered to serve as branchiæ ; i see no reason to believe that they are more especially designed for this end , than is the general surface of the body .
mouth.  the labrum is moderately bullate , the longitudinal diameter of this part equalling about one third , or half of that of the rest of the mouth .
the palpi are moderately developed .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
5 ) have five teeth with the inferior point either broad , or very narrow and <unk> .
the maxillæ are step-formed ( pl .
x , fig .
9 ) ; the first step is sometimes indistinct and curved ; and in l .
<unk> , all the steps vary much , and are more or less blended together .
the outer maxillæ ( like those at pl .
x , fig .
16 ) , are internally clothed continuously with spines .
the olfactory orifices are not at all prominent .
cirri.  the first pair is placed near the second pair , and is of considerable length ; the second has the anterior ramus thicker than the posterior ramus , and the segments <unk> ; the segments ( pl .
x , fig .
26 ) of the four posterior cirri bear from four to six pair of long spines , with a row of small intermediate spines : in the posterior cirri of l .
australis the lateral rim spines are much developed ; and in those of l .
fascicularis , the usual pairs of large spines are lost in a broad triangular brush , formed by the increase of the lateral marginal , and intermediate spines .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
18 b ) , very small , either blunt or pointed , and quite destitute of spines .
the prosoma is well developed .
the stomach is surrounded in the upper part by a circle of large branching cæca .
the generative system is highly developed ; the testes coating the whole of the stomach , entering the filamentary appendages and the pedicels of the cirri ; the two ovigerous lamellæ contain a vast number of ova ; they are united to rather large fræna , of which the sinuous margin supports either a continuous row or separate tufts of glands .
<unk>  the species abound over the arctic , temperate and tropical parts of the atlantic , indian and pacific oceans , and are always , or nearly always , attached to floating objects , dead or alive .
the same species have enormous ranges ; in proof of which i may mention that of the six known species , five are found nearly all over the world , including the british coast ; and the one not found on our shores , the l .
australis , apparently inhabits the whole circumference of the southern ocean .
general remarks and affinities.  the first five species form a most natural genus ; they are often sufficiently difficult to be distinguished , owing to their great variability .
the sixth species ( l .
fascicularis ) differs to a slight extent in many respects from the other species , and has considerable claims to be <unk> separated , as has been proposed by mr. gray , under the name of <unk> ; but as it is identical in structure in all the more essential parts , i have not thought fit to separate it .
as far as external characters go , some of the species of pæcilasma have not stronger claims , than has l .
fascicularis , to be <unk> separated ; and i at first retained them altogether , but in drawing up this generic description , i found scarcely a single observation applicable to both halves of the genus ; hence i was led to separate lepas and pæcilasma .
if i had retained these two genera together , i should have had , also , to include the species of dichelaspis and <unk> ; and even scalpellum would have been <unk> only by the number of its valves ; this would obviously have been highly inconvenient .
although some of the species of pæcilasma so closely resemble externally the species of lepas , yet if we consider their entire structure , we shall find that they are sufficiently distinct ; as indirect evidence of this , i may remark that conchoderma ( as defined in this volume ) , includes two genera of most authors , and yet certainly comes , if judged by its whole organisation , nearer to lepas than does pæcilasma .

[ 24 ] as this , though the commonest species , has never been defined , i give only a few <unk> and references , it being quite impossible to distinguish , in any published description , this species from a .
<unk> of leach ; this latter species i recognise under this name only from having authentic specimens from the british museum , as leach overlooked every one of the real <unk> characters .
[ 25 ] i have used , in conformity with botanists , the <name> of <unk> , to show that i have seen an authentic specimen .

general appearance.  valves white , more or less translucent and thick , with a tinge of <unk> , from the underlying corium ; sometimes brownish cream-coloured , rarely with a tint of purple .
surfaces smooth , with traces of very fine lines radiating from the umbones , sometimes rather plain on the basal part of the scuta .
length in proportion to the breadth of the capitulum variable , owing to the varying degree to which the scuta and terga have their apices produced .
scuta with the occludent margin either considerably curved or nearly straight .
the internal tooth of the right-hand scutum , close to the umbo , varies in size and form , being either pointed , square , or obliquely truncated on either side , or it has a notch on the summit ; internal basal rim of the scuta either plainly developed or nearly absent .
in many specimens ( pl .
i , fig .
1 ) , on the scuta , or on the scuta and terga , ( and sometimes more on one side of the individual than on the other , ) a nearly straight line , running diagonally across the capitulum , of slight , quadrilateral depressions , of a dirty greenish colour , with the edges blending away , is either conspicuously developed , or can only just be discerned .
these marks increase in size from the umbones to the margins of the valves .
there are sometimes two or even three rows on the scuta .
they are formed by the retention of a portion of the chitine membrane , which is cast off the rest of the surface ; the margins of the valves are occasionally notched slightly on the line of marks ; there is no difference along this line in the underlying corium .
specimens both with and without a barbed <name> are thus characterised .
<name> ; the interspace between the <name> and the scuta and terga is not wide .
the <name> exteriorly , is either convex and smooth , or furnished with knobs or with extremely sharp , long teeth ( pl .

peduncle smooth , wrinkled , length in proportion to that of the capitulum varying , from barely equalling it , to six or seven times as long .
i have noticed a specimen including mature ova , with a capitulum under half an inch long .
[ 26 ] mr. w. thompson found that 15 specimens , out of about 200 , attached to a vessel which came from new orleans into belfast , had their <unk> barbed .
filamentary appendages ;  never more than two on each side , with sometimes only one developed ; of variable length ; one seated on the flank of the prosoma , under the first cirrus ; the second close under the basal articulation of this cirrus , on the posterior face of a slight swelling : these appendages correspond with g and h in fig .

edges of the orifice bright <name> orange ; basal edges of the scuta , and sometimes of all the valves , with a torn border of orange membrane .
interspaces between the valves dull <unk> .
peduncle <unk> <unk> , with the lower part sometimes pale ; chitine membrane itself tinted orange ; in young specimens , peduncle pale , the colour first appearing in the uppermost part , close under the capitulum ; this upper part is often darker than the other parts , and never orange-coloured , as in l .
<unk> and l .
anserifera .
sack internally dark purplish <unk> , sometimes with a tinge of orange , darkest under the growing edges of the valves ; body of animal pale purplish <unk> .
the four posterior cirri blackish purple ; the second , and often the third cirrus , appear as if the colour had been laterally abraded off ; these latter cirri have sometimes a tinge of orange .
in very young specimens , the cirri are only barred with purple .
the ova and the contents of the ovarian tubes are of a beautiful azure blue , becoming yellow in spirits .
in museums a vast amount of difference is seen in the colours of this species , caused by the method of preparation : if dried without having been in spirits , and subsequently kept dry , the orange tint round the orifice is preserved ; if kept long in spirits , this is quite lost ; but sometimes in specimens in spirits the colour of the membrane of peduncle is preserved and rendered <unk> .
the colours of the sack and animal are either quite discharged or rendered extremely dark .
the valves themselves also often become more opaque .
in some specimens well preserved in spirits , the sack and cirri were <unk> or <unk> , tinted with dirty green , or orange , or bright yellow , or brick-red .
general remarks.  from the foregoing description it <name> be seen how extremely variable almost every part of this species is .
i find , in the british museum , ten distinct specific names given by dr. leach to different varieties , or rather to different specimens , for some of them are undistinguishable .
a specimen from the sandwich islands , sent by mr. <name> to mr. cuming , is marked a .
<unk> .
in looking over a large collection of specimens in a museum , the most distinctive characters appear at first to be the colours , the <unk> or barbed condition of the <name> , the row of square marks on the scuta and terga , and the more or less produced form of the whole capitulum : all these characters are absolutely worthless as distinctive characters , and blend into each other .
in a fresh condition , the colours of this species , and of l .
anserifera and l .
<unk> are surprisingly alike , though in l .
anatifera alone , the uppermost part of the peduncle is dark .
as far as i have seen , the smoothness of the valves , together with the presence of a tooth beneath the umbo , on the right-hand scutum , and its entire absence on the left side , ( in other species it is smaller on this , than on the right-hand side , ) is an unfailing <unk> <name> .
i believe this species is always attached to floating objects , though there are some very young specimens in the british museum , collected by sir g. grey , adhering to sandstone , but this may have been buoyed up by some large sea-weed .
mr. peach has given me the particulars of two instances , in which , after gales of wind , this species , of nearly full size , adhering to apparently freshly <unk> <unk> , has been cast upon the coast of england and scotland .

general appearance.  capitulum laterally flat ; length varies in proportion to the breadth ; valves white , somewhat translucent , moderately thick , very smooth , but with faint traces of radiating lines ; in some varieties , surface rather irregular along the zones of growth .
scuta without any internal teeth , and with scarcely any trace of the internal basal rim ; upper <name> little acuminated ; the occludent margins of the two scuta stand rather separate from each other , showing a wide space of corium between them : these margins are arched and protuberant , but with the lower part a little hollowed out ; basal margin a little curved .
in one specimen alone , i saw a trace of a diagonal line of square coloured marks , like those common in l .
anatifera .
terga rather broad , with the basal <name> not much acuminated .
the degree of prominence and outline of the double occludent margin varies very much .
<name> , separated by a rather wide space from the scuta and terga ; of very varying shape , the upper part not much acuminated , generally very flat , sometimes exteriorly marked by a central depressed line ; never barbed ; occasionally , ( in a specimen from australia , ) middle part so wide as almost to become <unk> ; on the other hand occasionally of nearly the same width throughout ; somewhat constricted above the fork .
fork deeply embedded as usual ; situated , in fresh specimens , a little way beneath the basal margins of the scuta , instead of touching them , as in the other species ; forks of varying width , not so abruptly inflected as in many species ; sometimes much narrower than the upper widest part of the valve , sometimes nearly twice as wide ; prongs of fork not very sharp , diverging at about a right <name> , with the rim between them reflexed .
the apex of the <name> extends up between the terga for barely half their length , instead of up fully three fourths of their length , as in l .
anatifera .
the chitine membrane at the base of the capitulum , especially at the anterior and posterior ends , is covered with beautiful , little , embedded , yellowish beads , about <unk> of an inch in diameter ; above this , on each side of the <name> , there is a space with similar but smaller little spheres , and still higher up still <unk> ones ; others occur on different parts of the capitulum ; these spaces are seen to be distinctly separated from each other , and present a beautiful appearance under a high power .
peduncle , as long as , or rather longer than , the capitulum : in one set of specimens , however , it was thrice or four times as long as the capitulum .
the peduncle , in some specimens , was conspicuously covered with transverse plates of yellowish hard chitine .
filamentary appendages.  three on each side ; one on the flank of the prosoma , with a pair beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; relative lengths various , but the posterior filament of the pair under the cirrus , is the shortest .
mouth ; palpi not much acuminated ; maxillæ step-formed , but with the upper or first step in some specimens indistinct , or forming a curve .
cirri ; the segments of the first cirrus and of the posterior arm of the second cirrus are highly protuberant , the protuberances sometimes equalling half the thickness of the segments themselves .
caudal appendages smooth , rounded .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , in the collection of mr. cuming , had a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and <unk> wide ; therefore not quite equalling in size the largest specimens of l .
anatifera .
<unk>  when fresh , valves <unk> from the underlying corium , edges of all the valves and round the orifice , and round the top of the peduncle , bright <unk> , passing into the finest <name> , and varying slightly in tint in different specimens .
space between the <name> and the other valves , and between the occludent margins of the scuta , <name> <unk> ; peduncle either pale or <unk> , or only clouded on the sides with the same .
in young specimens , peduncle nearly colourless ; and in those under a quarter of an inch long in the capitulum , the top of the peduncle has not acquired its orange tint .
sack pale , <unk> , body the same , but paler and more reddish ; cirri ( but only the tips of first pair ) tinted with fine golden orange .
immature ova in peduncle beautiful blue .
after being long kept in spirits , the colours are changed , weakened , or discharged , as in l .
anatifera and l .
anserifera , and the valves become opaque .
in some <unk> specimens the corium everywhere had become pale brown ; more usually it assumes a dirty purplish <unk> .
monstrous <unk>  amongst a set of ordinary specimens from a ship from genoa , sent me by mr. stutchbury , there were three , one full-grown and two very young , with the whole capitulum , ( and likewise with the scuta and terga taken separately , ) not above half the usual length in proportion to the breadth .
neither the colours nor animal in this variety presented any difference .
general remarks.  this species is almost universally confounded with l .
anatifera .
quoy and gaimard , however , appear to have distinguished it , under the name of a .
tricolor , from its colours .
leach named it accidentally , for he specifies not one distinctive character , and besides his two published names , he has appended two other names to specimens in the british museum .
a specimen , from the sandwich islands , sent by mr. <name> to mr. cuming , is marked a .
<unk> .
in a dry state , from the shrinking of the membranes , and consequent approach of the <name> to the other valves , and of the fork to the basal margin of the scuta , it is most difficult to distinguish this species , though so decidedly distinct , from l .
anatifera ; the absence , however , of a tooth on the under side of the right-hand scutum is at once characteristic .
even in specimens kept in spirits , in which there has been no shrinking , but in which the colours have changed , and taking into account the variation in the <name> and upper part of the terga , this species is not always readily distinguished from l .
anatifera , without opening the valves and looking for the right-hand tooth of the latter .
in fresh specimens , the orange ring at the top of the peduncle , and the broad purplish interspace between the <name> and other valves , are characteristic .
in all states , the filamentary appendages offer a good character .

[ 27 ] professor macgillivray does not consider the species , which he has described under l .
<unk> , and which i can not doubt is the same with the present species , as the l .
anserifera of linnæus ; but i find it so named in all old collections , and it seems to agree very well with linnæus 's description .
there has been much groundless confusion about this species ; i have no hesitation in giving a .
<unk> , of <unk> , as a <unk> , though i have received from <name> the lepas <unk> of this volume , named as the a .
<unk> ; and on the other hand , <unk> has <unk> called a common variety of l .

general appearance.  capitulum more or less elongated relatively to its breadth ; in two specimens , with scuta of equal width , one was longer than the other by the whole of the occludent margin of the terga .
valves white , thick , ( in young specimens sometimes <unk> and thin , ) closely approximate to each other ; surfaces furrowed to a very variable amount .
terga generally more plainly furrowed than the scuta , of which the basal portion is generally less furrowed than the upper part ; ridges , often rough , generally much narrower than the furrows : in half-grown specimens ( <unk> , <unk> of leach , ) the ridges are frequently <unk> , and there is even sometimes a row of bead-like teeth along the basal margins of the scuta .
the ridges vary much , sometimes alternately wide and narrow ; in two specimens of equal size , there were , in one , thirty-two ridges , and in the other only eighteen , on the scutum .
scuta , with the occludent margin rounded and protuberant to a variable degree , but always leaving a rather wide space between the margin , and the ridge which runs from the umbo to the apex ; apex pointed .
right-hand internal tooth considerably larger than that on the left , which is often reduced to a mere ridge ; internal basal rim thick , sometimes furrowed along its upper edge , but of variable thickness , sometimes not extending as far as the <unk> <name> .
terga , sometimes equalling , sometimes only two-thirds of , the length of the scuta ; in young specimens , the two occludent margins form a <unk> with each other ; in older specimens they form less than a <unk> , and hence the portion of valve thus bounded is unusually protuberant .
<name> , within deeply concave ; exterior sides finely furrowed longitudinally , generally <unk> ; valve only slightly narrowed in above the fork , of which the prongs diverge at an <name> of <unk> , or rather more , and are wider than the widest upper part of the valve ; rim between the prongs reflexed ; the heel or external <name> , just above the fork , sometimes considerably prominent .
i have seen only a single large specimen with its <name> barbed .
in half-grown specimens , ( var .
<unk> , leach , ) the <name> is often strongly barbed , with the upper point much acuminated , the fork about twice as wide as the widest upper part , and the prongs diverging at rather more than a <unk> .
in some specimens , especially very young ones , there are at the base of the <name> , above the fork , some strong , <unk> , <unk> , calcareous teeth ; such occur also in some specimens along the basal margins of the scuta , two of these hooked teeth under the umbones of the scuta being larger than the rest : specimens conspicuously thus characterised came from the navigator islands ; in these , i may add , the acutely triangular primordial valves were quite plain .
peduncle , generally about as long as the capitulum ; in young specimens generally short .
filamentary appendages , generally five , sometimes six , on each side ; one is seated on the side of the prosoma , and the four others placed in pairs beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; the lowest posterior filament of the four generally is the largest .
in young specimens , having a capitulum only half an inch long , the upper pair of the four often is not developed , or is represented by mere knobs .
the mouth presents no distinctive characters .
cirri , with the longer ramus of the first pair almost equal to the shorter arms of the second pair ; <unk> surfaces only slightly protuberant .
caudal appendages smooth , curved , pointed .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , had a capitulum one inch and a half in length .
<unk>  the white valves are edged with bright orange membrane ; and are so close to each other that no interspaces , coloured from the underlying corium , are left .
peduncle , dark <unk> , with the uppermost part under the capitulum bright orange all round ; the chitine membrane itself being thus coloured .
sack , internally , dark purplish <unk> .
body and cirri , either nearly white or pale <unk> colour , with the arms of the second , third , and fourth cirri , and pedicels of the fifth and sixth , more or less tinted with orange .
a specimen preserved during fourteen months in good spirits had only a tinge of orange left round the orifice and round the upper part of peduncle , and on the cirri .
in some other specimens , badly preserved , the chitine membrane was quite colourless , and sack and cirri dirty <unk> .
fresh ova , <unk> ; immature ova , in ovarian tubes , pale pink .
monstrous <unk>  in mr. stutchbury 's collection , there was a specimen , with the scuta , broad , smooth , thin , and fragile , without any ridge running from the umbo to the apex , and with the occludent margin reflexed .
this seemed caused by the shell having been attacked by some boring animal , and from having supported <unk> .
in the same specimen the first cirrus on one side was <unk> thick and curled ; the second cirrus had its posterior ramus in a rudimentary condition .
in mr. cuming 's collection , there are small specimens with the zones of growth overlapping each other , with thick irregular margins , and with the <name> distorted .
this species has cost me much trouble : i have examined vast <name> of specimens , from a tenth to half an inch in length , attached to light floating objects , such as <unk> and <unk> from the tropical oceans , which all resembled each other , and slightly differed from the common appearance of l .
anserifera : this variety is the <unk> <unk> of leach ; and for a long time i considered it as a distinct species .
it differs from l .
anserifera , in the less thickness of the valves , in their being more finely and yet plainly furrowed ; in the greater width of the scuta ; and more especially , of that part of the valve lying between the occludent margin , and the ridge running from the umbo to the apex ; in the less elongation of the area in the terga , bounded by the two occludent margins ; and , lastly , in the less size of the whole individual .
the trophi and cirri are absolutely identical .
lately , however , in carefully going over a great suite of specimens , all the above few distinctive characters broke down and insensibly graduated away ; and i am convinced that this form is only a variety of l .
anserifera ; its different aspect being caused partly by youth , but chiefly , i suspect , from being attached to light objects floating close to the surface of the sea .
the lepas anserifera can be distinguished by the slight furrows on its valves from all the other species , excepting l .
<unk> : this latter species can be readily known , by the close proximity in the scuta of the occludent margin , and the ridge extending from the umbo to the apex ; by its <name> being very narrow above the fork ; by the prongs of the fork diverging at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ; by the thinness of its valves ; by the coarseness of the furrows on them ; and lastly , by there being at most in l .
<unk> only one filamentary appendage beneath the first cirrus .

general appearance.  the capitulum varies considerably in length compared to its breadth , caused chiefly by the greater or less production of the occludent portion of the terga ; valves thin , brittle ; the furrowed surface varies much in character , narrow and broad ridges often alternating ; frequently each ridge ( but more especially the ridge running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum , and sometimes that alone , ) is covered with prominent , curled , flat , calcareous spines , giving the shell an appearance like that of many mollusca .
other specimens show no trace of these calcified projections .
from the thinness of the valves and the depth of the furrows , the margins of the valves are sinuous .
scuta :  the ridge running from the umbo to the apex is unusually prominent and curved ; it runs very close to the occludent margin , so that , differently from in all the other species , only a very narrow space is left between this margin and the ridge .
internal teeth , under the umbones , either sharp and prominent , or mere knobs ; sometimes that on the right side is much larger than that on the left ; sometimes they are nearly equal ; sometimes that on the left is scarcely distinguishable .
internal basal rim absent , or barely developed .
terga :  these valves have a conspicuous notch to receive the apex of the scuta ; the two occludent margins either meet each other at a <unk> , or at a much smaller <name> , causing the portion thus bounded to vary much in outline , area , and degree of prominence .
this at first led me to think that the p .
<unk> of leach , in which the point is very sharp and prominent , was a distinct species ; but there are so many intermediate forms , that the idea must be given up .
i may remark , that in all the species of lepas , the upper part of the tergum seems particularly variable .
the degree of <unk> of the basal portion of the tergum also varies ; the internal surface sometimes has small crests radiating from the umbo .
<name> , broad , within deeply concave ; edges sinuous , externally sometimes strongly barbed ; narrow above the fork , which latter is wider than the widest upper part of the valve ; prongs sharp , thin , diverging at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ; the rim connecting the prongs not , or only slightly , reflexed .
peduncle , narrow , shorter than the capitulum .
filamentary appendages , none , or only one , short , obtuse projection on each side , on the posterior face of the swelling under the first cirrus .
mouth.  mandibles , with the inferior point produced into a single pectinated tooth , rarely into two pectinated teeth ; on one side of one specimen , there were only four instead of five teeth .
palpi very narrow .
maxillæ highly variable ; they may be described as formed of five steps , of which the two lower ones are generally united into a single one , divided by a mere trace of a notch ; or with the three lower steps blended into an irregular , projecting surface , and with even the fourth step indistinct .
i have seen these two extreme forms on opposite sides of the mouth of the same individual ,  on one side the maxillæ being regularly <unk> , on the other the whole inferior part forming an almost straight edge , standing high up above the first notch or step which bears the two upper great spines .
cirri.  first pair rather far removed from the second pair , with the longer ramus about three-fourths of the length of shorter ramus of second cirrus ; <unk> surfaces , hardly at all protuberant ; lateral marginal spines on the posterior cirri rather long ; caudal appendages smooth , rounded , extremely minute : penis very spinose .
size.  capitulum in the largest specimen , <unk> of an inch long ; only a few arrive at this size .
colours , after having been kept in spirits ,  sack and cirri , especially first cirrus , clouded with pale purple ; peduncle brownish ; valves appear <unk> in specimens not long preserved , but in specimens kept longer they become perfectly and delicately white .
general remarks.  under the head of l .
anserifera , i have made some remarks on the <unk> characters of this species .
in the thinness of the valves ,  form of the <name> , with the rim connecting the prongs being not , or scarcely , reflexed ,  and in the shortness and narrowness of the peduncle , there is some approach to l .
australis , and thence to l .
fascicularis .
in the form of the maxillæ ,  in one specimen having the mandible on one side bearing only four teeth ,  and in the frequent absence of filamentary appendages , there is some approach to the genus pæcilasma ; but there is no such approach in the characters derived from the capitulum .
we have seen that , as in so many other species of this genus , most of the parts are variable , and this is the case to a most unusual extent in the form of the maxillæ .
dr. leach has attached eight specific names to the specimens preserved in the british museum .

general appearance.  capitulum rather obtuse and thick ; valves thin , brittle , approximate , either white and transparent , or <unk> and opaque ; or sometimes tinted internally with purple ( perhaps the effects of being preserved in spirits ) ; surface plainly marked by lines of growth , rarely marked with traces of lines radiating from the umbones .
scuta with teeth on both sides , nearly equal ; internal basal rim rather wide , sometimes furrowed ; basal margin considerably curved inwards .
terga rather wide ; basal <name> blunt ; <name> formed by the two occludent margins blunt and rounded .
<name> ( fig .
5 a ) with the apex blunt , flat ; the middle part generally very broad ; much constricted above the fork , where it is internally deeply concave , and externally <unk> ; fork twice as broad as the broadest upper part of the valve ; with the prongs flat , broad , thin , pointed , diverging at about an <name> of <unk> , with the intermediate rim not at all reflexed ; the fork generally not deeply imbedded in the chitine membrane of the peduncle , so as to be quite easily visible externally ; sometimes there is an internal , transverse , depressed line on the fork .
in young specimens , with the capitulum about a quarter of an inch long , the fork of the <name> is not developed , the lower slightly inflected portion consisting simply of an oval plate , twice as wide as the upper part .
until i had carefully examined a perfect series , showing the gradual changes in this part , i did not doubt that the young specimens formed a distinct species , and named it accordingly : the shortness of the penis first made me perceive that the specimens were immature .
at this early age , i may add , the filamentary appendages were not developed .
peduncle either quite short , or as long as the capitulum , close under which it is considerably constricted all round .
filamentary appendages.  two on each side ; one long , tapering , placed on the prosoma ( in one specimen represented by a mere knob ) , and the second shorter , situated on the posterior margin of the swelling beneath the first cirrus .
mouth.  maxillæ , with three large spines at the upper <name> , and with the first step distinct , but narrow ; mandibles with five teeth ; in young specimens the inferior point ends in a single spine ; sides of the <unk> cavity very hairy ; the membrane , forming the inner fold of the labrum , yellow and thickened in the form of a spoon .
cirri.  in the posterior cirri there are , at the upper lateral edges of the segments on both sides , small spines ; the segments in the first cirrus , and in the broad anterior ramus of the second cirrus , are <unk> and considerably protuberant .
caudal appendages smooth .
size.  the largest specimen had a capitulum one inch long .
the colours ( after having been long in spirit ) of the valves have already been given ; sack and peduncle dirty yellowish-brown , with the parts corresponding to the margins of the valves much darker brown , or almost black ; segments of the cirri clouded with dark brown ; body and pedicels of the cirri dirty yellowish .
i have reason to believe that the colours are totally different in living specimens .
monstrous <unk>  most of the specimens from lat .
<unk> s. , on the coast of patagonia , were more or less deformed , with the successive zones of growth overlapping each other , and forming coarse concentric ridges .
the <name> in several specimens was laterally distorted .
i have already remarked that this species has some affinity to l .
<unk> ; but it is much more closely related to l .
fascicularis , the affinity being clearly shown by the thinness and <unk> of the valves , their <unk> , by the width and little <unk> of the upper part of the <name> , by the width of the fork , and by its not being deeply imbedded .
in young specimens , moreover , before the fork is fully developed , there is a remarkable similarity between the two species , in the form of this lower part of the <name> .
again , the narrowness and inflection of the peduncle under the capitulum in l .
australis , and lastly , the lateral marginal spines on both sides of the segments of the posterior cirri , all clearly indicate this same affinity to l .
fascicularis .
i believe this species is confined to the southern ocean ; and perhaps there represents l .
fascicularis of the northern and tropical seas .
it must , judging from the number of specimens brought home by captain sir j. <name> , and from those previously in the british museum , and from those collected by myself , be a very common species .

general appearance.  capitulum highly variable in all its characters ; thick and broad in proportion to its length , but the breadth is variable ,  in some specimens , the capitulum being longer by one-fifth of its total length than broad ; in others , one-fifth broader than long .
valves generally approximate ; in some varieties , however , from the narrowness of the <name> and terga , the valves stand far apart , there being an interval between the <name> and scuta of nearly half the breadth of the latter .
valves excessively thin , brittle , transparent , colourless , smooth , but generally sinuous along the zones of growth , which are conspicuous : valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane , which is thickly clothed , especially in the interspaces between the valves , with minute spines , barely visible to the naked eye .
scuta with the lower part of the <unk> margin extremely protuberant ; occludent margin , more or less , but slightly reflexed , with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex ; basal margin much reflexed , but to a variable extent and at a varying <name> , even up to a right <name> ,  an external rim or collar being thus formed .
there are no distinct internal teeth , but the basal margin under the umbones , is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection , which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed as the rest of the basal margin : there is no distinct internal basal rim .
the primordial valves are generally visible , but they do not lie , as in all other species , close to the basal margin , but a little above it ,  the lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed .
terga flat , with the occludent margin slightly arched , and not , as in the foregoing species , formed of two sides ; apex bent towards the <name> ; width of the lower half highly variable , owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out ; in some specimens , the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout ; in other specimens this lower part is <unk> .
the widest part of the tergum either equals in width , or is only two-thirds of the width of the widest part of the <name> beneath its umbo .
<name> ( pl .
i , fig .
6 a ) highly variable in shape , with the part above the umbo either <unk> and slightly concave within , or nearly flat and furnished with a central external ridge ; or the upper part ( fig .
6 c ) is of equal and extreme narrowness throughout , and deeply concave within , appearing as if only the central ridge had been developed .
the part below the umbo , ( answering to the fork in the foregoing species , ) is about one-third of the length of the whole valve , and generally twice as wide as the upper part , but in the variety with the upper part of the <name> equally narrow throughout , the lower part is thrice as wide as the upper ; the disc , or lower part , is generally slightly concave within , exteriorly either with or without a central ridge ; basal margin rounded ; lateral margin more or less curved , according to the form of the upper part .
the disc is not more deeply imbedded in membrane than is the upper part of the valve .
the heel or umbo is either angular and prominent , or rounded .
in very young specimens the <name> is simply bowed , instead of being rectangularly bent .
peduncle ,  short , narrow , being abruptly inflected all round under the basal edges of the capitulum ; lower part of very variable shape , being often suddenly contracted into a mere thread ( fig .
6 b ) , which sometimes widens again at the extreme end .
the external membrane is very thin , and is penetrated by the usual fine tubuli leading to the corium ; its surface is wrinkled and destitute of spines , or with extremely few .
the peduncle is often completely surrounded by a yellowish ball , ( of which i have seen specimens from the coast of england , and from off borneo , ) sometimes half as wide as the capitulum , composed of very tender , vesicular , <unk> membrane , and of a pulpy substance : perhaps the yellow colour may be owing to long immersion in spirits .
some authors have supposed that the ball was the <unk> of the animal ; and for the first few minutes , deceived by the numerous included <unk> of , as i believe , <unk> , i thought that this was the case ; others have supposed that it consisted of some <unk> <unk> or other foreign organism ; but it is , in reality , a most singular development of the <unk> , which ordinarily serves to attach cirripedes by their bases to some extraneous object , but here surrounding that object and the peduncle , gives buoyancy , by its vesicular structure , to the whole .
the membrane of the ball falls to pieces in caustic potash , differently from the chitine membrane of the enclosed peduncle , and this shows that there is some difference in composition from ordinary cement .
the ball , when cut in two , exhibits an obscure concentric structure .
the whole is excreted by the two cement-ducts , through two rows of orifices , one on each side of the surrounded portion of the peduncle ; and i actually traced , in one case , the yellow pulpy substance coming out of the cement-ducts .
the upper apertures are in gradation larger than those below them , and they stand a little further apart from each other ; these are figured as seen from the outside , much magnified , at pl .
i , fig .
6 d .
i did not succeed in finding the <unk> , but i followed the ducts , of rather large size , running for a considerable distance as usual along and within the longitudinal muscles of the peduncle .
nearly opposite the uppermost aperture , on each side , the <unk> passes out through the corium , and becomes laterally attached to the outer membrane of the peduncle , at which point an aperture is formed ( as in other cases , by some unknown process ) , thus giving exit to the contents of the <unk> .
beneath this upper aperture the <unk> runs down the peduncle , between the corium and the outer membrane , till it comes to the next aperture , to which it is also attached , and so on to all the lower ones ; but i believe no cement tissue continues to pass out through these lower apertures .
beneath the lowest aperture the two ducts run into the two prehensile antennæ of the larva , which , as usual , terminate the peduncle .
the antennæ are attached to some small foreign body in the centre of the vesicular ball , by the usual tough , light brown , transparent cement .
the two upper apertures are nearly on a level with the outside surface of the ball ; and it was evident that as the animal grows , new apertures are formed higher and higher up on the sides of the peduncle , and that out of these , fresh vesicular membrane proceeds , and grows over the old ball in a continuous layer .
it appears that the growth of the vesicular ball is not regular ,  that it is not always formed ,  and that when formed the whole , or the lower part , sometimes <unk> and is washed away .
as that portion of the peduncle which is enclosed ceases to grow , and has its muscles absorbed , retaining only the underlying corium , whereas the upper <unk> portion , and likewise , ( as it appears ) lower portions once enclosed but since denuded , continue to increase in diameter , the peduncle , when the vesicular ball is removed , often has the most irregular outline , contracting suddenly into a mere thread , and then occasionally expanding again at the basal point .
frequently two or three specimens have their peduncles imbedded in one common ball , of which there is a fine specimen in the college of surgeons ( pl .
i , fig .
6 ) , the ball being about one inch and a quarter in diameter , with a slice cut off .
in this specimen , it is seen that the vesicular membrane proceeding from several individuals , unites to form one more or less symmetrical whole , and that the original common object of attachment is entirely hidden .
dr. <unk> [ 29 ] gives a curious account of the infinite number of specimens , through which he sailed during several days , in the southern atlantic ocean : the balls appeared like bird 's eggs , and were mistaken for some <unk> , which was supposed to have encrusted the scales of the <unk> , to which the cirripede had originally become attached .
several individuals had their peduncles imbedded in the same ball , " which floated like a cork on the water . "
as this species grows into an unusually bulky animal , we here see a beautiful and unique contrivance , in the cement forming a vesicular membranous mass , serving as a buoy to float the individuals , which , when young and light , were supported on the small objects to which they originally had been cemented in the usual manner .

filamentary appendages.  five on each side , of which four lie in pairs at the base of the first cirrus ( of these , only three are sometimes developed ) , and one on the flank of the prosoma .
mouth.  palpi much acuminated .
mandibles with five teeth ; the first not far remote from the second ; inferior point rather broad and finely pectinated .
maxillæ with two large , unequal , upper spines , and four regular steps .
cirri.  posterior cirri , with the upper parts of the segments slightly protuberant ; in young specimens , the spines can be seen to consist of five pairs , placed in two converging lines in the upper half of each segment , with numerous minute , <unk> , and intermediate little bristles : in large specimens , all these latter have so increased in number , that the normal five pair can not be distinguished , and the front of each segment is covered by a triangular thick brush of bristles , all pointing in the same direction , thus giving a very unusual character to the posterior cirri : the dorsal tuft on each segment consists of six or seven large spines , with from one to three dozen fine ones .
first cirrus and anterior ramus of second cirrus with broad brushes of bristles .
the pedicels of all the cirri are thickly covered with bristles .
caudal appendages smooth , with rounded summits .
penis very hairy : vesiculæ seminales purple , much convoluted , lying within the prosoma ; testes <unk> , scarcely enlarged at their terminal points , purplish ; ovigerous fræna large with sinuous margins , the glandular beads being arranged in groups .
size.  the largest specimen ( from the coast of devonshire ) had a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and <unk> broad , and of unusual thickness .
colours , after having been in spirits : front surfaces of the segments of the cirri and of the pedicels purple .
in some specimens from off borneo , parts of the sack and the interspaces between the two scuta , were of a fine purple .
montagu states , that the whole shell and body of animal , when fresh , are pale blue , with the cirri spotted with brown .
general remarks.  the extreme variability of this species is remarkable .
in the college of surgeons , there is a group of specimens collected by mr. <name> , i believe , in the atlantic , in which the extreme narrowness of the <name> and of the terga ( pl .
i , fig .
6 , b , c ) ( with consequent wide spaces of membrane left between these valves ) , led me , at first , to entertain no doubt , that it was quite a distinct species , which was strengthened by finding that the whole surface of the cirri were <unk> , with very minute spines ; hence i called this variety , <unk> .
on the closest examination , however , i could detect no other differences , and the narrowness of the <name> and terga varied very considerably : moreover , in one of the specimens , which was about intermediate in the form of its valves between this variety and the common form , the surfaces of the cirri were not in the least degree <unk> .
again , in some other specimens , the terga were as narrow as in mr. <name> 's , whilst the <name> had its usual outline .
in a var .
( called by leach , p .
<unk> , ) from the atlantic , under the equator , the <name> is remarkable from the extreme flatness of the upper part , and from the presence of an exterior , narrow , central ridge .
in one specimen from jersey , in the british museum , the <name> made an extremely near approach to this same form .
affinities.  this species is certainly much the most distinct of any in the genus , and mr. gray has proposed to separate it under the name of <unk> ; but considering the close similarity of the whole organisation of the internal parts , together with the transitional characters afforded by l .
australis , i think the grounds for this separation are not quite sufficient .
i have remarked , under l .
australis , on the affinity between that and the present species .
in the <name> terminating in a disc ( though here not imbedded ) , there is some slight affinity to pæcilasma eburnea and crassa , and <unk> so in the arrangement of the bristles on the posterior cirri .
in the valves being covered with <unk> membrane , and to a certain extent in the form of the <name> and of the occludent margin of the terga , and especially in the two rows of <unk> in the peduncle , there is some affinity to scalpellum .

i have not been able to adopt mr. <unk> ' name for this genus , as it would be too <unk> incorrect to call a <unk> species , a <unk> .
<unk> , 3 , 5 , aut 7 , <unk> : <name> <unk> ad <unk> apices <unk> <unk> , <unk> basali aut <unk> aut in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : scuta <unk> <unk> , <unk> ad <unk> <unk> <unk> valves , 3 , 5 , or 7 , approximate : <name> extending only to the basal points of the terga ; with its lower end either truncated or produced into a deeply imbedded disc .
scuta nearly oval , with their umbones at the rostral <name> .
mandibles with four teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part of edge prominent ; anterior ramus of the second cirrus not thicker than the posterior ramus ; caudal appendages <unk> , spinose .
generally attached to crustacea .
i have already given my reasons for <unk> and separating this genus from lepas ; as far as the capitulum is concerned , the differences between these genera certainly appear trivial ; they consist in the <name> not extending up between the terga , and in the lower end being either truncated , or produced into an imbedded disc : the terga have a single occludent margin .
the included animal 's body differs in more important respects ; for both mandibles and maxillæ are very distinct ; the cirri of some of the species also differ ; and the caudal appendages are here always spinose : there are no filamentary appendages : and lastly , the habits are different .
the genus may be divided into two sections , firstly , p .
<unk> and p .
<unk> , which have their carinæ <unk> truncated , the basal angles of their terga cut off , and the anterior rami of their second cirri shorter than the posterior rami ; and , secondly , p .
crassa , p .
fissa , and p .
eburnea , which in these several respects are otherwise characterised .
the p .
eburnea , however , differs rather more from p .
crassa and p .
fissa , than these two do from each other ; but certainly not enough to allow of the retention of mr. <unk> ' genus of <unk> .
p .
crassa , in an especial degree , connects together all the forms .
general appearance.  capitulum oval , more or less produced , flat or <unk> ; formed of three , five , or seven approximate valves ; the lesser number arising from the abortion of the terga , and the greater number from the scuta being divided into two segments .
valves moderately thick , either white or reddish , smooth or <unk> , and sometimes partly covered by membrane , bearing minute spines .
scuta oval , of varying proportions ; the basal margin is generally narrow , and blends into the <unk> margin ; the internal basal rim generally is well developed , sometimes with , and sometimes without internal teeth beneath the umbones .
in p .
eburnea , and sometimes in p .
crassa , there is a line of apparent fissure , and in p .
fissa of actual disseverment , running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum , nearly in the line in which a ridge extends in lepas : the primordial valves of the scuta in these three species , are seated at the basal angles of the lateral and larger segments .
the positions of the primordial valves , and the direction of growth in the calcified valves , are , in all the species , the same as in lepas .
in several of the species attached to crustacea , the two scuta are unequally convex , which is caused , as was pointed out to me by mr. gray , by that valve which lies close and nearly parallel to the body of the crab , being least developed .
the terga are either quite absent , or rudimentary as in p .
crassa , or pretty well developed as in the other species : the occludent margin is single , and not double as generally in lepas ; the basal <name> is either pointed or truncated .
the <name> varies considerably in shape , but never extends up between the terga , nor ends downwards in a fork ; in the first two species it is truncated ; in the others , it terminates in a <unk> oblong disc , which in p .
eburnea seems almost entirely ( but of course not quite ) to separate the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle ; a similar separation is effected in p .
fissa , where the imbedded disc is small , by two large teeth on the internal basal rims of the two scuta .
the <name> is always narrow , and either solid internally or very slightly concave .
peduncle , is very short and narrow ; the membrane is generally ringed with thicker , <unk> portions , and often bears very minute spines .
size.  all the species are small , with a capitulum not exceeding half an inch in length .
filamentary appendages.  none .
mouth.  labrum generally considerably bullate in the upper part , with a row of teeth on the crest .
the mandibles have four teeth , with the inferior point narrow and <unk> , or rudimentary and absent .
the maxillæ have , under the two or three upper great spines , a deep notch itself bearing spines ; beneath this , the lower part is straight and considerably prominent , pl .
x , fig .
15 .
outer maxillæ are covered on their inner sides continuously with spines .
cirri.  the first pair is sometimes seated very distant from the second .
the arrangement of the spines on the posterior cirri varies , to an unusual degree within the limits of the same genus .
we have either the ordinary structure of anterior pairs , with single fine intermediate spines ( as in p .
<unk> and <unk> ) , or we have the pairs increased by one or two additional longitudinal lateral rows , as in p .
eburnea ; or we have the front spines forming a single transverse row , as in p .
crassa and p .
fissa , pl .
x , fig .
29 , a .
the segments in none of the species are protuberant ; the anterior ramus of the second cirrus does not seem to be thicker than the posterior ramus , as is usually the case .
the rami of the second , and of most of the other cirri , are unequal in length ,  the anterior ramus , contrary to the ordinary rule , being longer in p .
eburnea , p .
fissa , and p .
crassa , than the posterior ramus by several segments ; i have hitherto observed this inequality only in the sessile genus chthamalus .
the caudal appendages are small , <unk> , and always furnished with bristles .
<unk>  four out of the five species live attached to crustacea in the european and eastern warmer temperate and tropical oceans ; the fifth species was found attached to the dead spines of an <unk> , off new guinea .
it is probable that several more species <name> be hereafter discovered .

general appearance.  capitulum rather compressed , narrow , and produced .
valves white , tinged with orange , smooth , moderately thin , occasionally with faint traces of striæ radiating from the umbones .
scuta , apex pointed , with a very slight ridge running to the umbo ; basal margin equalling two thirds of the length of the terga , with an internal basal rim ; on the under side of each valve , beneath the umbo , there is a strong tooth .
out of the numerous specimens , all excepting one had their scuta unequally convex , with their occludent margins unequally curved , that of the more convex valve at the umbo , curling beyond the medial line .
the basal end of the <name> is , likewise , slightly curved laterally , and always turns towards the more convex valve .
this inequality , as mr. gray pointed out to me , depends on the position of the specimens ; the flatter side lying close to the carapace of the crab .
terga , flat , oblong , nearly rectangular ; occludent margin straight ; basal <name> , truncated , almost parallel to the occludent margin ; in width , three or four times as wide as the <name> .
<name> , ( fig .
1 , a ) short , narrow , slightly curved , upper part broadest , with the apex rounded , only just passing up between the basal broad ends of the terga ; externally <unk> , internally very slightly concave ; basal end abruptly truncated , crested , not deeply imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle .
peduncle , barely as long as the capitulum , apparently ( for specimens dry and much shrunk ) narrow , surrounded by rings or folds of thicker yellowish membrane , of which the upper ones retain moderately long spines ; low down these rings become confluent ; whole surface finely dotted , dots largest on the rings .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate in the upper part , with a row of teeth on the crest ; mandibles with four teeth , the fourth close to the inferior apex , which is very little developed , sometimes making the fourth tooth appear simply bifid .
maxillæ with two large spines on the upper <name> , beneath which there is a large depression , bearing one rather long and thick , and four short and thick , spines ; inferior upraised part with a double row of longer and thinner spines .
cirri.  posterior cirri with segments bearing five pairs of spines , of which the lowest pair is very minute ; intermediate spines minute ; spines of the dorsal tuft thin , of nearly equal size ; segments not at all protuberant , elongated .
first cirrus , standing far separated from the second ( as in scalpellum ) , with its nearly equal rami rather above half as long as those of the second cirrus .
second cirrus with anterior ramus not thicker , and scarcely more thickly clothed with spines , than the posterior ramus , but shorter than it by three or four segments ; the spines not forming a very thick brush on the anterior ramus .
both rami of third cirrus with a longitudinal row of minute spines , parallel to the main pairs .
between the bases of the pedicels of the first pair of cirri , there are two closely approximate , conical flattened protuberances , like the single one to be described in ibla .
caudal appendages , about one third of the length of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , with some moderately long and strong spines at the end , and down the whole outer sides .

general appearance.  this species so closely resembles p .
<unk> , that it is superfluous to describe it in detail ; and i <name> indicate only the points of difference .
when the valves have been well preserved , they are of fine pale orange colour , and hence the name above given , which was proposed by the rev .
r. t. lowe .
scuta , with the internal <unk> teeth small ; basal internal marginal rim very prominent , furrowed within ; basal margin short , ( only equalling half the length of terga ) , owing to the great curvature of the lower part of the <unk> margin ; hence , the outline of the scuta is almost pointed oval .
i saw no appearance of inequality in the two sides .
terga , rather smaller in proportion to the scuta , than in p .
<unk> , with the basal end very obliquely truncated , so as to appear at first simply pointed , not parallel to the occludent margin ; apex considerably more pointed and produced than in the foregoing species .
<name> , almost of equal narrowness throughout , barely concave within ; lower end triangular , abruptly truncated , and not crested .
primordial valves very plain , with the usual hexagonal structure : those of the terga , rounded at both ends , instead of being square , as in the mature calcified valves .
peduncle short , narrow , not half as long as the capitulum ; paved with minute equal beads , as in the genus dichelaspis .
mouth.  mandibles with the fourth tooth very small ; inferior <name> rudimentary .
maxillæ , with three great upper spines , beneath which there is a deep notch bearing some delicate spines ; inferior upraised part , as in p .
<unk> .
cirri.  rami of first cirrus hardly more than one third as long as the rami of the second cirrus , which latter rami are unequal in length by only two segments ; the posterior ramus being the longer one .
caudal appendages , with only two or three lateral bristles , besides those on the summit .
size.  capitulum , three to four <unk> of an inch long .
general remarks.  this species has the closest general resemblance to p .
<unk> , and is evidently a representative of it .
on close examination , however , almost every part differs slightly ; the chief points being the narrowness of the basal margin of the scuta ; the <unk> of the truncated basal end of the terga and the sharpness of the upper end ; the rudimentary state of the inferior <name> of the mandibles ; the character of the spines on the maxillæ ; the proportional lengths of the cirri , and the <unk> of the spines on the outer sides of the caudal appendages .
the fact of madeira having this pæcilasma , a representative both in structure and habits of a japan species , is interesting , inasmuch , as i am informed by mr. lowe , that some of the madeira fishes are <unk> of those of japan .

[ 31 ] general appearance.  capitulum highly bullate , or thick .
valves rather thick , opaque , either pale or dark <unk> , smooth , yet rather plainly <unk> from the umbones .
there are a few very minute spines on the membranous borders of the valves .
scuta highly convex , broadly oval , apex broad rounded ; basal margin narrow , much curved ; no internal , <unk> teeth ; basal internal rim strong , running up part of the occludent margin .
a slightly prominent ridge , either rounded or angular , but in one specimen a narrow depressed <unk> line , runs parallel to the occludent margin and ends near the apex in a slight notch ; this fact is of interest in relation to the structure of the scuta in p .
eburnea and p .
fissa .
the scuta are either equally or very unequally convex ; in the latter case , the occludent margin of one valve is curled , so that its umbo is not quite medial .
[ 31 ] it is stated , in <unk> .
<unk> , ' ( 1848 , p. 44 , ) that this species was attached to a <unk> , from madeira ; i can not but suspect that there has been some confusion with the <unk> <unk> from madeira , which is thus attached .
terga , minute , almost rudimentary , scarcely broader than the <name> , and half as long as the chord of its arc ; carinal margin slightly curved ; scutal margin straight , with a slight prominence fitting into a notch in the scuta ; basal end bluntly pointed .
<name> , ( fig .
3 , a ) rather shorter than the scuta , extending up only to the basal ends of the terga ; moderately curved ; apex moderately sharp ; middle part broadest , externally <unk> ; internally not concave , with the inner lamina of shell , at the basal end , produced into a very small oblong disc or tooth , which is only as wide as the narrowest upper part of the valve .
the exterior keel does not extend on to this disc , which is slightly constricted at its origin .
peduncle very short , narrow , ringed , and apparently without spines .
size.  capitulum four <unk> of an inch long .
the following parts of the animal are described from some small and not well preserved specimens from madeira , which i owe to the kindness of mr. lowe .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate in the upper part , with large , inwardly pointed , unequal teeth .
mandibles , with four large , pointed , <unk> teeth , with the inferior <name> very narrow , acuminated like a single spine .
maxillæ , with three ( ? )
large upper spines , of which the middle one is extremely strong and long , beneath which , there is a deep notch with a single strong spine , and with the whole inferior part square and much upraised , so as to stand on a level almost with the tips of the great upper spines .
cirri in a miserable state of preservation ; first cirrus short , second cirrus with rami unequal , and i suspect the anterior one the longest ; some of the other cirri also have unequal rami .
the segments of the posterior cirri are not protuberant , they have on their anterior faces a single transverse row of bristles : in the upper segments , some of the spines in each dorsal tuft ( which is much spread out ) , are much thicker , though rather shorter than those on the anterior face .
this peculiar structure is common to all five posterior cirri .
caudal appendages.  i can only say that they are spinose on their summits .
affinities.  this species is allied to p .
eburnea in the rudimentary condition of its terga ; in the <unk> basal end of its <name> ; and in the presence in some specimens , of a <unk> line on the scuta parallel to their occludent margins .
its affinity , however , is closer to p .
fissa , as is more especially shown by the remarkable arrangement of the spines on the five posterior cirri .

spines on the segments of the posterior cirri arranged in single transverse rows .
philippine archipelago ; island of <unk> ; parasitic on a spinose crab , found under a stone at low water ; single specimen , in <unk> , cuming .
general appearance.  capitulum <unk> , broadly oval , nearly a quarter of an inch long .
valves white , smooth , moderately thick , marked by the lines of growth .
the occludent segments of the scuta , and nearly the whole of the terga , and the whole of the <name> , enveloped in <unk> membrane , tinged with orange , but the specimen had long been kept dry .
scuta formed of two , apparently always separate , segments , closely united , so that externally their separation is hardly visible , and does not allow of movement ; the fissure thus formed runs almost in the line connecting the umbo and apex , ( where in most species a ridge extends , ) but a little on the carinal side of it .
the occludent segment is narrowly <unk> , pointed at both ends , with the upper end projecting slightly beyond the apex of the lateral segment , and with the occludent margin regularly curved from end to end .
the lateral segment is large , of an oval shape , with a narrow strip cut off on one side .
primordial valves very plain at the umbones of the lateral segments , but none are visible on the occludent segments ; and this makes me believe that these two pieces are normally parts of a single valve ; having only one specimen of p .
fissa , i was not able to make out quite certainly whether the two segments are continuously united at their umbones by a <unk> portion of valve , as is certainly the case with dichelaspis .
the basal margin of the lateral segment is narrow , inflected , and blends with the <unk> margin ; it has an internal , prominent , basal rim , and towards the occludent margin a large , prominent , internal tooth .
this internal basal rim is not parallel to the outer basal margin , but rises to a point a little way up the occludent margin , in the same manner as in p .
eburnea , but in a lesser degree ; in this latter species the peduncle is internally almost cut off by the large disc of its <name> ; here , on the other hand , it is internally almost cut off by these rims and the two large teeth of the lateral segments of the scuta .
terga sub-triangular , short , nearly half as broad as long ; three or four times as wide as the <name> , and rather wider than the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin single , arched ; carinal margin slightly arched ; basal <name> bluntly pointed .
<name> very narrow , much arched , running up just between the basal ends of the terga ; exterior ridge enveloped in membrane ; heel blunt , prominent ; internally , not concave , even slightly convex , produced at the lower end into a very narrow , short , imbedded disc , ( or rather tooth , ) which is itself a little curved downwards and blunt at the end .
peduncle very narrow , about half as long as the capitulum ; yellow , finely <unk> , plainly ringed , without spines .
mouth.  labrum , with a row of minute teeth ; palpi narrow .
mandibles with all the lower part narrow ; of the four teeth , the second and third are narrow , the fourth is pectinated and placed very close to the inferior <name> , which is produced into a long thin tooth .
maxillæ unknown .
cirri.  first pair lost .
the arrangement of the spines on all is most abnormal , pl .
x , fig .
29 : dorsal tuft long , arranged in a transverse line and seated in a deep notch ; in the sixth cirrus , the spines on the lower segments are fine , those on the upper segments are thick and <unk> , mingled with some fine spines ; in the four anterior cirri the spines of the dorsal tufts are even thicker and more <unk> .
on the anterior faces , also , of all the segments the spines form a single row ; they are shorter than those composing the dorsal tuft ; hence the spines on each segment are arranged in a circle , interrupted widely on the two sides : this arrangement is common to all five posterior cirri .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus one third longer and thinner than the posterior ramus ( this is the reverse of the usual arrangement ) ; this longer ramus equals in length the sixth cirrus .
third cirrus , with the anterior ramus considerably longer than the posterior ramus ; in the three posterior pair of cirri , also , the anterior rami are a little longer than the posterior : except in length , there is little difference of any kind between the five posterior pair of cirri .
pedicels of the cirri long ; rami rather short ; segments elongated , not protuberant .
caudal appendages nearly as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , thickly clothed with very fine bristles , like a <unk> pencil brush .
affinities.  in the structure of the <name> , and more especially of the scuta , there is a strong affinity between the present and following species ; for we shall immediately see that in p .
eburnea there is evidence of the scuta being composed of two segments fused together ; and the larger segment is furnished with an internal oblique , strong , basal rim .
to this same species there is an evident affinity in the form of the mandibles and of the caudal appendages , and in the anterior rami of the cirri being longer than the posterior rami .
notwithstanding these points of affinity , i consider that p .
fissa is more closely related in its whole organisation , as more particularly shown in the arrangement of the spines on the cirri and in the presence of terga , to p .
crassa than to p .
eburnea .
although in dichelaspis , the scuta are invariably composed of two almost separate segments , yet p .
fissa shows no special affinity to this genus .

general appearance.  capitulum flat , pear-shaped , placed almost transversely to the peduncle .
valves white , smooth , moderately thick .
scuta :  the basal margin , as seen externally , is narrow , and can hardly be separated from the carinal margin ; but an internal basal rim , ( fig .
5 , b ) ( along which the imbedded disc of the <name> runs , ) shows where , in the other species , the basal and carinal margins are separated .
this basal internal rim is not parallel to the external basal margin , but runs upwards to the occludent margin , leaving beneath it a large triangular space , to which the membrane of the peduncle is attached ; and this makes it appear as if the rostral umbones of these valves had grown downwards ; but , judging from the allied species , p .
fissa , i have no doubt that the primordial valves really lie on the umbones , and that the growth has been in the usual direction , that is , exclusively upwards .
the occludent margin is curved , and blends by a regular sweep into the carinal margin , so that there is no acute upper <name> .
a distinct line can be seen , as if two calcareous valves had been united , running from the umbo to the upper end of the valve , thus in appearance separating a slip of the occludent margin ; internally this appearance is more conspicuous ; this structure is important in relation to that of p .
fissa .
the pointed umbones are divergent , and internally under each , there is a large tooth .
the two valves are equally convex .
terga , entirely absent .
the <name> ( tab .
ii , fig .
5 , a , c ) , including the disc , is three fourths as long as the scuta ; it is placed almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle ; it is narrow and internally convex ; the imbedded disc is very large , forming a continuous curve with the upper part of the <name> ; this disc runs along the internal basal rim of the scuta , and hence almost separates , internally , the peduncle from the capitulum ; it equals one fourth of the total length of the valve , and is thrice as wide as the upper part ; it is oval , externally marked by a central line , and with a slight notch at the end , giving a divided appearance to the whole , and indicating how easily a fork might be formed from it .
the <name> is thick , measured from the inner convex to the exterior surface , which is <unk> ; heel prominent .
peduncle , narrow , very short , not nearly so long as the capitulum .
mouth.  labrum considerably bullate , with the lower part much produced towards the adductor muscle ; crest with small bead-like teeth ; palpi small , pointed ; mandibles , with the first tooth standing rather distant from the second ; inferior <name> <unk> and bifid ; maxillæ ( pl .

15 ) , with two considerable spines ( only one is shown in the plate ) beneath the upper large pair ; the inferior upraised part bears seven or eight pair of spines , and its edge is not quite straight ; close to the main notch , lying under the four upper spines , there are two minute notches , with the interspace bearing a tuft of fine spines and a pair of larger ones .
cirri.  the rami in all are rather unequal in length , the anterior rami being rather the longest ; the anterior rami of the second and third cirri are not thicker than the posterior rami .
the segments in the three posterior cirri are not protuberant ; the upper segments bear three or four pair of spines , with some minute intermediate ones , and with the lateral marginal spines unusually large and long , so as to form , with the ordinary pairs , a third or fourth longitudinal row ; hence a small brush is formed on each segment .
the dorsal tuft is large and wide , so as to contain even fourteen spines , of which some are as long as those in front .
in the lower segments of these same posterior cirri , the lateral marginal spines are not so much developed ( nor is the dorsal tuft ) , and hence the segments can hardly be said to be <unk> .
the first cirrus is placed rather distant from the second pair .
the second and third cirri differ from the three posterior pair , only in the bristles being slightly more numerous , and in the dorsal tufts being more spread out .
caudal appendages about half the length of the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; truncated and rounded at their ends ; thickly clothed with long excessively fine bristles , so as to resemble <unk> pencils .
the stomach , i believe , is destitute of cæca ; in it was a small crustacean .
general remarks.  i was at first unwilling to sacrifice mr. <unk> genus , <unk> , which is so neatly characterised by its three valves ; moreover , the present species does differ , in some slight respects , from the other species of pæcilasma ; but under the head of p .
fissa i have shown how that species , p .
crassa and p .
eburnea are tied together .
the absence of terga , which are rudimentary in p .
crassa , ( and we shall hereafter see , in conchoderma , how worthless a character their entire absence is , ) and the arrangement of the spines in the upper segments of the posterior cirri , are the only characters which could be used for a generic separation .

the name <unk> was given by mr. gray under the belief that there were eight valves .
leach ( as stated in the 'annals of philosophy , ' ) had proposed , in ms. , the name <unk> , and this is now used in the british museum by mr. gray , and thus appears in agassiz 's <unk> <unk> . '
although , strictly , there are only five valves , i continued to use , in my ms. , the term <unk> , until i examined the d .
<unk> , where it was so apparent to the naked eye that there were only five valves , the scuta in this species being less deeply bifid , that i was compelled to give up a name so manifestly conveying a wrong impression , and hence adopted the one here used .
valves 5 , generally appearing like 7 , from each scutum being divided into two distinct segments , united at the rostral <name> ; <name> generally extending up between the terga terminating downwards in an imbedded disc , or fork , or cup .
mandibles , with three or four teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part of edge generally not prominent ; anterior ramus of the second cirrus not thicker than the posterior ramus , not very thickly clothed with spines ; caudal appendages <unk> , spinose .
<unk>  eastern and western warmer oceans in the northern hemisphere , attached to crustacea , <unk> , & c. <unk>  the capitulum appears to contain seven valves ; but , on examination , it is found that two of the valves on each side , are merely segments of the scutum ; these are united at the umbo , in three of the species , by a narrow , <unk> portion of valve , where the primordial valve is situated ; in d .
<unk> , however , the junction of the two segments is perfectly calcified , and of the same width as the whole of the basal segment .
the capitulum is much compressed , broad at the base , and extends a little beneath the basal segments of the scuta .
the valves are very thin , often imperfectly calcified , and generally covered with membrane .
they are not placed very close together , and in all the species a considerable interspace is left between the <name> and the two other valves : in the d .
<unk> the valves are so narrow that they form merely a calcified border round the capitulum .
the membrane between the valves and over them , is very thin , and is thickly studded , in some of the species , with minute blunt conical points , apparently representing spines .
the valves in the same species present considerable variations in shape ; in their manner or direction of growth , and in the position of their primordial valves , they agree with lepas and pæcilasma .
<unk>  in three of the species the two segments , named the occludent and basal , appear like separate valves , but these , by dissection , can be most distinctly seen to be united at the rostral <name> .
the primordial valve , formed of the usual hexagonal tissue , is elliptic , elongated , and placed in the direction of the occludent segment ; <unk> commences at its upper point , so as to form the occludent segment , and afterwards at its lower point , but rectangularly outwards , to form the basal segment ; in the minute space between these two points of the primordial valve , there is , in four of the species , no <unk> ; so that the two segments are united by what may be called a flexible hinge ; in d .
<unk> the two calcareous segments are absolutely continuous .
the occludent segment is longer than the basal segment ; it either runs close along the orifice , or in the upper part bends inwards ; both segments are narrow , except in d .
<unk> , in which the basal segment is moderately broad ; the two segments are placed at an <name> , varying from <unk> to <unk> , to each other .
the capitulum generally extends for a little space beneath the basal segments of the scuta , where it contracts to form the peduncle .
the terga present singular differences in shape , and are described under the head of each species ; scarcely any point can be <unk> of them in common , except that they are flat and thin .
the <name> is much bowed , narrow , and internally either slightly concave or convex and solid ; the upper end extends far up between the terga ; the lower end is formed by a rectangularly inflected , imbedded , triangular or oblong disc , deeply notched at the end , or as in h .
<unk> , of a fork , the base , however , of which is wider than the rest of the <name> , so as to present some traces of the <unk> structure of the other two species ; or lastly , as in d .
<unk> , it terminates in a <unk> cup .
<unk>  this is narrow , compressed , and about as long , or twice as long , as the capitulum ; in d .
<unk> it is studded with minute beads of yellowish chitine .
size.  small , with a capitulum scarcely exceeding a quarter of a inch in length .
filamentary appendages.  none .
there are two small ovigerous fræna , which , in d .
<unk> , had the glands collected in seven or eight little groups on their margins .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate , with small teeth on the crest ; palpi small , not thickly covered with spines .
mandibles narrow , with three or four teeth .
maxillæ small , with a notch beneath the two or three great upper spines ; lower part bearing only a few pair of spines , generally not projecting , but in d .
<unk> largely projecting .
outer maxillæ , with their inner edges continuously covered with bristles .
cirri.  first pair short , situated rather far from the second pair ; second pair with the anterior ramus not thicker than the posterior ramus , and hardly more thickly clothed with spines than it , excepting sometimes the few basal segments .
all the five posterior pair of cirri resemble each other more closely than is usual .
in d .
<unk> , the segments of the posterior cirri bear the unusual number of eight pair of main spines .
caudal appendages.  <unk> , spinose ; in d. <unk> they are twice as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , but i could not perceive in them any distinct articulations .
<unk>  attached to crabs at madeira , and off borneo ; to <unk> in the indian ocean .
the individuals of all the species appear to be rare .
general remarks.  four of the five species , forming this genus , though certainly distinct , are closely allied .
i have already shown , that although the characters separating lepas , pæcilasma , and dichelaspis are not very important , yet if they be neglected these three natural little groups must be confounded together .
dichelaspis is much more closely united to pæcilasma than to lepas , and , as far as the more important characters of the animal 's body are concerned , there is no important difference between them .
consequently , i at first united pæcilasma and dichelaspis , but the latter forms so natural a genus , and is so easily distinguished externally , that i have thought it a pity to sacrifice it .
the <name> , ( which seems to afford better characters than the other valves in dichelaspis , ) from generally running up between the terga and in ending downwards , in three of the species , in a deeply notched disc or fork , more resembles that in lepas than in pæcilasma ; in the manner , however , in which the imbedded disc , in d .
<unk> and d .
<unk> , nearly cuts off the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle , there is a resemblance to pæcilasma eburnea .
in the extent to which the valves are separated from each other , in the <unk> form of the scuta , ( the two segments in dichelaspis , perhaps , answering to the upper and lateral projections in the scuta of conchoderma virgata , ) and in the basal half of the scuta not descending to the base of the capitulum , there is a considerable resemblance to conchoderma ; in both genera the adductor muscle is attached under the umbones of the scuta ; but the structure of the mouth and cirri and caudal appendages shows that the affinity is not stronger to conchoderma than to lepas .
it appears at first probable , that dichelaspis would present a much closer affinity to pæcilasma fissa , in which , owing to the scuta being formed of two segments , there are seven valves , than to any other species of that genus ; but in p .
fissa the primordial valve is triangular and is situated on the basal segment , whereas , in dichelaspis , it is elliptic and is seated between the two segments , and is more in connection with the occludent than with the basal segment ; and this i can not but think is an important difference : in other respects , p .
fissa shows no more affinity to dichelaspis than do the other species of the genus .
finally , i may add that dichelaspis bears nearly the same relation to pæcilasma , as conchoderma does to lepas .

general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , elongated , with the valves not very close together , the <name> being separated by a rather wide space from the scuta and terga .

ii , fig .
6 b ) , the carinal margin of the basal segment is protuberant , and the occludent margin hollowed out ; in old specimens the occludent margin of the basal segment is straight , and the carinal margin much hollowed out .
in very young specimens the basal segment is very small compared to the occludent .
terga , variable in shape ; flat , lower part wider than the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin double , forming a considerable rectangular projection , as in the terga of lepas ; scutal margin deeply <unk> at a point corresponding with the apex of the scuta , a flat tooth or projection being thus formed ; there is sometimes a second tooth ( fig .
6 b ) a little above the basal point .
the terga , in the first variety , somewhat resemble in shape the scuta of conchoderma aurita .
<name> , much bowed , narrow , slightly concave within , ( in the borneo specimen , rather wider and more concave , ) extending up between the terga for half their length , terminating downwards in a rectangularly inflected , deeply imbedded , oblong , rather wide , flat disc , at its extremity more or less deeply notched .
this disc is externally smooth ; internally it sometimes has two divergent ridges on it ; it extends across about two-thirds of the base of the capitulum ( fig .
6 a , as seen from beneath , when the peduncle is cut off ) , to under the middle of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle , narrow , flattened ; united to the capitulum some little way below the scuta ; about as long as the capitulum ; the membrane of which it is composed is thin , externally studded with bluntly conical beads of yellowish chitine , of which the largest were <unk> of an inch in diameter ; on their internal surfaces these are furnished with a small central , circular depression , apparently for a <unk> ; the arrangement of the beads varied in concentric zones .
similar conical points on the capitulum have an internal concave surface about <unk> in diameter , with a central circle <unk> in diameter , for the insertion , as i believe , of a <unk> .
size.  the largest specimen had a capitulum a quarter of an inch long .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate ; crest with not very minute , blunt teeth , which towards the middle lie closer and closer to each other , so as to touch .
palpi rather small , with a few very long bristles at the apex .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with four teeth , and the inferior <name> <unk> and acuminated ; in one specimen , on one side of the mouth , the mandible had only three teeth .
maxillæ , small ; at the upper <name> there are two large spines and a single small one , beneath which there is a deep notch , and beneath this a straight but projecting edge , bearing a few moderately large and some smaller spines .
outer maxillæ sparingly covered with bristles along the inner margin .
cirri.  first pair far removed from the second pair , and not above half their length ; segments rather broad , with transverse rows of bristles not very thickly crowded together ; terminal segments very obtuse , and furnished with thick spines .
the segments of the three posterior pair have each three or four pair of spines , with a few minute spines scattered in an exterior , parallel , longitudinal row ; dorsal tufts , with four or five long spines .
the second cirrus has its anterior ramus not thicker , but rather shorter than the posterior ramus ; the former is only a little more thickly clothed with spines , owing to those in the longitudinal lateral row being longer and more numerous , than is the sixth pair of cirri .
bristles not serrated .
caudal appendages , narrow , thin , slightly curved , about half as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; in young specimens , the appendage bore seven or eight pair of long bristles rectangularly projecting ; in some older specimens , there was a tuft of bristles on the summit , and two other tufts on the sides .
i at first thought that the borneo specimen was a distinct species , but after careful comparison of the external and internal parts , the only difference which i can detect is , that the terga are slightly larger , and that the <name> , to a more evident degree , is wider , more especially in the middle and lower portions .

general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , elongated , formed of very thin membrane , with the valves forming round it a mere border .
valves thin , imperfectly calcified , covered with membrane .
scuta formed of two narrow plates at very nearly <unk> to each other , one extending along the occludent , and the other along the basal margin ; both become very narrow at the point of junction , and are there not calcified , but are evidently continuous and form part of the same valve ; the basal segment is about half as long and narrower than the occludent segment , flat and bluntly pointed at the end ; occludent segment slightly curled , and therefore the whole does not lie quite in the same plane ; narrow close to the umbo , with a very minute tooth on the under side ; apex rounded .
in the upper part , the occludent segments leave the membranous margin of the orifice , and run in near to the terga , bending towards them at an <name> of <unk> with their lower part .
i was unable to distinguish the primordial valves .
<unk>  these valves are of the most singular shape , resembling a battle-axe , with a flat and rather broad handle ; the upper part consists of an axe , with a broad cutting <unk> edge , behind which is a short blunt spike .
the spike and cutting edge together answer to the double occludent margin of the tergum in lepas .
the whole valve is flat , thin , and lies in the same plane ; the carinal margin is nearly straight ; the scutal margin <unk> out a little , and at a short distance above the blunt basal point is suddenly narrowed in , making the <unk> portion very narrow ; the widest part of the handle of the battle-axe , is narrower than the occludent segment of the scuta .
the two spikes behind the cutting and <unk> edges of the two terga , are blunt and almost touch each other ; above their point of juncture , the membrane of the orifice forms a slight central protuberance .
<name> , very narrow throughout , concave within , much bowed ; upper point broken and lost , but it must have run up between the terga for more than half their length ; basal portion inflected at nearly right angles , and running in between , and close below , the linear basal segments of the scuta , so as almost entirely to cut off internally the peduncle and capitulum .
this lower inflected and imbedded portion , or disc , gradually widens towards its further end , which is , at least , four times as wide as the upper part of the <name> , and is deeply <unk> , but to what exact extent i can not state , as the specimen was much broken .
on each side of this elongated triangular disc , there is a slight shoulder corresponding to the ends of the basal segments of the scuta ; and on the upper surface of each shoulder , there is a small tooth or projection .
the middle part of the disc is barely calcified , and is transparent .

this species comes very close to the d .
<unk> , which likewise was attached to a snake ; but i can not persuade myself , without seeing a graduated series , that the differences immediately to be pointed out can be due to ordinary variation .
i am much indebted for specimens to the kindness of mr. <unk> .
general appearance.  the membrane of the capitulum and peduncle is surprisingly thin and <unk> , so that the ovarian tubes within the peduncle can be traced with the greatest ease .
the valves are small , the apices only just crossing each other , and are composed of yellow chitine , with mere traces of <unk> .
the capitulum is pointed , oval , <unk> of an inch long ; the peduncle is narrow , and fully twice as long as the capitulum .
<unk>  the two segments stand at <unk> to each other ; the basal segment is linear and pointed , fully half as long , but only one third as wide , as the occludent segment .
the point of junction of the two segments is wider than the rest of the basal segment .
this latter segment lies some little way above the top of the peduncle .
the occludent segment is bluntly pointed ; it is directed a little inwards from the edge of the orifice towards the terga ; the apex reaches up just above the slightly reflexed lower point of the terga .
the adductor muscle is fixed under the point of junction of the two segments .
the terga are battle <unk> , with the blade part very prominent , <unk> ; behind the blade there is a short <unk> prominence .
the lower point of the handle of the axe , is bent towards the <name> .
the tergum , measured in a straight line , equals in length two thirds of the occludent segment of the scutum , the handle being rather narrower than this same segment .
the <name> is extremely narrow and much bowed ; the apex reaches up only to just above the lower bent points of the terga .
the basal end is rectangularly inflected , and stretches internally nearly across the peduncle ; it consists ( fig .
7 a ) of a triangular disc of yellow thin membrane , four or five times as wide as the upper part of the valve ; the end of this disc is hollowed out ; its edges are thickened and calcified , and hence , at first , instead of a disc , this lower part of the <name> appears like a wide fork ; the tips of the prongs stretch just under the tips of the basal segments of the scuta .
<unk>  its narrowness and transparency are its only two remarkable characters .
mouth.  all the parts closely resemble those of d .
<unk> , but being in a better state of preservation i <name> describe them .
the labrum is highly bullate , with a row of minute teeth on the crest , placed very close together in the middle .
palpi small , thinly clothed with spines ; mandibles extremely narrow , hairy , with four teeth , but the lower tooth is so close to the inferior <name> , as only to make the latter look double .
maxillæ , with a very deep broad notch , dividing the whole into two almost equal halves ; in the upper part there are three main spines .
cirri.  the first pair are placed at a considerable distance from the second pair ; they are short with equal rami , and rather broad segments furnished with a few transverse rows of bristles .
the five posterior cirri have singularly few , but much elongated segments , bearing four pair of spines : the two rami of the second pair are alike , and differ only from the posterior cirri in a few of the basal segments having a few more spines .
the caudal appendages are twice as long as the pedicels , and nearly half as long as the whole of the sixth cirrus ; they have a small tuft of long thin spines at their ends , and a few in pairs , or single , along their whole length ; at first i thought that they were <unk> , but after careful examination i can perceive no distinct articulations ; i have seen no other instance of so long an appendage without articulations .
<unk>  this species differs from d .
<unk> in all the valves being shorter , so that their points only just cross each other ; but this , i conceive , is an unimportant character .
in the scuta , the basal segment is here narrower , but the point of junction of the two segments wider than in that species ; in the terga , the edge of the axe is smooth instead of being <unk> , and the handle and the point behind are of a rather different shape ; in the <name> the imbedded basal disc has not shoulders and small teeth , as in d .
<unk> .
notwithstanding these differences , i should not be much surprised if the present form were to turn out to be a mere variety .

very rare .
general appearance.  capitulum much compressed , sub-triangular , formed of very thin membrane ; valves imperfectly calcified , and thin .
scuta formed of two narrow plates placed at about an <name> of <unk> to each other , and united at the umbo by a <unk> flexible portion .
the primordial valve is situated at this point , but chiefly on the occludent segment .
the occludent segment is about twice as wide and about one fifth longer than the basal segment , which latter is rather sharply pointed at its end .
the occludent segment is slightly arched , a little narrowed in on the occludent margin close to the umbo ; its upper end is broad and blunt ; it runs throughout close to the edge of the orifice of the sack , and its longer axis is in the same line with that of the terga .
close to the umbones , on the under side of the basal segment , there is , on each valve , a longitudinal calcified fold , serving as a tooth .
terga broad , with a deep notch corresponding to the apex of the occludent segment of the scuta ; the part beneath the notch is of nearly the same width throughout , and is twice as broad as the occludent segment of the scuta ; it has its basal <name> very broad and blunt .
the entire length of the terga equals two thirds of that of the occludent segment of the scuta ; occludent margin simply and slightly curved .
the <name> is of nearly the same width throughout , with the upper part rather the widest , and the apex blunt ; within convex ; it extends up between three fourths of the length of the terga , terminating downwards in a fork with very sharp prongs , standing at <unk> to each other ( fig .
8 a . )
the fork , measured from point to point , is thrice as wide as , and measured across at the bottom of the prongs it is wider than , the widest upper part of the valve ,  a resemblance being thus shown with the triangular notched disc in d .
<unk> .
the points of the <unk> extend under about one fourth of the length of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle rather longer than the capitulum , which , in the largest specimen , was <unk> of an inch in length ; peduncle narrow , close under the capitulum ; membrane thin and <unk> .
the larger specimen had almost mature ova in the lamellæ .
mouth.  labrum with a few bead-like teeth on the crest , distant from each other even in the central part ; palpi rather small , moderately clothed with bristles .
mandibles , with four teeth ; the inferior <name> blunt and broad , showing , apparently , a rudiment of a fifth tooth ; the first tooth is as far from the second , as is this from the inferior <name> ; second , third , and fourth teeth very blunt , whole inferior part of mandible not much narrowed .
maxillæ small , with a small notch under the three upper spines , which are followed by five or six pair , nearly as large as the upper spines .
cirri.  first pair remote from the second ; their rami nearly equal , and about one third of the length of the rami of the second cirrus ; thickly clothed with bristles : rami of the second cirrus of equal thickness , but little shorter than those of the sixth cirrus ; the three or four basal segments of the anterior ramus are thickly clothed with spines ; the other segments , and all the segments on the third pair , resemble the segments of the three posterior pair .
these latter are elongated , not protuberant , and support eight pairs of spines with very minute intermediate spines ; those in the dorsal tufts are numerous and long .
caudal appendages nearly as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; oval , moderately pointed , with their sides , for one fourth of their length , thickly clothed with long very thin spines .

the specimens are in a bad condition , not one with all the valves in their proper positions , and most of them broken ; animal 's body much decayed and fragile .
general appearance.  capitulum apparently much flattened ; valves naked , coloured reddish , separated from each other by thin <unk> membrane .
the scuta consist of two bars placed at <unk> to each other , with the point of junction fully as wide as any part of the basal segment , and perfectly calcified ; the primordial valve lies at the bottom of the occludent segment .
the basal segment is equally narrow throughout , and very slightly concave within ; the occludent segment widens a little above the junction or umbo , and then keeps of the same width to the apex , which is obliquely truncated ; internally this segment is concave ; externally it has a central ridge running along it ; the occludent segment is twice as long and twice as broad as the basal segment .
both segments are a little bowed from their junction to their apices .
<unk>  these are of a singular shape ; they are about three-fourths as long as the occludent segment of the scuta , and in their widest part , of greater width than it .
they consist of four prominent ridges proceeding from the umbo , and united together for part only of their length , and , therefore , ending in four prominences ; one of these , the longest , has the same width throughout , and forms the basal point ; a second , very small one , is seated high up on the carinal margin just above the apex of the <name> ; the third and fourth , are nearly equal in length , and project one above the other on the scutal margin .
there are two occludent margins , meeting each other at right angles , and forming a prominence , as in lepas ; and this gives to the margin of the valve the five prominences .
the whole valve internally is flat ; externally , it is <unk> as described .
<name> ( fig .
10 , a , b ) , much bowed , narrow , long ; externally , the central ridge is quite flattened ; internally , slightly concave , but scarcely so towards the lower part , which is narrow ; the upper part widens gradually , and the apex is rounded .
the basal embedded portion is as wide as the uppermost part , and forms a cup , unlike anything else known : the outline of this cup is <unk> and <unk> ; it is moderately deep ; it is formed by the external lamina of the <name> bending rectangularly downwards and a little outwards , whereas the inner lamina of the lower part ( which is slightly concave ) , is continued with the same curve as just above , and forms the concave chord to the <unk> rim of the cup .
this cup , i believe , lies under the points of the basal segments of the scuta .
peduncle unknown , probably short .
length of capitulum , above <unk> of an inch .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , and produced into a large overhanging projection ; crest with a row of rather large bead-like teeth ; palpi small , their two sides parallel , very sparingly covered with long bristles .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with four teeth , and the inferior <name> produced into a single strong spine : the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth almost equals that between the tip of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> .
maxillæ with three large upper unequal spines , beneath which , there is a deep and wide notch ( bearing one spine ) , and the inferior part projects highly , bearing three or four pairs of spines , and is , itself , obscurely divided into two steps .
outer maxillæ , very sparingly covered with bristles ; outline , hemispherical .
cirri.  the rami of the five posterior pair are extremely long , as are the pedicels ; the segments are much elongated , with their anterior faces not at all protuberant ; each bears five pair of very long and thin spines , with an excessively minute one between each pair ; the dorsal tuft consists of very fine and thin spines .
the second cirrus has its anterior ramus not at all thicker than the posterior ramus ; but has an exterior third longitudinal row of small bristles .
first cirrus , separated by a wide interval from the second pair ; very short with the two rami slightly unequal in length ; the segments are broad , and are paved moderately thickly with spines ; the terminal spines not particularly thick .
caudal appendages consist of very small and narrow plates , about half the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with a few long spines at their ends .
this well-marked species , i think , has not more affinity to one than to another of the previous species : it differs from all , in the junction between the two segments of the scuta being perfectly calcified ; in the peculiar cup , forming the base of the <name> ; and lastly , in the inferior part of the maxillæ projecting .

i have most unwillingly instituted this genus ; but it <name> be seen by the following description , that the one known species could not have been introduced into lepas or pæcilasma , without destroying these genera , although it has a close general resemblance with both .
as far as the valves are concerned , it is more nearly related to lepas than to pæcilasma ; but taking the entire animal , its relation is much closer to the latter genus than to lepas : it differs from both these genera in the manner of growth of the scuta , which is both upwards and downwards , the primordial valve being situated in nearly the middle of the occludent margin .
in this respect , and in the shape of the <name> and terga , there is an almost absolute identity with scalpellum ; i may , however , remark that in scalpellum , the scuta first grow downwards , and afterwards in most of the species upwards , whereas here from the beginning , the growth is both upwards and downwards .
in the mouth and cirri , there is rather more resemblance to scalpellum than to pæcilasma and lepas : in habits , also , this genus agrees with scalpellum , and if it had possessed a lower whorl of valves , it would have quite naturally entered that genus .
it is unfortunate , that so insignificant and poorly characterised a form should require a generic appellation .
in natural position , it appears to lead from scalpellum through pæcilasma to lepas .

general appearance.  the capitulum is rather thin , and broad in proportion to its length ; it seems always entirely covered by the horny <unk> bark of the <unk> , and hence externally is coloured <name> brown and covered with little horny spines .
the membrane over the valves is very thin , and is with difficulty separated from the <unk> ; it has , i believe , no spines of its own .
the corium lining the peduncle is a fine purple .
all the individuals are attached to the coralline , with their <unk> upwards in the direction of the branches , and in this respect fig .
1. is erroneous .
the valves , when cleared of the bark , are white , or are strongly tinged with <unk> .
the upper parts of the scuta and terga are plainly furrowed in lines radiating from their umbones ; hence their margins are serrated with blunt teeth ; their surfaces , moreover , are sparingly studded with small calcareous points .
scuta ( fig .
1 , a ) , sub-triangular , with the lower part rounded and protuberant , the upper produced and pointed .
the umbo is situated in the middle of the occludent margin , instead of at the rostral <name> , as in the foregoing genera .
the occludent margin is straight , and is bordered by a narrow step or ledge , formed of transverse <unk> , and therefore has its edge serrated : the rostral <name> is often slightly produced into a small projection .
the basal margin is short , and forms an <name> above a <unk> with the occludent margin : the tergal margin is straight ; the carinal margin is rounded , protuberant , and of unusual length compared to the basal margin .
the surface of the valve is convex near the umbo ; and beneath there is a large deep hollow for the adductor muscle .
terga ( fig .
1 , b ) large , flat , triangular , as long as the scuta or the <name> , all three valves being nearly equal in length ; occludent margin straight , or slightly arched , basal <name> broad , not very sharp .
<name> short ( fig .
1 , c , drawn rather too long ) , deeply concave , rectangularly bent , with the lower part not quite as long as the upper , and a little wider : the basal margin is truncated , rounded , and slightly sinuous .
the umbo is situated at the <name> , and therefore nearly central .
the umbo of the terga , i may add , is in the same place , as in lepas .
the peduncle is very short and narrow , and is , i believe , without spines ; it is enveloped by the bark of the <unk> .
the capitulum in the largest specimens was <unk> of an inch in length .
filamentary appendages , apparently none .
mouth , with the orifice rather inclined <unk> .
labrum , with the upper part extremely protuberant , forming a projecting horn ; no teeth on the crest .
palpi rather small , with only a few bristles at the end .
mandibles , with four teeth and the inferior <name> pointed : first tooth as far from the second , as is the latter from the inferior <name> ; in one specimen , on one side , there were five teeth .
maxillæ with three great spines at the upper <name> , beneath which a deep notch , and with the inferior part much upraised ; this lower part rather rounded at both corners , with the upper spines longer than the lower .
outer maxillæ , with the bristles continuous in front ; externally , slightly protuberant , with a tuft of bristles longer than those on the front side .
olfactory orifices apparently not protuberant ; but all the specimens were in a bad state .
cirri.  prosoma very little developed .
first cirrus very far removed from the second .
the three posterior cirri are straight and long ; the segments are elongated and bear four or five pairs of very long spines , with a single minute intermediate spine between each pair ; dorsal tufts , with long spines .
first cirrus , rami unequal by two or three segments , and thickly covered with spines ; the first cirrus is short compared to the second , owing to the length of the pedicel of the latter , though the longer ramus of the first , nearly equals the shorter ramus of the second pair .
second cirrus , with its anterior ramus shorter by two or three segments than the posterior ramus , and thicker than it , with the segments covered like brushes with bristles ; posterior ramus , and both rami of the third cirrus , a little more thickly clothed with bristles than are the three posterior cirri .
caudal appendages , minute , broadly oval , with six or seven long bristles on their summits .

[ 35 ] [ 34 ] the general title to the volume , containing four quarterly parts , is dated 1818 ; but as in the 'journal de physique , ' for july , 1817 , the editor refers to conchoderma , the quarterly part containing this genus must have appeared before 1818 : lamarck gives the year 1814 as the date of the paper in question , and i have accordingly followed him .
from a similar reference by the editor , it appears that <unk> 's volume appeared before the number of the 'journal de physique ' containing leach 's paper .
[ 35 ] under these nine generic names , the two common species of conchoderma have received thirty-three different specific denominations , caused partly by changes of nomenclature , and partly from varieties having ranked as species .
<unk> 2 ad 5 , <unk> , inter se <unk> : scuta <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : <name> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> valves 2 to 5 , minute , remote from each other : scuta with two or three lobes , with their umbones in the middle of the occludent margin : <name> arched , upper and lower ends nearly alike .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulations of the first pair of cirri , and on the pedicels of four or five anterior pairs ; mandibles , with five teeth , finely pectinated ; maxillæ step-formed ; caudal appendages , none .
<unk>  mundane , throughout the equatorial , temperate , and cold seas ; attached to floating objects , living or inorganic .
the capitulum is formed of smooth membrane , including five small valves , of which the terga and <name> are often quite rudimentary or absent .
valves minute , thin , generally more or less linear , placed far distant from each other ; sometimes imperfectly calcified and covered by chitine membrane , or imbedded in it .
the umbones of the valves ( together with the primordial valves ) are nearly central , so that they are added to at their upper and lower ends ; hence their manner of growth is considerably different from that of the valves in lepas .
the adductor muscle is attached to a slight concavity on the under side of each scutum , at the point whence the lobes diverge .
the terga are placed almost transversely to the scuta ; at their lower ends , there is either a very slight prominence in the capitulum , or there is a large tubular , folded appendage , opening into the sack , and apparently serving for respiratory purposes .
peduncle , smooth , moderately long ; attachment effected by the <unk> being poured out exclusively , as it appears , from the larval antennæ .
these antennæ in c .
aurita and c .
virgata , resemble , in the form of the disc and in the long feathered spines on the ultimate segment , those in lepas .
the filamentary appendages are highly developed ; there are six or seven on each side ; two are attached beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ( as is usual in lepas ) , and near them there are one or two small <unk> projections of apparently similar nature ; the rest of the filaments are attached to the posterior edges low down , on the lower segments of the pedicels of the cirri .
i believe , in all cases , these appendages are occupied by testes .
prosoma , moderately developed .
mouth , situated not far from the adductor muscle ; labrum considerably bullate , with the crest hairy and pectinated with inwardly pointing , approximate , flattened teeth : inner fold of the supra-oesophageal cavity slightly thickened and yellowish , <unk> on the sides .
palpi of the usual shape , not meeting , moderately broad .
mandibles , with five teeth , graduated in size , nearly equidistant , finely pectinated either on one or both sides towards their bases ; inferior <name> narrow , either produced into a fine tooth , or almost rudimentary .
maxillæ , about <unk> of the size of the mandibles , step-formed , with five steps generally distinct ; at the upper <name> there are two large unequal spines , of which the lower one is the largest , with a third long thin one on the first step ; lower spines doubly serrated .
<unk> directed inwards and backwards .
outer maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
16 ) simply arched ; the membrane of the supra-oesophageal cavity under these maxillæ is highly bullate and <unk> .
olfactory orifices not prominent .
cirri.  first pair not seated far distant from the second pair .
the three posterior pair have the anterior faces of their segments considerably protuberant , supporting four or five pairs of long bristles ; between which , there is a row of minute , fine , <unk> pointing bristles : on the lateral upper margins of each segment , there are a few very minute spines ; dorsal tuft short , with thick and thin spines intermingled .
in the first cirrus ( of which the rami are nearly equal in length ) , and in the anterior ramus of the second cirrus , the faces of the segments are highly protuberant , and clothed with thick transverse rows of finely and doubly serrated spines : the anterior ramus of the second cirrus is considerably thicker than the posterior ramus , which latter , together with both rami of the third cirrus , differ from the three posterior cirri only in the intermediate and in the lateral marginal spines being slightly more developed .
caudal appendages , absent .
alimentary <unk>  the upper part of the stomach has four large cæca , of which the posterior one is the largest ; the whole surface , also , is covered with minute pits , arranged in transverse rows .
generative system , developed to an extraordinary degree .
the testes run into all the filamentary appendages , as well as more or less , into the pedicels of the cirri : the two vesiculæ seminales unite within the penis , either just beyond its basal <unk> , or up one third of its length .
penis short , hairy .
the ovarian tubes not only fill the peduncle , but extend in a thin sheet between the two folds of corium all round the sack , close up to the terga .
the two ovigerous fræna are present in the usual position ; the ovigerous lamellæ either form several layers , in pairs , one under the other , or are united in a single large <unk> sheet enclosing the whole animal .
<unk>  the prevailing tint is a dark <unk> , which forms , or tends to form , broad longitudinal bands on the peduncle and capitulum .
general remarks.  this genus is intimately related , as has been remarked by professor macgillivray , [ 36 ] to lepas : if we look to the body of the animal , which from being less exposed to external influences must , in the cirripedia , offer the most trustworthy characters , we find that in conchoderma there are additional filamentary appendages attached to the cirri , that there are no caudal appendages , that the teeth of the mandibles are finely pectinated , and that the ovarian tubes run higher up round the sack ; in every other respect , there is the closest similarity , even to the arrangement of the bristles on the cirri .
in the capitulum , the difference consists chiefly , though not exclusively , in the less development of the valves , and their consequent wide separation : the scuta , however , in conchoderma , are added to beneath their umbones , or original centres of growth , which is never the case , or only to a very slight degree , in lepas .
conchoderma has no very close affinity to any other genus .
as the majority of authors have ranked the two common species under two distinct genera ( <unk> and <unk> ) , i may observe , that there is no good ground for this separation ; in the above few specified points in which conchoderma differs from the genus most closely allied to it , the two species essentially agree together .
if we take the nearest varieties of c .
virgata and c .
aurita , there is but a very slight difference even in the form of their valves , and these hold the same relative positions to each other ; the <name> , however , is always less developed in c .
aurita ; even the colouring in both tends to follow the same arrangement .
the only obvious distinction between the two species , are the <unk> appendages of c .
aurita , which , however , are not developed in its early age , are subject to considerable variation , are of no high functional signification , and are indicated in c .
virgata by two prominences on the same exact spots .
on these grounds i conclude , that the generic separation of the two species is quite <unk> .

general appearance.  the capitulum ( seen from above in pl .
iii , fig .
4 a ) is slightly compressed , almost globular , composed of thick membrane , with two large , <unk> , flexible , tubular , folded appendages , at the upper end , opening into the sack .
these appendages are seated behind the rudimentary terga when such are present , or behind the spots which they would have held if not aborted .
in a young condition they are tubular , but not folded ; and often , according to prof. macgillivray , either one or both are at first <unk> .
they are formed externally of the outer membrane of the capitulum ( rendered thin where folded ) , and internally of a prolongation of the inner tunic of the sack ; between the two , there is , as around the whole sack , a double layer of corium .
a section across both appendages , near their bases , is given in pl .
iii , fig .
4 b , showing how they are folded ,  the chief fold being directed from below upwards , with a smaller fold , not always present , from between the two , outwards .
the folds sometimes do not exactly correspond on opposite sides of the same individual ; they are almost confined to the lower part , the orifice itself being often simply tubular .
these appendages are sometimes very nearly as long as the whole capitulum : a section near their bases is sub-triangular .
i shall presently make some remarks on their functions and manner of formation .
the scuta , as well as the other valves , are imperfectly calcified : shape , variable .
they usually consist of two lobes or plates , placed at above a right <name> to each other , and rarely ( fig .
4 c ) almost in a straight line ; the lower lobe is more pointed and narrower than the upper ; the two correspond to the lower and middle lobes in the scuta of c .
virgata , the upper one being here absent .
the terga are developed in an extremely variable degree ; they are often entirely cast off and absent .
in very young specimens , they are of the same length with the <name> , but after the <name> has ceased to grow , the terga always increase a little , and sometimes to such a degree as to be even thirty or forty times as long as <name> .
when most developed ( fig .
4 a ) they are not above one third as long as the scuta , to which they lie at nearly right angles ; they consist of imperfectly calcified plates , square at both ends , slightly broader and thinner at the end towards the <name> , where they are a little curled inwards , than at the opposite end ; they are not quite flat in any one plane ; internally they are slightly concave ; finally , i may add , they nearly resemble in miniature the terga of c .
virgata .
in full grown specimens , the terga almost invariably drop out and are lost ; but even in this case , a long brownish cleft in the membrane of the capitulum , marks their former position .
the orifice of the capitulum is usually notched between the terga , or between the <unk> left by them ; on each side of the notch there is a slight prominence .
in some few cases , however , there is no trace of this notch .
behind the terga or the <unk> , the great <unk> appendages , as we have seen , are situated .
<name> , rudimentary ( fig .
4 ) and often absent ; it is <unk> , and is rarely above the <unk> of an inch long .
after arriving at this full size , calcareous matter is added to the under surface over a less and less area , so that it becomes internally pointed , and finally , in place of calcareous matter , continuous sheets of chitine are spread out beneath it ; hence , during the disintegration of the outer surface , the <name> comes to project more and more , and at last drops out ; subsequently , even the little hole in which it was imbedded , <unk> and disappears .
peduncle , cylindrical , distinctly separated from the capitulum , and generally twice or thrice as long as it : the thickness of the outer membrane generally great , but variable : surface of attachment variable , either pointed , or widely expanded , or formed into divergent projections .
filamentary appendages , seven on each side , highly developed , long and tapering ; there are two beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , and one on the posterior margin of the pedicel of each cirrus , excepting the sixth pair ; the filaments on the pedicels are nearly twice as long as the cirri themselves .
mouth ,  mandibles , with the five teeth nearly equidistant , and towards their bases finely pectinated on both sides ; inferior <name> rudimentary , often represented by a single minute spine : in one specimen , there were only four teeth on one side .
maxillæ , with five steps , not very distinct from each other , with the first step much curved .
the larger of the two upper great unequal spines is pectinated , like the teeth of the mandibles ; there is a third long finer spine beneath the upper large pair .
cirri rather short , broad , with the anterior faces of the segments protuberant , especially those of the first cirrus and of the anterior ramus of the second pair : spines on the anterior cirri doubly serrated .
posterior cirri , with the intermediate spines between the pairs , long ; dorsal tufts , minute .
on the lower segment of the pedicels of the four posterior cirri , there are two separate tufts of bristles .
colours extremely variable ; sometimes five longitudinal bands of dark purple can be distinctly seen ( as in c .
virgata ) on the peduncle , these bands becoming more or less confluent on the capitulum ; at other times , the capitulum is more or less spotted , or often nearly uniformly purple : the sack , cirri and trophi are , also , purple .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen was , including the peduncle and ears , five inches in length , the capitulum itself being rather above one inch in length , and <unk> of an inch in breadth .
general remarks.  i have come to the same conclusion with prof. macgillivray , concerning the variability of this form , and i believe there is only one true species .
with respect to dr. <unk> 's species , viz. , <unk> <unk> and o .
<unk> , though i have not seen specimens , i can hardly doubt , from the insufficient characters given , that they are mere varieties .
with respect to the <unk> appendages , we shall presently see in c .
virgata , that at corresponding points on the capitulum ( tab .
iii , fig .
2 b ) , there are two slight , closed prominences .
according to professor macgillivray , in c .
aurita , every gradation can be followed by which the appendages , at first closed , become tubular and open .
the opening would ensue , if the corium became absorbed at the bottom of the appendages whilst still <unk> , for then the inner tunic would be cast off at the next moult and would not be <unk> , whilst the outer membrane would gradually disintegrate together with the other external parts of the capitulum , and not being <unk> at this point , an aperture would at last be left .
these appendages have no relation to the generative system : the ovarian tubes , which surround the sack do not extend into them ; nor do the ovigerous lamellæ .
i believe , that their function is respiratory : the corium lining them is traversed by <unk> <unk> channels , and their <unk> , tubular and open structure must freely expose a large surface to the <unk> water .
why this species should require larger respiratory organs than any other , i know not .
in this species , moreover , the filamentary appendages are developed to a greater extent than in any other cirripede ; in most genera , the surface of the body and of the sack suffices for respiration .

membrane , thin .
valves , thin , small , sometimes imperfectly calcified , very variable in shape and in proportional length , and therefore , situated at variable distances from each other , but always remote and imbedded in membrane .
scuta , <unk> , consisting of an upper and lower lobe ( the latter generally the broadest ) , united into a straight flat disc , with a third lobe standing out from the middle of the exterior margin , generally at an <name> of from <unk> to <unk> ( rarely at right angles ) to the upper part , and generally ( but not always ) bending a little inwards .
the shape of the lateral lobe varies from rounded oblong to an <unk> triangle ; as it approaches this latter form , it becomes much wider than the upper or lower lobes .
in one specimen , and only on one side , the scutum ( fig .
2 d ) presented five points or projections .
in some specimens , the scuta are very imperfectly calcified , and consist of several quite separate beads of calcareous matter of irregular shape , held together by tough brown membrane .
terga , extremely variable in shape , placed at nearly right angles to the scuta : beyond their carinal ends ( fig .
2 b ) , the capitulum presents two small prominences , which are important as indicating the position of the homologous , <unk> appendages in c .
aurita .
[ 39 ] the upper ends of the terga are imbedded in membrane , and project freely like little horns for about one third of their length : this free portion exactly answers to the projecting portion , bounded by the two occludent margins , in the terga of lepas .
the freely projecting portion is generally curled inwards , and the carinal portion more or less outwards ,  the form of the letter <unk> being thus approached ; but the <unk> are not exactly in the same plane .
the whole valve is generally of nearly equal width throughout , the carinal part being a very little ( but in some specimens considerably ) wider ; internally , it is deeply concave ; both points generally are blunt and rounded .
in some rare varieties ( <unk> <unk> of leach , fig .
2 c ) , the terga are much smaller and flat , with both points sharp , the whole upper portion being much and abruptly attenuated , and internally , without a trace of a concavity .
generally , the terga are about two thirds of the length of the scuta , rarely only half their length ; generally , they are separated from the apices of the scuta by about their own length , rarely by twice their own length .
generally , the terga are shorter than the <name> , but sometimes a very little longer than it : generally they are distant by one third or one fourth of their own length from the apex of the <name> , rarely by their entire length .
[ 39 ] these have also been observed by dr. <unk> ; see 'journal of acad .

<name> ( fig .

length , variable , generally rather longer ( sometimes by even one third of its own length ) than the scuta , but sometimes equalling only three fourths of the length of the scuta ; generally longer than the terga .
upper and lower points rounded ; in rare varieties , both ends are sharply acuminated .
the <name> and terga are generally most acuminated where they are smallest and least perfectly calcified ; and consequently , in this same state , the valves stand furthest apart .
peduncle , flattened , gradually widening as it joins the capitulum , to which it is generally about equal in length , or a little longer .
filamentary appendages.  six on each side ( pl .
ix , fig .
4 ) , of which one ( h ) is seated on the posterior margin of a swelling , beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , and this is the longest ; the second ( g ) is short and thick , and is seated a little lower on the side of the prosoma , ( near to this , there are also two little <unk> <unk> ; ) the third ( i ) is seated on the posterior margin of the pedicel of the first cirrus , above the basal articulation ; the fourth , fifth , and sixth ( j , k , l ) in similar positions on the pedicels of the third , fourth , and fifth cirri .
these three latter filaments are shorter and smaller than the first three .
at the base of the second cirrus , which has no proper filament , there is a swelling as if one had been united to it .
mouth.  mandibles , with the basal edges of the five teeth pectinated by minute , short , strong spines on one side ; inferior <name> extremely short .
in one specimen , there was a minute pectinated tooth between the first and second ; in another , the second tooth was bifid on its summit ; in another , the fourth was rudimentary .
maxillæ , with five steps : sometimes each step commences with a spine rather larger than the others ; at the upper <name> , there are two large unequal spines ( neither pectinated , ) with a third longer and thinner , seated a little below .
outer maxillæ ( pl .

16 ) , simple .
cirri , with twice as many segments in the sixth cirrus as in first ; spines on the first and second cirri doubly serrated .
colours ( when alive ) .  capitulum and peduncle grey , with a tinge of blue , with six black bands , tinged with purplish brown .
the two bands near the <name> become confluent on the peduncle , and sometimes disappear ; the <name> is edged , and the interspace between the two scuta , coloured with the same dark tint .
the whole body and the pedicels of the cirri are dark <unk> , with the segments of the cirri almost black : in some specimens , the colour seems laterally abraded from the cirri .
ova white , becoming in spirits pinkish , and then yellow .
the dark bands on the capitulum and peduncle become in spirits purple ; but are sometimes discharged ; the general grey tint disappears .
professor macgillivray states that many individuals are <unk> or <unk> , with irregular brown streaks , or crowded dots : he states that in very young specimens the colours are paler , and the valves <unk> .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , had a capitulum rather above one inch long and three fourths of an inch wide : growth very rapid .
monstrous <unk>  in the british museum , there is a dried and somewhat injured specimen of a monstrous variety , the <unk> <unk> of j. e. gray : it differs from the common form only in having a tubular projection , just behind the notch separating the upper points of the terga ; this tube springs from over the terga , and is , therefore , in a different position from the <unk> appendages in conchoderma aurita .
it does not open into the sack : the membrane composing it appears to have been double in the upper part , and to have been lined with corium : in short , this tube seems to have been an <unk> or <unk> , of a cup or tubular form .
general remarks.  it <name> have been seen how much subject to variation the valves of this species are .
when i first examined the <unk> <unk> of leach , from <unk> n .
<unk> , atlantic ocean , and found in many specimens , both old and young , that the terga were very small , flat , acuminated at both ends , with a projecting shoulder on the carinal margin , and situated at about their own length from the apex of the <name> , and at twice their own length from the scuta ; and when i found the <name> acuminated at both ends , and the scuta very imperfectly calcified , with the lateral lobe broad , flat , and standing out at right angles ; and lastly , when i found the whole capitulum bluntly pointed , instead of being square on the summit , i had not the least doubt , that it was a quite distinct species .
afterwards , i found in the <unk> <unk> of leach , from the south atlantic , the same form of terga ; but within slightly more concave or furrowed , and not nearly so small , and therefore not placed at above half so great a distance from the other valves ; and here , the <name> had its usual outline , as had nearly the scutum on one side , whereas , on the other side , it presented a new and peculiar form , having five ridges or points , and was imperfectly calcified ; seeing this , it was impossible to place much weight in the precise form or size ( and therefore , relative separation , ) of the calcified valves ; and on close examination , i found every part of the mouth and cirri identical in leach 's <unk> <unk> and c .
<unk> , and in the common form .
therefore , i conclude , that c .
<unk> , and still more c .
<unk> , are only varieties ; the terga presenting the greatest , yet variable , amount of difference , namely , in their <unk> and flatness .
we know , also , that in the species of the closely allied genus of lepas , the terga are very variable in shape , and this is the case , even in a still more marked degree , in conchoderma aurita .
professor macgillivray , i may add , has come to a similar conclusion regarding the extreme variability of the valves of this species .
as the varieties here mentioned are very remarkable , and may perhaps turn out to be true species , i think they are worth describing in some detail : i <name> only further add , that we must either make several new species , or consider , as i have done , several forms as mere varieties .

again , i possess a group of remarkably fine specimens given me by mr. l. reeve , from the southern ocean , ( as i infer from a young lepas australis adhering to them , ) in which all the individuals , young and old , are characterised as follows :  scuta , with the lateral lobe generally broad , but to a very varying extent , with the upper and lower lobes extremely sharp .
terga separated from the scuta , by one and a fourth of their own length , and by their own length from the <name> ; somewhat acuminated at both ends , nearly straight , with a very slight shoulder near the umbo .
<name> equalling the terga in length , and about three fourths of the length of the scuta ; neither the upper nor lower point much acuminated .
all the valves most imperfectly calcified : in one specimen , the scutum on one side was simply horny , without a particle of calcareous matter .
the summit of the capitulum nearly intermediate in outline between the common square , and <unk> form of var .
<unk> .
i compared the cirri and trophi with those of a common variety , and could detect not the smallest difference .
this variety differs from var .
<unk> , in the less development of its <name> , and from <unk> , in the greater development of its <name> , and especially of its terga .
it would appear as if the great variability of the valves was connected with the absence of calcareous matter .

[ 40 ] [ 40 ] i owe to the kindness of professor <name> , an examination of these specimens , and information regarding them .
capitulum , with the membrane very thin ; summit <unk> pointed .
valves linear and thin .
scuta , elongated , flat , with the upper projecting lobe rather more acuminated than the lower , and equalling it in length ; lateral lobe not wider than the lower , and about as long as it , forming an <name> of about <unk> with the upper one .
terga , of somewhat variable length , generally about half as long as the <name> , narrow , and of nearly equal width throughout ; lower point sharp ; externally convex ; internally solid , with a trace of a central depressed line ; the upper fourth part generally a little bowed out of the plane of the lower part , and abruptly bent at rather above a right <name> along the occludent margin of the orifice .
these valves are situated at about half their own length from the upper points of the scuta .
<name> considerably arched , extending to the lower points of the terga , or running up between them for even half their length ; equally narrow throughout ; scarcely broader than the terga ; both points rounded ; internally concave ; the lower point does not extend as far down as that of the lower lobe of the scuta .
peduncle , narrow , shorter than the capitulum , which , in the largest specimen was <unk> of an inch long .
longitudinal purple bands appear to have originally existed on the peduncle .
filamentary appendages , trophi and cirri all similar to the same parts in c .
virgata ; but perhaps the anterior faces of the segments in the posterior cirri are rather less protuberant ; perhaps also the first cirrus is rather shorter in proportion to the sixth cirrus .
variety ( monstrous ) .  amongst the specimens , i found one very young one , in which the scuta had not upper lobes , so that in outline they exactly resembled the scuta in the quite distinct c .
aurita : there was not even a rudiment of a <name> : the tergum , on one side , was externally bordered by a projecting , semicircular , calcified disc ; and the upper points of both terga showed only traces of the rectangular projection , which is the chief characteristic of c .
<unk> .
from these traces alone , and from the specimen being mingled with the others , do i here include this variety .
general remarks.  i have very great doubts whether i have acted rightly in considering this as a species ; but as there were many specimens , old and young , all differing remarkably from the common species , this form anyhow deserves description .
the points by which it can be distinguished from c .
virgata , are  the almost rectangular manner in which the upper portion of the tergum is bent outwards and along the orifice of the sack  the narrowness of all the valves , and especially of the lateral lobes of the scuta ,  and lastly , the greater curvature of the <name> , which in some specimens runs up far between the terga ; had this last character been constant , it would have been an important one , but such is far from being the case .
great as are these differences in the valves , and though common to many specimens , they are not sufficient to convince me that it is a true species , and i should not be at all surprised at varieties , intermediate between it and the common form , being hereafter found ;  had a name not been already attached to it , i should not have given one .
in the monstrous variety described , we see to what an extent the valves may vary .
the c .
<unk> approaches nearest to the var .
of c .
virgata , called by leach <unk> <unk> , for in both , the top of the capitulum is bluntly pointed and the terga are solid within ; in the var .
<unk> , the terga and <name> are minute , whereas here , though very narrow , they are much elongated .
certainly c .
<unk> has almost as strong a claim to rank as a species as c .
<unk> ; but , in the former , by the aid of other varieties , the differences were almost reduced to the peculiarities in the terga  the valves , the most subject to variation .
in c .
<unk> we have other differences , and the form of the terga is even still more peculiar .
i have , therefore , provisionally attached to it the specific name by which it is designated in the museum of the college of surgeons .
from having been long kept in spirits , all aid from colour is lost .

[ 41 ] any one not attending to the characters derived from the softer parts of the <unk> and lepadidæ , might easily confound with alepas the genus <unk> ( genus nov. ) , which , undoubtedly , though having the external appearance of a pedunculated cirripede , belongs to the <unk> , and is closely related to <unk> .
filaments seated beneath the basal articulations of the first pair of cirri ; mandibles , with two or three teeth ; maxillæ notched , with the lower part irregular , projecting ; caudal appendages <unk> .
attached to various living objects , fixed or floating .
capitulum either entirely destitute of valves , or with transparent horny scuta , not containing any calcareous matter , and almost hidden in membrane .
these scuta are formed of a lower and a lateral lobe , placed at above right angles to each other ; they are added to by successive layers , and closely resemble in shape the scuta of the conchoderma aurita .
the orifice in a .
<unk> projects so much as to be almost tubular .
in a .
<unk> and a .
<unk> it does not project , and is either moderately large , or very small in proportion to the length of the capitulum ; from contraction it is much wrinkled .
the membrane forming the capitulum is smooth and very transparent ; it contains very few tubuli , except under certain irregular projections in a .
cornuta .
the peduncle is rather short and narrow ; it blends into the capitulum , and is not , in some of the species , separated from it by any distinct line ; the surface of attachment is rather wide .
within the peduncle we have the three usual layers of <unk> muscles ; namely , the innermost and longitudinal , which run lower down than the others ; the middle and transverse ; and , lastly , the exterior , oblique muscles , which cross each other ( becoming transparent ) on the rostral central line .
these several muscles run up from the peduncle and surround the capitulum ; from the transparency of the membranes they can be seen from the outside : they are particularly conspicuous round the orifice , which they probably serve to close .
there is , in all cases , the usual adductor scutorum muscle ( with transverse striæ ) , which is attached under the horny scuta , where such exist .
the fact of the <unk> muscles of the peduncle surrounding the whole capitulum , has been observed only in one other genus , namely anelasma .
in consequence of this structure , the capitulum must possess considerable powers of contraction .
the antennæ of the larva in the alepas cornuta and a .
<unk> have the sucking disc nearly circular , with the spines unusually plain on the distal as well as <unk> margin .
basal segment broad , much constricted where united to the disc .
the ultimate segment has on the middle of the outer margin , in a .
cornuta , two minute spines , which i have not observed in any other cirripede : on the summit there are the usual spines .
size.  three of the species are small .
filamentary appendages.  these are rather small ; there is only one on each side , situated on the posterior margin of a slight swelling , beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; and therefore in the position in which the filaments are most constant in lepas , and where they likewise occur in conchoderma .
<unk>  the prosoma is either pretty well developed or is small , according as the first cirrus is placed near to , or far from the second cirrus .
mouth.  labrum moderately bullate , with the lower part more or less produced ; crest with blunt , bead-like teeth , and short hairs .
palpi ( pl .
x , fig .
8 ) , acuminated and narrow to an unusual degree .
mandibles , with two or three teeth , and the inferior <name> acuminated ; the lateral bristles unusually strong , so as to give the main teeth the appearance of being pectinated .
maxillæ , widely notched , with three great upper spines ; the part beneath the notch projecting , and either straight or irregular .
outer maxillæ , with the inner bristles either continuous or divided into two groups : exteriorly there is a smaller or larger prominence , with long bristles .
the olfactory orifices are either slightly , or not at all protuberant .
cirri.  in the three posterior pair , the segments have their bristles arranged in a transverse row , either in the form of a narrow brush , or consisting only of a single pair with two or three minute , intermediate , and lateral marginal spines .
the anterior ramus of the second cirrus is thicker , and more thickly clothed with spines than is the posterior ramus : this latter ramus , however , and both rami of the third cirrus , are rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior pair .
the unique case in a .

caudal appendages , thin , tapering , <unk> , about as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
<unk>  the oesophagus runs in a somewhat sinuous course , and enters the top of the stomach obliquely .
there are no cæca .
the <unk> envelope presents a <unk> structure , instead of the usual longitudinal folds .
generative system.  the penis is hairy , not very long , and ringed or articulated in an unusually plain manner ; the space between each ring being about one fourth of the diameter of the penis : the <unk> basal portion or support is here remarkably long .
the vesiculæ seminales are long , tortuous , and enter the prosoma .
the ovarian tubes are of wide diameter : in a .
cornuta they surround the whole capitulum .
the ovigerous fræna are small , constricted at the base , and square on the free margin , which is studded with minute glandular beads , borne on the finest footstalks .

a .

[ 42 ] [ 42 ] it appears that <unk> ( <unk> des .
<unk> , vol .
i , p. 34 ) observed a species of this genus adhering to a <unk> on the coast of brazil .
mr. cocks informs me that an alepas , apparently a .
<unk> , has been cast on shore near <unk> , attached to a <unk> ; and that two other specimens adhered to the bottom of a vessel arriving at that port from <name> .
affinities.  this genus differs from all , except anelasma , in the manner in which the <unk> muscles of the peduncle run up and surround the capitulum , and likewise in the <unk> character of the <unk> envelope of the stomach .
to conchoderma , especially to c .
aurita , there is manifest affinity in the form of the horny scuta : there is also some affinity to this same genus in the presence of filamentary appendages though here little developed , and in the circular form of the disc of the larval antennæ , and , lastly , in the ovarian tubes in a .
cornuta surrounding the capitulum .
there is quite as close , if not closer affinity to ibla , in the following peculiarities ,  in the curved oesophagus ,  in the general character of the cirri and trophi , with the olfactory orifices in one species in some degree prominent ,  in the <unk> caudal appendages ,  and in the <unk> penis , with its elongated <unk> support , though both these characters are exaggerated in ibla .
lastly , the scuta in ibla , though not at all resembling in shape those of a .
cornuta , are formed without calcareous matter ; and again , in ibla , the muscles of the peduncle run up to the bases of the valves , and so almost surround the space in which the animal 's body is lodged .
the four species of alepas appear to form two little groups ; viz .
a .

capitulum oval , blending insensibly into the peduncle ; moderately flattened ; composed of thin <unk> membrane , with the exception of two horny , almost quite hidden scuta .
orifice situated near the summit , and in a line , which is oblique to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle ; much wrinkled ; barely one third of the length of the whole capitulum .
the scuta , consist of yellowish , transparent , horny , laminated chitine , without any calcareous matter ; externally covered by the common integument of the capitulum ; these valves are placed very near to each other , close under the orifice , and therefore high up on the capitulum ; the membrane between them is smooth and <unk> ; they are formed of two rather acuminated lobes , joining each other at above a right <name> ; one lobe ( the longer one ) stretching nearly transversely across the capitulum , the other running down parallel to its rostral margin : in shape and position they resemble the scuta of conchoderma aurita ; and if another lobe had been developed it would have run along the orifice , and then these valves would have resembled the scuta of conchoderma virgata .
in a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , the scuta from point to point were <unk> of an inch in length .
peduncle , much wrinkled , about one third in diameter of the capitulum , and shorter than it ; at the base it is generally expanded into two or three <unk> projections .
length of the largest specimen , about one fourth of an inch .
colour , according to a. <unk> in the work above cited , " <unk> <unk> ; " but after spirits the whole becomes uniformly yellowish .
filamentary appendages , situated beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , on the posterior edge of the usual enlargement ; acuminated , about two thirds of the length of the shorter ramus of the first cirrus .
prosoma well developed .
mouth.  on each side there are two slight prominences ; one under the mandibles , the other transverse nearer to the adductor muscle .
labrum , placed near the adductor muscle , with the upper part not more bullate than the lower part ; crest with a row of blunt teeth , and many fine bristles growing chiefly outside the teeth ; there are many fine bristles on the inner or supra-oesophageal fold of the labrum .
palpi not nearly touching each other , pointing towards the adductor : much hollowed out on their inner sides , hence narrow and acuminated , with doubly serrated bristles .
mandibles , with three teeth and the inferior <name> ending in a single sharp spine ; whole inferior portion narrow ; first tooth as far from the second , as the latter from the inferior <name> ; owing to the presence of short thick spines projecting from the sides of the jaw , the lower edges of the second and third teeth appear pectinated .
maxillæ , nearly two thirds of the width of the mandibles ; beneath the three larger upper spines there is a considerable notch , and the whole lower part is very slightly upraised ; edge irregular , with obscure traces of either two projections , or perhaps of four steps .
outer maxillæ , with bristles in front continuous ; exteriorly there is a slight prominence near each olfactory orifice , with a tuft of long bristles .
cirri not much elongated ; first pair placed not quite close to the second ; five posterior cirri nearly equal in length ; pedicels long , with irregularly scattered spines ,  those on the pedicel of the first cirrus beautifully and conspicuously feathered .
the segments of the three posterior pair are not very short or broad ; very slightly protuberant , each with a long transverse , <unk> , narrow brush of bristles , which stand two or three deep in the middle , but on the sides are single : dorsal tufts long , and in the upper segments the spines are thick and <unk> .
this structure is common to all the cirri .
first cirrus with the rami unequal in length by two segments ; from the shortness of the pedicel , this cirrus is much shorter than the second , but its rami are about two thirds of the length of those of the second cirrus .
second cirrus ( and in a less degree the third cirrus ) , with the anterior ramus a shade broader than the posterior ramus , and rather more thickly covered with spines than are the three posterior cirri .
fifteen segments in the sixth cirrus ; nine in the longer ramus of the first cirrus .
caudal appendages , rather longer than the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , composed of seven cylindrical , tapering segments , each with a circle of very fine bristles on its summit .
the acoustic ( ? )
sacks are situated some way below the basal articulations of the first cirrus .

[ 44 ] m. <unk> rang rejects the specific name " <unk> , " as <unk> a generic character , and he has been followed in this by mm .
quoy and gaimard themselves .
this , according to the rules of the british association , would hardly have been a sufficient reason , but it appears that a .
<unk> , like a .
<unk> , has a pair of horny scuta or valves ; and , therefore , the name <unk> is too obviously false to be retained .
with respect to the generic name triton , i fully believe that it was applied by linnæus to the cast-off <unk> of sessile cirripedes .

parasitic on <unk> , mediterranean and atlantic oceans : south shore of england ( ?
) [ 45 ] i have not seen this species , and have drawn up the above specific character from the plates and brief descriptions in the voyages of the <unk> and <unk> .
m. lesson thinks that his species differs from that of mm .
quoy and gaimard ; but as the peculiar yellow colour of the capitulum , general shape , short cirri , habits and range , are all common to both , i believe that they are identical .
there is , however , one singular difference , namely , that the cirri are coloured bright blue in the plate in the voyage of the <unk> , and yellowish in that in the voyage of the <unk> : this possibly may have resulted from the drawing in the latter case having been made from a specimen long kept in spirits .
m. lesson says that there are seven pair of cirri , from which i infer that this species has a pair of long , articulated , caudal appendages : he asserts that each cirrus has ten segments ; the cirri are short and little curled .
m. lesson remarks , that " deux <unk> <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> de <unk> <unk> : " i can hardly doubt but that these are horny scuta of nearly the same shape as in a .

capitulum globular , slightly flattened , smooth , translucent , entirely destitute of valves ; orifice slightly projecting or tubular , parallel to the longitudinal axis of the peduncle , with the edges sinuous ; it appears more tubular than it really is , from the <unk> of the part of the capitulum immediately beneath the orifice .
three small , flexible , horny , irregular prominences project from the carinal margin ; one at the bottom of the capitulum ; a second about half-way up it ; and a third generally close to the orifice ; but their positions vary a little , and the prominences vary still more in shape and size , being either rounded and very small , or much flattened and considerably prominent ; they are <unk> ; in the membrane under them a few tubuli may be seen , which are not elsewhere visible ; their summits are roughened with very minute points and beads of chitine ; others , still <unk> , are scattered over the whole capitulum .
peduncle short , narrower than the capitulum , into which it insensibly blends ; strongly wrinkled ; surface of attachment wide ; position with respect to the branches of the coralline , various .
size and <unk>  the largest specimen , including the peduncle , was half an inch in length , and <unk> of an inch across the capitulum ; colour , after having been long in spirits , <unk> .
filamentary appendages , one on each side , short , tapering and pointed ; seated on the posterior margin of a slight swelling beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus ; they are about equal in length to the pedicels of this cirrus .
the mouth is directed <unk> ; labrum much produced downwards , so as to be far separated from the adductor muscle ; moderately bullate , forming about one third of the longitudinal axis of the entire mouth ; upper part forming a slightly overhanging prominence ; crest with a row of blunt , bead-like teeth , and externally to them there are numerous curved short bristles .

mandibles , with either two or three teeth ; inferior <name> narrow and <unk> ; both sides covered with strong bristles or spines , projecting beyond the toothed edge .
maxillæ , with two large upper spines , and a third rather distant from them ; beneath these , there is a wide notch or hollow ; inferior part square , projecting , bearing six pair of moderately long spines , ( of which the central one is the longest , ) mingled with finer ones .
outer maxillæ , with a semicircular outline ; the serrated bristles in front are divided into two groups ; externally there is a rounded and very considerable projection covered with long bristles .
olfactory orifices slightly prominent , approximate , seated within and just beneath the rounded projections at the base of the maxillæ .
<unk>  prosoma little developed ; thorax small .
cirri , extremely long , but slightly curled , capable of being protruded so as almost to touch the base of the peduncle or the surface of attachment ; segments short , extraordinarily numerous .
in the three posterior cirri ( excepting the rudimentary rami ) , each segment supports two long , slightly serrated spines , with two or three minute intermediate ones , and with one or two very short , thick spines on the inner and upper lateral margins : dorsal tufts with only two or three long , fine , unequal spines .
all the segments are extremely flat , broad , short , with their anterior faces not protuberant ; the greater number of the segments , especially the lower ones , have very obscure articulations , to be seen only with a high power , and these can be capable of little or no movement .
first cirrus placed far from the second , with the top of its pedicel on a level with the top of the lower segment of the pedicel of the second cirrus ; rami short , barely half the length of those of the second cirrus ; unequal , the anterior ramus being only two thirds of the length of the posterior one ; the shorter ramus contains thirteen <unk> segments , with one side rather protuberant ; the longer ramus contains twenty-three thinner segments ; the segments on both rami are clothed with bristles , arranged in two or three rows , forming narrow transverse brushes .
second cirrus , with its pedicel long , and its rami nearly equalling in length those of the sixth pair ; the two rami of nearly equal length ; the anterior one rather thicker than the posterior one ; this posterior ramus has fifty-five segments !
the bristles on the second and third cirri are arranged on the same principle as on the three posterior pair ; but from an increase in size and number of the little intermediate bristles between the main pairs , and of those on the lateral rims , the segments , especially the basal ones , of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus , are clothed with thin brushes of bristles ; these same bristles , on the posterior ramus of the second , and on both rami of the third cirrus , can hardly be said to form brushes , though longer and more numerous than those on the three posterior pair of cirri .
fifth and sixth cirri.  these resemble each other , and have their inner or posterior rami in an almost rudimentary condition .
in the sixth cirrus ( pl .
x , fig .
28 ) the outer ramus ( a ) has actually sixty-three segments , whereas the rudimentary ramus ( k ) has only eleven , nearly cylindrical segments .
these are furnished with extremely minute spines , of which those on the dorsal face are longer than those on the anterior face ; the spines on the summit of the terminal segment are the longest ; the segments are not half as thick as the normal ones in the outer ramus .
the rudimentary ramus is only one seventh part longer than the pedicel which supports both it and the normal ramus .
in the fifth cirrus , the rudimentary ramus is rather longer , and has thirteen segments , resembling those in the rudimentary ramus of the sixth .
in the fourth cirrus there is no trace of this peculiar structure , the rami being equal in length and strength .
the two rudimentary rami on each side are nearly straight , and seem incapable of movement ; they project out behind the normal rami , and closely resemble in general appearance , the two caudal appendages ; hence this cirripede , at first sight , appears to be <unk> .
pedicels of cirri.  the pedicel of the first pair is very short ; that of the second is the longest ; those of the posterior cirri decreasing in length .
upper segments short ; lower segments in the second , third and fourth cirri , irregularly and rather thickly clothed with bristles , but in the fifth and sixth cirri , there is a regular double row of main spines , with some minute intermediate ones : hence there is a difference , both in the rami and in the pedicels , between the fourth cirrus and the fifth and sixth , and this is a unique case .
on the dorsal surface of the pedicel of the second cirrus , there is a tuft of much feathered fine spines .
caudal appendages.  each consists of eight much tapering , very thin segments , furnished with a few short simple spines round their upper margins , and with a longer tuft on the terminal short segment ; basal segments twice as thick as the middle ones .
in length , these caudal appendages equal the pedicels of the sixth pair of cirri , and are a very little shorter than the rudimentary rami of these same cirri .
general remarks.  having examined this species first in the genus , i fully anticipated that the very remarkable character of the inner rami of the fifth and sixth cirri being rudimentary , and serving the same function ( if any ) with the caudal appendages , would have been generic ; but this is not the case , for alepas cornuta can not be separated from a .
<unk> without violating a clear natural affinity .

* * * * * i owe to the great kindness of professor steenstrup , an examination of this very curious cirripede , well described and figured by <unk> , who considered it an alepas .
it lives parasitic , with its peduncle imbedded in the skin of sharks , in the north sea .
according to the principles of classification which i have followed , this cirripede can not possibly remain in alepas , and must form a new genus ; for some time , indeed , i thought that a new family or <unk> ought to have been instituted for its reception ; but when i considered that its highly peculiar characters are all negative , as the <unk> , <unk> structure of the cirri , and that no new or greatly modified functional organ is present , i concluded that it might properly remain amongst the lepadidæ .
we shall , moreover , hereafter see that the male of ibla , which , of course , must remain in the same family with the female , is , in some analogous respects , even more abnormal than anelasma .

capitulum , destitute of valves ; oval , much flattened ; the double membrane composing it , thin , highly flexible , coloured externally and internally , by the underlying corium , of a blackish purple ; aperture , extremely large , extending from the upper end of the capitulum , to close above the peduncle , gaping , and not protecting ( in the dead condition ) the cirri and mouth .
the peduncle is about half as long as the capitulum , but , according to <unk> , this part varies in length ; it is a little narrower than the capitulum ; colourless , from being imbedded in the shark 's skin ; <unk> ; basal end almost hemispherical .
total length of animal <unk> ; diameter of peduncle <unk> of an inch .
the external membrane of the capitulum is not nearly so thick as is usual in other cirripedes , and is , therefore , unusually flexible .
the internal membrane , on the other hand , is very much thicker than is usual , being only a little thinner than the outside coat ; this circumstance , as well as the similarity in colour on both sides , is evidently due to the remarkable <unk> of the sack , and consequent exposure of its inside .
the inner membrane , when viewed under a high power , is seen to be covered with the minutest spines ; the external membrane is <unk> , except that there are a few rows of very minute beads of hard chitine , like those which occur on the capitulum of conchoderma aurita .
<unk> , however , states that there are imbedded in the outer membrane , scattered , minute , <unk> , calcareous particles .
of these , i could see no trace .
there is a very thin muscular layer between the two coats , all round the capitulum , and this layer becomes rather thicker round the base , near the peduncle .
the adductor muscle , occupying its usual place close below the mouth , is thinner than in any other cirripede of the same size seen by me ; nor does it end so abruptly at each extremity , as is usual : where attached to the outer coat , no impression is left .
it is a singular fact , that in this cirripede alone , the fibres of the adductor , and of the muscles of the cirri , and of the trophi of the mouth , are destitute of transverse striæ ; but it is not singular , that the muscles surrounding the capitulum should , also , be destitute of striæ , for this is the case with the muscles which , running up from the peduncle , surround the capitulum in alepas , and partly surround it in conchoderma .
it must not be inferred from the absence of transverse striæ in the muscular fibres of the adductor and of the cirri and trophi , that they are involuntary , but only that they are in an embryonic condition , for i find in the natatory larva , that all the muscles , with the exception of some connected with the eyes , are similarly destitute , and yet perform voluntary movements .
[ 46 ] [ 46 ] dr. c. schmidt in his contribution to the comparative anatomy of the <unk> animals , & c. , ( translated in <unk> scientific memoirs , vol .
v , p. 1 , ) says that in young crustacea , " we find plain primitive fibres , which subsequently acquire the transversely <unk> aspect . "
although in the dead state , the aperture of the capitulum seems to be always gaping , yet i have little doubt , that the living animal can fold the flexible membrane , like a mantle , round its thorax and cirri , and thus protect , though feebly compared with most cirripedes , these organs .
i suspect that the mouth is always exposed .
<unk>  the membrane of the peduncle is thin ; the whole surface is sparingly and quite irregularly studded with minute , <unk> filaments ( pl .
iv , fig .
3 , highly magnified ) ; these are occasionally as much as <unk> of an inch in length ; the degree of branching varies much , but is generally highly complex ; the ordinary diameter of the branches is about <unk> of an inch ; their tips are rounded , and even a little enlarged , and frequently torn off , as if they had been attached to or buried in the flesh of the shark , in which the whole peduncle is imbedded .
these filaments are formed of , and are continuous with the external transparent membrane of the peduncle , and they contain , up to the tips of every <unk> , a hollow thread of corium , prolonged from the layer internally coating the whole peduncle .
in all other lepadidæ , the peduncle increases in length , chiefly at the summit where joined to the capitulum , and in diameter , throughout nearly its whole length , except close to the base ; but , owing to the constant disintegration of the outer surface , the old outside coat does not split in defined lines , like the membrane of the capitulum .
in anelasma , however , owing to the imbedded position of the peduncle , the old outer coats are preserved , the lines in which they have split during continued growth being thus exhibited : those in the uppermost part almost symmetrically surround the peduncle , showing that here , as in other lepadidæ , has been one regular line of growth ; but in the lower part the lines are extremely irregular ; and what is almost unique , it appears that the blunt basal end is constantly increasing in length and breadth , and , apparently , at a greater rate than any other part .
i judge of this latter fact , from the whole bottom of the peduncle being covered with numerous curved , or nearly circular , lines of natural splitting , the nature of which can be best understood by examining the <unk> drawing ( pl .
iv , fig .
3 ) of a small portion ( taken by chance ) of the membrane of the base , seen from the outside , and bearing some of the simplest branched filaments : other branches , as may be seen , have been cut off .
this manner of growth explains the broad , blunt basal termination of the peduncle , so unlike that in other lepadidæ .
new membrane is formed , not continuously as in other cases , under the whole surface of the old membrane , but in irregular patches ; thus the portion marked ( a ) runs under ( b ) , but not under the little circles ( c , c ) , for these are the <unk> portions and <unk> the membrane ( a ) and ( b ) .
i do not understand how the splitting of the old membrane is effected ; but no doubt it is by the same process by which the membrane of the capitulum in other genera , as in scalpellum , splits symmetrically between the several valves .
in the branched filaments it is particularly difficult to understand their growth , for it is not possible , after examining them , to doubt that they continue to increase , and send off <unk> , which it would appear probable , penetrate the shark 's flesh like roots .
i may remark that one , or more commonly two or three branched filaments stand nearly in the centre of each circular line of exuviation or splitting .
the branched filaments first commence as mere little <unk> , and these appear to be most numerous at the bottom of the peduncle .
the final cause of the downward growth of the bottom of the peduncle , is obviously to allow of the animal burying itself in the shark 's body , in the same way as <unk> and <unk> become imbedded by the downward growth of their <unk> in the skin of <unk> .
the only other genus of lepadidæ , in which the growth of the peduncle is at all analogous , is lithotrya , in this genus , however , the animal burrows mechanically into soft rock or shells .
i looked in vain for cement , or for the <unk> , ( but the specimen was in an extremely unfavorable state for finding the latter ) or for the prehensile antennæ of the larva .
no doubt this cirripede at first becomes attached in the same way as others , but after early life , i suspect it is retained in its place , by being so deeply imbedded in the shark 's body , and perhaps by the <unk> branched filaments .
the irregular growth and splitting of the membrane at the base of the peduncle , where the prehensile antennæ of the larva must originally have been situated , would account for not finding them .
the inside of the peduncle ( fig .
2 g ) was gorged , in the specimen examined by me , with immature ova .
the innermost muscular layer consists of longitudinal bundles of unusual size , but placed rather far apart from each other ; these do not extend to the very base of the peduncle , and at the upper end they curve inwards , almost to the middle of the under side of the diaphragm , separating the peduncle and capitulum .
outside these longitudinal muscles , there are delicate transverse ones , but apparently there are no oblique muscles in the upper part of the peduncle , as in other lepadidæ ; near the bottom , the transverse muscles form a thicker layer with many of the bundles running in oblique lines .
mouth.  <unk> has not described this part quite accurately , owing to his not having used high enough <unk> powers .
he states that the trophi are soft and functionless , which is far from the case .
the whole mouth ( fig .
2 d ) , is unusually small ; it is , to a certain extent , probosciformed , and being curved a little downwards , projects slightly over the adductor muscle , to which it is closely placed .
the labrum does not project more beyond the general surface of the body , than in many other cirripedes , but the probosciformed structure is caused by the elongation of the surface fronting the thorax .
the summit of the mouth stands above the level of the top of the pedicels of the first pair of cirri .
the labrum is slightly hollowed out in the middle of its upper margin ; it can scarcely be called bullate , in which it differs from all other lepadidæ ; on the other hand , the outer and inner folds of the labrum are not so close together as in balanus .
on each upper corner , there is , as usual , a small rounded prominence , close to which there is a second slight , rounded , <unk> swelling ; these latter represent the quite rudimentary palpi .
the mandibles ( figs .
4 , 5 ) are more highly developed than the other trophi ; they are , however , very minute , the toothed edge being only about <unk> of an inch in length , measured in its longest direction ; the edge is unusually thick , with the teeth placed rather on one side ; this organ , when viewed on the labrum side ( fig .
5 ) , shows two large teeth placed low down , with the inferior <name> pectinated and broadly truncated ; but when viewed on the other or maxillæ side ( fig .
4 ) , several large and small teeth , placed alternately and irregularly in pairs , are seen extending along the whole edge .
the mandibles are furnished , as usual , with three principal sets of muscles attached to the basal fold of the mouth .
the maxillæ ( fig .
7 ) are still smaller than the mandibles ; the spinose edge being only the <unk> of an inch in length ; the edge , instead of being square , and furnished with a double row of long spines , as in all other cirripedes , is rounded , thick , <unk> , and with the side facing the mandibles , thinly and irregularly strewed with short , thick , very minute spines ; there is a large broad <unk> ( a ) , in the usual place , but it is much more transparent and flexible than common : there are also the usual muscles .
in other cirripedes , the mandibles alone seem to force the prey down the oesophagus ; but here , the mandibles and maxillæ equally stand over the orifice , and their adjoining spinose faces and edges , seem excellently adapted to force , by their united action , any minute living creature down the passage .
the outer maxillæ are almost in as rudimentary a condition as the palpi ; they are quite <unk> ; viewed externally , they appear like two smooth , blunt , very minute projecting points ; but viewed internally , the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal hollow seems to be united actually to their tips , so that they do not project at all .
i was surprised to find that the longitudinal muscles going to these organs were developed , in proportion to the other muscles , quite as fully as in ordinary cirripedes : hence , these two little outer maxillæ , no doubt , serve as an under lip , and possess the usual backward and forward movement .
the surface of the probosciformed mouth facing the first pair of cirri , has a deep central longitudinal fold , and rather more than half-way down , a transverse fold ; just above this latter fold , and therefore quite below the outer maxillæ themselves , the two olfactory orifices are seated ; these are unusually large , and the sack into which they lead , is most unusually large and deep .
in this cirripede , i was first enabled to observe that the membrane lining the sack is tubular , and open at the bottom .
cirri.  there are , as usual , six pair , and not of very small size ; they have a shapeless and rudimentary appearance ; they are coloured , like the rest of the body , blackish purple : they are quite <unk> , and not articulated , but their anterior faces are either obscurely or very plainly <unk> , so that in some ( for instance in the third pair , pl .
iv , fig .
6 ) , nine or ten prominent steps could be counted , manifestly representing so many segments .
the rami are equal in length in the first pair , and slightly unequal in the second and third pair ; these two latter are longer than either the first or three posterior pair .
there is a small interspace as usual between the first and second pair of cirri .
internally , the cirri are occupied , even up to their tips , by delicate <unk> muscles .
the external membrane of the thorax and limbs , when examined under a very high power , is seen to be covered with minute toothed scales , as in most cirripedes .
the thorax is articulated as usual : the posterior part , however , is smaller , and tapers more suddenly than in other species , and this corresponds with the smaller size and more rudimentary condition , of the three posterior pair of cirri , compared with the anterior pair .
the prosoma is hardly at all developed .
the orifice ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 e ) of the acoustic ( ? )
sack , beneath the first cirrus , is unusually large .
there are no filamentary appendages .
alimentary <unk>  the membrane lining the oesophagus is unusually thin : it is furnished with the ordinary <unk> muscles , and others radiating from them like spokes of a wheel .
the stomach is lined by unusually prominent <unk> folds , which in the <unk> are transverse , sending forth , however , short folds at right angles ; and these latter , in the proper stomach , become so much developed that the folds appear longitudinal .
the <unk> extends inwards , about as far as the base of the fourth pair of cirri , but is very short , owing to the little development of the three posterior segments of the thorax .
the anus is seated in its usual place , at the dorsal basis of the penis , and is hidden by loose folds of skin ; but there are no distinct caudal appendages .
the stomach , in the specimen examined , was quite empty .
reproductive <unk>  the penis ( fig .
2 , c ) is thick , short ( about twice as long as the sixth cirrus ) , constricted at the base , ringed , <unk> , with the terminal aperture large ; internally it is well furnished with muscles .
the two vesiculæ seminales , appeared to be unusually small ; and one was much smaller than the other ; they do not ( i believe ) become united into a common tube , till near the apex of the penis .
they were empty ; and , i presume , from the state of the ova , that their contents had lately been discharged .
the whole thorax was filled with a white , fibrous and cellular mass , consisting perhaps of the testes in their undeveloped state .
the individual dissected by me , appeared to have been defective in its last act of reproduction , for there were only two or three ova attached to the <unk> on one side , and not very many on the other .
the ova are much less elongated than is usual ; they are of a remarkable size , namely <unk> of an inch in their longer diameter ; the membrane by which they are united into a pair of lamellæ is remarkably strong ; the <unk> ( pl .
iv , fig .
2 f ) on each side is large , strong , with rounded edges , pale coloured and hence conspicuous ; on the side nearest the body , the whole surface is covered with <unk> glands , having very short footstalks , and being in total length <unk> of an inch ; these glands secrete a <unk> layer of <unk> fibres , attached to the ovigerous lamellæ .
in the specimen described by <unk> , the lamellæ ( fig .
1 , and fig .
2 , b , b ) appear to have been very large : and in that examined by myself , the peduncle was gorged with immature ova , showing that the female reproductive powers were ample , though at the foregoing period , only a few eggs had been formed .
<unk>  according to <unk> , this species lives imbedded in the skin of <unk> maximus and <unk> , in the north sea : i suspect that it is not closely compressed in its cavity , otherwise , i do not see the use of the two layers of muscles round the whole peduncle ; it probably adheres to the sides of the cavity by the tips of the branched , <unk> filaments ; owing to the flexible nature of the capitulum , this cirripede can offer little resistance to the water , and , therefore , is little likely to be torn out of its cavity .
i have no doubt that it can fold the membrane of the capitulum , like a cloak , round its thorax and cirri ; but it certainly can offer far less resistance , than other cirripedes , to any enemy .
this creature must obtain its food , and considering its productiveness much food must be required , in a manner quite different from nearly every other member of its order .
as the whole of the peduncle is imbedded , and as the mouth is probosciformed , with the labrum a little curled over the adductor muscle , i conclude that this cirripede can reach minute animals crawling by on the surface of the shark 's body .
it must be borne in mind that the mouth , as in all cirripedes , has the power of independent movement , and that the mandibles and maxillæ are here beautifully adapted to catch and force down any small living creature into the muscular oesophagus ; the rudimentary outer maxillæ , moreover , no doubt have the power of scraping , like a lip , anything towards these prehensile organs .
it <name> hereafter be seen , that the male of ibla cumingii , in which the cirri are quite rudimentary , obtains its food in a somewhat analogous manner , though in this case the whole peduncle moves , and not merely a probosciformed mouth : it deserves attention , that in the male ibla and in anelasma , in neither of which the cirri are prehensile , the palpi are rudimentary and useless .
i am tempted to believe , that the largely developed olfactory sacks , and perhaps , likewise , acoustic ( ? )
sacks , in anelasma , replace , by giving notice of the proximity of prey , the loss of <unk> cirri .
it should be remembered that all cirripedes subsist on animals which happen to swim or float within reach of the cirri ; but here it is only those which happen to crawl within reach of the probosciformed mouth .
it would , however , be rash to assert that the cirri in anelasma , considering their muscular though feeble structure , may not be of some slight use , when thrown over the prey , in preventing its escape .
professor steenstrup informs me that , from late observations , it appears that this animal always adheres to the shark 's body in pairs .
i regret extremely that i have not been able to examine a pair : that the individual examined by me was <unk> , i can hardly doubt , though the male organs certainly were feebly developed ; it appears probable , that the individual described by <unk> was likewise <unk> : but after the facts presently to be revealed regarding the sexes in ibla and scalpellum , it is quite possible that the male and female organs may be developed in inverse degrees in different and adjoining individuals .
the genus anelasma is , i think , properly placed between alepas and ibla .
in several of its characters , such as the absence of calcareous valves , the broad blunt end of the peduncle , the <unk> cirri , the small size of the trophi , and more especially the absence of transverse striæ in those muscles , which in mature cirripedes are thus furnished , we see that this genus is in some degree in an embryonic condition .

general remarks.  as there are only two species as yet known , and as these resemble each other in every respect most closely , a generic description would be a useless repetition of the full details given under ibla cumingii .
i have taken this latter species as the type , from having , owing to the kindness of mr. cuming , better and more numerous specimens .
ibla and lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle ; but there is no distinction of any importance , though useful for classification , between the capitulum and peduncle ; and these two parts , as we have seen , tend to blend together in some species of conchoderma and alepas .
the entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle , at first appears very remarkable ; but we have seen a similar fact in alepas , and there is an approach to it in some varieties of conchoderma aurita and c .
virgata .
in all four valves of ibla , the umbones , or centres of growth , are at their upper points .
the horny spines on the peduncle , are the <unk> of the calcareous scales in scalpellum and pollicipes ; and in this latter genus , two of the species have their scales , almost cylindrical , placed irregularly , with new ones forming over all parts of the surface , and not exclusively at the summit ,  in which several respects there is an agreement with ibla .
the shape of the body ( i .
e. thorax and prosoma , pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is peculiar ; but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera , and shall meet again in some species of scalpellum .
the presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the lepadidæ , though observed in the sessile genus , chthamalus .
the caudal appendages in the i .
quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family , being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
a far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus , in both species , running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle , instead of , as in every other species , close under this muscle .
i took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly : the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented in pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ by faint dotted lines .
the stomach has no cæca ; the <unk> folds are longitudinal ; there is a marked <unk> at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma .
there are no filamentary appendages .
the generative system gives the chief interest to this genus .
we here first meet with males and females distinct ; and , within the limits of this same restricted genus , the far more wonderful fact of hermaphrodites , whose masculine efficiency is aided by one or two complemental males .
the complemental and simple males closely resemble each other , as do the female and hermaphrodite forms ; but under the two following species i enter into such full and minute details on these remarkable facts , that i <name> not here <unk> on them .
i may add that , at the end of the genus scalpellum , i give a summary of the facts , and discuss the whole question .
the penis ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) in the hermaphrodite , i .
quadrivalvis , is singular , from the length of its <unk> support , and from the distinctness of the segments in the articulated portion .
as ovigerous fræna occur in the usual place in i .
quadrivalvis , though much smaller than in any other species , i have no doubt that they occur in i .
cumingii , although i failed in observing them .
the glands on the margin , in i .
quadrivalvis , are singular , from not being borne on a long , <unk> footstalk .
affinities.  ibla , though externally very different in appearance from scalpellum , is more nearly related to that genus than to any other ; in both genera some species have the sexes separate , the imperfect males being parasitic on the female , and other species are <unk> or hermaphrodite , but aided by parasitic complemental males .
in scalpellum , again , the oesophagus pursues a sinuous course , resembling that in ibla , though it does not pass exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle .
the disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva , in both genera , has an unusual oblong form , like a mule 's hoof ; there is also an affinity between the two genera in the size and form of the ova , in the prominent orifices of the olfactory cavities , and in the peduncle not being naked ; though , in these two latter respects , in the structure of the cirri , and in the <unk> caudal appendages , there is an equal affinity to pollicipes and lithotrya .
i have already shown that alepas is likewise related to ibla .

female .
the capitulum is formed of four valves , but is hardly distinct from the peduncle .
the latter includes , in its wide upper part , the <unk> body .
the valves , namely , a pair of scuta and terga , are composed of an extremely hard , horny substance , or properly chitine , and do not contain any calcareous matter ; they are extremely flat or thin , and both pairs project freely , like curved horns , to a considerable height above the sack enclosing the body : the terga project about twice as much as the scuta , and their flat apices generally diverge a little .
the tips of the valves are frequently broken off ; their surfaces are plainly marked or ribbed by the layers of growth , which are wide apart .
the bases of the valves externally are hidden by the long spines of the peduncle .
<unk>  these are shorter and broader than the terga ; their internal ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 b´ ) growing or <unk> surfaces are slightly concave , triangular , with the basal margin longer than the other margins and slightly <unk> in the middle : there is no depression for the strong adductor muscle : the internal surface of the free <unk> portion , has a small central fold ( formed by an oblique crest ) running from the summit of the triangular growing surface to the tip of the valve : in perfect specimens , the growing and the free <unk> portions ( the latter represented much too long in fig .
8 a´ and b´ ) are about equal in length : the basal portion of one side of the scutum <unk> the tergum .
<unk>  the internal glowing surface ( fig .
8 b´ ) is almost <unk> , and less in area than the <unk> : external surface rounded ; internal surface of the free <unk> portion , slightly concave .
colour and structure of <unk>  the external surfaces of the scuta and terga are yellow along the middle , plainly marked by zones of growth , and finely ribbed longitudinally : the internal surfaces and sides of the horns of the two valves , are coloured fine blue or purple ; in the terga , however , the internal surface is mottled with yellow .
in some specimens , especially in one from <unk> , each zone of growth was only very narrowly edged with blue .
when a thin layer is removed from one of the valves , the dark blue or rather purple appears by transmitted light a beautiful pale blue ; and it is a very singular fact , that this blue portion is permanently turned by very gentle into a fiery red ; the same singular effect is produced by muriatic and acetic acids .
this blue part is much harder than the yellow ; the latter exhibits , under a high power , a folded structure , and is penetrated by a few tubuli , whereas the harder blue portion has a cellular or scaled appearance .
the spines of the peduncle exhibit , in a smaller degree , similar phenomena .
<unk>  this , as already remarked , can not be distinctly separated from the capitulum ; it is much compressed ; it is composed of unusually thin and delicate membrane , transversely wrinkled and thickly clothed with long cylindrical horns or spines of chitine .
these horns ( fig .
8 <unk> ) are not the <unk> of the spines which are articulated on the external membranes of many pedunculated and sessile cirripedes , but of the calcified scales on the peduncle of scalpellum and pollicipes ; for they pass through the membrane ( the underlying corium being marked by their bases ) and are persistent , being added to , like the valves , during each successive period of growth .
their bases are concave , so that a section of the layers of growth exhibits a series of pointed cones , one within another .
each spine is nearly cylindrical , irregularly curled , and <unk> or slightly enlarged at intervals : the apex smooth and pointed ; the exterior surface longitudinally and finely ribbed , like the valves .
the spines increase irregularly in size from the bottom to the top of the peduncle , those at the carinal and rostral ends being generally the longest ; they point upwards and hide the bases of the valves .
they are not arranged symmetrically , and new ones are formed over all parts of the peduncle .
they are formed of the same substance as the valves , and do not contain any calcareous matter .
these horns are yellowish , generally ringed with pale and dark <unk> brown , which on pressure becomes slightly <unk> with pale blue and fiery red : sometimes only the upper horns are thus ringed , and in rare instances all are simply yellowish .
the muscles of the peduncle run up to the bases of the four valves .
surface of <unk>  the cement appears to proceed from only two points .
in some specimens , a considerable length of one side of the peduncle was fastened to the surface of attachment , the horns or spines being enveloped in the cement .
the prehensile antennæ of the larva <name> presently be described under the male .
the length of an average specimen , including the peduncle and valves , is about half an inch , and the width across the widest part one fifth of an inch .
mr. cuming has one specimen an inch in length , but this is owing to the peduncle being unusually tapering .
in a specimen kept some years in spirits , the cirri , trophi , caudal appendages , and corium under the membrane between the scuta , were all dark purple ; the sack and corium of peduncle clouded with purple , and the prosoma pale-coloured .
the body ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is small compared with the capitulum and peduncle ; it is much flattened ; the prosoma is of a very peculiar shape , being square , the sides of equal length , and , in an <unk> specimen , <unk> of an inch long .
the peculiar shape arises from the great distance between the first and second cirrus  from the mouth being far removed from the adductor scutorum muscle  and lastly , from the lower part of the prosoma being not at all protuberant .
the thorax which supports the cirri is also unusually small , plainly articulated , and separated from the prosoma by a deep fold .
the thin membrane of the prosoma is studded with some fine , pointed hairs , about <unk> in length , and articulated on little circular discs .
mouth , placed at a considerable distance from the adductor , and directed in an unusual manner towards the ventral surface of the thorax : the trophi are arranged , in a curved line , facing the thorax ( see pl .
v , fig .
2 , for this part in the male ) , and therefore less laterally than is usual .
labrum ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ opposite c ) highly bullate ; the upper part produced into a blunt point : on its crest there are no teeth .
palpi ( fig .
8 a´ opposite d ) small , blunt and rounded at their ends ; inner margins slightly concave .
mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
4 ) , with three teeth , of which the first is much larger than the second and third , and distant from them : inferior <name> produced and pectinated ; upper edges of the second and third teeth finely pectinated .
maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
11 ) small , slightly but distinctly indented by two notches , supporting , besides the three upper great spines , three pairs of moderately long spines and some finer ones : <unk> short , thick .
outer maxillæ , unusually pointed , with the inner bristles not very numerous , continuously arranged ; externally , the bristles are longer .
olfactory orifices , tubular , projecting , flattened , square on the summit , smooth : they point upwards and obliquely towards each other : they arise more laterally than in the other genera , namely outside the bases of the outer maxillæ , and between them and the inner maxillæ .
between the bases of the first pair of cirri , there is a conical prominence , clothed with bristles and coloured purple : it projects nearly as high as the top of the lower segment of the pedicel of the first cirrus : it lies over the <unk> ganglion , and serves , i suspect , to fill up a little interval between the outer maxillæ .
cirri long , little curved : the first pair ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) is situated at an extraordinary distance from the second ; hence its basal articulation is on a level with the upper articulation of the pedicel of the second cirrus .
in the three posterior cirri , the segments are laterally very flat , with their anterior surfaces not protuberant ; each supports three pairs of thin , <unk> bristles , of which the second pair is much shorter than the upper , and the lowest pair minute ; between each pair there is a minute , <unk> projecting bristle ; dorsal tufts consist of two or three spines , of which one is longer than the others .
the two bristles forming each pair , are not of equal length ; for in the rami of each cirrus , the inner row of bristles is much shorter than the outer ; and this seems to be connected with the flatness of the whole animal , and the consequent little power of divergence in the rami of the cirri .
the first cirrus is rather short , with the rami unequal in length by about two segments : the anterior ramus is shorter and thicker than the other : segments numerous , each clothed with several rows of bristles .
the second cirrus has the anterior ramus thicker and more thickly clothed with spines than the posterior ramus ; this latter is rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri ; the third cirrus is in all these respects characterised like the second cirrus , but in a lesser degree .
the pedicels of the second and third cirri are thickly and irregularly clothed with spines ; in the three posterior pairs , the spines are placed in two regular rows , with some minute intermediate spines .
caudal appendages ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , f ) , <unk> , thin , tapering , in one specimen equalling , in another just exceeding , in length the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
in the latter specimen there were thirteen segments , of which the basal segments were broader and shorter than the upper ; these latter are slightly constricted round the middle , so that they resemble , in a small degree , an <unk> .
their upper margins are surrounded by rings of bristles ; the terminal segment being surmounted by one or two very fine bristles much longer than the others .
the two appendages are closely approximate ; each arises from a narrow elongated slip , attached to the side of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
nervous system.  i examined the upper part of the nervous chord , in order to ascertain whether the <unk> ganglion , which is of a <unk> shape , was far separated from the second ganglion ; and this i found to be the case , in accordance with the distance of the first cirrus from the second .
i may here remark , that in s .
quadrivalvis i discovered the eye , which , though in all probability really double , appeared to be single ; it was situated near to the supra-oesophageal ganglion ; and this ganglion was situated near to the adductor scutorum muscle , and at a considerable distance from the labrum .
the aperture leading into the acoustic ( ? )
sack , is situated much lower down than is usual ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ ) , namely , at the length of the pedicel of the first cirrus beneath its basal articulation .
generative system.  the specimens here described , of which i examined six , are exclusively female ; they have no trace of the external , probosciformed penis , or of the two great vesiculæ seminales , or of the testes : on the other hand , the ovarian tubes within the peduncle are developed in the usual manner , and owing to the large size of the ova , are of large diameter , and hence very distinct : i detected , also , the true ovaria at the upper edge of the stomach .

of the above-described ibla cumingii i dissected six specimens , four from the philippine archipelago , [ 47 ] and two from the burmah empire , and none of them , as we have just seen , possessed the probosciformed penis , the vesiculæ seminales , or the testes , so conspicuous in other cirripedes ; on the other hand , all were furnished with the usual branching ovarian tubes and sometimes with ova , and consequently were unquestionably of the female sex .
within each of these specimens there was attached within the sack , in a nearly central line , at the rostral end , ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , h , magnified five times , ) a flattened , purplish , <unk> little body , projecting about the <unk> of an inch : in one of the six individuals , there was a second similar little creature attached at the carinal end of the sack .
before giving the reasons which i think conclusively prove that these little animals are the males of the ordinary form of the ibla cumingii , it <name> be convenient to describe their structure in detail .
[ 47 ] i am deeply indebted to the liberality and kindness of mr. cuming , in allowing me to cut up four specimens of this new species ; and to dr. gould , of boston , u. s. , for the examination of the burmese specimens .
the whole consists of a long , much flattened peduncle , separated from the mouth and thorax by an oblique fold , ( pl .
v , fig .
1 h , b ) , which is conspicuous on the dorsal margin under the cirri , and can be traced with difficulty to the ventral margin .
the thorax , itself rudimentary , and supporting rudimentary cirri , is in some individuals , as in the one represented ( fig .
1 , magnified 32 times ) , covered by , or received in the oblique fold h , just mentioned : in other individuals the thorax is drawn out , and then the fold shows merely as a notch on the dorsal margin , and the basal articulations of the cirri stand some little way above it .
the basal edge of the large , well-developed month can be traced all round , and on the ventral margin ( b ) , is generally marked by a slight notch .
the dimensions and proportions vary much : the longest specimen , including the imbedded portion , was <unk> , and the shortest barely <unk> of an inch in length ; the width of the widest portion varied from 1 to <unk> of an inch : the specimen figured ( pl .
iv , fig .
8 a´ , and pl .
v , fig .
1 , ) is a broad , short individual .
generally , the middle of the peduncle is rather wider than the upper part .
<unk>  the main part of the animal , as may be seen in the drawing , consists of the peduncle , of which the imbedded portion tapers more or less suddenly in a very variable manner , and is of variable length ,  in one specimen being one fourth of the entire length , and in another consisting of a mere minute blunt point .
the free upper part of the animal is bent in various directions , in relation to the imbedded portion .
the latter passes obliquely through the chitine membrane and corium , lining the sack of the female , and running along amidst the underlying muscles and <unk> fibrous tissue , is attached to them by cement at the extremity .
the peduncle is often , but not in the individual represented , much constricted at the point where it passes through the skin of the female , and generally at several other points , especially towards the extremity ( see fig .
1 ) ; the stages of its deeper and deeper <unk> being thus marked .
the <unk> are , i believe , simply due to the continued growth of the male , whilst the hole through the membrane of the female does not yield .
the <unk> , which is considerable only when the lower part of the peduncle is almost parallel to the coats of the sack , seems caused by the growth and repeated <unk> of the female ; i believe , that the larva attaches itself to the chitine tunic of the sack , and that the cement , by some unknown means , affects the underlying corium , so that this particular portion of the tunic is not moulted with the adjoining integuments , and that the growth of the surrounding parts subsequently causes this portion to be buried deeper and deeper : it is , i believe , in the same way as the end of the peduncle in conchoderma aurita , sometimes becomes imbedded in the skin of the whale to which it is attached .
the outer tunic of the peduncle is thin and <unk> : in the fold ( fig .
1 h ) under the cirri , there is a central triangular <unk> of still thinner membrane , corresponding in position to the membrane connecting the two terga in the female , and there subjected to much movement .
i may here remark , that this fold , in its office of slightly protecting the thorax and in its position , evidently represents the capitulum with its valves , enclosing the whole body of the female .
the outer tunic is lined by corium , mottled with purple , and within this there are two layers of <unk> muscles , transverse and longitudinal , as in all pedunculated cirripedes .
the corium extends some way into the imbedded portion of the peduncle , and consequently , the outer tunic there continues to be added to layer under layer , and as it can not be periodically moulted , it becomes much thicker than in the upper free part of the animal : the corium , however , does not extend to the extreme point , so that in it growth of all kind ceases .
<unk>  the peduncle terminates ( pl .
v , fig .
1 e ) in the two usual , larval , prehensile antennæ , which it is very difficult to see distinctly ; they are tolerably well represented in fig .
5 , greatly magnified .
their extreme length , measured from the basal articulation to the tip of the hoof-like disc , is <unk> of an inch , the disc itself being <unk> of an inch .
the disc is slightly narrower than the long basal segment , from which it is divided by a broad conspicuous articulation ; its lower surface is flat and its upper convex , altogether resembling in shape a mule 's hoof ; its apex is fuzzy with the finest down ; it bears a narrow ultimate segment , thrown , as usual , on one side ; this segment supports on its rounded irregular summit , at least five , i believe , judging from the structure of the same part in the male larva of ibla quadrivalvis , six or seven spines , longer than the segment itself : one long spine arises from the under side of the disc , near the base of the ultimate segment , and points backward : there is also a single curved spine on the outside , near the distal end of the basal segment .
these organs were imbedded in a <unk> ball or cylinder of brown , transparent , finely laminated cement , and thus attached to the fibrous tissue of the female .
the two cement-ducts ( fig .
1 f ) were very plain , each about <unk> of an inch in diameter , containing the usual inner chord of opaque cellular matter .
i traced them at the one end into the prehensile antennæ as far as the disc ; and at the other , up the peduncle for about one fourth of its length , where i lost them , and could not discover with certainty any cement glands .
i may , however , here mention , that i found in the lower half of the peduncle , numerous , yellowish , transparent , excessively minute , pyramidal bodies , with step-formed sides ; of these two or three often <unk> by their bases like crystals ; i have never seen anything like these in other cirripedes , but it has occurred to me that they may possibly be connected with the formation of the cement : for in the last larval condition of lepas , the cement-ducts run up to the <unk> ovaria , filled at this period with yellowish , <unk> , cellular masses , without the intervention of cement glands , and i can imagine that similar masses , not being developed into functional ovaria , might give rise to the yellow pyramidal bodies .
mouth.  the mouth is well developed ; it is represented as seen vertically from above , in pl .
v , fig .
2 , magnified about 60 times ; the positions of the cirri and the outline of the thorax are accurately shown by dotted lines ; a lateral view is given in fig .
1 .
in the specimen figured , the longitudinal diameter of the mouth , including the labrum , was <unk> of an inch .
the muscles of the several trophi have transverse striæ , and are the strongest and most conspicuous of any in the body .
the labrum is largely bullate , with its summit slightly concave ; the trophi are arranged in a remarkable manner , in a semicircular line , so as to be opposed to the labrum rather than to each other : there are no teeth or spines on the crest of the labrum , which <unk> the <unk> cavity .
the palpi ( fig .
2 b and fig .
3 ) are very small , dark purple , bluntly pointed , with a few small bristles at the point ; they do not extend beyond the knob at each corner of the labrum , which is here present , as in all other lepadidæ ; they are much smaller than in the female , though of a similar shape , and consequently , their points are much further apart : within their bases , the lateral muscles of the mandibles are , as usual , attached ; they are represented in fig .
3 , as seen from the inside , with the eye on a level with the concave summit of the labrum .
the rudimentary condition of the palpi is connected , as remarked under the anelasma <unk> , with the absence of efficient cirri .
the mandibles ( fig .
7 ) are well developed ; they so closely resemble those of the female that it is superfluous to describe them : they are , however , smoother , without any trace of the teeth being pectinated , and with the inferior point smaller : measured in their longer direction , they are <unk> of an inch in length , and , therefore , a little less than one third of the size of those of the female .
these organs have the usual muscles well developed , and the usual articulations .
the maxillæ ( fig .
8 ) have a rather rudimentary appearance ; yet they have the same size relatively to the mandibles , as in the female , the spinose edge being <unk> of an inch in length .
these organs resemble , to a certain extent , those of the female , differing from them in being less prominent ,  in the outline being more rounded , with the notches even less distinct ,  and in the spines being fewer .
the <unk> is short and broad .
the outer maxillæ ( fig .
6 ) are pointed , with a small tuft of bristles at the apex ; they are much less hairy than in the female , but have nearly the same unusual shape .
outside their bases , and between them and the inner maxillæ , the two well-developed , tubular , flattened , <unk> , olfactory orifices , project in exactly the same remarkable position as in the female ; these are not represented in fig .
2 , though sometimes they can be very distinctly seen , when the mouth is viewed from vertically above .
thorax and cirri.  the thorax is in a rudimentary condition : i did not observe the usual articulations .
the whole , as seen from vertically above , is of small size , compared with the mouth ; the outline is accurately shown by dotted lines in tab .
5 , fig .
2 , together with the positions of the two pair of cirri , the caudal appendages , and anus .
the posterior end of the thorax does not rise to the level of the summit of the mouth ; and the thorax seems of no service , excepting perhaps as a sort of outer lip to protect the mouth .
the cirri are in an extreme state of abortion , and evidently functionless ; they are lined with purplish corium , without the vestige of a muscle ; they are usually distorted and bent in different directions ; they vary in size , and even those on opposite sides of the same individual , sometimes do not correspond , and do not arise from exactly corresponding points of the thorax .
there are always two pair of cirri , which , as i conclude from the position of the <unk> orifices , answer to the fifth and sixth pair in other cirripedes .
each cirrus ( fig .
4 ) usually carries only one ramus , placed on a large basal segment , evidently corresponding to the pedicel of a normal cirrus .
the posterior are larger than the anterior cirri , which latter spring from points a little lower down on the thorax .
in the posterior cirrus figured , the great basal articulation or pedicel , almost equals in length , and much exceeds in thickness , the four segments of the ramus ; these segments are furnished on their upper dorsal edges with little brushes of spines , but have not even a trace of the normally larger and far more important anterior spines .
in one specimen , the anterior cirrus had a large pedicel , carrying three segments , like those of the posterior pair ; but in another specimen , one of the three segments showed traces of being divided into two , thus making four imperfect segments ; whilst on the corresponding side of this same individual there were only two <unk> segments , with their few spines differently arranged .
again , in a third specimen , the great basal segment of the anterior cirrus on one side , bore , exteriorly to the usual ramus , a single segment furnished with bristles , and evidently representing a second ramus ; thus showing that the great basal segment certainly answers to a pedicel .
i may here add , that on the integuments of these cirri , i observed with a high power , the serrated <unk> appearance common in other cirripedes .
directly between the bases of the sixth cirrus , there is a very minute <unk> , which , under the highest power , can be seen to consist of two closely approximate , flattened points ; these , i have no doubt , are the caudal appendages in an extremely rudimentary condition , for i traced the vesiculæ seminales to this exact spot : close outside these rudimentary points , on a slight swelling , is the anus .
it <name> presently be seen that in the male of the closely allied ibla quadrivalvis , the nature of these caudal appendages admits of no doubt , for in this species they consist of more than one segment , are spinose , and close under them towards the mouth , there is a perfectly distinct <unk> , representing the usual probosciformed penis .
alimentary <unk>  the oesophagus is very narrow , and of remarkable length ; from the orifice under the mandibles , it first runs back ( in this respect not well represented in pl .
v , fig .
1 , ) under the bullate labrum , and then straight down the peduncle , where it terminates in the usual <unk> expansion , entering one side of the small globular stomach ; the latter , at its lower end , is slightly constricted , and then is rather abruptly upturned .
the <unk> is of unparalleled length , and extremely narrow ; it can be best detected after the dissolution by caustic potash of the softer parts , when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous , in the ordinary manner , with the outer integuments of the thorax .
the anus , as already stated , is seated on a slight swelling , and consists of a small longitudinal slit ( f , fig .
2 ) , placed close outside the two very minute caudal appendages .
organ of <unk>  in all the specimens , a little below the fold separating the mouth from the peduncle , and near the abdominal ( or rostral ) edge , a black ball ( c , fig .
1 ) , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , is conspicuous .
when dissected out , it is somewhat conical in form , and appears to consist of an outer coat , with a layer of <unk> of a dark purple colour , surrounding a transparent , rather hard lens , apparently leaving a circular orifice at the summit , and forming a short tube at the base , surrounding what i believe to be a nerve .
i was not able to perceive that this eye consisted of two eyes united , which the analogy of other cirripedes makes me suppose probable , although in the ordinary and hermaphrodite ibla quadrivalvis , the eye also appeared single .
it is seated under the two transparent muscular layers , close upon the upper end of the stomach , and this is the exact position , as stated in the introductory discussion ( p. 49 ) , in which the eyes of pedunculated cirripedes are commonly situated .
generative system.  within the muscular layer all round the upper part of the peduncle , and surrounding the stomach , there are numerous , little , rather irregular globular balls , with brown granular centres , so closely resembling the testes in other cirripedes , though of smaller size , that i can not doubt that this is their nature : they were much plainer , larger , and more numerous in some specimens than in others .
the vesiculæ seminales can seldom be made distinctly out ; but having cut one specimen transversely across the thorax , they were as plain as could be desired , lying parallel and close to each other above the <unk> , ( the animal being in the position as drawn , ) and therefore in their normal situation .
each had a diameter four times as great as that of the <unk> .
in this individual the contents seemed ( whether from decomposition or state of development , or from my not having used high enough power , i know not , ) merely pulpy ; but i have since found , in another specimen , masses of the most distinct spermatozoa , with the usual little knots on them , associated with numerous cells , about as large as and resembling those which i have examined in living cirripedes , and from which i have every reason to believe the spermatozoa are developed .
the vesiculæ seminales unite and terminate under the two extremely minute caudal appendages , and here i think i saw an orifice ; but there is certainly no projecting , probosciformed penis .
having dissected the six specimens with the utmost care , and having scrupulously examined the ovaria in other cirripedes during their early stages of development , even before the exuviation of the larval locomotive organs , and in specimens of smaller size than the male ibla , i am prepared to assert that there are no ovaria , and that these little creatures are exclusively males .
it should be borne in mind , that in some of the specimens there were perfect spermatozoa in the vesiculæ seminales ( as likewise in some of the males of i .
quadrivalvis ) , and , therefore , if these individuals had been hermaphrodites , their ova would have been , at this period , well developed , and ready for impregnation : in this state it is almost impossible that they could have been overlooked .
moreover , it is probable that such ova would not have been very small , for the larvæ whence the parasitic males are derived , attain ( as might have been inferred from the known dimensions of their prehensile antennæ , and as we shall show actually is the case in i .
quadrivalvis , ) the size common amongst ordinary cirripedia .
concluding remarks.  that these animals are true cirripedes , though having so different an external appearance from others of the class , admits of not the least doubt .
the prehensile antennæ , enveloped in cement and including the two cement-ducts , would have been amply sufficient , without other parts  for instance , the mouth , by itself perfectly characteristic with each organ , together with the whole alimentary canal , constructed on the normal plan ,  to have proved that they were cirripedia .
under the head of the closely-allied ibla quadrivalvis , we shall , moreover , see that the males are developed from larvæ , having every point of structure  the peculiar <unk> shell , the two compound eyes , the six natatory legs , & c. ,  characteristic of the order .
but in some respects , the males are in an embryonic condition , though unquestionably mature , as shown by the spermatozoa ;  thus , in the thorax and mouth opening throughout their whole width into the cavity of the peduncle , that is , <unk> into the anterior part of the head , and in the viscera being there lodged instead of in the thorax and prosoma , there is a manifest resemblance to the larva in its last stage of development : the absence of a probosciformed penis , the <unk> peduncle , the food being obtained without the aid of cirri , and the length of the <unk> , are likewise embryonic characters .
not only are these males , as just remarked , cirripedia ; but they manifestly belong to the pedunculated family .
if a specimen had been brought to me to class , without relation to its sexual characters , i should have placed it , without any hesitation , next to the genus ibla ; if the mouth alone had been brought , i should assuredly have placed it actually in the genus ibla : for let it be observed how nearly all the parts resemble those of ibla cumingii , excepting only in size and in being less hairy .
the trophi are arranged in the same peculiar position as in the female ; the labrum is largely bullate , without teeth on the crest ; the palpi , though relatively smaller , are of the same shape ; so are the mandibles ; the maxillæ are more rounded and less prominent , but have the same exact size relatively to the mandibles ; the outer maxillæ have the same , quite peculiar pointed outline , and the olfactory orifices are tubular , and hold the same unusual position .
it is most rare to find so close a resemblance in the parts of the mouth , except in very closely allied genera , and often species of the same natural genus differ more .
again , in the long oesophagus and constricted stomach there is a resemblance to ibla .
in the male of ibla quadrivalvis , the caudal appendages are <unk> ; now , this is a character confined to four genera , namely , ibla , alepas , pollicipes , and lithotrya .
i may add , that large tubular olfactory orifices are confined to the same genera , together with scalpellum .
lastly , it particularly deserves notice , that the prehensile antennæ , in having a hoof-like and pointed disc , with a single spine on the heel , much more closely resemble these organs in scalpellum , certainly the nearest ally of ibla , than in any other genus ; they differ from the antennæ in scalpellum , only in the ultimate segment not having a notch on one side .
these organs , unfortunately for the sake of comparison , were not found in the female and ordinary form of ibla .
the full importance of the above generic resemblance in the antennæ , <name> hereafter be more clearly seen , when their classificatory value is shown in the final discussion on the sexual relations of ibla and scalpellum .
here , then , we have a pedunculated cirripede very much nearer in all its essential characters to ibla than to any other genus , and exclusively of the male sex ; and this cirripede in six specimens , from two distant localities , adhered to an ibla exclusively of the female sex .
may we not , then , safely conclude that these parasites are the males of the ibla cumingii ?
considering that , in the same class with the cirripedia , there is a whole family of crustaceans , the <unk> , in which the males , compared with the females to which they cling , differ as much in appearance as in ibla , and are even relatively smaller , i should not have added another remark , had there not been under the head of the following species , and of the next genus scalpellum , a class of allied facts to be advanced , which in some respects support the view here taken , but in others are so remarkable and so hard to be believed , that i <name> call attention to the alternative , if the above view be rejected .
the ordinary ibla cumingii must have a male , for that it is not an hermaphrodite can hardly be questioned , seeing how easy it always is to detect the male organs of generation ; and we must consequently believe in the visits of a locomotive male , though the existence of a locomotive cirripede is improbable in the highest degree .
again , as the little animal , considered by me to be the male of i .
cumingii , is exclusively a male , ( for there were no traces of ova or ovaria , though the spermatozoa were perfect , ) we must believe in a locomotive cirripede of the opposite sex , though the existence in any class of a female visiting a fixed male is unknown : [ 48 ] in short , we should have <unk> to make two locomotive cirripedes , which , in all probability , would differ as much from their fixed opposite sexes , as does the cirripede , considered by me to be the male of i .
cumingii , from the ordinary form .
this being the case , i conclude that the evidence is amply sufficient to prove that the little parasitic cirripede here described , is the male of ibla cumingii .
[ 48 ] it deserves notice , that in the class crustacea , both in the <unk> and in the cirripedia , the males more closely resemble the larvæ , than do the females ; whereas amongst insects , as in the case of the <unk> in coleoptera , and of certain nocturnal lepidoptera , it is the female which retains an embryonic character , being <unk> or <unk> , without wings .
but in all these cases , the male is more locomotive than the female .
if we look for analogies to the facts here given , we shall find them in the <unk> already alluded to , but in these the males are not permanently attached to the females , only cling , i believe , to them voluntarily .
the extraordinary case of the <unk> , originally described as a worm parasitic on certain <unk> , but now shown by <unk> to be the male of the species to which it is attached , is perhaps more strictly parallel .
so again in the <unk> worm , the <unk> <unk> the sexes cohere , but are essentially distinct : " this singular species , however , " according to professor <name> , [ 49 ] " offers the transitional grade to that still more extraordinary <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , in which the male is <unk> blended by its caudal extremity with the female , immediately anterior to the <unk> aperture of the <unk> .
by this union a kind of hermaphroditism is produced ; but the male apparatus is furnished with its own peculiar <unk> system ; and an individual animal is constituted distinct in every respect , save in its terminal <unk> with the body of the female .
this condition of animal life , which was conceived by <name> as within the circle of physiological possibilities , has hitherto been exemplified only in the single species of <unk> , the discovery of the true nature of which , is due to the sagacity and patient research of dr. c. th .
<name> <unk> . "
in ibla , the males and females are not <unk> united , but only permanently and <unk> attached to each other .
we have in this genus the additional <unk> of occasionally two males parasitic on one female .
[ 49 ] <unk> of anatomy and physiology , p. 142 .
i have used the term parasitic , which perhaps ought strictly to be confined to cases where one creature derives its nutriment from another , inasmuch as the male is invariably and permanently attached to and imbedded in the female ,  from its being protected by her capitulum , so that its own capitulum is not developed  and from its feeding on minute animals <unk> her sack .
the male ibla must seize its prey , guided probably by its well-developed olfactory organs , through the movement of its long , flexible body , furnished with muscles , and with the mouth seated on the summit .
we have already seen one instance of a cirripede , the anelasma , obtaining its food without the aid of cirri , by means of its probosciformed , flexible mouth .
the eye can serve only to announce to the male when the female opens her valves , allowing occasionally some minute prey to enter .
in ordinary cirripedes the penis is long , articulated , and capable of varied movements , i presume for the purpose of <unk> each separate <unk> : the male ibla has no such organ ; and no doubt the whole body , furnished like the penis with longitudinal and transverse muscles , serves the same purpose !
i may remark , that it seems surprising that so small a male should secrete sufficient <unk> to <unk> the ova of the female , but the ova are not nearly so numerous in ibla as in most genera of cirripedes ; and the smallness of the males in some parasitic crustacea has already been alluded to .
the male must always be younger than the female , for the latter must first grow large enough for the larva of the male to crawl into her sack .
whether the male lives as long as the female i know not , but he certainly lives for a considerable period and increases in size , as shown by the depth to which the end of the peduncle is imbedded .
moreover we shall see , under the next species , that the male is metamorphosed from a larva , not one sixth of its own size .
in the male ibla , abortion has been carried to an extraordinary and , i should think , almost unparalleled extent .
of the twenty-one segments believed to be normally present in every crustacean , or of the seventeen known to be present in cirripedes , the three anterior segments are here well developed , forming the peduncle : the mouth consists as usual of three small segments : the succeeding eight segments are represented by the rudimentary and functionless thorax , supporting only two pair of distorted , rudimentary and functionless cirri : the seven segments of the abdomen have disappeared , with the exception of the excessively minute caudal appendages ; so that , of the twenty-one normal segments , fifteen are more or less aborted .
the state of the cirri is curious , and may be compared to that of the anthers in a <unk> flower ; for they are not simply rudimentary in size and function , but they are monstrous , and generally do not even correspond on opposite sides of the same individual .
as males in other classes of the animal kingdom often retain some female characters , so here ( though the case is not strictly analogous [ 50 ] ) the male possesses the <unk> apparatus , which <unk> is part of an ovarian tube modified .
[ 50 ] certain plants offer a closer , though not perfect , analogy .
thus , in the florets of some <unk> flowers , the pistil , besides its proper female functional end , serves to brush the pollen off the anthers ; while , in the florets of some other <unk> ( see the account of <unk> in <unk> .
k. sprengel das <unk> <unk> der natur ' ) , the pistil is functionless for its proper end , the flower being exclusively male , but its style is developed , and still serves as a brush .
so in the male ibla , part of the ovaria , in a modified condition , is still present , and serves as a <unk> apparatus .
the individuals in every other genus ( with the exception of scalpellum ) , in the several families , in the three orders of cirripedia , are hermaphrodite or <unk> .
why , then , is ibla unisexual ; yet , becoming , in the most paradoxical manner , from its earliest youth , essentially <unk> ?
would food have been deficient , and was the seizure of infusoria by another and differently constructed individual , necessary for the support of the male and female organs ?
the orifice of the sack of the female is unusually narrow ; would the presence of testes and vesiculæ seminales have rendered her thorax and prosoma <unk> thick ?
seeing the analogous facts in the six , <unk> species of the allied genus scalpellum , i infer there must be some <unk> and more mysterious final cause .

hermaphrodite .
all the external parts so closely resemble those of i .
cumingii , that it would be superfluous to describe more than the few points of difference .
the horny substance of both scuta and terga is uniformly yellow ; though in <unk> specimens , from the underlying corium being seen through the valves , these generally have a tinge of blue .
the scuta , viewed internally , are less elongated transversely ; they have their basal margins slightly more hollowed out , and the fold on the upper free and <unk> portion rather deeper .
the terga , viewed internally , have the apex of the growing or <unk> surface higher relatively to the scuta than in i .
cumingii ; and the basal <name> is much broader , owing to the lower carinal margin being much more protuberant than the scutal margin .
the spines on the peduncle are all yellowish-brown , and are rather longer than in i .
cumingii .
i observed in three or four specimens , that the lowest part of the peduncle had become internally filled up with the usual , brown , transparent , laminated cement , cone within cone , so that this lower part was rendered rigid and <unk> ; this latter effect , i apprehend , is the object gained by the formation of cement within the peduncle , of which i have not observed any other instance .
the entire length of the largest specimen was one inch ; some other specimens were only half this size .
the thorax and prosoma are of the same shape as in i .
cumingii , and in the largest specimen , about one tenth of an inch square ; the prosoma , as in that species , is hairy .
in the mouth , all the parts are closely similar to those of i .
cumingii , but one third larger ; the crest of the labrum is a little roughened with minute points : the palpi are <unk> and <unk> at their extremities : the mandibles have their second and third teeth nearly equal in size to the first , and they do not appear pectinated : the maxillæ have their spinose edge very nearly straight : the outer maxillæ are pointed .
the olfactory orifices are similarly situated , and of similar shape ; they are dark coloured .
cirri.  these also are similar to those of i .
cumingii ; the segments , however , of the three posterior cirri have each four pair of spines , placed very close together in a transverse direction .
first cirrus has its two rami unequal in length by about six segments .
the anterior rami of the second and third cirri are thicker , and more thickly clothed with spines , than the posterior rami , to perhaps a greater degree than in i .
cumingii .
in the posterior cirri , the upper segments of the pedicels are nearly as long as the lower segments .
caudal appendages , four times as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , and three fourths of the length of the rami of this same cirrus : segments thirty-two in number , and therefore as many as those forming the sixth cirrus : the upper segments are much thinner and longer than the basal segments ; each furnished with a circle of short bristles ; whole appendage excessively thin and tapering : the two closely approximate .
<unk>  from some <unk> <unk> specimens in mr. <unk> possession , it appears that the sack , cirri and trophi , were dark blue , as in i .
cumingii ; after being long kept in spirits , these parts become brown .
generative system.  the penis ( pl .
iv , fig .
9 a ) is very singular in structure ; it is of the ordinary length , but of small diameter ; it tapers but little ; it consists of a <unk> articulated , and a fixed <unk> portion ; this latter is smooth , much flattened , not divided into segments , and projects straight out under the caudal appendages ; it is about one third of the length of the entire penis ; it corresponds with a part present in all cirripedes , but here surprisingly elongated .
the articulated portion consists of separate segments , twenty in number , quite as distinct as those of the cirri ; each one is oblong , being longer by about a third part than broad ; each has a few short bristles round its upper margin ; the terminal segment has a circular brush of bristles .
the vesiculæ seminales are easily seen , though they are narrow ; they are slightly tortuous ; they enter the prosoma , and lie on each side of the stomach ; their outer case has a ringed structure , but is not fibrous ; the contents in the best specimen consisted of a mass of spermatozoa , which i saw with perfect distinctness .
the testes are unusually large and <unk> .
ova , spherical , <unk> of an inch in diameter , united as usual into two ovigerous lamellæ .
the ovigerous fræna are extraordinarily small , and might be very easily overlooked ; their length , in a full-sized specimen , was only <unk> of an inch , and they projected only <unk> from the inner surface of the sack .
the glands on their margin , to which the lamellæ adhere , are pointed oval , with an extremely short footstalk , and that rather thick ; the entire length of gland and footstalk , being only <unk> of an inch .
the larvæ , in their first stage of development , offer the usual characters , and closely resemble those of scalpellum ; the probosciformed mouth , however , is remarkably prominent , and the limbs unusually thick .
affinities.  this species most closely resembles i .
cumingii , and can not be distinguished externally , except by the absence of the blue colour on the marginal and interior portions of the valves ; and this can hardly be ascertained without separating and cleaning them , owing to the <unk> of the underlying corium .
internally some slight differences may be perceived in the form of the valves .
considering these so slight differences , it is highly remarkable that this species should be hermaphrodite , whilst i .
cumingii is unisexual .
there is a greater , though still slight , difference in the included animal 's body ; the palpi in i .
quadrivalvis are <unk> , the mandibles smoother , the olfactory orifices <unk> ; the rami of the first cirrus more unequal , the spines more numerous on the segments of the posterior cirri , and lastly and most conspicuously , the caudal appendages are very much longer relatively to the length of the sixth cirrus , than in ibla cumingii .
complemental male .
i have examined one specimen of the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , preserved in spirits from kangaroo island , and one dry from <name> , both places in south australia , and four from an unknown locality , purchased from mr. sowerby ; and within five out of these six specimens , males were attached .
in one of them , two males of different ages were included , one adhering to the peduncle of the other : in i .
cumingii , also , it may be remembered , there was a case of two males parasitic on one female .
i may add that i opened another quite young specimen , from <name> , not counted with the above , and it was without a male .
the males in the five specimens were attached low down , at the rostral end , almost in a horizontal position , stretching across the bottom of the sack ; one of them , however , was placed considerably on one side .
one individual which i measured , was <unk> of an inch in length , and <unk> in width in the widest part , namely , about half down the peduncle .
i may state , for the sake of comparison , that the hermaphrodite to which this individual was attached , was , including the peduncle and capitulum , one inch in length , that is , six times as long as the male , and one fifth of an inch in width , that is , four times as wide .
the above measurements show that the male of this species is rather more than twice as large as that of i .
cumingii .
in consequence of this greater size , i dissected , with the utmost care , the one specimen which was excellently preserved in spirits , and found every part , with a few exceptions , so exactly the same as in the male of i .
cumingii , only larger and more conspicuous , that it <name> be sufficient to indicate the few points of difference .
the most conspicuous difference is , that the oblique fold separating the thorax and peduncle is more plainly developed , projecting at the point corresponding to h in fig .
1 , pl .
v , <unk> of an inch ; in the middle the fold is notched ; it can be traced more easily than in i .
cumingii , running beneath and parallel to the basal edge of the mouth , to the ventral margin of the body .
in the mouth there is hardly any difference ; the maxillæ , however , have two notches even plainer than in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , or than in the male i .
cumingii , but the depth of such notches is always a variable character ; there are also more spines on the edge in the male of the present species , than in i .
cumingii .
both mandibles and maxillæ in the male i .
quadrivalvis , are larger than in the male i .
cumingii , to a greater degree than the larger proportional size of the body in the former <name> account for ; and this , likewise , is the case with these same organs in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis compared with the female i .
cumingii .
the tubular olfactory orifices are situated in the same peculiar position as in the hermaphrodite , and as in both sexes of i .
cumingii : they are <unk> of an inch in diameter , and about as thick as one of the lower segments in the rami of the sixth cirrus .
the thorax , as in the male of i .
cumingii , is quite rudimentary , and serves as a mere flap to protect the mouth .
in the three specimens carefully examined , the posterior cirri had each only one ramus , whilst the anterior cirri generally had two : in one specimen , one of the rami in the anterior cirrus was formed of five segments , and the other ramus of three segments , both rami being supported on a <unk> pedicel ; but on the opposite side of the same individual , the anterior cirrus was represented by a mere knob .
the longer ramus of the anterior cirrus , in the <unk> individual , barely exceeded in length the mandibles measured along the line of the teeth !
in one specimen between the bases of the posterior cirri , there were two perfectly distinct caudal appendages ; these , like the cirri , are in a quite rudimentary condition ; one was <unk> of an inch in length , and consisted of three segments , the upper edges of which had short spines ; the other was shorter , <unk> , but spinose .
in a second specimen , these appendages were quite aborted .
close under them , on the inside or towards the mouth , ( that is , in the normal position , ) there was a rudimentary but quite distinct penis , with the apex projecting freely , and with the sides distinguishable from the ventral surface of the thorax , for the length of <unk> of an inch : the corium lining this little penis made the terminal orifice plainly visible .
the vesiculæ seminales lie in the usual position , and are conspicuous ; they are slightly tortuous , with their ends blunt : in the specimen so well preserved in spirits , they were filled with a mass of spermatozoa , perfectly distinct ; and the whole cavity of the body was lined with globular and pear-shaped testes .
assuredly there was no vestige of ovarian tubes .
from the greater size and excellent preservation of this specimen , which rendered the examination of the generative system so easy , i was able to examine the contents of the stomach , in which i found the delicate <unk> coat , separated as usual , and containing cellular matter , on which the animal had preyed , but the nature of which i was unable to make out .
the anus was much plainer than in the male of i .
cumingii .
i saw the eye distinctly .
i could not distinguish the orifices of the acoustic ( ? )
sacks ; and i think i should have seen them , if they had existed .
prehensile <unk>  i examined these in the larvæ presently to be mentioned , and therefore they were in better condition than in the mature animal when cemented .
their total length , measured along the outside , from the basal articulation to the end of the disc , is <unk> or <unk> of an inch  that is , one third longer than in i .
cumingii ; whilst the hoof-like disc itself is <unk> , or only <unk> of an inch longer than this same part in i .
cumingii : the apex of the disc is downy , or bears some excessively minute spines .
the ultimate segment has its end irregularly rounded , with the spines obscurely divided into two groups , the outer group consisting of two or three longer and thinner spines , and the inner group of , as i believe , five rather shorter spines : the longer spines equal in length the whole ultimate segment .
i could not perceive that they were plumose , as in many other genera .
a single , rather thicker and long spine , pointing backwards , is attached to the under side of the disc , nearly opposite to the point where the ultimate segment is articulated on the upper convex surface .
another single , curved spine is attached on the outer side of the basal segment , near its distal end .
development of the <unk>  in the specimen before alluded to , which included two males , one of these was only the <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore between one fifth and one sixth of the size of the mature male .
it had , probably , undergone only one exuviation since its metamorphosis , for the larva is nearly as long , namely , <unk> of an inch .
in this young male , the mouth formed one third of the entire length : it was attached , not as in every other case to the sack of the hermaphrodite , but low down to the peduncle of the other male .
in the sack with these two males , there were certainly four , i believe five , larvæ , which in every main point of structure resembled the larvæ of other pedunculated cirripedes .
from the peculiar form of their prehensile antennæ , differing in no respect , except in the proportional lengths of the segments , from the same organ in the male i .
cumingii , i can feel no doubt that these were the larvæ of the male i .
quadrivalvis ;  for a moment 's reflection <name> show how excessively improbable it is , that several larvæ of some other cirripede , and that a cirripede intimately allied to the parasitic male ibla , should have forced themselves , without any apparent object , into the sack of the hermaphrodite ibla .
the larvæ , though not yet attached , were on the point of attachment , so that the single eye of the mature animal could be distinctly seen , lying near to the two great compound eyes of the larva .
we have also just seen , that one male quite recently here had undergone its metamorphosis .
the larvæ are <unk> of an inch in length , and rather more than <unk> in width in the widest part : they are <unk> , the dorsal edge forming the keel of the boat ; the anterior end is only a little <unk> than the posterior end ; the <unk> carapace is smooth .
all the essential points of structure in the larvæ of other cirripedes at this stage , could be distinctly here seen ,  such as the two compound eyes , with the <unk> to which they are attached , and the two oblong sternal plates whence the <unk> spring ,  the adductor muscle ,  the six natatory legs , with long plumose spines ,  the abdomen , with its three small segments and the caudal appendages ,  the prehensile antennæ already described ,  and , lastly , the two little ( auditory ? )
sacks at the <unk> edges of the carapace , but not so near the anterior extremity as in lepas .
the four or five larvæ , after having undergone in the open sea the several preparatory metamorphoses common to the class , must have voluntarily entered the sack of the hermaphrodite : ultimately would they , on finding two males already attached there , have retired , and sought another individual less well provided ; or would they all have remained , and so formed a <unk> establishment , such as we shall presently see occurs sometimes in scalpellum ?
this must remain quite uncertain .
in this same hermaphrodite specimen of i .
quadrivalvis , the two ovigerous lamellæ contained some hundreds of larvæ in the first stage of development , which were liberated from their enveloping membranes by a touch of a needle : they were about the <unk> of an inch in length , and presented all the usual characters of larvæ at this period .
what a truly wonderful assemblage of beings of the same species , but how marvellously unlike in appearance , did this individual hermaphrodite present !
we have the numerous , almost globular larvæ , with lateral horns to their <unk> , with their three pair of legs , single eye , probosciformed mouth and long tail :  we have the somewhat larger larvæ in the last stage of development , much compressed , <unk> , with their two great compound eyes , curious prehensile antennæ , closed rudimentary mouth and six natatory legs so different from those in the first stage :  we have the two attached males , with their bodies reduced almost to a mouth placed on the summit of a peduncle , with a minute , apparently single eye shining through the integuments , without any carapace or capitulum , and with the thorax as well as the legs or cirri rudimentary and functionless :  lastly , we have the hermaphrodite , with all its complicated organisation , its thorax supporting six pairs of <unk> <unk> cirri , and its well-developed capitulum furnished with horny valves , surrounding this wonderful assemblage of beings .
unquestionably , without a rigid examination , these four forms would have been ranked in different families , if not orders , of the articulated kingdom .
concluding remarks.  if the creature which i have considered as the male of ibla cumingii be really so , and the evidence formerly given seems to me amply conclusive , then the animal just described , from its close affinity in every point of structure with the former , assuredly is the male of ibla quadrivalvis .
but feeling strongly how improbable it is , that an additional or complemental male should be associated with an hermaphrodite , i <name> make a few remarks on the only possible hypothesis , if my view be rejected ,  namely , that the two parasites considered by me to be exclusively males , are not so , but are independent hermaphrodite cirripedes , the female organs and ova ( which , if present , would have been nearly mature , judging from the presence of spermatozoa in both species ) having been overlooked by me in every specimen : and again , that in the animal described as the female i .
cumingii , i have , though minutely <unk> several specimens , and finding far smaller parts , such as the organs of sense and nervous system , entirely overlooked all the conspicuous male organs , though when i came to i .
quadrivalvis , and naturally expected to find it likewise exclusively female , a single glance showed me the great probosciformed penis , and by the simplest dissection the vesiculæ seminales and testes were exhibited .
such an oversight is scarcely credible ; but even if assumed , we have to believe in the extraordinary circumstance of the two parasites being species of an independent genus , not only the very next in alliance to the animals to which they are attached , but in certain most important points , namely , the organs of the mouth , actually deserving a place in the very same genus .
moreover , the two parasites differ from each other , not only in about the same slight degree , but in a corresponding manner , as do the two <unk> to which they are attached ; thus the mouths of ibla quadrivalvis and i .
cumingii are closely similar , ( the difference being barely of specific value , ) so are the mouths of the two parasites ; but the parts are larger in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis , than in i .
cumingii , so are they in the parasites .
again , the most conspicuous character in i .
quadrivalvis , is the number of segments in the caudal appendages , far exceeding those in the other species of ibla , as well as of every other pedunculated cirripede , and the parasite of this species has articulated spinose appendages , far larger than the barely visible , <unk> pair in i .
cumingii .
considering the whole case , there seems no room to doubt the <unk> of the conclusion arrived at , under the former as well as under the present species , namely , that these little parasites are the males of the two species of ibla to which they are attached ;  wonderful though the fact be , that in one case , the male should pair with an hermaphrodite already provided with efficient male organs .
it is to bring this fact <unk> forward , that i have called such males , complemental males ; as they seem to form the complement to the male organs in the hermaphrodite .
we look in vain for any , as yet known , analogous facts in the animal kingdom .
in the genus scalpellum , however , next in alliance to ibla , in which , consequently , if anywhere , we might expect to find such facts , they occur ; and until these are fully considered , i <name> the conclusions here arrived at , <name> not be summarily rejected .
although the existence of hermaphrodites and males within the limits of the same species , is a new fact amongst animals , it is far from rare in the vegetable kingdom : the male flowers , moreover , are sometimes in a rudimentary condition compared to the hermaphrodite flowers , exactly in the same manner as are the male <unk> .
if the final cause of the existence of these complemental males be asked , no certain answer can be given ; the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite of ibla quadrivalvis , appeared to be of small diameter ; but on the other hand , the ova to be impregnated are fewer than in most cirripedes .
no explanation , as we have seen , can be given of the much simpler case of the mere separation of the sexes in ibla cumingii : nor can any explanation , i believe , be given of the much more varied arrangement of the parts of <unk> in plants of the linnean class , <unk> .

and <unk> . )
valves 12 to 15 in number : latera of the lower whorl , four or six , with their lines of growth generally directed towards each other : sub-rostrum very rarely present : peduncle <unk> , most rarely naked .
filamentary appendages , none : labrum , with the upper part highly bullate : trophi , various : olfactory orifices , more or less prominent : caudal appendages , <unk> and spinose , or none .
males , parasitic at or near the orifice of the sack of the female or of the hermaphrodite : thorax enclosed within a capitulum , furnished with three or four rudimentary valves , or with six perfect valves : peduncle either short and distinct , or confounded with the capitulum : sometimes mouth and stomach absent , and cirri <unk> ; sometimes mouth and cirri normal .
generally attached to horny corallines , in the warmer temperate seas over the whole world .
i have felt much doubt in limiting this genus : the six recent species which it contains , differ more from each other than do the species in the previous genera .
mr. gray has proposed or adopted generic names for four of the species , and a fifth certainly has equal claims to this same rank .
these genera have been founded almost exclusively on the number of the valves ; and oddly enough , the <name> have generally been given wrongly , namely , in scalpellum , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
scalpellum blends through s .
villosum into pollicipes ; and this latter genus has an equal right with scalpellum , to be divided into sub-genera , three in number .
hence , no less than eight genera might be made out of the twelve recent species of scalpellum and pollicipes , and their formation , in some degree , be justified ; but , in my opinion , this inordinate multiplication of genera destroys the main advantages of classification .
at one time , i even thought that it would be best to follow lamarck , and keep the twelve recent species in one genus ; but considering the number of fossil species , i believe the more prudent course has been followed , in retaining the two genera scalpellum and pollicipes ; more especially as i can hardly doubt , that several other species <name> be hereafter discovered .
having so lately described in the memoirs of the <unk> society , the fossil species , i <name> not here further allude to them , than to state , that out of the fifteen species therein described , s .
<unk> comes very close to the recent s .
vulgare , and that several eocene and cretaceous species , such as s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , and s .
maximum , are allied to s .
rutilum and s .
ornatum .
scalpellum villosum , a recent species , has stronger claims than any other species to be <unk> separated ; and its habits , in not being attached to horny corallines , are also different , but the identity of its complemental male with that of s .
peronii , and its numerous points of resemblance in structure with the other species , have determined me not to separate it .
scalpellum peronii , villosum , and rostratum , in having a sub-carina ,  in the rostrum being pretty well developed ,  and in the complemental male being pedunculated , and furnished with a functional mouth and prehensile cirri , may be separated from s .
vulgare , ornatum and rutilum ; but even between these two little groups , s .
rostratum is in some respects intermediate , namely , in having three pairs of latera , and more especially in the rudimentary condition of the valves of its complemental male , and in the position in which the male is attached to the hermaphrodite .
the three species in the second little group , namely , s .
vulgare , s .
ornatum , and s .
rutilum , are more nearly allied to each other in all their characters , especially in the characters drawn from their males , than are the other three species .
s .
ornatum and s .
rutilum are considerably nearer to each other than any other two of the species .
upon the whole i conclude that the six species must be thrown either into five or into four genera ( the first three species making one genus ) , or all into one genus , and this latter has appeared to me the preferable course .
the separation even of scalpellum and pollicipes , as already stated , is hardly natural .
the fact of these genera having existed from a remote epoch , and having given rise during successive periods to many species now extinct , is probably the cause that the few remaining species are so much more distinct from each other , than is common in the other genera of lepadidæ .
whenever the structure of the whole capitulum in the fossil species is well known , and as soon as more species , recent and fossil , shall have been discovered , then probably the genus scalpellum <name> have to be divided into several smaller genera .
<unk>  the capitulum is much compressed , and generally produced upwards ; it is formed of from twelve to fifteen valves , which are rather thin , and with the exception of s .
ornatum , almost entirely covered by membrane , bearing spines : the valves are seldom locked very closely together .
a sub-rostrum exists only in s .
villosum , which species leads on to pollicipes ; in s .
vulgare the rostrum is rudimentary and hidden .
the scuta , terga and <name> , are much larger than the other valves : these five valves seem to differ essentially from the others in being at first developed under the form of the so-called primordial valves : the other valves commence by a small indistinct brown spot , very different from the hexagonal tissue of the primordial valves : i saw this very clearly in young specimens of s .
vulgare .
at first , the scuta , terga and <name> , grow exclusively downwards ( and permanently so in most fossil species ) , and therefore the growth of the scuta and <name> is in an absolutely opposite direction to what it is in lepas , pæcilasma and dichelaspis .
after a short period the scuta are added to at their upper ends ; the portion thus added , stands at a rather lower level , and projects in a rather different direction from the <unk> part of the valve , giving to it , in some respects , the appearance of having been broken and mended .
this structure is common to s .
vulgare , s .
rostratum and s .
peronii .
the upper latera ( except in s .
villosum ) grow in the same manner , namely , at first exclusively downwards , and then both upwards and downwards .
the rostral and carinal latera ( with the same exception of s .
villosum ) have their umbones seated laterally , at opposite ends of the capitulum ,  the umbones of the rostral latera being close to the rostrum , and those of the carinal pair close to the <name> , and consequently their chief growth is directed towards each other .
the <name> in all the species , except s .
villosum , is either bowed or <unk> bent ; in the latter case the lower half is parallel to the peduncle , and the upper half , extending far up between the terga , is parallel to their longer axes .
in some of the species the <name> is added to almost equally at both ends ; in s .
ornatum it grows but little at the upper end , and to a varying degree in different individuals according to their age ; in s .
rutilum the umbo is at the apex , and there is consequently no upward growth ; lastly , in s .
villosum the <name> widening much from the apex to the basal margin , grows exclusively downwards , and a portion of the apex projects freely ,  characters all common to the <name> in the genus pollicipes .
the upper latera occur in all the species ; in the lower whorl there are either two or three pair of latera , in the former case the infra-median pair being absent .
the latera differ considerably in shape in the different species .
the peduncle is generally rather short , and , with the exception of s .
peronii , is covered with calcified scales .
these scales are generally small , and placed symmetrically in close whorls , in an <unk> order , with each scale corresponding to the interspace between two scales in the whorls above and below .
in s .
ornatum , the scales are so wide , transversely , that there are only four in each whorl .
in s .
villosum , the scales are <unk> and arranged somewhat irregularly in transverse rows , not very near to each other .
new calcareous scales originate only round the top of the peduncle , and they continue to grow only in the few upper whorls ; and as the peduncle itself continues to increase in diameter by the formation of new inner membranous layers and the disintegration of the old outer layers , the calcareous scales come in the lower part of the peduncle to stand further and further apart .
in the earliest stage of growth there are no calcareous scales on the peduncle in s .
vulgare ; they first appear under the <name> .
spines are articulated in great <name> on the surface of the peduncle in s .
vulgare , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , and very short ones on that of s .
rostratum .
<unk>  all the species , except s .
villosum , are attached to horny corallines : the singular means of attachment in s .
vulgare <name> be described under that species , and is probably common to several of the other species .
the larva in most , or in all cases , when it proceeds to attach itself , clings head downwards to the branch , and hence the capitulum comes to be placed upwards , with its orifice fronting the branch and the <name> outwards .
the sucking disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva , in the five species examined , was a little pointed , and in shape resembled the hinder hoof of a mule : this may perhaps be accounted for by the narrowness of the branches of the corallines , to which it has to adhere : a large circular disc , as in lepas , would have been worse than useless : the ultimate segment in most or all the species , has on its inner side ( the segment being supposed to be extended straight forward ) a notch or step , bearing , i believe , two spines .
size and <unk>  some of the species attain a medium size , others are small .
the valves are generally clouded red or pink , but sometimes white .
mouth.  the various parts vary far more than in any genus hitherto described .
the labrum is highly bullate , with the upper part forming a rounded overhanging projection , and with the lower part much produced , so that the mouth is placed far from the adductor scutorum muscle , and consequently the orifice is directed more towards the ventral surface of the thorax than in most other cirripedes : on the crest of the labrum there are some very small teeth in several of the species , but not in all .
the mandibles have either three or four main teeth , generally with either one or two small teeth intermediate between the first and second large teeth , and in the case of s .
peronii , with small teeth between all the larger ones .
the maxillæ have their edges furnished with many spines , and are either straight or have the inferior part prominent and step-formed .
the outer maxillæ have the spines on their inner edges either continuous or divided into two groups , of which latter structure we have not hitherto had any very well characterised example .
the olfactory orifices are either highly or moderately protuberant .
in most of the species the prosoma is little developed , and the first cirrus is placed far from the second .
the cirri are generally but little curled , and have elongated segments , with long , generally serrated spines : the first cirrus varies in proportional length ; the second and third cirri have both their rami more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri , the spines being generally arranged in three or four longitudinal rows : the cirri , however , of s .
villosum in all respects resemble closely the cirri of pollicipes sertus and p .
spinosus .
the caudal appendages are <unk> , small , and clothed with spines : in s .
villosum , however , differently from in all other allied forms , there are no appendages .
the stomach , in those species which i opened , is destitute of cæca .
there are no filamentary appendages .
generative system. the ova are nearly spherical , and remarkably large , as was stated to be the case in the introductory discussion , in which the larva of s .
vulgare , in the first stage of development , was described : the ovigerous fræna are small .
the testes are large , but the vesiculæ seminales in some of the species extraordinarily small .
scalpellum ornatum , and perhaps s .
rutilum , are unisexual ; the other species are hermaphrodite , but most or at least some of the individuals , are furnished with complemental males .
these latter are fully described under each species , so i <name> here only remark , that s .
ornatum , which alone ( excepting perhaps s .
rutilum ) is unisexual , has less claim than the other species to be <unk> separated : we have seen also , in ibla , that similar sexual differences occur in two most closely allied species .
it is very singular how much more some of the males and complemental males in scalpellum differ from each other , than do the female and hermaphrodite forms ; this seems due to the different stages of embryonic development at which the males have been arrested .
in the males , however , of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , compared one with another , but not with the males of the other species , the parts of the mouth and apparently the cirri , resemble each other more closely , than do the same organs in the hermaphrodites .
at the end of this genus i shall give a summary on the highly remarkable sexual relations both in scalpellum and ibla .
<unk>  the species seem distributed over the whole world , but as far as we can trust our present scanty materials , are most common in the warmer temperate regions .
the s .
vulgare ranges from the norwegian seas to naples .
most of the species are inhabitants of deep water .
affinities.  in the preliminary remarks , we have seen how this genus blends into pollicipes ; and under the head of <unk> , i have shown its close affinity to that genus .
if , indeed , we take pollicipes spinosus , and destroy all but six of the already minute and almost rudimentary latera , we shall , as far as the capitulum is concerned , convert it into a scalpellum , closely similar to s .
villosum .
if we take any species of scalpellum , ( excepting s .
villosum and s .
rutilum , ) and destroy all the valves , but the scuta , terga and <name> , we shall convert it into an <unk> .
lastly , i have shown under ibla , that in several most remarkable peculiarities of structure , there is a manifest affinity between scalpellum and that genus .
geological <unk>  full details on this subject have been given in the memoirs of the <unk> society .
i <name> here only state , that the oldest known form of scalpellum occurs in the lower green sand .

capitulum with 14 valves , including the rudimentary rostrum : upper latera irregularly oval .
mandibles , with four or five teeth : maxillæ , with the edge straight , bearing numerous spines .
complemental male <unk> , with four rudimentary valves ; no mouth ; cirri not prehensile ; attached to the occludent margin of the scutum , near the umbo .
great britain , ireland , <name> , norway , naples .
attached to horny corallines , at from twenty to thirty , sometimes even to fifty fathoms in depth , according to forbes and <unk> .
hermaphrodite .
<unk>  capitulum much flattened with the apex produced , of a pale brown colour , sometimes faintly tinted purple , composed of 14 valves , of which the rostrum is rudimentary and barely visible externally ; valves thin , white , translucent , smooth , slightly marked by the lines of growth , separated from each other by rather wide interspaces of colourless membrane , which is thickly clothed by small , articulated spines of unequal length .
the valves , excepting sometimes their umbones , are also covered with membrane , bearing spines , placed in rows parallel to the lines of growth ; the spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack .
scuta slightly convex , thrice as long as broad ; upper part much acuminated ; occludent margin almost straight ; basal margin nearly at right angles to the occludent margin ; the tergal margin is separated from the lateral margin by an <name> more or less prominent ; a slight curved ridge runs from the umbo to this <name> , and this deserves especial notice , inasmuch as it indicates the outline which the valve assumed in its earliest growth , and which is permanently retained in most of the older fossil species .
along the occludent margin , there is a trace of a ledge , developed in a variable degree , and which is noticed only on account of the plainly visible ledge along this same margin , in the allied genus <unk> .
the umbo , or centre of <unk> , is seated close to the occludent margin , and at about one fourth of the length of the valve from the apex .
internally , ( fig .
15 , a´ , pl .
v , ) the part above the umbo is flat ; and beneath this upper part , there is a large rounded hollow ( d ) for the adductor muscle : a fold or indentation ( a ) running downwards from the umbo , extends in a very oblique line across the occludent margin .
this fold is of high interest as giving <unk> to the complemental males , and <name> hereafter often be referred to .
terga , triangular , flat ; occludent margin , very slightly arched .
<name> much bent , with the umbo placed at barely one third of the entire length of the valve from the apex .
two very slight ridges can be perceived , one on each side , running from the umbo to the basal margin , and separating the roof from the <unk> of the valve ; these ridges are of great use in distinguishing the fossil carinæ of scalpellum , from the carinæ of pollicipes .
the part above the umbo is formed by the upward production of a marginal slip along each side of the valve , which slips in the fossil species ( c in the woodcut , fig .
1 , given in the introduction , ) i have designated as the <unk> .
the lower part of the valve gradually widens from the umbo downwards ; internally , the whole is deeply concave , and continuously curved .
the <name> varies at which the upper and lower portions externally meet each other ; but is never less than <unk> .
the upper part of the <name> runs up between the terga for three-quarters of their length ; the basal margin does not extend down low enough to pass between the carinal latera .
rostrum , ( fig .
15 b´ , seen externally , and highly magnified , ) minute , almost hidden by the enveloping membrane and by the small prominent umbones of the rostral latera ; in area equalling about one fourth of the rostral latera ; externally pyramidal , with the upper side rather longer than the lower ; internally slightly concave , square , with the upper margin and sometimes with the lower margin , slightly hollowed out .
umbo of growth nearly central .
upper latera , flat , irregularly oval , with an almost rectangular shoulder under the basal <name> of the terga ; in area , about one third larger than the largest valve of the lower whorl ; the exact degree of elongation of the oval figure varies a little .
umbo seated a little above the central point .
lower whorl ,  rostral latera , nearly twice as long as broad , lying under the basal margins of the scuta : umbo seated over the rostrum ; opposite end , towards which the valve widens either sensibly or but little , is either square or rounded ; in area , less than any of the other valves , excepting the rostrum ; in breadth , equalling either half or one third of the height of the infra-median latera ; growth , directed chiefly towards the infra-median latera .
the <unk> umbo is about one sixth part of the entire length of the valve .
infra-median latera , rather larger than the carinal latera ; their shape varies from elongated <unk> with the angles rounded , to oval , with the longer axis directed upwards .
the umbo is seated a little above the middle of the basal margin , so that there is some little growth downwards , but the main growth is upwards .
the upper point generally stands a little above that of the carinal latera .
carinal latera , flat , less in area than the infra-median latera ; basal margin nearly straight ; carinal margin slightly hollowed out , terminal margin arched and protuberant .
the umbones of the two valves almost touch each other under the middle of the <name> ; main growth towards the infra-median latera and upwards ; umbones projecting not above one fifth of the entire length of the valve .
peduncle , much flattened , rarely as long as the capitulum , with the upper end nearly as wide as it ; the lower end is either blunt , or tapers to a very fine point .
the calcareous scales are transversely elongated , and are about four times as wide as high ; their internal surfaces are slightly concave , and their external , convex ; the two ends are pointed .
viewed internally , the scales approach in shape to <unk> .
there are , in a <unk> specimen , about twenty scales in each whorl , their tips overlapping each other : the whorls are placed not very near each other and at rather unequal distances , except round the uppermost part , where , being in process of formation , they are packed closely together .
the membrane uniting the scales , supports numerous transverse rows of articulated spines , varying from <unk> to <unk> of an inch in length , and each furnished with a long sinuous <unk> , <unk> of an inch in diameter , running through the membrane to the underlying corium .
<unk>  specimens are attached to various horny corallines , and occasionally to the peduncles of each other .
[ 51 ] in both cases , supposing the coralline to be erect , the capitulum is placed upwards , with its orifice towards the branch to which it is attached , and consequently with its <name> outwards .
where several are crowded in a group , their peduncles often become twisted and their positions irregular , with their orifices facing in any direction .
this uniform position is simply the consequence of the larva attaching itself <unk> , and from the position of the prehensile antennæ , necessarily with its sternal surface parallel and close to the branch of the coralline ; hence the dorsal surface , which afterwards is converted into the <name> , faces outwards .
the peduncle , as already stated , often tapers , at its basal extremity , to a sharp point .
in very young specimens , for instance in one with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch in length , the method of attachment is the same as in lepas and many other genera , namely , by cement proceeding exclusively from the antennæ of the larva ; but in older and full-grown specimens , instead of the whole bottom of the peduncle becoming flattened and broadly attached , which would be here impossible , the cement is poured out through a straight row of orifices along the rostral edge , thus causing , by an excellent adaptation , a narrow margin to adhere firmly to the thin and cylindrical branches of the coralline .
these orifices are represented , magnified seven times , in pl .
ix , fig .
7 , in which the lower attached portion of the peduncle is split open and exhibited ; they are circular , and stand at regular intervals , in a straight line ; the higher orifices are larger , but further apart from each other than the lower ones ; in one full-grown specimen , i counted ten of these orifices in a length of exactly a quarter of an inch .
at each period of growth , the corium <unk> a little from the attached portion of the peduncle ; of which portion , the greater part is thus left empty and as incapable of further growth , as are the larval antennæ at the extreme point : in the specimen figured , the corium extended a little below the upper orifice .
the prehensile antennæ , however , i must remark , do not strictly rise from the extreme point of the peduncle , but at a little distance from it , on the rostral surface ; this simply ensues from the antennæ in the larva , being situated on the sternal surface , close to , but not actually on the front of the head .
the two cement glands are seated high up on the sides of the peduncle , and remote from each other ; they are small , unusually globular and transparent .
the two cement-ducts ( fig .
7 a a ) proceeding from them , are <unk> of an inch in diameter , and run in a <unk> line ; at the point where they pass through the corium to enter the lower attached portion of the peduncle , they become closely <unk> , and partially imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle .
together they run along the rostral edge , giving out through each orifice a little disc of brownish cement , and finally they enter the larval antennæ .
the peduncle , just above the attached portion , where still lined by corium , no doubt increases in diameter at each period of growth , and must , i presume , become pressed against the almost parallel branch of the coralline .
the corium , at this same period , shrinks , or is absorbed , and the two cement-ducts come in contact with , and adhere to , the inner surface of the outer membrane of the peduncle ; and then , by a process which i do not understand in this or any other cirripede , apertures are formed both in the ducts and through the membrane , so that the cement passes through , firmly fastening the outer surface of the peduncle with its calcareous scales and spines , to the coralline .
[ 51 ] mr. peach , ( transact .
brit .
<unk> , 1845 , p. 65 , ) states that this is sometimes the case in cornwall ; and i have seen a similar instance in a fine group from naples .
the structure of the larval prehensile antennæ <name> be most conveniently described when we come to the complemental male ; and figures ( <unk> , pl .

size and <unk>  montagu states ( <unk> .

the valves in all the specimens are white , and the membrane connecting them either nearly white , or dirty pale yellowish , or <unk> .
within the sack the corium under the valves is tinted pale purple , and two very faint bands of the same colour can generally be distinguished running down the two sides of the peduncle .
body , coloured <unk> , with the upper segments of the pedicels of the cirri , tinted in front with purple .
body , much flattened , the prosoma is very little developed ; the mouth placed far from the adductor muscle , and is directed in a remarkable manner towards the ventral surface of the thorax : the first pair of cirri stands far separated from the second pair .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , forming an overhanging projection equalling the longitudinal axis of the mouth ; basal margin much produced ; crest with a row of bead-like teeth .
palpi rather small , with their external margin straight , and internal margin oblique : the bristles on the two palpi just meet each other .
mandibles , with five or six teeth , with the second , ( or second and third , when there are six teeth , ) smaller than the others ; in two specimens , there were five teeth on one side and six on the other ; inferior <name> rather broad and strongly pectinated .
maxillæ with the edge nearly straight , without any notch , but with the inferior portion very slightly projecting ; there are twelve or thirteen pairs of unequal spines , of which some of the middle ones are rather longer than the others , and almost as long as the two upper great spines .
outer <unk>  on the inner margin the bristles are divided into two separate tufts ; exteriorly , near the base , there is a distinct rounded swelling with bristles .
the olfactory orifices are highly protuberant , approximate , flattened , scarcely tapering towards their upper ends .
cirri.  the five posterior pair are elongated , very little curled , with short pedicels ; their segments are long , not at all protuberant in front , bearing five or six pairs of long , slightly serrated spines , with a very minute tuft of bristles between each pair , and with some short lateral spines on the inner side of each segment ; on the fourth pair of cirri , these lateral spines are considerably developed ; dorsal tufts consist of fine spines , with one much longer than the others .
first pair short , separated by a wide interval from the second ; rami unequal in length , by between two and four segments ; longer ramus having nine segments , scarcely half as long as the rami of the second cirrus ; shorter ramus with seven segments ; in the same individual there were twenty segments in the sixth cirrus .
the segments in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus are oblong in a transverse direction , and may be compared to a set of shields placed transversely and strung together ; in the longer ramus the segments are longitudinally oblong ; in both they are thickly covered with spines .
second cirrus ; the anterior ramus is a little broader than the posterior ramus , with the segments bearing about five rows of bristles ; fifteen segments in the shorter ramus .
third pair , with the two rami equal in thickness , and with the segments differing very little from those of the posterior cirri , excepting that the serrated spines in the external lateral rows are rather larger .
the fourth pair is remarkable by having , on the inner side of the upper edge of each segment , a little tuft of minute smooth spines , flattened , and a little enlarged near their ends , so as to be <unk> ; i could not see these singular spines on the other cirri .
the lower segments of the pedicels of all the cirri , excepting the sixth pair , are remarkable from having their inner edges , in the middle , produced into a considerable , abrupt , rounded projection , irregularly covered with spines .
caudal appendages , ( pl .
x , fig .
21 , ) very small , flattened , of nearly the same width throughout ; in a <unk> specimen , only <unk> of an inch in length ; each bears from ten to twenty small bristles placed distantly from each other , of which those on the rounded apex are the longest .
generative system.  the penis is remarkably acuminated ; the vesiculæ seminales are unusually small , and enter only for a short distance into the prosoma ; the testes are large .
the ovarian tubes are of large diameter ; the ova are nearly spherical and large , namely , <unk> of an inch in diameter ; they are not numerous , and lie in single layers in the two lamellæ .
the ovigerous fræna are well developed , and lie under the scuta ; one i measured was <unk> of an inch in length and <unk> in width ; the margin is obliquely truncated and slightly sinuous .
this species breeds late in the autumn , and even in <unk> ; i have examined a specimen from cornwall with ova containing larvæ , taken on the 26th of october ; again , in another specimen from belfast , sent to me by mr. thompson , taken in <name> , there were ova in the lamellæ , and therefore no doubt impregnated ; and on february the 12th i received from mr. peach , from cornwall , specimens so very young that they must have become attached during the first days of the month .
<unk>  the specimens from near naples , ( which i owe to the kindness of the rev .
f. w. <name> , ) are somewhat larger , and differ slightly from those of britain : they form , i imagine , the s .
<unk> of <unk> .
after carefully examining them internally and externally , i think it is quite impossible to consider them specifically distinct , for although in several specimens , the valves were placed a little further apart from each other ,  the upper latera a little more elongated ,  the carinal latera rather narrower in their upper half ,  the infra-median latera rather more rounded ,  and , lastly , in the scuta , the tergal margin extended almost in the same line with the lateral margin ; nevertheless in other specimens , i could perceive no difference whatever .
it is , however , remarkable that in several full-grown neapolitan specimens there were no complemental males , whereas i have never seen a single full-grown british specimen without such being present .
in some specimens in the british museum , without any given locality , i have observed considerable variation in the breadth of the carinal and rostral latera .

when first <unk> scalpellum vulgare , i was surprised at the almost constant presence of one or more very minute parasites , on the margins of both scuta , close to the umbones : these are represented , but rendered darker and therefore more conspicuous than in nature , in the drawing , pl .
v , fig .
15 , which is three times the natural size .
i carelessly dissected one or two specimens , and concluded that they belonged to some new class or order amongst the articulata ; but did not at that time even conjecture , that they were cirripedes .
many months afterwards , when i had seen in ibla , that an hermaphrodite could have a complemental male , i remembered that i had been surprised at the small size of the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite s .
vulgare , so that i resolved to look with care at these parasites ; on doing so , i soon discovered that they were cirripedes , for i found that they adhered by cement , and were furnished with prehensile antennæ , which latter , i observed with astonishment , agreed in every minute character , and in size , with those of s .
vulgare : the importance of this agreement <name> not at present be fully appreciated .
i also found , that these parasites were destitute of a mouth and stomach ; that consequently they were short-lived , but that they reached maturity ; and that all were males .
subsequently the five other species of the genus scalpellum were found to present more or less closely analogous phenomena .
these facts , together with those given under ibla ( and had it not been for this latter genus , i never probably should have even struck on the right track in my investigation , ) appear sufficient to justify me , in provisionally considering the truly wonderful parasites of the several species of scalpellum , as males and complemental males .
when these parasites are fully described , <name> be the proper time to discuss and weigh the evidence on their sexual relations and nature .
i <name> now describe the parasite of s .
vulgare .
general appearance.  shape , <unk> , compressed ( pl .
v , fig .
9 , magnified 36 times ) , with a short neck : the outline is usually symmetrical , but sometimes is a little distorted on the under side .
the creature is imbedded more than half its length or depth in the transparent , <unk> chitine border of the scutum of the hermaphrodite .
its length , or longer axis , varies from 10 to <unk> ; its breadth , or transverse axis , is 6 to <unk> ; and its thickness , for it is much flattened , is only <unk> of an inch .
on the summit , there is a <unk> orifice ( a ) , the size of which can rarely be made out quite distinctly , owing to the extreme thinness of the membranous edges .
a little way beneath the orifice , there are four little blunt , bristly points ( b ) , generally rather more than the <unk> of an inch in length ; they are rather variable in size , and seem to be of no functional importance ; directly beneath them , there are four little calcareous beads ( as may be known by their dissolving with <unk> in any acid , and breaking easily under the needle ) ; these are the <unk> of an inch in their larger external diameter ; they are rather deeply imbedded in the outer integument , and taper a little downwards ending in a concave terminal point , into which a minute <unk> enters , like those passing into and through the valves of ordinary cirripedia : along the axis of <unk> , they are often <unk> of an inch in length .
these calcareous beads or rudimental valves are seated in pairs , at the two ends of the flattened animal , so that when the animal is laid on one side , the upper bead in each pair exactly covers and hides the lower one .
the outer integument is composed of chitine , as may be inferred from boiling caustic potash having no effect on it ; the upper part is thicker than the imbedded portion and is wrinkled transversely ; it is covered with minute spines <unk> of an inch in length , either single or in groups of two and three , ( pl .
v , fig .
14 . )
this outer tunic is lined by corium , sometimes slightly mottled with dull purple ; and this by delicate , longitudinal , <unk> muscles , running from the base up to the under edge of the orifice ; these longitudinal muscles are crossed , at least , in the upper part , by still finer transverse muscles .
thorax and <unk>  when the external integument is cut open , the thorax ( pl .
v , fig .
13 ) is found lodged within an inner sack or rather tube , extending from near the bottom of the animal , up to the external orifice .
the whole thorax is sometimes forced through the orifice , owing perhaps to the action of the spirits of wine and consequent <unk> , and is thus well displayed without dissection .
the thorax tapers a little , is much flattened and straight ; its length , together with the terminal abdominal lobe , is about <unk> of an inch ; it is formed of very thin , most finely hirsute membrane , transversely wrinkled and so <unk> , that when <unk> by the internal muscles being seized , it stretches to twice its former length ; in this condition , five transverse articulations are displayed .
the abdominal lobe is smooth , and can not be stretched , or turned inside out by pulling the above muscles .
on the thorax , corresponding with the interspaces between the five transverse articulations , there are four pair of short limbs , but their bases , i believe , are prolonged across the inner or ventral surface of the thorax , so as almost to touch each other .
these limbs , i believe , have no articulations , except , perhaps , where united to the thorax .
the anterior or lowest limb , on each side , supports two or sometimes only a single spine ; this pair is rather smaller than the second , and is placed a little more distant from it , than are the upper pairs from each other .
the second pair differs from the upper two , only in having its three spines a very little shorter .
the two upper or posterior pair exactly resemble each other ; each has two spines on the summit , and a third seated lower down , on a little notch on the outer side , but with its point on a level with the others .
the points of the spines of the two upper limbs , stand on a level with the external spines at the end of the abdomen .
all the spines are of excessive tenuity and sharpness ; they are straight , long , and not plumose .
the abdominal lobe is square , and from not being wrinkled , has a different appearance from the thorax : on each of the posterior angles , there are three moderately long , very sharp spines , with the tips of the outer pair bent a little inwards ; in the middle between them , there are two little spines , and a little below and outside these latter , on the ventral surface , there are two other longer spines with their tips bent inwards ; and again , lower down , two other pair , one beneath the other , of short spines .
perhaps , the three pair of spines on the ventral surface , <name> the three segments , which are distinct on the abdomen of the larva in the last stage of its development , in lepas and other genera .
in the same way , it is probable that the lateral spine on the notch in each limb , marks the point where , in the larva , there is an articulation .
altogether , there are seven pairs of spines on the abdomen , and eleven pairs on the thoracic limbs .
a little way beneath the lower or anterior pair of limbs , the thorax is abruptly bent , and becomes confluent with the lower internal parts of the whole animal .
here , the very delicate membrane of chitine which lines the sack or tube , extending from the external orifice , can be seen to be continuous , as in all cirripedes , with the outer tunic of the thorax .
within the thorax , there are some longitudinal muscles , without transverse striæ , which , i believe , enter the short limbs , but not the abdomen , as i infer from the latter not being <unk> when they are pulled .
at their lower ends these muscles terminate abruptly , and from being contracted are often a little enlarged .
they extend a short way beneath the lower pair of limbs , and are , i suspect , attached to the outer integument of the animal , near the base .
after the most careful dissection of very many specimens , and their examination in many different methods ( as by caustic potash , & c. ) , i can venture positively to assert that there is no vestige of a mouth , or <unk> organs , or stomach : i did not see any anus , but i <name> not affirm that such does not exist .
in the upper part of the animal , lying under the superficial muscles , and close beneath the upper line of their attachment , i found in all the specimens , an eye , of a pointed oval form , rather less than <unk> of an inch in diameter , formed of an outer capsule , lined with purple <unk> , and surrounding , as it appeared , a lens .
the eye is not introduced in fig .
9 , for i could not see it , except by dissection , and therefore do not know its exact relative position .
generative system.  the contents of the animal , between the sack containing the thorax and the outer integuments , and directly under the thorax , varied much in condition : in young and lately attached specimens the whole consisted of a pulpy mass with numerous <unk> ; in other specimens , apparently more mature , there were vast <name> of cells , sometimes <unk> in sheets , about <unk> of an inch in diameter , and having <unk> granular centres ; these i believe to be the testes , for in a specimen presently to be mentioned , in which the <unk> <unk> was gorged with spermatozoa , i found adhering to its outside , a mass of cells of exactly the same diameter , but now empty and transparent instead of having brownish centres .
lastly , in several other specimens , at the very bottom of the <unk> animal , there was a brownish , pear-shaped bag , of different sizes in different individuals , and occasionally broader even than the thorax .
this bag contained either pulpy matter , or a great mass of spermatozoa .
before being disturbed , these spermatozoa lay parallel to each other in flocks , and they yielded to the needle in a peculiar manner , so that i found ( having had experience with these bodies in living cirripedia ) i could almost tell before examination under the compound microscope , whether or not i should see spermatozoa .
many had distinct heads , [ 52 ] which were two or three times as broad as the filamentary bodies ; the latter when placed between glass were the <unk> of an inch in diameter .
i compared these spermatozoa with others taken out of the vesiculæ seminales of the individual hermaphrodite s .
vulgare , to which the parasite was attached , and could not perceive the slightest difference in them .
the brownish pear-shaped bag , or <unk> <unk> , the coat of which seems fibrous , could sometimes be distinctly traced , sending a chord or prolongation far up the thorax : at the end of the abdominal lobe , no doubt there is an orifice ; and this , i believe , i once distinguished .
owing to this chord , the bag often adheres to the thorax , when the latter is dissected out of the general integuments ; in this condition , i twice clearly made out that it was single : in one other specimen , however , there appeared to be two small vesiculæ seminales .
by using a condenser and very brilliant light , the outline of the <unk> <unk> could sometimes be distinguished before dissection , at the bottom of the <unk> animal ; and such was the case in the specimen drawn in fig .
9 .
[ 52 ] i do not understand the development of the spermatozoa in cirripedia : in a recent chthamalus and balanus , i found the greater number had a little filament in front of the head or <unk> enlargement , which latter varied in size and in shape from globular to that of a spindle .
the filament before the head , also , varied in proportional length ; it did not project in exactly the same straight line with the hinder part , and some of the spermatozoa were entirely without this filament in front ;  such is the case with the spermatozoa here described .
although i have dissected , at least , thirty specimens , taken at different times of the year , and from different localities , and when many of the specimens were mature and ready for the impregnation of ova , as clearly shown by the presence of innumerable spermatozoa , i have never seen even a trace of an <unk> or ovaria .
antennæ and <unk>  the prehensile antennæ ( pl .
v , fig .
10 ) , are seated a little above the very base of the <unk> animal ; and this might have been expected from the antennæ in the larva , being seated on the ventral surface , not at the very extremity of the head .
by a very strong light , they can sometimes just be seen whilst the parasite is attached to the hermaphrodite ( the scutum of the latter having been cleaned on the under side ) , and are thus represented in fig .
9 .
they are formed of thicker membrane than the general integument of the body : the second segment , or disc , is pointed and hoof-like ; when seen in profile ( fig .
11 ) , the upper convex surface has a uniform slope with the upper surface of the basal segment ; it is furnished with a single backward pointing spine , attached , i believe , on the under side , nearly opposite the articulation of the ultimate segment : at the apex , there are some excessively minute hairs or down .
the ultimate segment projects rectangularly outwards as usual , and has on its inner side , rather beneath the middle , a conspicuous notch ( fig .
12 ) , which bears two or three long , <unk> spines ; on the summit there are three or four rather shorter spines .
on the outside of the great basal segment there is a single spine curving backwards .
the importance of the following measurements ( in fractions of an inch ) <name> hereafter be seen .
length of whole organ , from end of disc to the further } margin of the oblique basal articulation } <unk> length of whole organ , to the inner margin of the oblique } basal articulation } <unk> breadth of basal segment , measured half-way between the } basal and second articulations ,  the limb being viewed } from vertically above } <unk> length of hoof-like disc , measured from the apex to the } middle of the articulation with the basal segment } <unk> breadth of ditto <unk> length of ultimate segment <unk> breadth of ultimate segment beneath the notch <unk> breadth of ultimate segment above the notch <unk> i did not see the cement-ducts , which , perhaps , was owing to the corium extending from the inside of the whole animal some way into the antennæ , thus rendering them rather less transparent than in common cirripedes .
that the ducts and <unk> exist , is certain , for the antennæ in every case were enveloped in a little irregular mass or capsule of the usual , brown , transparent , laminated cement .
when several of these parasites were attached close together , the cement ran up between them .
i may here state , that i found on one scalpellum , three males very lately attached , and not as yet imbedded in the chitine border ; they were white , opaque , pulpy , and full of oily globules ; the lower part was considerably more pointed , and extended further beyond the prehensile antennæ , than in the older and imbedded specimens .
there were distinct remnants of two great reddish-brown eyes , showing that in this respect the larvæ of the male in their last stage of development , are characterised like the larvæ of other lepadidæ .
the male larva would , probably , be a little larger than the male itself ; but yet compared with the larva in the earliest stage , there can have been unusually little increase of size during the several intermediate metamorphoses ; i judge of this from the dimensions of the larva of the hermaphrodite in the first stage , namely , <unk> of an inch , exactly the size of some of the smaller males .
in the allied genus ibla , the increase is also less than is usual , namely , from <unk> of an inch , the diameter of the <unk> , to only <unk> of an inch , the length of the <unk> larva , just before its final metamorphosis .
habits and concluding remarks.  the males are imbedded in the spinose chitine border of the occludent margin of the scuta , exactly over an oblique fold or notch ( fig .
15 <unk> a ) , close by the umbo .
this fold has no direct relation to the males , but being present is taken advantage of by them ; for it occurs in the young hermaphrodite , before the attachment of the males , and in species of the genus in which the males are attached to other parts .
it occurs , also , in fossil species of pollicipes , and in these it seems caused by the upper inner part of the valve being rendered more and more prominent during growth : in the present species , i suspect , its origin is connected with the formation of a ridge bounding the outer side of the pit for the adductor scutorum muscle : we shall see in the next species , that this fold is of the highest importance in relation to the position of the males .
the transparent chitine border of the scuta is broad , and fills up the fold in the shell , so that the outline of the occludent margin is not affected by it : in the drawing ( fig .
9 ) some of the inner layers of chitine ( e e ) , which dipped into and filled up the fold , have been removed , that the lower part of the animal might be more plainly exhibited .
the chitine bears numerous spines of various lengths , which must afford some protection to the males , rudely arranged in lines , parallel to the edge of the valve , indicating the <unk> layers of chitine ; each spine has a fine , tortuous <unk> connecting its base with the underlying corium .
the extreme outer edge of the border is thin , forming a kind of lip , close beneath which the delicate tunic lining the sack is attached .
during continued growth , the valve is added to in thickness , and so is the chitine border , and likewise in breadth .
it appears that the larva of the male must attach itself on the under side of this border , on the edge of the tunic of the sack , and that by the action of the cement , the corium beneath is killed ( as i believe always is the case with other parasitic cirripedia ) , whereas on both sides , the chitine continues to be added to , so that the male , excepting the upper and always projecting portion , becomes imbedded at first laterally , and ultimately all round : i have seen specimens in several different stages of <unk> .
hence , in old specimens , with a thick and broad chitine border , it might and does come to pass that one male is imbedded ( the valve being laid flat ) directly beneath another .
i have examined a great number of specimens from various localities , taken at different times of the year ,  some dozen specimens from cornwall , [ 53 ] and several from unknown localities in various collections ; some from ireland , from the shetland islands , from norway , and from near naples .
every one of these specimens , with the exception of some of the neapolitan ones , had parasitic males attached to them : i must also except very young specimens , on which they never occur .
on a <unk> specimen , with a capitulum a little more than one fifth of an inch in length , it may be mentioned as unusual that there were three males .
in young specimens there is generally one male on each scutum , but sometimes there are two , and sometimes none on one side .
in large old <unk> specimens i have counted on the two sides together , six , seven , and eight males , and in one <name> specimen no less than ten , seven all close together on one valve and three on the other , but i do not suppose that all these were alive at the same time .
in the neapolitan specimens , however , which are the largest that i have seen , there was in no case more than two ; and out of seven or eight specimens , four had not any male ; so that it would appear there is something in this locality hostile to the development of the parasitic males .
i have noticed only one instance ( that given in fig .
9 ) in which the males were imbedded a little way apart ; generally they touch each other , and are cemented together : where there are several males , they occur at different levels , as measured from the under or upper surface of the chitine border : in one instance of four males adhering to one valve , i distinctly perceived that the lowest one was white , pulpy , and recently attached ; the two above , which were placed close together and between the same laminæ of chitine , were mature ; and the third still higher up , was dead , empty , transparent , and half decayed : in some other instances , i have found the uppermost parasites dead , and , together with the surrounding chitine , partially worn away .
[ 53 ] i am greatly indebted to mr. peach for his unwearied kindness in procuring me fresh specimens .
mr. w. thompson allowed me to <unk> one , possessing particular interest , out of his three <name> specimens .
professor forbes procured me a specimen from the shetland islands , and professor steenstrup was so kind to take pains to send me some <unk> specimens .
the larva of the male must have a different instinct from the larva of the hermaphrodite ; for the latter attaches itself head downwards to a coralline , whilst the male larva crawling on the scuta of the hermaphrodite , discovers , i presume by <unk> , the fold in the shell beneath the translucent border of chitine , and there invariably attaches itself .
its object in choosing this particular spot , i believe , simply is that the depth or thickness of the chitine is there greater , and sufficient for its <unk> , which would hardly be the case elsewhere .
this parasite has , as we have seen , no mouth or stomach , and indeed , considering its fixed position and the <unk> condition of its limbs or cirri , a mouth would have been of no service to it , without it had been extraordinarily elongated .
the male must live on the nourishment acquired during its locomotive larval condition ; and its life no doubt is short , but yet not very short , as i infer from the depth to which mature specimens are buried in the chitine border .
the full development of the spermatozoa <unk> , i suppose , some considerable lapse of time .
the thorax and limbs , though furnished with muscles , are obviously , as already remarked , of no use for prehension ; these parts serve , probably , to defend the little creature , when its eye announces the passing shadow of some enemy , and for this purpose they are well adapted from the extreme sharpness of the spines .
the thorax , into which i traced the <unk> <unk> , no doubt also serves for the <unk> and first direction of the spermatozoa ; and hence , perhaps , its singularly <unk> structure .
i have already remarked , that in specimens preserved in spirits , the thorax is often largely protruded , and bent down at right angles to the orifice .
i presume this is caused by <unk> ; nevertheless it deserves notice , that it was in these protruded specimens that the <unk> <unk> was most conspicuously gorged with spermatozoa .
i suspect the longitudinal and transverse muscles lining the upper part of the outer integuments of the whole animal , can be of little use to the creature , without it be to aid in the protrusion of the thorax , and perhaps in the violent expulsion of the spermatozoa , thus causing them to reach the ovigerous lamellæ within the sack of the hermaphrodite .
it is also probable , that the action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite , would tend to draw inwards the spermatozoa in the right direction .
in one specimen , the spermatozoa in the hermaphrodite and in the male were mature at the same time ; in another this was not the case ; and as the males , apparently , become attached at all periods of the year , this want of coincidence in maturity must often occur .
can the males retain their spermatozoa , till told by some instinct , that the ova in the sack of the often <unk> hermaphrodite are ready for impregnation ; or are the spermatozoa sometimes wasted , as must annually happen with such incalculable quantities of the pollen of many dioecious plants ?
this little cirripede is , in many respects , in a partially embryonic condition .
there is no separation between the capitulum and peduncle ; there is no mouth ; and the thorax , throughout its whole width , opens into the anterior part of the animal : the limbs differ greatly from those both of the mature cirripede and of the larva , but come closest to the latter : the preservation of the abdomen is a well-marked embryonic character .
on the other hand , the four rudimentary calcareous valves , the narrow orifice , the hirsute outer integument , the two muscular layers , the single eye , and male internal organs , are all characteristic of the <unk> condition .
the four little valves , as i believe , represent the scuta and terga , though they are placed considerably below the orifice : the little bristly points have no homological signification , and are absent in the male of the following closely allied species .
the four pairs of limbs answer to the four posterior cirri , as may be inferred from their proximity to the abdominal lobe , and from the three posterior pairs closely resembling each other , and differing a little from the first pair ; this latter pair corresponds with the third pair in the hermaphrodite form of scalpellum .
if i am right in believing that only a single <unk> <unk> is ordinarily developed in the male , this is a special and singular character .
as stated in the beginning of this description , from the one great fact of the absolute correspondence of the prehensile antennæ of the parasite , with those of the hermaphrodite scalpellum vulgare , together with its fixed condition , its short existence , and exclusively male sex , i have thought myself justified in provisionally considering it as the complemental male of the cirripede to which it is attached ; but i <name> final judgment <name> not be passed on this view , until the whole case is summed up at the end of the genus .
[ 54 ] [ 54 ] i trust , before long , that some naturalist , with more skill than i possess , <name> examine these parasites on scalpellum vulgare , which unfortunately is the only species of the genus that can be easily obtained .
fresh specimens , or those preserved in spirits of wine , are necessary .
the action of boiling caustic potash is very useful in cleaning the prehensile antennæ .
if these latter organs are sought in the hermaphrodite for the sake of comparison , young specimens , adhering to clean branches of a coralline , should be procured , and caustic potash used .

[ 55 ] [ 55 ] i am greatly indebted to mr. <unk> for specimens of this extremely interesting species ; also to mr. <name> , to whom mr. <unk> had given some of the original specimens .
female .
capitulum oblong , with the upper portion much produced ; valves , 14 , thick , naked , closely locked together , irregularly clouded with pale crimson ; the membrane connecting the valves is not furnished with spines .
on most of the valves there are furrows and ridges diverging from the umbones , and the lines of growth are plainly marked : in the valves of the lower whorl , the umbones are slightly protuberant .
scuta , convex , unusually thick , oblong , quadrilateral , with the occludent margin the longest ; lateral margin slightly hollowed out .
the umbo ( and primordial valve ) is situated at the uppermost point of the valve , and consequently the growth is exclusively downwards .
on the under side ( pl .
<name> , figs .
1 b´ and 1 <unk> ) , in about the middle of the valve , there is a pit ( a ) for the adductor scutorum muscle , the depth and distinctness of which varies a little ; above the pit , and between it and the apex , there is a transverse , oblong , deeper depression ( b ) , within which , the male is lodged .
a small portion of the apex of the valve projects over the terga .
terga , large , nearly equalling the scuta in area , flat and sub-triangular ; the scutal margin is not quite straight .
the apex of the valve is thick and solid , and must have projected freely for a length equalling one third of the occludent margin .
<name> , laterally broad , <unk> bent ; slightly widening from the apex to the base ; internally , deeply concave .
the position of the umbo varies , in young specimens it is seated at the uppermost point , and consequently in such there is no upward growth ; in older specimens , from the junction and upward production of that part on each side of the valve , which i have called in fossil specimens the <unk> , the valve is added to above the umbo , but to a lesser degree than in s .
vulgare .
slight ridges separate the roof from the <unk> , and the <unk> from the <unk> .
rostrum , minute , narrow , widening a little from the apex downwards , inserted like a wedge between the umbones of the rostral latera , and hardly projecting above their upper margins , so as to be easily overlooked : internally concave .
upper latera ( fig .
1 <unk> ) , <unk> , with a deep square notch cut out of the arched margin , which notch receives the upper point of the carinal latera ; the surface of the valve between the notch and the umbo is depressed .
[ 56 ] rostral latera , small , gradually widening from the umbo to the opposite end , which is obliquely rounded .
infra-median latera , approaching to <unk> , placed obliquely to the longer axis of the capitulum ; or the upper part may be described as <unk> .
[ 56 ] the only valve which i have seen at all like this , is a fossil specimen from the upper chalk of <unk> ; this is described in my memoir on the fossil lepadidæ ( <unk> society ) , under the name of scalpellum <unk> ( tab .

8 , e , f ) , and is perhaps erroneously there considered as a carinal latus .
carinal latera : these appear as if formed of two valves united together ; the upper portion , widening as it ascends in a curved line , terminates in a rounded margin , which enters the deep notch in the upper latera ; the other and lower portion is shorter , and terminates in a square margin <unk> against the infra-median latera ; the umbones of the carinal latera project beyond the line of the <name> .
direction of the lines of growth in the <unk>  this should always be carefully observed , on account of the great diversity there is in this respect between the different species , especially when the recent are compared with the older fossil species ; moreover one of the chief characters between the genus scalpellum and pollicipes , depends on the direction of the lines of growth .
in the scuta , terga , rostrum , and upper latera of the present species , the chief growth is downwards ; in the <name> , in mature specimens , it is both upwards and downwards ; in the carinal latera , both upwards and towards the infra-median latera ; in the infra-median latera chiefly upwards ; and , lastly , in the rostral latera , towards the infra-median latera .
peduncle , short , not half as long as the capitulum ; calcareous scales <unk> as usual , tinged red , almost <unk> , acuminated at both ends , of remarkable length , so that in each whorl there are only four scales : a full-sized scale equals in length one of the rostral latera .
the tips of two scales , in one whorl , lie under the middle points of the <name> and rostrum ; and in the whorl , both above and below , a single much curved scale occupies this same medial position .
the peduncle does not seem to have been attached in any definite position to the horny coralline , as is the case with s .
vulgare .
length of capitulum in the largest specimen <unk> of an inch .
the mouth is directed towards the ventral surface of the thorax .
the labrum is far removed from the adductor muscle , with the upper part forming an overhanging projection ; i believe there are some very minute bead-like teeth on the crest .
palpi , small , narrow , thinly clothed with bristles .
mandibles , with three teeth , of which the first is distant from the second ; inferior <name> not much acuminated , pectinated on both edges .
maxillæ , small , narrow , produced , without any notch , with two large upper spines , of which one is much thicker than the other ; on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of very small hairs .
outer maxillæ , with few bristles , arranged in a continuous line on the anterior surface ; on the external surface there is a tuft of long bristles .
olfactory orifices situated laterally , forming two flattened , tubular projections .
cirri.  first pair placed not far from the second ; the three posterior pair not very long , with their segments elongated , not protuberant , bearing four pair of <unk> spines , with a single short bristle between each pair ; dorsal tufts small , with one spine longer than the others .
first cirrus rather short , segments not very broad ; second cirrus with the rami nearly equal in length , anterior ramus rather thicker than the posterior ramus , with three longitudinal rows of spines .
caudal appendages.  these are minute , rather broad , not half as long as the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with four very long spines at the tip .
<unk>  there is no trace of a probosciformed penis in the four specimens examined ; and as this organ is present in every ordinary cirripede , with the exception of ibla cumingii which we know to be exclusively female , so we may infer with some confidence that the form here described is female , although it is impossible in specimens once dried to demonstrate the absence of the vesiculæ seminales and testes .
affinities.  this is a very distinct species ; it is , however , much more nearly related to s .
rutilum , than to any other species ; and next to this , to s .
vulgare ; from this latter species it chiefly differs in the large scales of the peduncle , in the scuta not being added to at their upper ends , and in the membrane covering and connecting the valves being <unk> ; but there is a greater difference in the trophi and in the cirri .
the peduncle of s .
ornatum presents some resemblance to that of the singular cretaceous genus , <unk> .
male .
all the specimens , as already stated , were dry , but in an excellent state of preservation , so that after having been soaked in spirits , they could be minutely examined .
in the four which i opened , i found , in a transverse pouch on the under side of each scutum , a male lodged ; in a fifth dead and bleached specimen , the cavities in the shell for the reception of the males , were present ; and in a sixth young specimen , also dead , cavities were in process of formation .
as compared with plants , the relation of the sexes in this species may be briefly given , by saying that it belongs to the class <unk> <unk> .
i <name> first describe the males themselves , and then the cavities in the shell of the female .
the males differ in every point of detail , from the complemental males of s .
vulgare , but yet present so close a general resemblance , that a comparative description <name> be most convenient .
the general shape of the whole animal is rather more elongated , and i suspect flatter , but this latter point could not be positively ascertained in dry specimens .
the entire length is greater , being in the largest specimen <unk> ( instead of at most <unk> ) , and the width , <unk> of an inch .
the orifice is not <unk> ; the four bristly points over the calcareous beads are absent .
the whole outer integument is much thinner , owing evidently to its protected position , and is not covered by little bristles , but with an extremely high power , minute points arranged in transverse lines can be distinguished .
the calcareous beads , or rudimentary valves , are thin and regularly oval .
it is remarkable that in all the specimens , two on one side were smaller than the two on the other side ,  the smaller beads being <unk> , and the larger , <unk> of an inch in diameter ; therefore more than twice the size of one of the beads in s .
vulgare , which are only <unk> externally in diameter .
from the position of the eye , close to one margin , near the upper end of the flattened animal , and from the manner in which the little limbs and spines lay between two of the beads at the opposite end , it was manifest that these latter , one large and one small , corresponded with the terga of the other cirripedes , and that the other two , near the eye , answered to the scuta .
the valves being of unequal sizes on the right and left-hand sides of the animal , is probably connected with one side being pressed against the hard , <name> valve of the female ; in the same way as the valves in certain <unk> ; are smaller and flatter on the side nearest to the crustacean to which they are attached .
the eye , in being slightly notched on the upper and lower edge , shows signs of really consisting of two eyes , which i believe is always normally the case ; it is rather larger , in the proportion of 13 to 11 , being <unk> of an inch in diameter , than in s .
vulgare ; and from the almost perfect transparency of the integuments , is far more conspicuous than in that species .
hence when the valves of the female are opened , the black little eye is the first part of the male which catches the attention .
no vestige of a mouth could be discovered .
thorax and <unk>  the thorax , as in s .
vulgare , is highly <unk> , and when stretched exhibits the same five transverse folds or articulations ; when contracted , it is broader , so that even the truncated end of the abdomen is wider than the lower ( properly anterior ) end of the thorax in s .
vulgare .
its thin outer integument is studded with excessively minute points in transverse rows .
the four pair of limbs are longer than in s .
vulgare , but the spines on them much shorter and thicker ; each limb ( including the first ) supports three spines , of which one is seated on a notch low down on the outside , and is longer than the other two ; of these two , the one on the same side with the notch , is a little longer than the other .
the spines on the first and second pair of limbs are considerably shorter than those on the third pair , and these latter , are a little shorter than those on the fourth or posterior pair .
hence , the spines on the thoracic limbs , compared with those of s .
vulgare , present considerable differences , both in their relative and absolute dimensions .
the abdominal lobe is in proportion rather shorter ; its end is less abruptly truncated , and supports a row of , i believe , six moderately long , and <unk> thick spines ; these spines are not so long as those <unk> the fourth pair of limbs .
on both lateral margins of the abdomen , rather on the ventral face , there is a row of , i believe , seven long spines , but it is very difficult to count the spines in specimens which have been once dried .
i was able to distinguish that the two lower pair of spines on the ventral surface , are seated a little way one below and within the other , as in s .
vulgare .
the abdominal spines altogether form quite a brush , and there are certainly several more than in s .
vulgare , and those on the two sides are much longer .
<unk>  the disc is hoof-like , with the upper surface forming a straight line with the upper edge of the basal segment ; the apex is pointed and clothed with some fine down ; there is a single spine pointing backwards , which rises from the lower flat surface .
the ultimate segment was hidden in laminæ of cement ; and i was not able to make out its structure .
there is a single spine on the outer edge of the basal segment , in the usual position .
the entire length of the limb , measured from the end of the disc to the further margin of the basal articulation , is <unk> of an inch ; measured to the inner margin , it is ; <unk> of an inch ; the disc itself is <unk> of an inch long ; these measurements differ a little both absolutely ad proportionally , compared with those of the antennæ of s .
vulgare .
cavities in the scuta of the female for the reception of the <unk>  these extend nearly parallel to the tergal margin , transversely across the valves , for three fourths of their width ; they are seated above the depression for the adductor muscle , and are more conspicuous than it ; they are deep and well defined , and each exactly contains one male .
the males are placed with their orifices in a little notch in the occludent margin , and their prehensile antennæ at the further end .
the distance to which the cavities extend across the valve , and their distance from the upper or tergal margin , varies a little , but chiefly in accordance with the age of the specimens ; for the valve continues to increase in width , whilst the size of the cavity remains the same .
the occludent margin of the scutum in the largest female , was <unk> of an inch in length ; of another , in which there was a fully developed cavity , <unk> ; of a third , in which there was no cavity , only a slight concavity , with a preparatory impression , the length of the occludent margin was <unk> .
the larger and smaller of these three valves , are drawn of their proper proportional sizes , in pl .
<name> , figs .
1 b´ , 1 <unk> .
the preparatory impression ( fig .
1 <unk> , b ) , consists of a narrow , not quite straight , extremely slight furrow , of slightly irregular width , bordered on each side by a very minute ridge , which is distinctly continuous with the inner edge of the occludent margin , both above and below the cavity .
the furrow appears to have been formed by calcareous matter not having been deposited along this line , during the thickening or growth of the internal surface of the valve : i suspect , that it originates at a single period of growth , for i could see no signs of <unk> transverse lines .
i believe that it is strictly homologous with the fold , over which the complemental male is attached in s .
vulgare , but carried , for a special purpose , much further across the valve and rectangularly inwards , for in structure and position both are identical .
in comparing the internal views of the scuta in s .
vulgare and s .
ornatum ( pl .
v , fig .
15 a´ , and pl .
<name> , fig .
1 <unk> ) , it must be borne in mind , that the latter should be compared , as clearly shown by the lines of growth , with that portion alone of the scutum in s .
vulgare , which lies under the curved ridge connecting the umbo and <unk> <name> .
the deep cavity in which the male is lodged , is formed subsequently to the preparatory furrow , simply by the gradual thickening of the surrounding surface of the valve , more especially of a ridge just above the pit for the adductor muscle , and of another broad ridge just beneath the tergal margin .
the deepest part of the cavity lies parallel to the tergal margin along the upper side , and here , in the older valves , the preparatory furrow can by care be distinctly traced .
in conformity with the shape of the cavity , the orifice or notch in the occludent margin of the scutum , is situated at the point where the preparatory furrow sweeps round and enters .
i believe that the cavity is lined by membrane , and that between the cavity and the body of the female , there is a complex membranous layer ,  a pouch or bag being thus formed .
an imaginary section of this pouch ( with the thickness of all the parts extremely exaggerated and in a reversed position ) is given in pl .
<name> , fig .
1 <unk> : a is the shell ; x the cavity , converted , as i believe , into a pouch by , firstly , the delicate tunic ( c ) lining the sack of the female ; secondly , a double layer ( d ) of corium ; and , thirdly , by a special , rather thick membranous layer ( b ) , which thinning out round the cavity coats only part of the under surface of the scutum .
this latter membrane i have not seen in any other cirripede , and i believe it is nothing but the tissue , here not calcified , which , in a calcified condition , ordinarily forms the valves .
on this view , the males may be said to be lodged in pouches , formed in the thickness of the valves .
concluding remarks.  the males from the absence of a mouth ( and no doubt of a stomach ) , must necessarily be short-lived , and , i suppose , are periodically replaced by fresh males .
[ 57 ] in one instance , the remnants of the two great compound eyes of the larva , could be seen at the end of the pouch , opposite the orifice .
the larvæ , i conclude , crawl in at the orifice , one side of which is formed , as we have seen , of yielding membrane , and scratch out the dead <unk> of the former occupant : certainly , the males are less firmly attached to their pouches , though some small quantity of cement is excreted , than are other cirripedes to the objects to which they are attached .
the small size of the female , and her valves not being thickly edged with chitine , accounts for the males having pouches specially formed for them , instead of being , as in s .
vulgare , laterally imbedded in the <unk> of the scuta .
in hereafter weighing the evidence on the nature of the parasites in ibla and in scalpellum , the fact of the valves of the supposed female being here modified for the special purpose of lodging the males , <name> be seen to be important .
if we imagine the male parasites to be extraneous animals , and that by adhering to the sack of the scalpellum , they injure the corium and thus prevent the growth of the shell over an area exactly corresponding to their own size , and so form for themselves cavities ; yet what can be said regarding the preparatory furrows ?
surely these narrow lines can not have been produced by the pressure of the much broader parasites .
must we not see in the furrows , the first marking out , if such an expression may be used , of the habitation for the male , which has to be specially formed by the independent laws of growth of the female ?
[ 57 ] it is possible , though opposed to all analogy , that the females may be short-lived , and breed only once , in which case the males would not have to be periodically replaced .

british museum .
female or hermaphrodite .
there is only a single specimen in the british museum , and this had nearly all its valves separated , and many of them in fragments : from its state of decay , i think the specimen must have been dead , when originally collected .
<unk>  the capitulum consists of fourteen valves , including from analogy a rostrum .
[ 58 ] valves , apparently covered with membrane , bearing some thin spines on the margins ; clouded with a fine , though pale , orange tint ; surfaces plainly marked with lines of growth .
[ 58 ] in my first , and as i thought careful examination of the separated valves ( my only materials ) of this species , i mistook one of the triangular rostral latera for the rostrum , and hence was unfortunately led into an error in my <unk> on the fossil lepadidæ of great britain , ' in which i state that the present species has only twelve valves in the capitulum ; and i inferred from this , that s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , & c. , had only twelve valves ; i still believe this to be correct , but the existence of fourteen valves in s .
rutilum and s .
ornatum , the recent species to which the above fossils are most closely allied , no doubt is a strong argument in favour of this higher number .
scuta , elongated , nearly three times as long as broad ; apex , pointed ; basal margin extremely oblique , forming an acute <name> with the occludent margin ; the lateral margin is slightly hollowed out , and is separated from the tergal margin by a large rectangular projection or shoulder .
the occludent margin is nearly straight ; externally , there is a slight ridge running down the middle of the valve , from the apex to the <unk> <name> ; and a second ridge running from the apex to the <unk> <name> .
the lines of growth do not end abruptly at the <unk> <name> , as is the case with s .
ornatum and several fossil species , but run up a little way along the tergal margin .
the umbo is seated at the uppermost point , and , therefore , the main growth is downwards .
there is a large rounded depression for the adductor muscle ( a , fig .
2 a´ ) , and higher up , opposite the <unk> <name> , there is another hollow ( b ) , for the <unk> of the males ; this latter is of nearly the same shape as the hollow for the adductor muscle , but rather more conspicuous than it .
from the appearance of the under surface of the scuta , it might readily have been thought , that there had been two adductor muscles .
terga , of large size , longer than the scuta , flat , triangular , with the whole inferior part much produced and <unk> .
a portion of the apex , must have projected freely above the sack .
<name> ( pl .
<name> , fig .
2 b´ ) , simply bowed ( i .
e. , not rectangularly bent ) , with the umbo ( and primordial valve ) seated at the upper point ; rather massive , narrow , only slightly increasing in width from the upper to the lower end ; the two sides are flat , and at right angles to the roof , which is bordered on each side by a rather broad , <unk> ridge ( see section fig .
2 <unk> ) , or the roof may be said to have a <unk> furrow running from the apex to the basal margin , and widening downwards ; these two ridges have their lines of growth oblique , and hence have a twisted appearance ; the central depressed portion of the basal margin , which is square or truncated , descends lower down than the two ridges .
the sides of the valve close to the apex are broad , and consist , as i believe , of <unk> , as well as of <unk> , but these parts are not separated from each other by ridges , as is commonly the case , more especially with the fossil species .
i have described the <name> in some detail , on account of its resemblance to that of the cretaceous s .
<unk> , s .
<unk> , and s .

rostrum , unknown ; but one probably existed .
upper latera , of large size , elongated , quadrilateral , approaching to <unk> , with the angles rounded , nearly twice as long as broad ; almost flat ; upper half acuminated , lying between the scuta and terga ; the lower half broad , forming a rectangular projection lying between two latera of the lower whorl .
the umbo is near the apex , the greater part of the growth being downwards , but the valve is added to a little , round the two sides of the apex ; these additions do not take place in the early stages of growth , ( as explained under s .
vulgare , ) and , therefore , they form a depressed rim .
rostral latera , almost exactly triangular , curved ; basal margin furnished with a just perceptible rim .
infra-median latera , quadrilateral , sides unequal in length ; the <unk> margin being the longest ; in area not quite twice double the rostral latera ; directed obliquely upwards .
carinal latera , sub-triangular , produced upwards , with the apex rounded , and the two lateral margins hollowed out ; the basal margin exceeds a little in length the basal margin of the rostral latera .
the umbones of these two latera are seated at their basal outer angles , so that the growth of the valves is towards each other and upwards .
the umbo of the infra-median latus is seated at the <unk> <name> , and hence the growth is obliquely upwards .
the umbones of the rostral latera must have been close together , over the unknown rostrum .
length of capitulum about <unk> of an inch .
peduncle , only small fragments are preserved ; the calcified scales are small , closely <unk> , several of them together only equalling in length the basal margin of the rostral latera .
each scale is thin , transversely elongated ; basal imbedded portion straight ; upper margin rounded .
mouth.  labrum with the upper part highly bullate , forming an overhanging projection ; palpi apparently small and narrow .
mandibles , narrow , produced , with three teeth ; inferior <name> pectinated , as is sometimes the third tooth ; the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth equals that between the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , extremely narrow , produced , without any notch ; spinose edge exactly one third of the length of the mandibles : beneath the two upper great spines there are only three or four pair of spines ; on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of the smallest hairs .
outer maxillæ , rounded with the inner margins very sparingly but continuously covered with bristles .
i could not ascertain whether the olfactory orifices were tubular .
cirri.  these consisted , in the one specimen , of merely small fragments .
the segments of the posterior cirri are elongated , not protuberant , and support , i believe , five pair of <unk> spines , and an exterior row of very minute spines : dorsal spines fine and long .
either the second or third cirri , or probably both , are remarkable for having the whole of one side of each segment covered with irregular rows of long spines .
moreover , in the upper segments of these same cirri , between each separate dorsal tuft , there is placed one or two long bristles .
the first cirrus appears to have had very broad segments , and these are singular from the spines in the dorsal rows , being extremely long .
in some of the cirri , several of the basal segments are soldered together .
caudal appendages , lost .
from the state of the specimen , it was quite impossible to ascertain whether the individual here described was an hermaphrodite or female ; from the analogy of its nearest <unk> , s .
ornatum , the latter is the most probable ; but the genus ibla shows how the sexes may differ in the most closely-allied forms .
affinities.  from the hollows on the under sides of the scuta , for the <unk> of the males ; from the umbones of the scuta and of the <name> being situated on the apices of these valves ; and from all the characters of the mouth , s .
rutilum is much more closely allied to s .
ornatum than to any other species .
male , or complemental male .
in the concavity or hollow above the depression for the adductor muscle ( pl .
<name> , fig .
2 a´ ) , i found males , but in so extremely decayed a condition , that they could hardly be examined .
on one side , however , i distinctly saw the larval prehensile antennæ , with pointed , hoof-like discs ; and part of the thorax , with its small limbs and long spines , as in s .
vulgare or s .
ornatum .
i also saw clearly the eye .
the four calcified beads or rudimentary valves , i believe , were present ; but in removing the specimen , the whole fell to pieces and was lost .
the outer integument was covered with rather thick , very minute bristles , each about , <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore only half the length of those on the complemental males of s .
vulgare .
the cavities for the males are not formed , as in s .
ornatum , by the thickening of the internal surface of the valve round a defined space , but by the scutum being externally convex and internally concave down the middle , hollows being thus produced both for the <unk> of the males and for the attachment of the adductor muscle .
these hollows are separated from each other by a slight transverse ridge .
i do not know at which point of the margin of the valve , the orifice of the male is situated , but i presume close under the apex .
in this species , as in s .
ornatum , there can be no question that the scuta of the female are specially modified by their own growth for the reception of the males .
it must be added that , as it was not possible to ascertain whether the ordinary form of s .
rutilum was hermaphrodite or female , so it must remain doubtful whether the parasites are males or complemental males ; but the former , i think , is most probable .

terga large , one third of their own length longer than the scuta ; fat , sub-triangular ; the three margins are not quite straight ; the carinal margin projects a little above the apex of the <name> , and the scutal margin is <unk> to fit the upper part of the scuta .
<name> bowed , internally deeply concave ; upper portion above the umbo , about one fourth of the total length , extending between the terga for two thirds of their length , up to the slight prominences on their carinal margins : a ridge separates , on each side , the <unk> from the <unk> .

sub-carina minute , not above one third of the size of the rostral latera , which are the smallest of the other valves ; internally deeply concave ; externally solid , pyramidal , standing out beyond the surface of the <name> , with the umbo at the apex .
the umbones of the four pair of latera are seated a little above the centre in each valve , on the summit of a raised triangular portion ; this arises from the valve at first growing only downwards , and when added to at the upper end , the new part forms a ledge at a lower level round the old part , which had already acquired some thickness .

the latter project more , and are externally more pointed , as in the genus pollicipes .
the rostrum is well developed ; the infra-median latera , in proportion , are the least of all the valves .
the <name> is straight and pointed , and not , relatively to the scuta , quite so long .
the scuta are rather broader in proportion to their length , which would naturally follow from less having been added to their apices ,  these valves at first growing only downwards .

before describing the parasite of the present species , which departs entirely from the character of the males of the three preceding species , it is proper to state that i consider it to be a complemental male simply from analogy , as <name> hereafter be more fully shown at the end of the genus .
had a specimen of the parasite been brought to me without any information , i should have concluded that it was an immature individual of a new genus of pedunculated cirripedes , remarkable from the rudimentary condition of the valves , and exhibiting , in one important character , namely , in the form of the larval prehensile antennæ , an alliance to scalpellum .
had i been then told that three individuals in a group , had been found attached to s .
rostratum , not outside the valves , but to the integument , in a central line , between the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle , in such a position that when the scalpellum closed its valves , these parasites were enclosed within the capitulum , my surprise would have been great ; for it is very improbable that this singular and unparalleled position was accidental in this one group of specimens , inasmuch as there seems to be a relation between the naked condition of the capitulum of the parasite , and the protection afforded to it by the capitulum of the scalpellum .
it further becomes apparent on reflection , that these minute parasites , though having the appearance of immaturity , can not increase in size , or but little , for if they did grow , and acquired an ordinary size , they would either be killed by the pressure of the scuta of the scalpellum , or they would destroy the latter , and in doing so soon lose their own support , and thus necessarily perish !
the one full-grown specimen of s .
rostratum , in mr. <unk> collection , was in a good state of preservation , but dry .
the three parasites were attached , as stated , close under the labrum , between it and the adductor muscle .
they are constructed like ordinary cirripedia , and have a mouth , thorax and cirri , enclosed in a capitulum , supported on a peduncle of moderate length and narrow .
the entire length of the capitulum and peduncle , as far as could be ascertained in the shrivelled condition of the specimens , was <unk> , and the greatest width of the capitulum <unk> of an inch .
both capitulum and peduncle are hirsute with spines , nearly <unk> of an inch in length , mingled with shorter hairs in little rows of three and four together .
the figure ( 5 ) in pl .
<name> is merely a restoration , as accurate as could be made from the much shrivelled specimens .
there are only three valves ,  namely , an oval <name> ( a ) , seated rather high up on the capitulum , in a rudimentary condition and only <unk> of an inch in length , and a pair of scuta ; these latter consist of a narrow , slightly curved plate , <unk> in length , broadest at the lower end , where the breadth is <unk> of an inch .
the prehensile antennæ , at the end of the peduncle , have pointed hoof-like discs : i was not able to make out the other parts .
it deserves notice , that in the young specimen of the ordinary form of s .
rostratum , <unk> of an inch in length , and therefore only thrice as long as the parasites , all the valves were perfect , and seemed to have followed the ordinary law of development .
mouth.  the largely bullate labrum is placed far from the adductor , in the same manner as in the hermaphrodite .
the mandibles have three large sharp teeth , with the inferior point very sharp and small , so that there is one less tooth than in the hermaphrodite .
the maxillæ have two or three large upper spines , the others being very thin ; i believe the lower part is upraised and <unk> , as in the hermaphrodite .
the outer maxillæ are <unk> in front , with a few short bristles on the outer side near the bottom .
i was not able , from the dried state of the specimens , to discover whether the olfactory orifices were tubular .
altogether it was apparent , from this imperfect examination , that there was a close similarity between the mouth of the parasite and of the hermaphrodite .
the thorax is unusually elongated .
cirri.  the first pair is very short , and is distant from the second .
all have the appearance of immaturity , with their pedicels very long in proportion to their rami ; the latter are slightly unequal in length , even in the sixth pair .
there appeared to be six segments in the rami of the sixth pair , each segment bearing two or three pair of long spines .
caudal appendages , with two or three little spines on their summits .
penis , short , blunt , thick at the apex , with one or two spines on it .
i did not see any ovaria , but this could hardly have been expected in specimens in a dried condition , without they had happened to have been in a gorged condition .
certainly there were no ova .
in the general summary at the end of the genus , i shall give my reasons for believing this parasite to be the complemental male of the scalpellum rostratum .

hermaphrodite .
capitulum formed of 13 valves ; namely , two scuta , two terga , a <name> and sub-carina , a rostrum , a pair of upper latera , and two pair of lower latera ; these latter valves , with the sub-carina and the rostrum , make a whorl of six pieces .
the upper part of the capitulum is , as usual , produced .
the upper valves are separated ( in specimens which have not been dried ) by rather wide interspaces of membrane ; they are covered ( excepting , generally , their umbones , ) by membrane , which in the interspaces is clothed with fine spines .
the spines , or the marks where they were once articulated , are visible over nearly the entire surface of the membrane covering the valves .
the spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack .
the whole capitulum , ( in a dried condition ) , is coloured dull <unk> , which is only in part due to the underlying corium , for the valves themselves are pale red .
after having been long kept in spirits , the whole capitulum becomes colourless .
the valves are smooth , faintly marked by lines of growth .
the umbones of the lower valves project outwards , giving a <unk> appearance to the base of the capitulum .
scuta , slightly convex , oblong , breadth about two thirds of the length , almost quadrilateral , with the upper portion produced into a flat projection ; this projection is almost <unk> , being constricted a little on each side below the apex .
there is a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the umbo is near the apex , the part above not being above one fifth of the whole length of the valve .
as in s .
vulgare , the growth is at first downwards , and subsequently a little upwards and downwards , thus producing the upper , small , <unk> projection , which lies at a lower level than the umbo .
there is a fold on the occludent margin .
terga , large , flat , triangular ; carinal margin slightly hollowed out ; occludent margin slightly arched , with a small portion protuberant to a variable amount .
the apex is slightly curved towards the <name> .
<name> , long , internally deeply concave , <unk> bent , the lower portion slightly longer and wider than the upper part ; the two halves meet each other at about an <name> of <unk> ; the upper half is parallel to the longer axis of the terga , between which it extends for three fourths of their length .
the external surface is rounded , except near the umbo , where the edge is <unk> ; growth almost equally upwards and downwards ; the <unk> and <unk> are not separated by ridges .
the sub-carina lies close under the <name> , and is placed almost transversely to the longer axis of the capitulum ; external surface arched and smooth , the whole having the shape of half of a cone , with the apex a little curved outwards ; seen internally , it may be said to be formed of two triangular wings placed at right angles to each other ; basal margin straight ; in size equalling the carinal latera .
rostrum , lying almost transversely to the longer axis of the capitulum , under the basal margins of the scuta ; in shape ( fig .
6 a ) closely resembling the sub-carina , but about one third larger than it ; larger also than either the rostral or carinal latera ; seen externally , appears like a half cone ; seen internally , is formed of two triangular wings ( with curved edges ) , placed at <unk> to each other .
upper latera , internally flat , oblong , twice as long as broad ; upper end square , truncated ; upper half rather wider than the lower half ; fully twice as large as either of the lower latera .
the basal points extend below the basal margins of the scuta .
the umbo is placed a little above the centre .
rostral latera , minute , scarcely exceeding one third of the size of the carinal latera , and very much less than the rostrum ; they are placed transversely under the basal point of the upper latus , or rather between it and the <unk> <name> of the scutum ; basal margin , as seen internally , straight ; upper margin arched ; rostral <name> produced ; internally flat ; the whole valve is very thick and solid , so that the umbo which lies at the rostral end , projects rectangularly outwards .
carinal latera , oblong , nearly quadrilateral , with the upper <name> produced ; placed obliquely , parallel to the lower half of the upper latera ; umbo slightly prominent , seated near the apex , with three rounded ridges proceeding from it ; internal surface very slightly concave .
peduncle and <unk>  the peduncle is short , not equalling the capitulum in length .
the whole surface is most thickly clothed with minute spines , which are not visible when the specimen is dry ; i think it probable that they may sometimes all drop off before a new period of exuviation .
the peduncle does not ( at least in the specimens which i have examined , which were grouped in a bunch ) taper at the lower end to a point ; and after careful examination , i feel sure that the cement does not <unk> from several successively formed orifices , as in s .
vulgare and as in some pollicipes , but only from the two original orifices in the prehensile antennæ of the larva .
in these latter organs , the sucking disc is hoof-like and pointed , and is narrower than the basal segment .
the ultimate segment has on its inner side ( supposing this segment stretched straight forwards , ) a notch or step bearing at least three spines .
the proportions of the different parts differ slightly from those in s .
vulgare ; but , as i shall hereafter have to give all the measurements , i do not think them worth repeating here .
in the one large group of specimens examined by me , in mr. <unk> possession , all were attached symmetrically to the coralline , as in the case of s .
vulgare , capitulum upwards , and their <unk> outwards .
length of capitulum about three quarters of an inch ; width about half an inch ; entire length , with peduncle , a little more than one inch .
the mouth is placed far from the adductor muscle .
labrum , with its basal margin much produced ; upper part highly bullate , forming a rounded projection equalling the longitudinal axis of the rest of the mouth ; crest without any teeth .
palpi , triangular , with the two margins , thickly clothed with bristles ; on each side of the mouth , near where the palpi are united to the mandibles , there is a slight , orbicular , <unk> swelling .
the mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
3 ) have nine or ten very unequal teeth , with the inferior <name> rather broad and pectinated ; of these , there are four main teeth , of which the second is always the smallest , and between the four , one or two small teeth are <unk> ; so that the total number is either nine or ten , and often varies on the two sides of the same individual , as likewise does the shape of the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , with the edge nearly half as long as that of the mandibles , supporting from seventeen to twenty pairs of spines ; the upper pair is only slightly larger than the others ; a part near the inferior <name> projects slightly beyond the rest of the nearly straight edge .
the <unk> , at its base or point of origin , is unusually broad and flat .
outer maxillæ , large and triangular .
the inner margin is slightly concave , and continuously covered with short spines .
the outer margin is <unk> , as in s .
vulgare , with the basal part supporting a great tuft of long bristles , of which the greater number turn outwards , and almost cover the olfactory orifices .
the latter are slightly prominent , placed some way apart from each other , with the above-mentioned tufts of bristles between them .
all the spines of the trophi are in some degree doubly serrated .
cirri.  the first pair is seated rather far from the second pair , and the prosoma being little developed , the shape of the body nearly resembles that of s .
vulgare .
the posterior cirri are elongated , very little curled , with the segments much flattened , not at all protuberant , bearing from five to seven pair of long serrated spines , with a few small spines in an exterior row ; between each pair there is a very minute tuft of small bristles ; the upper lateral rim of each segment is toothed with small spines ; spines of the dorsal tufts , long , serrated .
first pair , elongated , having numerous segments , namely , seventeen , whilst the sixth pair in the same individual had only twenty-one segments ; rami nearly equal ; segments short , nearly cylindrical , thickly clothed with long serrated spines .
the second and third pair are nearly equal in length ; they have their anterior rami slightly thicker than their posterior rami , both being much more thickly clothed with spines , than are the three posterior pair of cirri .
pedicels , rather short , with their inner edges not forming a projection , as in s .
vulgare .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
20 ) , <unk> , flat , rounded at their ends and moderately long ; clothed most thickly , like brushes , with very fine bristles , which latter are serrated , and are longer than the appendages themselves .
penis , of small size , narrow , pointed , and thickly clothed with delicate hairs ; in length equalling only one fourth of the sixth cirrus .
ovigerous fræna , small , semicircular ; entire edge thickly covered with glands .
ovarian tubes , within the peduncle , fully developed as usual .
affinities.  this species differs from all the others in the absence of calcareous scales on the peduncle ; but it has no other character which at all justifies its generic separation .
in the shape of the scuta and <name> it comes nearest to s .
vulgare .
taking all the characters together , it is scarcely possible to say to which of the other species it is most closely allied , having close affinities with all .
in the entire structure , however , of the complemental male , immediately to be described , this species certainly comes nearer to s .
villosum than to any other species .
i may add , that in s .
villosum the latera are almost rudimentary , and therefore tend to disappear , whereas in s .
peronii it is the calcareous scales on the peduncle which have actually disappeared .

i examined , owing to the great kindness of mr. cunning , six dry specimens of the hermaphrodite s .
peronii , from swan river , and one in spirits from another locality , in the british museum .
out of these seven specimens , only three appeared to have had parasites attached to them , and these i infer , from reasons to be more fully given at the end of the genus , are complemental males .
one of the three specimens , however , had two males close together .
these parasites were firmly cemented to the integument of the hermaphrodite , in a fold , in a central line between the scuta , a little below ( the animal being in the position in which it is figured ) the adductor scutorum muscle , and therefore some way below the umbones of these valves .
when the scuta are closed , the parasites , from their small size , are enclosed and protected .
in every detail of structure , they are obviously pedunculated cirripedia .
the capitulum ( pl .
<name> , fig .
3 ) has six valves ; namely , a pair of scuta and of terga , a <name> , and a rostrum , all united by <unk> membrane , furnished near the orifice with some much longer and thicker spines .
the capitulum is truncated in a remarkable manner , the orifice not being , as in the hermaphrodite , in the same line with the peduncle , but almost transverse to it , and therefore almost parallel to the surface of attachment .
the largest specimen measured transversely , through the scuta and terga , was <unk> of an inch in breadth ; another was only <unk> to <unk> : this latter specimen , measured longitudinally , from the base of the <name> to the tips of the terga , was <unk> of an inch .
a scutum of the largest specimen was <unk> in length .
the scuta and terga are broadly oval , with the primordial valves very plain at their upper ends .
i may here mention , that in a central line between the scuta , i observed the apparently single , minute , black eye , as in ordinary cirripedia .
the <name> is straight , triangular , and internally slightly concave ; its basal margin descends far below the basal points of the terga .
the rostrum is shorter , and internally more concave than the <name> : i believe it projects more abruptly outwards than is represented in the figure .
the peduncle commences some little way below the scuta : it is narrow and very short : it is finely <unk> : it is lined by delicate transverse <unk> muscles , within which there are the usual stronger , longitudinal muscles .
the base is flat and truncated .
i examined , and carefully compared , the prehensile antennæ with those of the hermaphrodite , and found every part and every measurement the same .
the full importance of this identity <name> hereafter be more fully insisted on .
the antennæ are represented of their proper proportional size in fig .

mouth.  the labrum , as in the hermaphrodite , is highly bullate , and far removed from the adductor scutorum muscle .
the palpi are small and triangular , with their blunt apices clothed with a very few scattered bristles .
mandibles , with only three teeth , and the lower <name> minute , slightly pectinated ; the first tooth is distant from the second , and larger than it .
width of the whole organ , <unk> of an inch .
maxillæ , bearing only a few spines , furnished with a long <unk> ; beneath the upper large pair there is a notch , under which there are two spines of considerable size and a small tuft of fine bristles ; width <unk> of an inch , and therefore only <unk> of the size of the same organ in the hermaphrodite : the relative sizes of the maxillæ and mandibles are the same in the male and hermaphrodite .
outer maxillæ blunt , triangular , with a few <unk> bristles on the inner face ; those on the outside being longer .
cirri.  the first pair is far removed from the second ; the rami are very short , barely exceeding the pedicel in length ; they are formed of only four segments , each bearing a pair of spines ; but on the end of the terminal segment , there are three spines , of which the central one is very long .
second pair also short .
in the sixth pair there are five or six elongated segments , each bearing three pair of long spines ; dorsal tufts large .
the cirri are furnished with <unk> muscles .
the caudal appendages exist as two very minute plates , with a few bristles at their apices .
the penis is not acuminated , with four bristles at the end ; it is short , equalling only the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
in the one specimen preserved in spirits , i unfortunately omitted to search for the vesiculæ seminales ; i can not doubt that such existed , but it would have been important to have ascertained whether they contained spermatozoa .
i made out , most distinctly , that there was no trace of ovarian tubes within the peduncle ; and my assertion may be believed when i state , that i traced the two much finer and more transparent cement-ducts , from the prehensile antennæ up to the body of the animal : in lepas i have repeatedly detected , with ease , the ovarian tubes within the peduncle , before the <unk> of the valves had even commenced , and therefore at a much earlier period of growth than in these parasites .
consequently i am prepared to affirm , that these parasites are not females , but that , as far as can be judged , from external organs , they are exclusively males .
concluding remarks.  in comparing the capitulum of the hermaphrodite with that of the complemental male ( pl .
<name> , figs .
6 and 3 ) , we must be struck with the differences in their shape , in the number , relative sizes , and forms of the several valves .
it should , however , be borne in mind , that the scuta and <name> in the hermaphrodite at first grow exclusively downwards ; so that if we remove the upper portions subsequently added , the difference in shape in these valves is not so great as it at first appears .
the rostrum in the male is of much larger relative size ; whilst of the upper latera there is not a trace , although in the hermaphrodite these valves are larger than the rostrum .
the terga , compared with those of the hermaphrodite , differ more essentially than do the other valves ; and the manner in which the primordial valves project , shows that from the first commencement of <unk> , the lines of growth have followed an unusual course .
the great breadth and shortness of the terga is evidently related to the shortening of the whole capitulum , and the transverse position of the orifice ; and this shortening of the capitulum , no doubt , is rendered necessary for its reception and protection within the shallow furrow between the scuta of the hermaphrodite .
finally , if we compare the internal parts of the hermaphrodite and male , the differences are considerable , though partly to be accounted for by the youth of the latter : the form and position of the labrum , and the distance between the first and second pair of cirri , is the same in both ; but the mandibles and maxillæ differ considerably .
to put the case as i have before done , if a specimen of one of these parasites had been brought to me to class without any information of its habits ,  the downward direction of growth in all the valves , the presence of a rostrum , the <unk> outer integument , all the details of the prehensile antennæ , the form of the animal 's body , and the position of the labrum , would have convinced me that , though a quite new genus , it ought to have stood close to scalpellum , and nearer to it than to ibla .

hermaphrodite .
capitulum with fourteen valves , consisting of a pair of scuta and of terga , a <name> , ( which five valves are much larger than the others , ) a rostrum , sub-rostrum , sub-carina , and three pair of small latera .
all the valves are covered by membrane , as are the calcareous scales on the peduncle ; and this membrane everywhere is densely clothed with spines .
the upper valves are not very thick ; they stand rather close together .
the eight valves of the lower whorl are more solid , and are placed far apart ; they are small , tending to become rudimentary .
none of the valves are added to at their upper ends , in which respect this species differs remarkably from the others of the genus , and approaches in character to pollicipes .
scuta , with a deep hollow for the adductor muscle , triangular , with the basal margin elongated , and protuberant .
terga , large , flat , triangular , basal point blunt , with the carinal margin slightly hollowed out , and the scutal margin protuberant .
apex solid .
<name> , rather longer than the terga , straight , gradually widening from the upper to the basal end , deeply concave .
in young specimens the upper part is slightly bowed inwards .
apex solid .
sub-carina , with the inner surface <unk> ; the umbo points transversely outwards ; in width it exceeds the largest of the latera .
rostrum , triangular , internally ( fig .
8 a ) concave ; basal margin slightly hollowed out , and deeply notched ; rather less in width than the <name> ; short , with the umbo pointing upwards and outwards .
in young specimens the apex curves a little inwards .
sub-rostrum , with the inner surface transversely elongated ( fig .
8 b ) , slightly <unk> , about two thirds as wide as the rostrum .
the apex points transversely outwards .
latera , three pair ; the middle pair apparently corresponds with the upper latera of the other species of the genus .
the two other pair of latera , together with the rostrum and sub-carina , form a whorl .
the sub-rostrum lies by itself , a little beneath this whorl .
the latera are smaller than the rostrum or the sub-carina .
they are placed far distant from each other ; their inner surfaces are triangular ; their umbones point upwards ; the rostral pair is smaller than the other two pair , which are of equal size .
the exact position of the rostral latus differed on the two sides of the specimen examined ; apparently its normal position is at the <unk> <name> of the scuta .
peduncle , wide at the summit , longer than the capitulum ; calcified scales small , not arranged very regularly ; flattened , <unk> , rather far separated from each other ; imbedded in membrane , so that even their summits are rarely uncovered .
the surface of the membrane is thickly clothed with spines , which are strong , thick , yellow , pointed , and furnished with large tubuli running to the underlying corium .
these spines are arranged in groups of from three or four , to five or six .
besides these larger spines , the whole surface is <unk> with very minute colourless spines , not above <unk> of the length of the larger ones .
the surface of attachment is broad .
this species , not being symmetrically attached to a coralline , the peduncle does not curve , as in most of the other species , towards the rostrum .
the capitulum is above half an inch in length .
mouth.  the labrum is much produced downwards , but yet the mouth is not very far distant from the adductor muscle : the upper part is bullate , forming a small overhanging point , and in longitudinal diameter equals the rest of the mouth .
palpi blunt .
mandibles with four teeth , strong , short , thick , the second tooth much smaller than the others ; inferior <name> broad , pectinated .
maxillæ with a long , rather sinuous edge , which , near the inferior <name> , has a narrow projecting point , bearing rather finer spines ; there is , also , apparently , a very minute tuft of small spines close under the two large upper spines : there are , altogether , about twenty pair of spines , without counting the smaller ones .
outer maxillæ , with the inner edge slightly concave , continuously covered with bristles ; exteriorly , with a prominence covered with longer bristles .
olfactory orifices prominent , protected by a slight punctured swelling between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
cirri.  prosoma moderately developed ; first pair of cirri rather far removed from the second pair .
the segments of the three posterior pair are not elongated , short , slightly protuberant in front , bearing four or five pairs of strong spines ; a little below each pair , there is an intermediate tuft of very fine straight bristles , of which the upper tuft is the largest ; on the lateral upper rims there are some short , strong spines ; dorsal tufts rather small and thick ; spines all more or less serrated , especially on the broad basal segments of the three anterior cirri .
pedicels of the cirri not particularly protuberant in front .
first cirrus with rami , slightly unequal in length ; not short ; basal segments much thicker and more protuberant than the upper segments .
second cirrus ; anterior ramus with six or seven basal segments highly protuberant , and crowded with spines ; posterior ramus with about six segments , similarly characterised .
third cirrus with the anterior ramus having six , and the posterior ramus five segments , also similarly characterised .
caudal appendages absent , there being only a slight swelling on each side of the anus .
the oesophagus runs parallel to the labrum , and enters obliquely the summit of the stomach , which is destitute of cæca : the <unk> envelope is longitudinally <unk> .
there are no filamentary appendages .
testes large , branched like a stag 's horns , attached in a sheet to the ventral surface of the stomach : the vesiculæ seminales enter the prosoma , and have their reflexed ends not very blunt .
the penis is rather narrow , with the terminal half plainly ringed , and bearing tufts of fine bristles arranged in circles , one tuft below the other ; on the basal half there are only a few scattered minute bristles .
affinities.  in the downward growth of all the valves , in the presence of a sub-rostrum , in the shape of the scuta , <name> , and more especially of the triangular latera , in the form of the peduncle , with its <unk> calcified scales , in the shape of the <unk> body , in the structure both of the mandibles and maxillæ , in the arrangement of the spines , both on the anterior and posterior cirri , scalpellum villosum most closely resembles , or rather is identical with , pollicipes .
had it not been for the formation of the valves forming the capitulum , and from the presence of complemental males , i should have placed this species alongside of pollicipes spinosus and sertus .
in not having caudal appendages , s .
villosum differs from all the species of scalpellum and pollicipes ; but this organ is variable to an unusual degree in pollicipes .
complemental male .
pl .
<name> , fig .
4 .
from the kindness of professor <name> , mr. gray , and mr. cuming , i have been enabled to examine six specimens of this species ; and on two of them i found complemental males .
they were attached in the same position as in s .
peronii ; namely , beneath the adductor muscle , in the fold between the scuta , so as to be protected by the latter when closed .
this parasite is <unk> , and has a close general resemblance with that of s .
peronii , but differs in very many points of detail .
it is represented of the natural size at <unk> fig .
4 .
the capitulum is <unk> of an inch , measured across the scuta and terga ; and the same measured from the base of the <name> to the top of the capitulum ; hence it is broader , by a quarter of the above measurement , and considerably higher than the male of s .
peronii .
from the capitulum being higher , that is , not so much truncated , the orifice is placed more obliquely .
the membrane connecting the valves is finely <unk> , and is besides furnished with spines , conspicuously thicker and longer than those on the male s .
peronii .
the scuta and terga are much more elongated , a scutum being here <unk> of an inch in length .
the <name> descends only just below the basal points of the terga , instead of far below them .
the rostrum is a little broader and more arched than the <name> ; it is <unk> in length , and therefore more than two thirds of the length of the <name> , the latter being <unk> of an inch from the apex to the basal margin .
the primordial valves , with the usual hexagonal tissue , are seated on the tips of the scuta , terga , and <name> , but not on the rostrum ; so that these valves follow the same law of development , as in the ordinary and hermaphrodite form of scalpellum .
the scuta ( a , fig .
4 , greatly enlarged ) , the terga ( b ) , and <name> ( c ) of the male , resemble the same valves in the hermaphrodite , much more closely than do these valves in the male and hermaphrodite s .
peronii .
the rostrum has not its basal margin hollowed out , and is very much larger relatively to the <name> , than in the hermaphrodite .
the large relative size of the rostrum in the complemental male both of this species and of s .
peronii , is a remarkable character , which i can in no way account for .
the peduncle is narrow and short , but in a different degree in the two specimens examined .
it is naked .
the prehensile antennæ were not in a good state of preservation : the disc is narrower than the basal segment , and only slightly pointed , in which important respect it differs from the same part in the foregoing species ; at its distal end , rather on the inner side , there are two or three spines , apparently in place of the excessively minute hairs , which are found at the same spot in some or in all the other species of scalpellum , and in ibla : similar strong spines occur in pollicipes .
unfortunately , for the sake of comparison , i was not able to find the prehensile antennæ in the hermaphrodite s .

maxillæ , with a considerable notch under the upper pair of large spines ; inferior part of the edge not prominent .
outer maxillæ , with the spines on the inner edge arranged into two groups .
olfactory orifices tubular and prominent , with some long bristles near their bases .
in the mandibles having only three teeth , in the maxillæ being notched and in the lower part not being prominent , and , lastly , in the bristles on the inner face of the outer maxillæ being arranged in two groups , these several organs differ from those in the hermaphrodite .
cirri.  first pair short , with only three or four segments in each ramus : second cirrus , with the basal segments not very thickly clothed with spines : sixth cirrus with seven segments , not protuberant in front , each bearing four pairs of spines , without intermediate tufts .
caudal appendages , none .
this is an interesting fact , considering that these organs are likewise absent in the hermaphrodite s .
villosum ,  an absence highly remarkable , and confined to the genus conchoderma and the one species of anelasma .
penis thick , not tapering , rather exceeding in length the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , square at the end , and furnished with some spines .
in one specimen , i believe i distinguished the vesiculæ seminales : if so , they contained only pulpy matter , and not spermatozoa .
there were no ovarian tubes within the peduncle , which was lined by the usual muscles ; i traced the two delicate cement-ducts , running from within the antennæ close up to the animal 's body .
hence in this case , as in that of s .
peronii , i dare positively affirm that ovarian tubes do not occur ; for it is out of the question that i could have traced the cement-ducts , and , at the same time , overlooked the far larger and more conspicuous ovarian tubes , into which , moreover , the ducts , had they existed , would have run .
consequently , these parasites are not females ; but judging from the probosciformed penis , and from the presence , as i believe , of vesiculæ seminales , they are males .
the complemental males of the present species , and of s .
peronii , so closely resemble each other , that what i have stated regarding the affinities of the latter , are here quite applicable .
it is singular how much more alike the parts of the mouth and the cirri of these two complemental males are , than the corresponding parts in the two hermaphrodites : this no doubt is due to the two males having been arrested in their development , at a corresponding early period of growth .
several of the characters , by which the hermaphrodite s .
villosum so closely approaches , and almost blends into the genus pollicipes ,  such as the thicker cirri , with the intermediate tufts of bristles , the small second tooth of the mandibles , and the little <unk> prominence on the maxillæ ,  are not in the least apparent in the complemental male .
summary on the nature and relations of the males and complemental males , in ibla and scalpellum .
had the question been , whether the parasites which i have now described , were simply the males of the cirripedes to which they are attached , the present summary and discussion would perhaps have been superfluous ; but it is so novel a fact , that there should exist in the animal kingdom hermaphrodites , aided in their sexual functions by independent and , as i have called them , complemental males , that a brief consideration of the evidence already advanced , and of some fresh points , <name> not be useless .
these parasites are confined to the allied genera ibla and scalpellum ; but they do not occur in pollicipes ,  a genus still more closely allied to scalpellum ; and it deserves notice , that their presence is only occasional in those species of scalpellum which come nearest to pollicipes .
in the genera ibla and scalpellum , the facts present a singular parallelism ; in both we have the simpler case of a female , with one or more males of an abnormal structure attached to her ; and in both the far more extraordinary case of an hermaphrodite , with similarly attached complemental males .
in the two species of ibla , the complemental and ordinary males resemble each other , as closely as do the corresponding hermaphrodite and female forms ; so it is with two sets of the species of scalpellum .
but the males of ibla and the males of scalpellum certainly present no special relations to each other , as might have been expected , had they been distinct parasites independent of the animals to which they are attached , and considering that they are all cirripedes having the same most unusual habits .
on the contrary , it is certain that the animals which i consider to be the males and complemental males of the two species of ibla , if classed by their own characters , would , from the reasons formerly assigned , form a new genus , nearer to ibla than to the parasites of scalpellum : so , again , the assumed males of the three latter species of scalpellum would form two new genera , both of which would be more closely allied to scalpellum , than to the parasites of ibla .
with respect to the parasites of the first three species of scalpellum , they are in such an extraordinarily modified and embryonic condition , that they can hardly be compared with other cirripedes ; but certainly they do not approach the parasites of ibla , more closely than the parasites of scalpellum ; and in the one important character of the antennæ , they are identical both with the parasitic and ordinary forms of scalpellum .
that two sets of parasites having closely similar habits , and belonging to the same <unk> , should be more closely related in their whole organisation to the animals to which they are respectively attached , than to each other , would , if the parasites were really distinct and independent creatures , be a most singular phenomenon ; but on the view that they differ only sexually from the cirripedes on which they are parasitic , this relationship is obviously what might have been expected .
the two species of ibla differ extremely little from each other , and so , as above remarked , do the two males .
in scalpellum the species differ more from each other , and so do the males .
in this latter genus the species may be divided into two groups , the first containing s .
vulgare , s .
ornatum and s .
rutilum , characterised by not having a sub-carina , by the rostrum being small , by the constant presence of four pair of latera , and by the peculiar shape of the carinal latera ; the second group is characterised by having a sub-carina and a large rostrum , and may be subdivided into two little groups ; viz. , s .
rostratum having four pairs of latera , and s .
peronii and villosum having only three pairs of latera : now the males , if classed by themselves , would inevitably be divided in exactly the same manner , namely , into two main groups ,  the one including the closely similar , <unk> males of s .
vulgare , ornatum , and rutilum , the other the pedunculated males of s .
rostratum , peronii , and villosum ; but this latter group would have to be subdivided into two little sub-groups , the one containing the <unk> male of s .
rostratum , and the other the <unk> males of s .
peronii and s .
villosum .
it should not , however , be overlooked , that the two main groups of parasites differ from each other , far more than do the two corresponding groups of species to which they are attached ; and , on the other hand , that the parasitic males of s .
peronii and s .
villosum resemble each other more closely , than do the two hermaphrodite forms ;  but it is very difficult to weigh the value of the differences in the different parts of species .
besides these general , there are some closer relations between the parasites and the animals to which they are attached ; thus the most conspicuous internal character by which ibla quadrivalvis is distinguished from i .
cumingii , is the length of the caudal appendages and the greater size of the parts of the mouth ; in the parasites , we have exactly corresponding differences .
out of the six species of scalpellum in their ordinary state , s .
ornatum is alone quite destitute of spines on the membrane connecting the valves ; and had it not been for this circumstance , i should even have used the presence of spines as a generic character ; on the other hand , s .
villosum , in accordance with its specific name , has larger and more conspicuous spines than any other species .
in the parasites we have an exactly parallel case ; the parasite of s .
ornatum being the only one without spines , and the spines on the parasite of s .
villosum being much the largest !
this latter species is highly singular in having no caudal appendages , and the parasite is destitute of these same organs , though present inn the parasites of s .
rostratum and s .
peronii .
again , s .
villosum approaches , in all its characters , very closely to the genus pollicipes , and the parasite in having prehensile antennæ , with the disc but little pointed , and with spines at the further end , departs from scalpellum and approaches pollicipes !
<name> any one believe that these several parallel differences , between the <unk> parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached , are accidental , and without signification ?
yet , this must be admitted , if my view of their male sex and mature be rejected .
one more , and the most important special relation between the parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached , remains to be noticed , namely that of their prehensile larval antennæ .
i observed the antennæ more or less perfectly in the males of all , and except in s .
villosum , in all the species , though so utterly different in general appearance and structure , i found the peculiar , pointed , hoof-like discs , which are confined , i believe , to the genera ibla and scalpellum .
in the hermaphrodite forms of scalpellum , i was enabled to examine the antennæ only in two species , s .
vulgare and s .
peronii , ( belonging , fortunately , to the two most distinct sections of the genus , ) and after the most careful measurements of every part , i can affirm that , in s .
vulgare , the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical ; but that they differ slightly in the proportional lengths of their segments , and in no other respect , from these same organs in s .
peronii ,  in which again the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical .
the importance of this agreement <name> be more fully appreciated , if the reader <name> consider the following table , in which the generic and specific differences of the antennæ in the lepadidæ , as far as known to me , are given .
these organs are of high functional importance ; they serve the larva for crawling , and being furnished with long , sometimes plumose spines , they serve apparently as organs of touch ; and lastly , they are indispensable as a means of permanent attachment , being adapted to the different objects , to which the larva adheres .
hence the antennæ might , à priori , have been deemed of high importance for classification .
they are , moreover , embryonic in their nature ; and embryonic parts , as is well known , possess the highest classificatory value .
from these considerations , and looking to the actual facts as exhibited in the following table , the improbability that the parasites of s .
vulgare and s .
peronii , so utterly different in external structure and habits one from the other , and from the cirripedes to which they are attached , should yet have absolutely similar prehensile antennæ with these cirripedes , appears to me , on the supposition of the parasites being really independent creatures , and not , as i fully believe , merely in a different state of sexual development , <unk> great .
the parasites of s .
vulgare take advantage of a pre-existing fold on the edge of the scutum , where the chitine border is thicker ; and in this respect there is nothing different from what would naturally happen with an independent parasite ; but in s .
ornatum the case is very different , for here the two scuta are specially modified , before the attachment of the parasites , in a manner which it is impossible to believe can be of any service to the species itself , <unk> of the <unk> thus afforded for the males .
so again in s .
rutilum , the shape of the scutum seems adapted for the reception of the male , in a manner which must be attributed to its own growth , and not to the pressure or attachment of a foreign body .
now there is a strong and manifest improbability in an animal being specially modified to favour the <unk> of another , though there are innumerable instances in which parasites take advantage of pre-existing structures in the animals to which they are attached .
on the other hand , there is no greater improbability in the female being modified for the attachment of the male , in a class in which all the individuals are attached to some object , than in the mutual organs of <unk> being adapted to each other throughout the animal kingdom .

in using the terms inner and outer sides of the end segment , it is supposed , that this segment is stretched straight forwards , instead of being bent rectangularly outwards , as in its natural position ; and then there can be no doubt which is the inner and outer sides .
it should be observed that the evidence in this summary is of a cumulative nature .
if we think it highly , or in some degree probable ,  from the ordinary form of ibla cumingii having been shown on good evidence to be exclusively female ,  from the absence of ova and ovaria in the assumed males of both species of ibla , at the period when their vesiculæ seminales were gorged with spermatozoa ,  from the close general resemblance between the parts of the mouth in the parasites and in the <unk> to which they are attached ,  from the differences between the two parasites being strictly analogous to the differences between the two species of ibla ,  from the generic character of their prehensile antennæ ,  and from other such points ,  if from these several considerations , we admit that these parasites really are the males of the two species to which they adhere , then in some degree the occurrence of parasitic males in the allied genus scalpellum is rendered more probable .
so the absolute similarity in the antennæ of the males and hermaphrodites both in s .
vulgare and s .
peronii ; and such relations as that of the relative <unk> of the several species in this same genus , all in return strengthen the case in ibla .
again , the <unk> parasites of s .
peronii and s .
villosum are so closely similar , that their nature , whatever it may be , must be the same ; hence we may add up the evidence derived from the identity of the antennæ in the parasite and hermaphrodite s .
peronii , with that from the antennæ in the male s .
villosum , approaching in character to pollicipes , to which genus the hermaphrodite is so closely allied ; and to this evidence , again , may be added the singular coincident absence of caudal appendages in the male and hermaphrodite s .
villosum .
if these two <unk> parasites be received as the complemental males of their respective species , no one , probably , <name> doubt regarding the nature of the parasite of s .
rostratum , in which the direct evidence is the weakest ; but even in this case , the particular point of attachment , and the state of development of the valves , form a link connecting in some degree , the parasites of the first three species with the last two species of scalpellum , in accordance with the affinities of the hermaphrodites .
when first examining the parasites of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , before the weight of the cumulative evidence had struck me , and noting their apparent state of immaturity , it occurred to me that possibly they were the young of their respective species , in their normal state of development , attached to old individuals , as may often be seen in lepas ; this , however , would be a surprising fact , considering that s .
rostratum and s .
peronii are ordinarily attached , in a certain definite position , to horny corallines , and considering that the exact points of attachment in these three parasites , ( of which i have seen no other instance amongst common cirripedes , ) namely , between the scuta , would inevitably cause their early destruction , either directly or indirectly , by their living supports being destroyed .
nevertheless , i carefully examined a young specimen of s .
rostratum only thrice as large as the parasite ; and not having very young specimens of s .
peronii and villosum , i procured the young of closely-allied forms , namely , of s .
vulgare , ( with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch in length , ) and of pollicipes polymerus , ( with a capitulum of less size than that of one of the parasites , ) and there was not the least sign of anything abnormal in the development of the valves .
in s .
vulgare , at a period when the calcified scuta could have been only <unk> of an inch in length , ( and therefore considerably less than the scuta in the parasites , ) the upper latera must have been as much as <unk> of an inch in length , and the valves of the lower whorl certainly distinguishable .
to sum up the evidence on the sex of the parasites , i was not able to discover a vestige of ova or ovaria in the two male <unk> ; and i can venture to affirm positively , that the parasites of s .
peronii and s .
villosum are not female .
on the other hand , in the two male <unk> , i was enabled to demonstrate all the male organs , and i most distinctly saw spermatozoa .
in the parasitic complemental male of s .
vulgare , i also most plainly saw spermatozoa .
in the parasites of s .
rostratum , s .
peronii , and s .
villosum , the external male organs were present .
i may here just allude to the facts given in detail under ibla , showing that it was hardly possible that i could be mistaken regarding the exclusively female sex of the ordinary form of i .
cumingii , seeing how immediately i perceived all the male organs in the hermaphrodite i .
quadrivalvis ; and as the parasite contained spermatozoa and no ova , the only possible way to escape from the conclusion that it was the male and i .
cumingii the female of the same species , was to invent two hypothetical creatures , of opposite sexes to the ibla and its parasite , and which , though cirripedes , would have to be locomotive !
i insisted upon this alternative , because if the parasite of i .
cumingii be the male of that species , then unquestionably we have in i .
quadrivalvis a male , complemental to an hermaphrodite ,  a conclusion , as we have seen , hardly to be avoided in the genus scalpellum , even if we trust exclusively to the facts therein exhibited .
with respect to the positions of the parasitic males , in relation to the impregnation of the ova in the females and hermaphrodites , it may be observed that in the two male <unk> , the elongated <unk> body seems perfectly adapted for this end ; in the males of the first three species of scalpellum , the spermatozoa , owing to the manner in which the thorax is bent when protruded , would be easily discharged into the sack of the female or hermaphrodite ; this would likewise probably happen with the complemental male of s .
rostratum , considering its position within the orifice of the capitulum , between the mouth and the adductor scutorum muscle .
the males of s .
peronii and villosum being fixed a little way beneath the orifice of the sack , below the adductor muscle , are less favorably situated , but the spermatozoa would probably be drawn into the sack by the ordinary action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite , and therefore would at least have as good a chance of fertilising some of the ova , as the pollen of many dioecious plants , trusted to the wind , has of reaching the stigmas of the female plants .
regarding the final cause , both of the simpler case of the separation of the sexes , notwithstanding that the two individuals , after the metamorphosis of the male , become <unk> united together , and of the much more singular fact of the existence of complemental males , i can throw no light ; i <name> only repeat the observation made more than once , that in some of the hermaphrodites , the vesiculæ seminales were small , and that in others the probosciformed penis was unusually short and thin .
viewing the parasitic males , in relation to the structure and appearance of the species to which they belong , they present a singular series .
in s .
peronii and s .
villosum , the internal organs have the appearance of immaturity ; the shape of the capitulum is specially modified for its reception between the scuta of the hermaphrodite , and several of the valves have not been developed .
this atrophy of the valves , is carried much further in s .
rostratum .
in ibla , many of the parts are embryonic in character , but others mature and perfect ; some parts , as the capitulum , thorax , and cirri , are in a quite extraordinary state of atrophy ; in fact , the parasitic males of ibla consist almost exclusively of a mouth , mounted on the summit of the three anterior segments of the 21 normal segments of the <unk> crustacean .
in the males of the first three species of scalpellum , some of the characters are embryonic ,  as the absence of a mouth , the presence of the abdominal lobe , and the position of the few existing internal organs ; other characters , such as the general external form , the four bead-like valves , the narrow orifice , the peculiar thorax and limbs , are special developments .
these three latter parasites , certainly , are wonderfully unlike the hermaphrodites or females to which they belong ; if classed as independent animals , they would assuredly be placed not in another family , but in another order .
when mature they may be said essentially to be mere bags of spermatozoa .
in looking for analogies to the facts here described , i have already referred to the minute male <unk> which cling to their females ,  to the <unk> males of certain <unk> , parasitic on the females ,  and to certain <unk> , in which the sexes cohere , or even are <unk> blended by one extremity of their bodies .
the females in certain insects depart in structure , nearly or quite as widely from the order to which they belong , as do these male parasitic cirripedes ; some of these females , like the males of the first three species of scalpellum , do not feed , and some , i believe , have their mouths in a rudimentary condition ; but in this latter respect , we have , amongst the <unk> , a closely analogous case in the male of the <unk> of gosse , which was discovered by mr. <unk> [ 62 ] to be entirely destitute of mouth and stomach , exactly as i find to be the case with the parasitic male of s .
vulgare , and doubtless with its two close allies .
for any analogy to the existence of males , complemental to hermaphrodites , we must look to the vegetable kingdom .
finally , the simple fact of the diversity in the sexual relations , displayed within the limits of the general ibla and scalpellum , appears to me eminently curious ; we have ( 1st ) a female , with a male ( or rarely two ) permanently attached to her , protected by her , and nourished by any minute animals which may enter her sack ; ( 2d ) a female , with successive pairs of short-lived males , destitute of mouth and stomach , inhabiting two pouches formed on the under sides of her valves ; ( 3d ) an hermaphrodite , with from one or two , up to five or six similar short-lived males without mouth or stomach , attached to one particular spot on each side of the orifice of the capitulum ; and ( 4th ) hermaphrodites , with occasionally one , two , or three males , capable of seizing and devouring their prey in the ordinary <unk> method , attached to two different parts of the capitulum , in both cases being protected by the closing of the scuta .
as i am summing up the <unk> of the phenomena here presented , i <name> allude to the marvellous assemblage of beings seen by me within the sack of an ibla quadrivalvis ,  namely , an old and young male , both minute , <unk> , destitute of a capitulum , with a great mouth , and rudimentary thorax and limbs , attached to each other and to the hermaphrodite , which latter is utterly different in appearance and structure ; secondly , the four or five , free , <unk> larvæ , with their curious prehensile antennæ , two great compound eyes , no mouth , and six natatory legs ; and lastly , several hundreds of the larvæ in their first stage of development , globular , with <unk> projections on their <unk> , minute single eyes , <unk> antennæ , probosciformed mouths , and only three pair of natatory legs ; what diverse beings , with scarcely anything in common , and yet all belonging to the same species !

[ 63 ] this is one of the rare cases in which , after much deliberation , and with the advice of several distinguished naturalists , i have departed from the rules of the british association ; for it <name> be seen that mitella of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , are both prior to pollicipes of leach ; yet , as the latter name has been universally adopted throughout europe and north <name> , and has been extensively used in geological works , it appears to me to be as useless as hopeless to attempt any change .
it may be observed that the genus pollicipes was originally proposed by sir <name> hill ( 'history of animals , ' vol .
iii , p. 170 ) , in <unk> , but as this was before the discovery of the <unk> system , by the rules it is absolutely excluded as of any authority .
in my opinion , under all these circumstances , it would be mere <unk> to go back to <unk> 's <unk> der <unk> ' for the name mitella ,  a work little known , and displaying entire ignorance regarding the cirripedia .
<unk> ab 18 <unk> ad 100 et <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : sub-rostrum <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> valves from 18 to above 100 in number : latera of the lower whorl numerous , with their lines of growth directed downwards : sub-rostrum always present : peduncle <unk> .
hermaphrodite ; filamentary appendages either none , or numerous and seated on the prosoma and at the bases of the first pair of cirri ; labrum bullate ; trophi various ; olfactory orifices generally highly prominent ; caudal appendages <unk> and spinose , or <unk> .
attached to fixed , or less commonly to floating objects , in the warmer temperate , and tropical seas .
it has been remarked , under scalpellum , how imperfectly that genus is separated from pollicipes ; and we have seen under scalpellum villosum that the addition of a few small valves to the lower whorl , would convert it into a pollicipes , most closely allied to p .
sertus and spinosus .
it has also been shown , that the six recent species of pollicipes might be divided into three genera , of which p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus , would form one thoroughly natural genus , as natural as lepas and the earlier genera ; p .
mitella would form a second ; and p .
sertus and p .
spinosus a third ; but i have acted to the best of my judgment in at present retaining the six species together .
as far as the valves of the capitulum are concerned , it would be very difficult to separate p .
mitella from p .
sertus and spinosus .
<unk> the number of valves in the capitulum has in this genus acquired its maximum .
the number varies considerably in the same species , and even on opposite sides of the same individual , and generally increases with age .
it is more important , that the number of the whorls in p .
cornucopia , and in the two following closely-allied forms , also increases with age .
in p .
sertus and p .
spinosus , even the number of the whorls varies in different individuals , independently of age .
the valves are arranged alternately with those above and below ; they are generally thick and strong , making the capitulum somewhat massive ; in some species they are subject to much disintegration ; but in others , the apices of the several valves , especially of the <name> and rostrum , are well preserved , and project freely : they are covered with membrane , which , differently from in most species of scalpellum , either does not bear any spines , or only exceedingly minute points .
in all the species there is a sub-rostrum and sub-carina , and often beneath these a second sub-rostrum and sub-carina .
in <unk> specimens there are at least 20 valves in the <unk> whorl .
the <name> is either straight or curved , but never rectangularly bent , and is always of considerable breadth .
none of the valves are added to at their upper ends .
the scuta have a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the valves lie either some little way apart , or more commonly close together .
in p .
mitella the scuta and terga are locked together by a fold , and the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in a peculiar manner , resembling that in which the compartments in the shells of sessile cirripedes fold over each other .
the peduncle is of considerable length in some of the species , and rather short in others ; it is , in every case , clothed with calcified scales .
the scales in the first four species are placed alternately and symmetrically ; they are formed and added to in the same manner as in scalpellum ; they differ in size according to the size of the individual , and consequently the lower scales on the peduncle , formed when the specimen was young , are smaller than the upper scales ; the lower scales are separated from each other by wide interspaces of membrane , owing to the continued growth of the peduncle by the formation of new layers of membrane , and the disintegration of the old outer layers .
each scale is invested by tough membrane ( or has been , for it is often abraded off ) , in the same manner as the valves ; each is furnished with one or more tubuli , in connection with the underlying corium .
in p .
sertus and p .
spinosus , the scales are small , <unk> , and not of equal sizes , and the rows are distant from each other , so that their alternate arrangement is not distinguishable ; in these two species , new scales are formed round the summit of the peduncle , and the growth of each is completed whilst remaining in the uppermost row ; but , besides these normal scales , such as exist in the other species of pollicipes and in scalpellum , new scales are formed in the lower part of the peduncle , which are generally of very irregular shapes , are often larger than the upper ones , are crowded together , and sometimes do not reach the outer surface of the membrane .
this formation of scales in the lower part of the peduncle , independently of the regular rows round the uppermost part , is perhaps a feeble representation of the calcareous cup at the bottom of the peduncle in the genus lithotrya .

size.  most of the species are large : and p .
mitella is the most massive of the pedunculated cirripedes .
the mouth is not placed far from the adductor muscle .
the labrum is highly bullate .
the mandibles have either three or four main teeth ( pl .
x , fig .
1 ) , with often either one or two smaller teeth inserted between the first and second .
the maxillæ ( pl .
x , figs .
13 , 14 ) , have their edges either straight and square , or notched , or more commonly with two or three prominences bearing tufts of finer spines .
the outer maxillæ ( fig .
17 ) generally have a deep notch on their inner edges , but this is not invariable .
the olfactory orifices in most of the species are highly prominent .
cirri.  the first pair is never placed far distant from the second .
the posterior cirri have strong , somewhat protuberant segments ; and between each of the four or five pair of main spines ( pl .
x , fig .
27 ) , there is a rather large tuft of straight , fine , short bristles .
the second and third pair have the basal segments , either of the anterior rami , or of both rami , so thickly clothed with spines ( fig .
25 ) , as to be <unk> : in p .
mitella , however , the third pair is like the three posterior pair in the arrangement of its spines , in this respect resembling the sessile <unk> .
the caudal appendages are either <unk> and spinose , or <unk> : it is remarkable that there should be this difference in such closely allied species as p .
cornucopia and p .
polymerus : the short , obtuse , <unk> caudal appendage of the former species ( fig .
22 ) makes an excellent passage from the <unk> ( fig .
19 ) to the <unk> form , as in p .
mitella .
the stomach , in those species which i opened , is destitute of cæca ; the <unk> glands are arranged in straight lines ; the <unk> is unusually short .
the prosoma is well developed .
in p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus , there are numerous filamentary appendages both on the prosoma , and at the bases of the first pair of cirri : these appendages are occupied by testes , and i suspect stand in relation to the length of the peduncle and consequent great development of the ovaria .
in order to give space for the filamentary appendages , the sack ( generally roughened by small <unk> <unk> ) penetrates more deeply than usual into the upper part of the peduncle .
there are small ovigerous fræna in p .
sertus , p .
spinosus , and p .
mitella : in the three other species , the <unk> or fold occupies the usual position on each side , and is large ; but in one specimen carefully examined by me , i was unable to see any glands ; and in another specimen , the ovigerous lamellæ were not attached to the fræna ; hence i conclude that the fræna are functionless in these three species .
affinities.  i have already remarked on the close relationship between this genus and scalpellum ; there is also some affinity with lithotrya .
<unk>  all over the world .
the p .
cornucopia ranges from scotland to teneriffe : the p .
polymerus is found in opposite hemispheres in the pacific ocean , extending from california to at least as far as <unk> south of the equator .
geological <unk>  having so lately given , in the <unk> of the <unk> society , ' a full account of all the fossil species known , i <name> not repeat here the conclusions there arrived at .
i <name> only state , that species of pollicipes are found in all the formations , extending from the lower <unk> to the upper tertiary beds .

according to mr. w. thompson ( 'annals of nat .

vol .
xiii , p. 436 ) , it has been found attached to <unk> near dublin .
capitulum , <unk> triangular , massive : valves close together , rather thick , with their exterior surfaces convex , naked , except in the lower parts , where united together by tough , <unk> membrane , destitute of spines .
the edges of the orifice are widely bordered by membrane , coloured fine crimson red .
the valves , in a specimen with a capitulum above three quarters of an inch long , were 52 in number ; in a specimen one fifth of an inch long , only between 20 and 30 .
two whorls of valves are distinct beneath the <name> and rostrum .
in one specimen in mr. cuming 's collection , with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , there were three whorls beneath the rostrum , and four beneath the <name> .
the scuta , terga , and <name> are much larger than the other valves .
scuta , oval , the basal and <unk> margins sweeping into each other , and the apex pointed ; internally ( pl .
vii , fig .
1 a ) the pit for the adductor muscle is deep .
terga , larger than the scuta , internally ( fig .
1 a ) slightly concave ; carinal margin much curved and protuberant ; basal <name> blunt ; scutal margin either curved with the upper part straight , or formed of two almost distinct lines , corresponding with the tergal margin of the scutum , and with one of the sides of the upper latus .
<name> , much curved , extending far up between the terga , internally deeply concave , widening much from the top to the bottom ; basal margin highly protuberant , with a central portion either truncated and very slightly hollowed out , or bluntly and rectangularly pointed , with the apex itself rounded .
rostrum , not one third of the length of the <name> , concave , triangular , with the basal margin slightly protuberant .
of the other valves , including the sub-carina and sub-rostrum , the shape of their inner surfaces is sub-triangular , with the basal margin convex ; externally the umbones are pointed , and slightly curled inwards , so as to overlap each other like tiles : the smaller valves , however , of the lower whorls ( fig .
1 a ) are more or less transversely elongated , so as to become almost elliptic instead of triangular .
of the latera , the upper pair , which corresponds to the interspace between the scuta and terga , is the largest , but barely exceeds in size the pair answering to the carinal latera in scalpellum , which lie between the terga and <name> : the next largest pair is the rostral , or that between the scuta and rostrum .
some , however , of the lower latera are of nearly equal size .
peduncle , narrower , but generally longer than the capitulum ; upper part encased with small calcareous scales , with their apices curved inwards , and overlapping each other .
the inner surface of each scale is triangular , with the basal margin protuberant .
the scales continue to grow or be added to , only in about the ten upper whorls , which form but a small part of the whole peduncle ; in the lower part , the scales become further and further separated from each other .
the surface of attachment , in full-grown specimens , is broad ; but in two very young specimens , which i removed with great care after the action of potash , i found the peduncle ending in a <unk> prolongation , such as often occurs in scalpellum vulgare and in lepas fascicularis .
at the extremity of the pointed peduncle , there were seated the larval prehensile antennæ , of which the following measurements are given to show how minute they are .
<unk> length , from apex of disc , to the further edge of the basal articulation <unk> breadth of basal segment , in broadest part <unk> hoof-like disc , length of <unk> ultimate segment , entire length of <unk> " " breadth , in broadest part <unk> the disc resembles a broad , rounded hoof , very little longer than broad , and narrowed in at the heel ; the apex is not at all pointed , and bears some minute and thin spines .
there is one large spine on the under side of the disc ; and another on the basal segment , on the outside , in the usual position .
the ultimate segment is long and thin ; it has a notch on the inner side ( the segment supposed to be stretched forward ) , bearing two or three long <unk> spines ; and there are three or four other spines on the summit : altogether there is a close resemblance with the antennæ in scalpellum , excepting that the hoof-like disc is not here pointed .
<unk>  valves internally tinted , in parts , grey ; peduncle , brown ; corium of sack , <unk> , of peduncle , <name> <unk> brown ; cirri , banded <unk> , and with the front surfaces of the segments , <unk> .
edge of the orifice of sack , fine crimson red .
the specimen here described had been dried for a few weeks , and was then moistened .
<unk>  the largest specimen which i have seen , in mr. <unk> collection , had a capitulum 1 and <unk> of an inch long ; a fine specimen , from teneriffe , was <unk> in length .
in a specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , and about the same in breadth , there were eighteen valves ; so that , besides the principal valves , five pair of latera , the sub-carina , and sub-rostrum , were already developed , and on the upper part of the peduncle , there were many calcareous scales .
filamentary appendages.  the prosoma is well-developed , with thirteen or fourteen pair of short , blunt filaments , placed close together in two longitudinal rows ; those nearest the thorax are the longest ; outside this double row , on each side , there is a row of <unk> , indicating a tendency to the formation of two other rows of filaments .
there is a pair of longer filaments , one on each side of the mouth , pointing upwards , and thinly clothed with long spines ; at the bases of the first pair of cirri there is a second pair of filaments , shorter and bearing a few minute spines .
the bottom of the sack is studded with small rounded <unk> , with roughened summits .
mouth , not placed very far from the adductor muscle .
labrum , highly bullate , equalling , in its longitudinal diameter , the rest of the mouth ; upper part square , not overhanging the lower part ; there are some small teeth on the crest .
palpi , oval , outer and inner margins nearly alike , thickly clothed with spines .
mandibles , with three very strong , yellow teeth ; inferior point broad , coarsely pectinated .
in one specimen , on one side , the third tooth was represented by two smaller teeth .
the maxillæ bear three conspicuous tufts of fine bristles , separated by larger spines ; the first tuft is placed close to the two , upper , large , but <unk> spines ; the second tuft is placed in the middle , and the third at the inferior <name> .
the two latter tufts stand on prominences ; between the two upper tufts there are three pair , and between the two lower tufts four or more pair of rather strong spines : ( see the figure , 13 , pl .
x , in the allied p .
polymerus . )
outer maxillæ , with the inner edge divided in the middle by a conspicuous notch , and with the bristles above and below short , making two equal combs .
on the exterior surface , the bristles are longer and more spread out .
olfactory orifices prominent , protected by a punctured swelling between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
cirri , short and rather thick ; the first pair is not far removed from the second .
the segments of the three posterior pair are somewhat protuberant , bearing six pair of short , strong spines , graduated in length , between which there is a very thick , longitudinal brush of short , fine , straight bristles , of which the lower ones are the longest ; some thick , minute spines arise from the upper lateral edges of the segments .
the spines in the dorsal tufts are short , much crowded , and of nearly equal length ; see figure , 27 , pl .
x , in the allied p .
polymerus .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had seventeen segments , the first cirrus had , in the shorter ramus , eight segments , of which the lower four were thick and protuberant , with the spines doubly serrated .
in this same specimen , the anterior ramus of the second cirrus had twelve segments , of which the five basal ones were highly protuberant , and thickly clothed with <unk> spines .
in the third cirrus the basal segments of the anterior ramus are highly protuberant .
the basal segments in the posterior rami of both these cirri , are slightly protuberant , but otherwise resemble the segments in the three posterior pair .
the caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
22 ) , in full-grown specimens , just exceed in length the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus ; they are nearly cylindrical , bluntly pointed , with five oblique imperfect articulations ; the lower or basal articulations can not be traced all round , being distinct only on the ventral surface .
there is a row of short spines round the upper edge of each segment , with a little , short tuft on the point of the terminal segment .
in a rather young specimen , however , with its capitulum one fifth of an inch long , each appendage certainly consisted of a single segment , with spines only on the summit .
penis purple , with excessively short and fine spines in tufts , chiefly near the extremity .
in a specimen with a capitulum only one fifth of an inch long , the penis consisted of a mere pointed <unk> , not so long as the caudal appendage , and therefore equalling in length only the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
ovigerous <unk>  i could see none , though there were two large lamellæ in the sack .
the ova were <unk> , but they had been dried and then placed in spirits .
the ova were wonderfully numerous , oval , much elongated , and <unk> of an inch in length .

the resemblance of this species is so close to p .
cornucopia , that it is quite useless to do more than point out the few points of difference .
valves of the capitulum and scales of the peduncle , coloured ( after having been in spirits , ) <unk> .
in a specimen in which the capitulum was <unk> of an inch in length , there were three whorls of valves below the <name> ; in this large specimen altogether there were about eighty valves ; in <unk> specimens , the number is about the same as in p .
cornucopia .
the upper latus , ( viewed internally , ) has an area about twice as large as that latus , which corresponds to the interspace between the <name> and terga ; whereas in p .
cornucopia the upper latus is only slightly larger than this same valve .
the apex of the basal internal margin of the <name> is here rounded , instead of being square , as is generally the case with p .
cornucopia .
the strong membranous margin of the orifice of the sack , in its upper part , is almost one third as wide as the widest part of the terga , whereas in p .
cornucopia it is only one fourth of this same width .
the peduncle apparently is rather longer , compared with p .
cornucopia , and the calcareous scales on it perhaps a little larger in proportion .
in a very young specimen , with the capitulum barely exceeding <unk> of an inch in length , i could distinguish the sub-rostrum , sub-carina , the upper , and some of the lower latera .
filamentary appendages.  these , in a <unk> specimen , are arranged on the prosoma in four longitudinal approximate rows , there being twelve in each row ; those in the two outer rows are only half the length of those in the two inner rows ; those nearest the thorax are the longest ; there are some <unk> outside the outer rows .
in a very large specimen with its capitulum <unk> in length , these filaments were very much more numerous , and some were placed on the first segment of the thorax , and at the bases of several of the posterior cirri .
some of the filaments are bifid , <unk> , and even branched .
in all the specimens , at the bases of the first pair of cirri , there are , on each side , a pair of filaments , ( one below the other , ) pointing upwards , less than half as long as those on the prosoma : also on each side of the mouth , there is a longer and thicker filament , pointing upwards , with a few very minute scattered spines on it ; the apices of these three pair of filaments , as well as of some of the others , are roughened with very minute pectinated scales .
all these filaments were gorged with the branching testes .
mouth.  the parts are closely similar to those in p .
cornucopia ; in the mandibles , the interspace between the third tooth and the inferior <name> , is slightly pectinated : in the maxillæ , there are six or eight pairs of spines between the two upper tufts of fine spines .
cirri.  these are in most respects similar , to those of p .
cornucopia .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had eighteen segments , the shorter ramus of the first pair had ten segments , of which the five lower segments were thick and clothed with doubly serrated spines .
in the second cirrus the anterior ramus had fifteen segments , of which the four basal ones were highly protuberant , and thickly clothed with spines .
these spines , and some on the third cirrus , and a few on the first cirrus , have peculiar bent teeth , presently to be described under p .
polymerus .
these singularly toothed spines are absent in p .
cornucopia .
from the above <name> , we see that the first and second pairs of cirri have more segments in proportion to the sixth pair , than in p .
cornucopia ; and in the second pair , a fewer proportional number of the basal segments are protuberant and thickly clothed with spines .
caudal appendages , shorter than the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , with only four articulations ; rather constricted near the base .
the ovigerous fræna consist of very long and prominent folds , thinning out to nothing towards the bases of the scuta , but not furnished , as far as i could see , with glands , and therefore not normally functional .
diagnosis with p. <unk>  the <unk> colour of the valves alone suffices .
there is a very slight difference , in the larger proportional size of the upper latera , and in the outline of the basal margin of the <name> .
in the maxillæ there is , in p .
elegans , a greater width between the two upper tufts of fine spines .
in the cirri , the segments in the first pair , are more than half as many as those in the sixth pair ; in the anterior ramus of the second pair , only <unk> of the segments are protuberant and <unk> , whereas in p .
cornucopia <unk> are in this condition .

capitulum , but little compressed , broad , with the scuta and terga placed in a more oblique direction , with respect to the peduncle , than is usual , so that the line of orifice forms an unusually small <name> with the basal margin of the capitulum .
the capitulum is composed of several whorls of valves , which gradually decrease in size from above downwards .
in a <unk> specimen there were four whorls under the rostrum ; in the lowest of these whorls , there were between eighty and ninety valves , and in the whole capitulum from one hundred and seventy , to one hundred and eighty .
the valves in the lower whorls are not of equal sizes .
viewed externally , the valves seem to touch and overlap each other ; viewed internally ( pl .
vii , fig .
2 a ) they are found to be just separated from each other by transparent membrane ; none of the valves are articulated together .
the outer surfaces of nearly all the valves , except in the two last formed whorls , are much disintegrated , and seem to be composed of alternate white and brown layers of shell .
the membrane connecting the valves , as well as that of the peduncle , ( in specimens long kept in spirits , ) is brown ; but in some dried specimens , there are indications of its having been coloured crimson ( as in p .
cornucopia ) , round the orifice and between the valves .
scuta , irregularly oval , convex , narrow at the upper end ; basal margin may be almost said to be formed of three short , unequal margins , corresponding with the rostrum , the rostral and the adjoining latus .
the edge corresponding with the latter , is the best marked , and is generally slightly hollowed out , as if a piece had been broken off .
the <unk> margin is curved and protuberant .
the umbo projects a little over the scutal margin of the terga .
terga , projecting beyond the other valves to an unusually small degree , broadly oval ; basal <name> bluntly pointed , apex rounded , blunt ; scutal margin , hollowed out to receive the upper part of the tergal margin of the scuta ; carinal margin curved and protuberant ; occludent margin consists of two short sides at right angles to each other .
the whole valve in length and area is about equal to the scuta ; internally , somewhat concave .
<name> , triangular , rather narrow , internally deeply concave , very slightly curled inwards ; basal margin protuberant , with a large central portion considerably hollowed out .
rostrum , triangular , of nearly the same shape as the <name> , but only one third of its length , internally very slightly concave , and with the basal margin various , being either truncated or <unk> prominent in the middle .
<unk>  the upper pair ( corresponding to the interval between the scuta and terga ) is only a trifle larger than the latera immediately beneath ; and these only a little larger than those lower down .
in the lowest whorl , the valves are very minute , though still about twice as large as the scales on the peduncle , and of a different shape from them .
the upper latera ( viewed internally ) are almost <unk> , owing to the prominence of the basal margin , but this varies considerably in degree .
the latera in the next whorl are triangular , with the basal margins protuberant and arched , in a less and less degree in the lower whorls , until in the lowest , the valves are elongated transversely .
microscopical <unk>  a valve placed in acid leaves a thick opaque mass , formed of three different kinds of tissue , one having a finely shaded appearance ; a second with a largely hexagonal <unk> structure , and the third thin , transparent , and marked with <unk> lines , which i imagine to be tubes , as <name> be hereafter seen in lithotrya .
near the exterior surface , there are many tubuli .
it appears to me probable that the strong tendency which the valves in this species have to disintegrate , is connected with the unusual quantity of <unk> tissue contained by them .
externally the valves are covered by a strong membrane , either white or yellow , or white streaked with yellow , and marked by lines of growth , and by longitudinal , sinuous , little ridges .
peduncle , in the upper part , of rather less diameter than the capitulum ; twice or thrice as long as it ; tapering a little downwards ; surface of attachment wide and flat .
calcareous scales , minute , symmetrically and closely packed together : each scale is much flattened , and its shape , including the imbedded portion , is that of a spear with its point broken off .
the basal end of each scale is <unk> hollow , and from the layers of growth <unk> to this hollow , there is a false appearance of an open tube running through the scale .
<unk>  the surface of attachment is wide : the two cement-ducts , after running down the sides of the peduncle in a sinuous course , within the longitudinal muscles and close outside the ovarian tubes , pass through the corium , and then separately form the most abrupt loops or folds .
these are represented in pl .
ix , fig .
2 , in which a space about <unk> of an inch square is given , as seen from the outside .
at each of the bends , an aperture has been formed through the membrane of the peduncle , and cement poured forth .
the manner in which the discs of cement ( b ) come out of the two ducts ( a a ) , and reach the external surface , is shown in the section , figure 2 a´ .
the two tubes are firmly attached to the older layers of membrane , and are covered by the <unk> layers .
in a young specimen , the cement-ducts were a little above <unk> of an inch in diameter , which had increased , in a <unk> specimen , to <unk> .
the <unk> are <unk> , seated near each other , high up in the peduncle .
size.  the largest specimen which i have seen , was three inches in length including the peduncle ; the capitulum was <unk> of an inch long , and one in width .
young <unk>  i examined one with a capitulum <unk> of an inch long , measured from the lowest whorl to the tips of the terga ; the width was only <unk> of an inch ; in old specimens the width of the capitulum is greater than the length .
the length of one of the scuta was <unk> of an inch , therefore , greater than the width of the entire capitulum , which is not the case with mature specimens .
besides the scuta and terga , the <name> and rostrum , and three pair of large latera , there was a lower whorl formed of ten or twelve valves , giving altogether to the capitulum of this very small specimen , either twenty-two or twenty-four valves .
shape of body , sack , colours , & c.  from the position of the orifice of the capitulum , the animal 's body is suspended to the scuta in a more transverse direction than is usual .
the prosoma is well-developed , and is distinctly separated from the three posterior thoracic segments , by a band of thin membrane .
the tunic of the basal part of the sack , where it enters the peduncle in a blunt point , is thickened and covered with roughened rounded <unk> .
the corium of the sack under the valves , is coloured ( after spirits ) so dark a brown as to be nearly black ; the cirri and trophi are similar , but with a tinge of <unk> .
filamentary appendages.  of these there were , on the prosoma of one specimen , twelve pairs , and in another specimen fourteen pairs , seated in two approximate rows ; the middle filaments are the longest , equalling about half the diameter of the thorax : each is flattened , and tapers but little towards its summit , which is roughened with microscopical crests serrated on both sides ; on the summit , also , there are a few bristles and some very short , thick , minute spines .
these appendages are directed rather towards each other , and towards the thorax .
i do not doubt that their <name> vary according to the size of the specimen .
i believe that they are occupied by testes .
outside these filaments , on each side of the prosoma , there are two very irregular rows of <unk> , intermediate in length between the filaments and the rounded <unk> at the bottom of the sack .
beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus , there is on each side , a short appendage , with a few bristles on its summit .
lastly , on each side of the middle of the mouth , on the prosoma , there is a longer appendage , dark-coloured , furnished with a few scattered bristles on its sides and apex , and directed upwards and a little towards the adductor scutorum muscle .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate , but with the uppermost part not more bullate than the lower part , and therefore not overhanging it ; basal margin much produced ; crest with some small blunt teeth and some bristles .
the inner fold of the labrum is much thickened , yellow , punctured , and with a tuft of fine bristles on each side .
palpi , approaching each other but not touching , <unk> , or with broad and square extremities , thickly fringed with serrated bristles .
mandibles with three unusually strong teeth , slightly graduated in size , with the inferior <name> very coarsely pectinated ; the lower edges of the main teeth are roughened .
maxillæ , ( pl .
x. fig .
13 ) .
spinose edge about half the length of the mandibles ; the two upper spines are unusually strong ; close under , and almost hidden by them , there is a tuft of fine spines ; in the middle there is a second similar tuft mounted on a prominence ; and at the inferior <name> there is a third tuft , also mounted on a rather wider prominence , not quite accurately figured .
in the interspaces between these tufts there are three or four pairs of spines of the usual appearance and projecting just beyond the fine tufts ; the upper of the two interspaces is rather narrower , but rather deeper , than the lower interspace .
<unk> very long , irregularly shaped , like an <unk> , with a remarkable elbow near its attachment ; apex slightly enlarged , thin and rounded .
outer <unk>  on the inner margin there is a deep and conspicuous notch , above and beneath which , there is a compact row of serrated bristles ; exteriorly the bristles are rather longer .
olfactory orifices very prominent , pointing obliquely towards each other .
cirri.  posterior cirri moderately long , much curled , with the segments ( pl .
x , fig .
27 ) flattened and wide ; the anterior surface <unk> protuberant , supporting six pairs of spines , of which the lower ones approach each other ; between these spines there is a large tuft of very fine spines , of which the central ones are the longest ; there is an upper lateral group of very short strong spines ; dorsal tufts composed of short , fine numerous spines .
first pair seated close to the second pair , short , having in both rami eight segments , whereas in the same individual the second pair , which is nearly twice as long , had thirteen , and the sixth pair eighteen segments .
rami of the first pair nearly equal in length , with their segments , excepting the two upper ones , thickly paved with bristles , in the midst of which a tuft of fine spines , as in the posterior cirri , may be distinguished ; the dorsal tufts <unk> the whole of each segment ; the <unk> anterior surfaces are protuberant chiefly in the upper part , so that they are oblique .
the posterior ( ? )
ramus has its segments much wider than those on the other ramus ; and amongst the common spines , in the third and fourth segments , ( counting from the bottom , ) there are some very strong spines with their upper ends coarsely and doubly pectinated , each tooth being <unk> bent into a rectangular elbow .
in the fifth segment , some of the spines are doubly pectinated with simple teeth ; and most of the spines are doubly serrated .
the second ( pl .
x , fig .
25 ) and third cirri have the five basal segments ( <unk> of the whole number in the second cirrus , and <unk> in the third cirrus ) of their anterior rami , extremely broad , protuberant , and paved with serrated bristles , amongst which , ( except on the actual lowest segment , ) there are some simply pectinated spines , and others with their teeth <unk> , exactly as in the first cirrus .
the basal segments of the posterior rami of the second and third cirri , differ from the three posterior cirri only in the spines being slightly more numerous ; but none of them are pectinated .
pedicels , rather short ; the upper segment resembles , in the arrangement of its spines , the segments of the posterior cirri ; the lower segment is longer than the upper , and has two tufts of fine spines , between the two rows of long spines .
in the second and third cirri , these two intermediate tufts on the lower segment of the pedicel , are not so distinctly separated from each other .
caudal appendages , very small , <unk> , blunt and rounded ; tips bearing a few , very short , thick spines .
alimentary <unk>  oesophagus , somewhat curved at the lower end , where it enters the stomach , which has no cæca ; <unk> , unusually short , extending from the anus only to the base of the fifth pair of cirri .
within the stomach , from top to bottom , there were thousands of a <unk> <unk> crustacean .
generative system.  both ovaria and testes are largely developed ; the former fill the long peduncle ; the testes enter both the pedicels of the cirri , and the filamentary appendages on the prosoma ; vesiculæ seminales very large , reflected at their ends , extending across each side of the stomach .
penis rather small , coloured purplish , with numerous little tufts of bristles .
<unk>  in some specimens in the british museum , collected by sir j. <name> , in the southern ocean , and in another older set from an unknown source , several parts of the outer tunic of the animal 's body presented the remarkable fact of being calcified , but to a variable degree ; whereas in several specimens from california , there was no vestige of this <unk> .
considering it most improbable that the <unk> of the integuments should be a variable character , i most carefully compared the above-mentioned sets of specimens , valve by valve , trophi by trophi , and cirri by cirri , and found no other difference of any kind ; therefore i can not hesitate to consider both to be the same species .
the first southern specimen which i examined presented the following characters : on the prosoma there was a central longitudinal band , formed of a thin , brittle , <unk> calcified layer , which became irregularly rather narrow towards the thorax ; on each side it sent out six or seven irregular rectangular plates , which surrounded and supported the bases of the two rows of filamentary appendages ; and outside these , some of the <unk> projections also had their bases surrounded by small , calcified , separate rings .
the thoracic segments corresponding with the second , fourth , fifth , and sixth cirri had , on each side , an elongated calcified plate ; on the ventral surface of the thorax , between the first and second cirri , there were two minute plates .
in all the cirri , excepting the first pair , the segments of the rami , and in the three posterior pairs , the segments of the pedicels , had their dorsal surfaces strengthened by oblong , quadrilateral , calcified shields , the upper margins of which are notched for the dorsal tufts of spine , and the two lateral margins are also slightly hollowed out ; these are represented in figure 27 .
the lower segments of the pedicels of some of the cirri , had an additional calcified plate on the <unk> face .
these plates are of a <unk> or yellowish colour , and are conspicuous : the degree of <unk> differs considerably ; some are quite brittle and very thin , others half horny , and <unk> only slightly in acids .
after having been placed in acid , there is no apparent difference between the parts before occupied by the calcified plates and the surrounding membrane ; these plates , however , are not superficial , but consist of several of the laminæ , which together compose the ordinary integument , in a calcified condition .
like the integuments of the body , and unlike the valves of the capitulum , these calcified plates are thrown off at each exuviation .
neither the exact shape nor number of the plates corresponded in different individuals , nor even on opposite sides of the same individual .
the margins of the plates often have a sinuous corroded appearance ; they are , moreover , often penetrated by minute rounded holes , that is , by minute , rounded , <unk> portions .
in one specimen from the antarctic expedition , there were only here and there a single shield on the segments of the posterior rami , and no plate on the prosoma .
of two specimens in another and older set in the british museum , from an unknown locality , both had shields on the segments of the cirri , but only one had the large plate on the prosoma .
i may here mention that in one specimen , in which the calcified plates were most developed , and which was nearly ready to moult , there were , within the filamentary appendages on the prosoma , small irregular balls of calcareous matter , appearing to me as if calcareous matter had been <unk> excreted , and not like a provision for the future .
<unk>  this species , in the present state of our knowledge , seems to range further than any other of the genus , extending from upper california , ( lat .
<unk> to <unk> n. , ) across the pacific , to at least <unk> s. , perhaps much farther south , for it was collected during the antarctic expedition , and <unk> was the highest latitude traversed by that expedition .
affinities.  this species is closely related to p .
cornucopia and p .
elegans , but differs rather more from them , than these two do from each other .
in the capitulum the chief distinctive characters are  the more perfect graduation in size , and the greater number , ( taking <unk> specimens , ) of the whorls of latera  the darker colours  the central part of the basal margin of the <name> in this species , being considerably <unk>  the peculiar form of the basal margin of the scuta  and lastly , the scutal margin of the terga being more hollowed out .
in the animal 's body , the most obvious distinctive character is the <unk> caudal appendage .
this species agrees with p .
elegans , in the presence of the singular <unk> teeth , on some of the spines in the first three pairs of cirri .

capitulum , compressed , consisting of the scuta , terga , <name> , rostrum , and a large pair of upper latera , with a single lower whorl of smaller valves ; these latter vary from 22 in very small specimens , to 26 in large specimens .
the capitulum , therefore , is formed of at most 34 valves ; but in the largest specimen seen by me , the capitulum being <unk> of an inch in width , there were only 32 valves .
in the smallest , namely , with a capitulum <unk> of an inch in width , there were 30 valves .
the valves are remarkably strong , and formed of white <name> matter ; they are closely approximate , and overlap each other : the scuta and terga are articulated together by a fold ; the apices of the valves are either worn and disintegrated , or they project freely like horns beyond the sack , to a much greater extent than in any other recent species of the genus : even a considerable portion of the scuta projects obliquely upwards .
the exterior surfaces of the valves ( when not worn ) are covered by a strong yellow membrane , and the upper free parts are generally attached together for some little length by this same membrane .
the valves are plainly marked by the zones of successive growth ; and most of them are ribbed and furrowed slightly , from their umbones to their basal margins .
the yellow external membrane , examined <unk> , is marked by , or rather formed of , numerous <unk> , crossed by longitudinal <unk> ridges .
the tubuli are not numerous , and of small diameter .
scuta ( pl .
vii , fig .
3 a´ , a ) triangular , with the apex more or less produced , according to the state of its preservation , and a little curved towards the terga ; basal margin , and in some degree the <unk> margin , arched , and slightly protuberant ; occludent margin thickened , slightly prominent , with the inner edge covered by the yellow membrane , like the exterior surface of the valve .
the upper part of the <unk> margin <unk> a little the edge of the tergum , and receives it in a furrow ,  the two valves being thus locked together .
this furrow lies in the <unk> , <unk> portion , and extends up to the apex ; it is of variable depth .
internally the scuta are concave , and in some old specimens to a high degree .
in these latter , the basal margin , towards the <unk> side , is strongly sinuous ; the prominences are formed by the terminations of the external longitudinal ridges , and correspond to the interspaces between the valves of the lower whorl .
these ridges , which are interesting , from throwing light on similar ridges in some fossil species , are present , both on old and young specimens , and run from the apex of the valve , in a slightly curved line , to the <unk> half of the basal margin , where , as we have just seen , they sometimes form prominences .
they consist of three or even four obscure , almost confluent , ridges , of which the middle one is generally ( but not always ) the smallest : together they cover the whole of that part of the scutum , which is not <unk> along the basal margin by the rostrum and large upper latus ; and they seem evidently due to the growth of the shell in this interspace having been freer .
so , again , the three or four small , confluent , component ridges have the same relation to the interspaces between the small latera of the lower whorl .
terga large , <unk> , with the internal growing surface ( fig .
3 a´ b ) , almost <unk> ; basal <name> blunt , rounded ; exteriorly , from the apex to the basal <name> there is a rather broad , very slight prominence , which bears the same relation to the <name> and upper latus , as do the compound ridges on the scuta to the rostrum and upper latus .
the upper part of the scutal margin forms a <unk> , rounded shoulder , though variable in its degree of prominence , in relation to the variable depth of the recipient furrow in the scuta .
externally , parallel to the occludent margin , and close below the prominent shoulder , just mentioned , there is a slight and variable depression , extending up to the apex of the valve .
this depression is due to the prominence , variable in degree , of the tergal edge of the recipient furrow in the scuta .
<name> , triangular , strong , inwardly bowed , generally with a large upper portion freely projecting ; exteriorly with a narrow , sharp , central ridge or keel , which is solid , the interior concavity not reaching so deep ; inner growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ , b ) deeply concave , triangular .
basal margin square  that is , transverse to the longer axis of the <name> , or it even rises ( as is best seen in the <unk> ) a little towards the exterior keel .
on each side of the central exterior keel , there is a narrow longitudinal ridge , corresponding with the interspace between the sub-carina and the <unk> latus of the lower whorl ; the latus next to the sub-carina is very small , and <unk> the ridge itself .
in a very large specimen , these lateral longitudinal ridges formed ( as they likewise did on the rostrum ) slight prominences on the basal margin .
in one specimen the <name> was straight .
rostrum closely similar , in almost every respect , to the <name> , even to the exterior , lateral , longitudinal ridges , and in their relation to the interspaces in the lower whorl .
the valve is generally not so long , but rather wider , more inwardly bowed , and with the exterior solid keel less prominent than in the <name> .
the inner growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ d ) is less acuminated at its upper end .
upper pair of <unk>  these are much larger than the remaining valves of the lower whorl ; they are straight , triangular , and much acuminated , with their apices , when well preserved , extending far up , for fully three fourths of the height of the scuta .
they nearly equal in length the <name> .
the growing surface ( fig .
3 b´ , a ) is flat , triangular , in <unk> specimens forming only a third or a quarter of the entire length of the valve .
in the middle of the basal margin there is a very slight prominence , corresponding with a slight external central ridge , formed as heretofore by the overlapping of two of the valves of the lower whorl .
basal margin nearly on a level with that of the scuta and with the basal points of the terga .
the foregoing eight larger valves form the main cavity , in which the body of the animal is lodged .
valves of the lower <unk>  these , seen externally , seem to belong to more than one whorl , but internally their basal margins stand on a level .
they vary in number , as already stated , from 22 to 26 .
i have seen an individual with a valve more on one side than on the other .
they are of unequal sizes , but they are rather variable in this respect : the largest are not above half the size of the upper latera : three or four pairs , together with the sub-rostrum ( e ) and sub-carina ( c ) , are always larger than the others : these two latter valves differ from the others only in being more concave .
seen externally , all these valves project considerably , and curl a little inwards , with their apices generally worn and truncated .
viewed internally ( fig .
3 b´ ) , whilst the valves are in their proper places , the inner and growing surfaces of the smallest are seen to be triangular ,  of the larger , some are <unk> , and others quadrilateral with the upper side much longer than the lower .
these latter valves overlap the upper parts of the little valves on both sides of them ; the <unk> valves overlap a valve on one side , and are <unk> on the other ; the triangular valves are <unk> on both sides .
the corium lining the capitulum is produced into narrow purple crests , which enter the interstices between the valves , more especially along the line separating the upper and lower whorls .
there is , also , a distinct flattened , tapering , free projection of corium , which enters between the <name> and sub-carina ; and another between the rostrum and sub-rostrum .
peduncle , much compressed , short , rarely as long as the capitulum ; in one very large specimen it was extremely short , barely one fifth of the length of the capitulum .
the attached portion , which is moderately pointed in young specimens , becomes extremely broad in old specimens .
the calcified scales sometimes differ a little in size , in specimens of the same age : they are always compactly and symmetrically arranged : in old specimens they are much larger than in young ones : each scale has , at first , a transversely elliptic growing base , which ultimately becomes nearly circular .
exteriorly the tips of the scales are always disintegrated ; they are sometimes <unk> , owing to the scales having been <unk> to after a period of reduced growth .
the scales are fringed with brown <unk> membrane .
<unk>  at the base of the peduncle , the two cement-ducts running together , twist about in a singular manner , and at their bends pour forth cement .
according to the age of the specimen , the ducts vary in diameter from <unk> to <unk> of an inch .
the two cement glands are small and difficult to find ; they are <unk> , with two ovarian tubes entering each .
they lie close together , in nearly the centre of the peduncle , and less than half-way down it .
this proximity of the two <unk> , and their position low down the peduncle , are of interest in relation to the position of these same glands in the sessile cirripedes .
size and <unk>  this is the largest and most massive species in the family .
i have seen one specimen in the british museum , from the coast of <name> , <unk> inches across the capitulum , and 1.5 in length , with the valves surprisingly thick .
the relative width and length of the capitulum varies .
the sack ( in specimens long kept in spirits ) is dirty purple , and exteriorly between the scuta , dark purple .
the cirri , trophi , penis , caudal appendages , three posterior segments of the thorax , and the abdominal surface are <unk> purple .
<unk>  thorax remarkably compressed and <unk> ; prosoma pretty well developed .
extending from the base of the second cirrus , to nearly a central line on the thorax , there is on each side a rounded ridge : there is a second transverse ridge , running from the base of the first cirrus to near the adductor scutorum muscle : these ridges seem formed merely to allow of the larger development of the testes .
mouth.  labrum highly bullate ; crest without any teeth , but with a few minute hairs .
the inner fold of the labrum forming the supra-oesophageal cavity , is thickened , and shows a trace of a central line of junction , as in sessile cirripedes .
palpi ( pl .

mandibles ( pl .

1 ) , with five teeth , of which the second is very small ; inferior <name> coarsely pectinated .
maxillæ ( fig .
14 ) , with a deep narrow notch ( bearing some fine spines ) beneath the two upper great spines , which stand on a prominence ; edge straight , bearing fourteen or fifteen pairs of spines : on the inferior <name> there is an obscure tuft of shorter and finer spines : <unk> long , sinuous , and slender .
outer maxillæ ( fig .
17 ) , with the inner margin divided by a deep notch into two lobes , of which the upper one is rather short ; both are clothed with a compact row of short bristles ; exterior margin with longer bristles .
olfactory orifices , large and prominent to an unusual degree .
cirri , moderately long and curled ; the four posterior pair are alike ; each segment has its anterior face somewhat protuberant , and bears six pairs of long spines , with a rather large , narrow tuft of intermediate spines , some of which are finely and doubly serrated .
the dorsal tufts consist of short , thick spines , with some fine longer ones .
the first cirrus is seated near the second ; its rami are slightly unequal in length ; lower segments paved with bristles ; one ramus is thicker than the other , and some of its segments have coarsely pectinated spines .
second cirrus has the five basal segments of its anterior ramus highly protuberant , and paved with bristles , of which some are coarsely pectinated ; the basal segments of the posterior ramus are rather more thickly clothed with bristles than are the posterior cirri , but otherwise resemble them .
the third cirrus , as already stated , is exactly like the three posterior pairs ; and this is a very unusual circumstance .
on the dorsal surfaces and sides of the pedicels of the posterior cirri , there are some scattered , short , thick , minute spines .
caudal appendages , <unk> : in a <unk> specimen , each contained eight segments , which reached half-way up the upper segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
lower segments flattened ; the upper , tapering , and cylindrical ; all have their upper margins furnished with stiff , little spines .
in a young specimen ( only <unk> of an inch in length , including the peduncle ) , the caudal appendage contained only four segments , and the tip did not reach to the upper edge of the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .
stomach , without cæca .
generative system.  vesiculæ seminales not reflexed at their broad ends ; white , spotted with black .
testes , pear-shaped , borne on long footstalks : penis covered with minute bristles , in little tufts arranged in straight lines .
the ovarian tubes fill up the peduncle to its base , but do not surround the sack ; they are of small diameter , and simply branched .
there is a very narrow ovigerous <unk> , with a straight edge , lying on each side under the line of junction between the scutum and upper latus .
affinities.  this species differs from all the others of the genus , in the third cirrus resembling exactly the three posterior pairs .
in most of its characters  namely , in the symmetrical arrangement of the scales on the peduncle , in the considerable size of the valves of the lower whorl , in the general approximation of the valves , in the <unk> caudal appendages , in the form of the outer maxillæ , in the prominent olfactory orifices , in the basal segments of the anterior ramus alone of the second cirrus being paved with bristles , there is more affinity to p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus than to p .
sertus and p .
spinosus .
in the scuta and terga being articulated together , in the union of all the valves by stiff membrane , in the peculiar manner in which the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other , in the corium entering between some of the valves in <unk> appendages , in the near equality of size of the rostrum and <name> , in the shortness of the peduncle in old specimens , in the position of the <unk> , and lastly in the characters of the third pair of cirri , this species presents a closer affinity to the sessile cirripedes , more especially to the <unk> , than does any other species of any other genus amongst the lepadidæ .
the movements , however , of the four <unk> valves are not at all more independent of the other valves , than in the other pedunculated cirripedes ; and the peduncle is furnished with all its characteristic muscles .

capitulum , flattened , triangular , broad , with the valves varying in number , in full-grown specimens of the same size , from 30 to above 60 ; the scuta , terga , and <name> are very much larger than the other valves ; the rostrum , however , is nearly half the size of the <name> ; the remaining valves are exceedingly small .
in some specimens there is only one whorl under the <name> ; in other specimens there are distinctly two whorls .
the scuta , terga , and <name> stand pretty close together ; they are moderately thick , and are covered , in chief part , by yellowish-brown membrane , which is destitute of spines .
scuta , triangular , broad , basal margin slightly protuberant .
terga , as large as the scuta , flat , regularly oval , basal point blunt and rounded .
<name> very slightly curved , triangular , internally rather deeply concave , basal margin straight .
the inner and growing surface is four <unk> of the entire length of the valve .
in half-grown specimens the apex projects a little outwards .
rostrum , small , much curled inwards ; the basal margin is much hollowed out ; the inner surface is broadly triangular , more than twice as wide as high , and about one fourth of the entire length of the valve .
the remaining valves , about 26 in number , do not correspond on the opposite sides of the same individual , they are exceedingly small , with the sub-carina , sub-rostrum , and three pairs of latera a trifle larger than the lower latera , which are generally arranged in two whorls .
in shape all the latera are nearly alike ; they consist of flattened styles , with their inner surfaces transversely oval , and more or less elongated , the larger ones being most elongated .
peduncle , broad , barely as long as the capitulum .
the calcareous scales are irregularly shaped , minute , elongated and pointed , placed in separate transverse rows , and crowded together in each row .
only the scales in the uppermost row grow regularly ; but some of the lower scales continue to be added to irregularly , and hence are the largest .
on the other hand , the lower part of the peduncle , from the first formed scales having been worn away , is often quite naked .
from this cause , and from the continued and irregular growth of some of the lower scales , the rows in this part of the peduncle , generally become irregular .
the surface of attachment is broad .
in a half-grown specimen , with a capitulum only <unk> of an inch long , all the lower valves were considerably larger in proportion to the scuta , terga , and <name> , than in full-grown individuals .
size and <unk>  length of capitulum in the largest specimen , <unk> of an inch ; breadth , slightly exceeding the length .
colours after having been long in spirits  upper part of sack , thorax , pedicels of cirri , and penis , clouded with fine purple ; cirri banded with the same ; exterior convex surface of the outer and inner maxillæ and palpi dark purple ; prosoma yellow .
the membrane of the peduncle and of the capitulum is dirty yellow , with bands of purple between some of the valves .
filamentary appendages , none .
ovigerous fræna placed near the middle of the basal margin of the scuta ; small , <unk> , with an <unk> ring of bead-like glands ; glands seated on long footstalks .
mouth.  labrum far produced towards the adductor muscle ; upper part highly bullate , nearly equalling the longitudinal diameter of the rest of the mouth , and very slightly overhanging the lower part ; crest with very minute bead-like teeth .
palpi , with their inner margins considerably <unk> , most thickly clothed with spines .

outer maxillæ , with the bristles in front , continuous , and without any notch ; exterior surface with a prominence clothed with long spines .
olfactory orifices slightly prominent .
cirri.  first cirrus placed near to the second ; posterior cirri not much elongated , with their segments slightly protuberant , bearing four pairs of spines , of which the lower pair is small ; spines slightly serrated .
in the lower segments , these spines are exceedingly unequal in length , the inner spines on both rami , not being above one fourth of the length of the outer corresponding spine in each pair .
the tufts intermediate between these pairs , are not very large : on the lateral upper rims there are some strong , short spines : dorsal tufts with short , thick spines .
first cirrus about three fourths as long as the second cirrus , with numerous tapering segments , three or four of the lower ones being thick and protuberant : in the first cirrus there are eleven segments , and in the sixth cirrus , seventeen .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus slightly thicker than the posterior ramus : a few of the basal segments of both rami are protuberant , and thickly clothed with spines .
in the third cirrus , the two rami are nearly equally thick , with some of the basal segments in both clothed , like a brush , with spines .
in these brushes on the first , second , and third cirri , most of the spines are doubly toothed , each tooth being simply conical .

capitulum , much flattened , broad , sub-triangular .
valves exceedingly various in number ; in the largest specimen with a capitulum <unk> of an inch high , and <unk> of an inch wide , there were only thirty-one valves , and these formed only a single whorl under the <name> and rostrum ; whereas , in another specimen , which was barely <unk> of an inch in length , there were fifty-two valves , and these formed two or three distinct whorls under the <name> .
scuta , terga , <name> , and rostrum , much larger than the other valves .
all are moderately thick , placed rather distant from each other , covered with thick membrane which abounds with tubuli , arranged in rows ; surface apparently smooth , but with a very high power , extremely minute spines can be seen at the extremities of almost all the tubuli .
little bunches of reddish fibrous matter are imbedded in the membrane , like tufts of sea-weed floating in water .
scuta , triangular , basal margin curved , protuberant ; the upper part of the <unk> margin is , also , slightly protuberant .
terga , large , oval , basal <name> broad , square ; lower part of carinal margin straight , upper part narrowed in ; the apex is covered with membrane and projects freely .
<name> , triangular , internally deeply concave , either straight , and with the apex free , or inwardly and considerably curved ; basal margin nearly straight .
rostrum , about half the length of the <name> ; either straight or inwardly curved ; it projects freely for full half its length ; inner growing surface triangular , more than twice as high as wide ; basal margin very slightly hollowed out .
the sub-carina and sub-rostrum are larger than the largest of the latera ; their inner surfaces are transversely elongated , rounded at both ends , and slightly concave ; externally they are pointed , and project outwards ; sometimes the sub-carina , and sometimes the sub-rostrum is the largest .
latera , small , with their inner surfaces transversely elongated , the larger being the most elongated .
externally they are acuminated , and directed upwards ; they project but very little beyond the thick membrane in which they are imbedded .
neither the number , size , nor shape of the latera agree on opposite sides of the same individual ; and it would appear that , occasionally , some of them cease to grow , and disappear .
in the large specimen with only thirty-one valves , the three pairs of latera , corresponding to the upper , rostral , and carinal latera in scalpellum , were larger in a marked manner than the others ; but in the specimen with fifty-four valves , this could hardly be said to be the case .
in this latter specimen , some of the valves in the <unk> whorl were exceedingly minute .
peduncle , broad , about as long as the capitulum ; surface of attachment wide ; calcareous scales minute , placed in transverse rows , which become less and less regular in the lower part .
the scales do not stand very close together ; they are of unequal sizes and irregular outline ; generally <unk> ; calcareous matter is added regularly only to the scales in the uppermost row , and irregularly to some of the lower scales .
the latter , consequently , are the largest , and often much elongated ; they are sometimes of singular and irregular shapes .

filamentary appendages , none , but on the prosoma there are scattered some small <unk> , which are roughened by finely spinose scales , like combs ; these <unk> certainly seem to represent the filaments in pollicipes cornucopia and its two allies .

affinities.  this species makes a very close approach in the general form and relative sizes of all the valves , and in the variability of the number of the whorls , to p .
spinosus ; there is a still closer and more important resemblance , in the inequality and manner of growth of the calcareous scales on the peduncle .
these species differ , in the colour of the membrane covering the valves , and in the greater development of both rostrum and sub-rostrum in p .
sertus .
the rostrum of the latter is longer than half the length of the <name> , and its inner surface is more than twice as high as wide ; and the sub-rostrum is twice as large as any of the latera ,  all points of difference from p. spinosus .
in the characters of the mandibles , and more especially of the outer maxillæ ; in the length of the first pair of cirri ; in both rami of the second and third cirri having their basal segments <unk> , with pectinated spines ; and in the shape of the caudal appendages , there is a close relationship to p .
spinosus , and through this species to scalpellum villosum .
in the little prominence of the olfactory orifices , p. sertus differs from most of the allied forms , excepting p .
spinosus .
in the maxillæ having two prominences bearing fine tufts of bristles , in the roughened knobs on the prosoma , and in the presence , in some individuals , of two or three whorls of valves under the <name> and rostrum , there is a marked tendency in p .
sertus to approach p .
cornucopia , p .
elegans , and p .
polymerus .

[ 65 ] the description of <unk> is so inaccurate , that i should not have recognised it , had not the lithotrya nicobarica , in a bottle in the british museum , borne this name .

peduncle covered with small calcareous scales , those of the upper whorls <unk> ; attached either to a basal calcareous cup , or to a row of discs .
body lodged within the peduncle : mandibles with three teeth , the interspaces being pectinated ; maxillæ various : olfactory orifices slightly prominent : caudal appendages <unk> .
lodged in cavities , bored in calcareous rocks , or shells , or corals ; generally within the tropics .
<unk>  the capitulum is not much compressed , a horizontal section giving an oval figure ; it is placed obliquely on the peduncle , the scuta descending lower than the terga and <name> .
there are eight valves , of which the scuta , terga , and <name> are large ; the rostrum and a pair of latera are very small and often rudimentary .
these three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle , the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size , by not being moulted at each period of exuviation .
the latera <unk> the carinal half of the terga ; i presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in scalpellum .
each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick , and extends over nearly the whole inner surface ; hence the <name> and terga , and to a certain extent the scuta , either actually do project freely much beyond the sack , or would have done so , had not their upper ends been removed ; for the upper and old layers of shell , in most of the species , either scale off or disintegrate and wear away .
a rectangularly projecting rim , serrated by small teeth , is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth , along the external surfaces of each valve ( see upper part of fig .
1 b´ pl .
viii . )
this structure , as well as that of the <unk> scales on the peduncle , is important , for by this means the animal , as we shall presently see , forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded .
the scutum <unk> either about one third or even one half of the entire width of the tergum , and <unk> against a prominent longitudinal ridge on its exterior surface .
in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> , this ridge on the tergum being folded over towards the scutum , forms a conspicuous furrow , receiving the tergal margin of the latter .
in l .
<unk> , there is a second furrow on the carinal side of the tergum , receiving the upper end of the <unk> or growing surface of the <name> .
besides these provisions for holding together the valves , there are , apparently , others for a similar purpose ; thus in each scutum , under the rostral <name> , there is a roughened <unk> tooth , which touches the under side of the little rostrum , and no doubt serves to give attachment to the membrane uniting the three valves together .
in some species , the adjoining basal margins of the scuta and terga , where touching each other , are inflected and roughened ; again in l .
rhodiopus , the carinal angles of the terga are produced into points , and in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> into prominent roughened knobs , which touch two corresponding small knobs , on the upper part of the growing surface of the <name> .
moreover , considerable portions of the inner surfaces of the scuta and terga , are roughened with minute sharp , <unk> points , apparently for the firmer attachment of the corium .
the roughened knobs at the rostral angles of the scuta , no doubt are homologous with the teeth in a similar position on one or both scuta in lepas , and in some fossil species of pollicipes , as in p .
<unk> .
the other projections and roughened surfaces are peculiar to lithotrya .
the growth of all the valves is , as in pollicipes , simply downwards .
the scuta are triangular , with their umbones or centres of growth at the apex ; the tergal margin , as seen from within , is either nearly straight or much hollowed out , accordingly as the scuta simply overlap the terga , or are received in a furrow .
in some of the species there is a distinct pit for the adductor muscle , and in others this can not be distinguished .
<unk>  these present great differences in shape ; but all appear to be modifications , ( as seen internally , ) of a <unk> figure , which seems to be the normal form of the terga in the lepadidæ .
of the lower part of the valve , the whole exterior surface , with the exception of a narrow ridge running from the apex down to the basal <name> , is hidden by the overlapping of the scuta , latera , and <name> .
the <name> , in outline is triangular , with the basal margin in some species extremely protuberant .
in the first four species , the internal surface is concave , in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> it is convex , with a central raised ridge , and consequently the upper <unk> portion of the valve , has a prominent central crest or ridge ; in l .
nicobarica and l .
rhodiopus there is only a trace of this ridge .
the rostrum , as before stated , is always very small ; it , as well as the latera , are most developed in l .
nicobarica , and least in l .
truncata and l .
<unk> ; generally only a few zones of growth are preserved , and from their being enlarged at their basal serrated rims , the rostrum sometimes appears like a few beads of a necklace strung together .
the latera are remarkable from being placed over the carinal half of the terga , in an oblique position , parallel to the lower carinal margin of the terga .
a section , parallel to the growth layers , varies in the different species from elliptic to broadly oval , and in l .
nicobarica it is triangular .
only a few layers of growth are ever preserved .
in l .
truncata , where the latera are represented by mere <unk> , ( like strings of beads ) , and are even less in width than the rostrum , they are imperfectly calcified .
microscopical structure of the <unk>  the <name> layers are white , and generally separate easily , so that in l .
dorsalis it is rare to find a specimen with the upper part of the valves perfect .
the valves are so translucent , that in the thin margins , even the tubuli could be sometimes distinguished .
the valves are coated by strong yellow membrane , which , after the <name> matter in l .
dorsalis had been dissolved in acid , separated into broad slips , answering to each zone of growth .
on the lower margin of each slip , there is a row of closely approximate spines , generally slightly hooked , pointed , <unk> of an inch in length , and <unk> of an inch in diameter ; they arise out of a little fold ; all are furnished with tubuli of the same diameter with themselves , running through the whole thickness of the <name> layers , and attached , apparently , by their apices , to the underlying corium .
as the spines are very numerous , so are the parallel rows of tubuli .
after the <name> layers had been dissolved , there was left in l .
dorsalis ( well seen in the latera ) , an extraordinary , <unk> mass of branching , jointed , excessively thin tubes , sometimes slightly enlarged at the articulations , and appearing to contain brown granular matter : other portions of the valves , instead of this appearance , exhibited membranes or films with similar , branching , articulated tubes or vessels attached to them : i have not seen this appearance in any other cirripede .
the yellow exterior enveloping membrane , with its spines , is present in all the species of the genus ; in l .
rhodiopus these spines are much larger than in l .
dorsalis , and on the inner sides of the <name> they are <unk> and quadrifid , and large enough to be conspicuous with a lens of weak power .
<unk>  the most remarkable fact concerning this part , is that the outer tunic , together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered , is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth .
i demonstrated this fact in l .
dorsalis and l .
truncata , by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath ; and as these two species , ( i obtained , also , pretty good evidence in l .
nicobarica , ) are at the opposite extremes of the genus , no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus .
i know of no other instance , amongst cirripedia , in which calcified valves or scales are moulted .
i am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece ; though this almost certainly is the case with the uppermost and lowest portions .
the animal 's body is partly lodged within the peduncle , which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum , and in the upper part is fully as broad as it .
the scales with which it is clothed , extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves .
the scales of the upper whorl , or of the two or three upper whorls ( pl .
viii , figs .
1 b´ and 3 d ) are larger than those below ; and these latter rapidly decrease in size , so as to become low down on the peduncle , almost or quite invisible to the naked eye .
the scales in each whorl , are placed alternately with those in the whorls , above and below .
all the upper scales are packed rather closely together ; those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral ; those in the few next succeeding whorls , are triangular , with their basal margins protuberant and arched ; the scales , low down on the peduncle , stand some way apart from each other , and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads , of which some of the smallest in l .
dorsalis were only <unk> of an inch in diameter .
in the lowest part of the peduncle these scales , after each fresh exuviation , are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity ; hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked .
this same part , however , is furnished with nail or rather <unk> little projections of hard , yellow , horny chitine ( fig .
3 e ) .
the <name> on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points ; one <name> which i measured was <unk> of an inch in total width , the footstalk being only <unk> of an inch in diameter ; the whole projected <unk> of an inch above the surface of the peduncle ; from the footstalk a fine <unk> runs through the membrane to the underlying corium .
these <unk> little points are often much worn down ; in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation , there remained , in the lower part , close above the basal calcareous cup , only some hard , smooth , yellow , little discs , on a level with the general surface of the membrane ,  these being the intersected or worn down footstalks , with every trace of the calcareous beads gone .
but in this same specimen , under the old <unk> membrane , there was a new one , studded with the usual circular calcareous beads , slightly unequal in size , generally about <unk> of an inch in diameter , and each furnished with a <unk> ; but as yet none of the <unk> points of chitine had been formed .
i believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads , and , therefore , are formed directly under them .
in l .
<unk> the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in l .
dorsalis , giving a <unk> appearance to it , and all of them are serrated ( fig .
3 d ) round their entire margins .
generally only the scales in the uppermost , or in the three or four upper rows are serrated , and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins .
the state of the serrated edge varies extremely in the same species , from elongated conical teeth to mere notches , according to the amount of wear and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation ; so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum .
each scale has a fine <unk> passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its <unk> imbedded <unk> or base .
the membrane is transparent , thin , and tender , to a degree i have not seen equalled in the other lepadidæ , except , perhaps , in ibla .
it is much wrinkled transversely .
muscles of the <unk>  these consist of the usual interior and longitudinal ,  exterior and transverse  and oblique <unk> ; the former are unusually strong ; downwards they are attached to the basal calcareous cup or disc , and upwards they extend all round to the lower curved margins of the valves .
they are , as usual , without transverse striæ .
besides these , there are , ( at least in l .
dorsalis and l .
nicobarica , ) two little fans of <unk> muscles , which occur in no other pedunculated cirripede ; they are attached on each side of the central line of the <name> , near its base ; they extend transversely and a little upwards , and each fan <unk> to a point where the lower margins of the <name> and terga touch ; of these muscles , the upper <unk> are the longest .
their action , i conceive , must be either to draw slightly together the basal points of the terga , and so serve to open their occludent margins , or to draw inwards the base of the <name> : these muscles apparently first shadow forth the posterior or carinal , <unk> , <unk> muscles of sessile cirripedes .
basal calcareous cup or <unk>  i have seen this part in all the species , except l .
<unk> , and in this it probably occurs , considering its very close alliance with l .
truncata .
the size , form , and conditions of the cup or disc varies infinitely according to the age , size , and position of the individual specimen .
we <name> commence with a full-sized animal , which has ceased to burrow downwards into the rock , in which case the discs usually grow into a cup , and become largely developed .
in l .
dorsalis alone , i have seen many specimens , so that the following description and remarks , though applicable i believe to all the species , are drawn up from that alone .
the cup ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 a´ , 1 <unk> ) is hardly ever regular in outline , and is either slightly or very deeply concave ; i have seen one , half an inch in diameter ; it is formed of several thick layers of dirty white , translucent , calcareous matter , with sinuous margins ; externally the surface is very irregular , and is coated by yellow membrane presently to be described .
the innermost and <unk> layer sometimes covers the whole inside of the cup , and extends a little beyond its margin all round ; but more generally it projects beyond only one side , leaving the other sides deserted .
i have seen a single new layer extending beyond the underlying old layers , as much as one sixth of an inch ; and again i have seen a part of the cup , as much as a quarter of an inch in width , deserted and covered with <unk> .
so irregular , however , is the growth , that after a period an old deserted portion <name> occasionally be again covered by a new layer , though of course without organic adhesion .
again it sometimes happens that the <unk> layer , remaining central , is very much less than the older layers ; in one such instance the innermost and <unk> layer ( fig .
1 a´ ) had a diameter of only a quarter of that of the whole cup , in the middle of which it was placed ; the cup thus tends to become filled up in the middle .
the cup , in its fully developed condition , is seated at the very bottom of the cavity in the rock .
from the aggregate thickness of the several component layers forming the cup , the old and mature animal rises a little in its burrow ; for instance , the bottom of the cup in one specimen which i measured , was <unk> of an inch in thickness .
in a younger condition , before the animal has bored down to the full depth , and whilst the cavity is only of moderate diameter , the lower part of the peduncle , instead of being attached to the inside of a cup , adheres to small , irregular , nearly flat , calcareous discs , overlapping each other like tiles ( figs .
1 , 2 a´ ) .
they are placed one below the other , generally in a straight line , and are attached firmly to one side of the burrow .
the discs are oval , or rounded , or irregular , and are commonly from <unk> to <unk> of an inch across : they usually form a quite straight ribbon , widening a little downwards : each little disc <unk> and extends beyond the one last formed , fully half its own diameter .
i have seen one row of discs an inch in length , but the upper discs are always worn away by the friction of the calcified serrated scales on the peduncle .
it is very important to observe that the lowest disc is not fixed , ( as was the case with the cup , ) at the very bottom of the burrow , but on one side , just above the bottom , which latter part is occupied by the blunt basal end of the peduncle .
in a valuable paper on l .
nicobarica , by <unk> , presently to be referred to , the disc is said to be attached on the carinal side ( see fig .
2 ) of the peduncle ; and this , i believe , is general .
i have seen one instance in which , during the excavation of a new burrow , an old burrow was met with , and the row of discs turned down it , making , with their previous course , nearly a <unk> .
in another similar instance , the discs , instead of turning down , became very large and broad , and so fairly formed a bridge across the old burrow ( fig .
1 ) ,  becoming narrow again as soon as the animal recommenced burrowing into the solid rock .
sometimes , as it appears , the animal , whilst still small , from some unknown cause , stops burrowing downwards , and then a cup is formed at the bottom of the hole .
as soon as the animal has got to its full depth , the burrow increases only in diameter , and during this process the linear row of discs is ground away and lost ; a cup is then formed .
the little discs can be deposited or formed only at each fresh exuviation ; and as some of the burrows are above two inches in depth , and as on an average each disc does not extend beyond the underlying disc more than <unk> of an inch , an animal which has bored two inches in depth , must have moulted at least thirty times .
i may here remark that i have reason to believe , from some interesting observations made by mr. w. thompson , of belfast , that some sessile cirripedes moult about every fortnight .
internal structure of the <unk>  when the cup is dissolved in acid , each <name> layer is represented by a rather tough , <unk> membrane , itself composed of numerous fine laminæ , which , under a one-eighth of an inch object glass , exhibit generally only the appearance of a <unk> drawing ; but there often were layers of branching vessels , ( like <unk> , ) less than the <unk> of an inch in diameter , and of a <unk> colour ; these vessels are not articulated , but otherwise resemble the same peculiar structure in the valves of the capitulum .
the exterior yellow membrane is marked , or rather composed of successive narrow rims , which , in fact , are the lines of termination of the laminæ of membrane , which in a calcified state form the cup itself .
in most parts , both on the borders and under the centre of the cup , but not everywhere , there are imbedded in the yellow membrane , elongated , irregular , <unk> masses of bright yellow chitine , each furnished with a <unk> , which penetrating the calcareous laminæ leads to the corium ; the little apertures thus formed , are clearly visible in the layers of membrane , left after exposure to acid .
in l .
nicobarica , the innermost <name> layer of the cup was punctured , like the surface of the shell in chthamalus and many other sessile cirripedes , by the internal orifices of these tubuli .
the <unk> masses often have <unk> summits ; and they differ in no essential respects from those on the lower part of the peduncle , excepting that they are quite imbedded in the membrane covering the under surface of the cup , whereas those on the peduncle project freely .
i found these <unk> bodies in the outer membrane of the cups in l .
dorsalis , l .
<unk> , and l .
rhodiopus , which alone i was enabled to dissolve in acid ; and i mention this fact , as indicating the probable presence of the more important <unk> projections on the lower parts of the peduncle in these same species .
the basal calcareous cup resembles , in essential structure , the valves of the capitulum ; the chief difference being that in the former there is a larger proportion of animal matter or membranous layers .
after the dissolution of the cups , in l .
dorsalis and l .
rhodiopus , i most distinctly traced the two cement-ducts ; they included the usual darker chord of cellular matter ; they were of rather small diameter , namely , <unk> of an inch .
the two ( in l .
dorsalis ) ran in a very irregular course , not parallel to each other , making the most abrupt bends .
they passed through the membranous layers , ( as seen after dissolution , ) and running for short spaces parallel to the component laminæ , were attached to them .
in their irregular course , these cement-ducts resemble those of pollicipes mitella , but i could not perceive that any cement had been poured out at the abrupt bends .
in one specimen of a basal cup , which i was enabled to examine whilst still attached to the rock , i found under the very centre , ( and of course outside the yellow membrane , ) a very small area of dark brown cement of the usual appearance .
in several specimens of full-sized cups , i was not able to perceive any cement on the external surfaces of the upper and <unk> layers ; hence i believe that the cup is cemented to the bottom of the hole only during the early stages of its formation ; and this , considering its protected situation , would no doubt be sufficient to <unk> the animal .
this probably accounts for the small size of the cement-ducts , and for the facility with which , as it appears , the cups can be removed in an unbroken condition from the rock .
in the case , however , of the small , flat , calcareous discs , which are formed whilst the animal is burrowing into the rock , these are attached firmly to the sides of the holes , in the usual manner , by cement .
in this cirripede it would be useless to look for the prehensile antennæ of the larva under the cup , for the animal , during the formation of the successive discs , must have travelled some distance from the spot on which the larva first attached itself .
the membrane of the peduncle is continuous with the yellow membrane coating the external surface of the cup ; and this latter membrane is continuous with those delicate laminæ which , in a calcified condition , form the layers of the cup itself .
in an exactly similar manner , in this and other cirripedes , the membrane of the peduncle , at the top , is continuous with that coating the valves , and is attached to the lower exterior edge of the <unk> layer of shell .
when a new <name> layer is formed , both under the valves of the capitulum and inside the basal calcareous cup , it projects beyond the old layer , and is included within the old , as yet not moulted , membrane of the peduncle .
within the cup of l .
nicobarica i found a <unk> layer of shell , projecting <unk> of an inch on one side of the cup , and by its protuberance distinguishable even through the old coat of the peduncle , which was nearly ready to be moulted .
in an analogous manner , in the capitulum of l .
dorsalis and l .
truncata , i have found a new <unk> membrane bearing the usual , but then sharp , calcified scales , attached to the lower projecting edge of the <unk> <name> layer , lying under the old <unk> membrane , which was attached to the penultimate layer of shell , and with its worn scales was just ready to be moulted .
the final cause of the moulting of the calcified scales , together with the membrane of the peduncle to which they are attached ,  a case confined to lithotrya ,  i have scarcely any doubt is the reproduction of a succession of scales , sharply serrated for the purpose of enlarging the cavity in which the animal is lodged .
the extreme thinness of the membrane of the peduncle has been noticed ; this may be partly related to its protected condition , but partly , i think , to the necessity of its being formed in a very <unk> condition ; for the new coat , owing to the projection of the new <name> layers under the valves , and within the basal cup , is by so much shorter than the old peduncle , yet after exuviation it has to stretch to a greater length than the old membrane , to allow of the growth of the cirripede .
owing to the thinness and <unk> of this membrane , the basal attachment of the cirripede is , no doubt , chiefly effected by the unusually strong longitudinal muscles ; and the necessity of a surface of attachment for these muscles , stronger than the external membrane of the peduncle , probably is one of the final causes of the basal calcareous disc and cup , and likewise for the unusual manner in which the valves of the capitulum are locked together by folds and small roughened projections .
the basal discs and cup , however , apparently serve for several other purposes , namely , for raising the animal a little in its burrow , ( which is narrow and pointed at the bottom , ) at that period of growth when it has ceased to burrow downwards , but still increases in diameter ; also for carrying the animal , as over a bridge , across any pre-existing cavity in the rock ; and lastly , perhaps , for removing lower down , in the intervals of exuviation , the point of attachment for the longitudinal <unk> muscles .
position of the animal in the rock , and its power of <unk>  a specimen of rock , two or three inches square , in mr. <unk> possession , is full of <unk> ; the cavities extend in every possible direction , and several were parallel , but with the animals in reversed positions ; the same thing is apparent in some specimens of mr. stutchbury 's , and it was evident that the positions occupied by the animals were entirely due to chance .
in mr. cuming 's specimen of rock , a considerable portion of the external surface is preserved , and here it can be seen that many of the specimens have their <unk> directed from the external surface directly inwards .
these individuals , which were of full size , must have preyed on infusoria inhabiting the cavities of the porous , calcareous rock .
on the other hand , i have seen some young specimens of l .
dorsalis with their valves not at all rubbed , and others of full size with uninjured <unk> and corallines on the tips of the valves , and again a specimen of l .
truncata with minute <unk> sea-weed on the summit of the capitulum ,  all which appearances induce me to believe that in these cases , the valves had projected freely beyond the cavity in which their peduncles were lodged .
i may here also mention that in mr. cuming 's specimen , above alluded to , the basal cups of five specimens touched and adhered to each other ; i was not able to make out whether there had originally existed separate burrows , as i think is most probable , and that the walls had been wholly worn away , or whether the five specimens had fixed themselves on one side of a large pre-existing , common cavity .
young specimens seem to burrow to the full depth , before nearly acquiring the diameter which they ultimately attain .
i measured one burrow , <unk> of an inch in depth , which , at its mouth or widest part , was only <unk> in diameter .
the several species occur imbedded in soft calcareous rocks , in massive corals , and in the shells of mollusca and of cirripedes .
it has been doubted by several naturalists , whether the basal calcareous cup at all belongs to the lithotrya , but after the foregoing microscopical observations on its structure , it is useless to discuss this point .
so again it has been doubted whether the cavity is formed by the cirripede itself ; but there is so obvious a relation between the diameters of specimens of various sizes , and the holes occupied by them , that i can entertain no doubt on this head .
the holes , moreover , are not quite cylindrical , but broadly oval , like the section of the animal .
the simple fact , that in this genus alone each fresh <name> layer round the bases of the valves , and therefore at the widest part of the capitulum , are sharply toothed ; and secondly , that in this genus alone a succession of sharply serrated scales , on the upper and widest part of the peduncle , are periodically formed at each exuviation ; and that consequently the teeth on the valves and scales are sharp , and fit for wearing soft stone , at that very period when the animal has to increase in size , would alone render the view probable that the lithotrya makes or at least enlarges the cavities in which it is imbedded .
although it may be admitted that lithotrya has the power of enlarging its cavity , how does it first bore down into the rock ?
it is quite certain that the basal cup is absolutely fixed , and that neither in form nor state of surface it is at all fitted for boring .
[ 66 ] i was quite unable to answer the foregoing question , until seeing the admirable figures by <unk> [ 67 ] , ( pl .
viii , figs .
2 and 2 a´ ) of l .
nicobarica , still attached in its cavity .
subsequently i obtained from mr. stutchbury several pieces of rock completely drilled with holes , many of small diameter , by l .
dorsalis , and in these i found numerous instances of the linear rows of little discs , like those of l .
nicobarica , showing in the plainest manner , that each time a new disc is formed , that is , at each exuviation , the animal moves a short step downwards ; and as the lowest of these little discs in none of the burrows was placed at the very bottom , we see that the lowest point of the peduncle must be the wearing agent .
in the peduncle of an individual of l .
dorsalis , nearly ready to moult , i found , it may be remembered , beneath and round the basal disc , under the old membrane of the peduncle , a new membrane studded with calcified beads , but with the horny <unk> spines not yet developed , whilst on the old outer coat these latter had been worn down quite smooth , and the calcified beads worn entirely away .
here , then , we have an excellent rasping surface .
with respect to the power of movement necessary for the boring action , the peduncle is amply furnished with transverse , oblique , and longitudinal <unk> muscles ,  the latter attached to the basal disc .
in all the <unk> , i have reason to believe that these muscles are in constant slight involuntary action .
this being the case , i conceive that the small , blunt , <unk> portion of the peduncle , descending beneath the basal rim of the lowest disc , would inevitably partake slightly of the movements of the whole distended animal .
as soon as the lithotrya has reached that depth , which its instinct points out as most suitable to its habits , the discs are converted into an irregularly growing cup , and the animal then only increases in diameter , enlarging its cavity by the action of the serrated scales on the peduncle , and of the serrated lower edges of the valves of the capitulum .
with respect to those reversed individuals attached with their <unk> downwards , i suppose that the larvæ had crept into some deep cavity , perhaps made originally by a lithotrya , of which the rock in the specimen in question was quite full , and had there attached themselves .
finally , it appears that in lithotrya the burrowing is simply a mechanical action ; it is effected by each layer of shell in the basal attached discs overlapping , in a straight line , the <unk> layer ,  by the membrane of the peduncle and the valves of the capitulum having excellent and often renewed rasping surfaces ,  and , lastly , by the end of the peduncle ( that is <unk> the front of the head ) thus roughened , extending beyond the surface of attachment , and possessing the power of slight movement .
[ 66 ] mr. hancock , in his admirable account of his burrowing cirripede , <unk> <unk> , ( 'annals of nat .
<unk> , ' nov. 1849 , p. 313 , ) came to this conclusion regarding the cup of lithotrya , and hence was led to think that this genus did not form its own burrows , but inhabited pre-existing cavities .
i am much indebted to this gentleman , who has been so eminently successful in his researches on the boring powers of <name> animals , for giving me his opinion on several points connected with the present discussion .
[ 67 ] i owe to the great kindness of prof. steenstrup the sight of this plate , published in the <unk> communications from the union of natural history , ' copenhagen , <name> 30 , 1850 , no .
i .
since this sheet has been set up in type , i have received from prof. steenstrup the memoir , in danish , belonging to the figures in question ; and the greater part of this has been translated to me by the kindness of a friend .
my account of the means of burrowing is essentially the same as that published by <unk> ; but the moulting of the scales on the peduncle , the presence of scales and of points of a different nature , the method of attachment by cement , the conversion of the discs into a cup , & c. , seem not to have been known to this naturalist .
<unk> states that the points on the peduncle <name> scratch iceland spar , and that , apparently , they are formed of phosphate of lime : in the case of the closely-allied l .
dorsalis , i must believe that the scales or beads on the peduncle are formed of carbonate of lime , for they were quickly dissolved with <unk> in acetic acid ; and the <unk> points , which are subsequently developed under the calcareous scales , appeared to me , under the compound microscope , to be formed of a horn or chitine substance .
<unk> states that the basal point of the peduncle is arched a little under the lowest disc , and there forms for itself a slight furrow ( as represented in the lateral view , pl .
viii , fig .
2 ) ; but in the burrows examined by me , this furrow or depression did not really exist , the appearance resulting from the basal margin of the lowest disc , projecting beyond the wall of the cavity by the amount of its own slight thickness .
* * * * * we <name> now proceed with our generic <unk>  animal 's <unk>  this , as already stated , is partially lodged within the peduncle .
the prosoma is rather largely developed .
the mouth is placed at a moderate distance from the adductor muscle .
the labrum is moderately bullate , with a row of blunt bead-like teeth , mingled with fine bristles , on the crest , which in the middle part is generally somewhat flattened .
the palpi are blunt , and even squarely truncated at their ends ; they are of large size , so that , if they had been half as large again , or even less , their tips would have met .
mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , with three nearly equal large teeth , and the inferior <name> produced , broad , and strongly pectinated : in the interspaces between these teeth there are , in all the species , some very fine teeth or <unk> , which are seated a little on one side of the medial line .
the mandibles are somewhat singular from the size of the transparent flexible <unk> ( a a ) to which the muscles are attached ; these are oval and constricted at their <unk> : in l .
dorsalis they are roughened with little points ; in l .
<unk> and l .
truncata they are large , of the same shape , but smooth .
<unk>  these are larger , compared to the mandibles , than is usual with pedunculated cirripedes ; they differ in shape in the different species , being either nearly straight on their edge , and notched or not ( fig .
10 ) , or notched with the inferior part forming a double prominence ( fig .
12 ) ; the spines on the inferior <name> , which is sometimes slightly produced , are always crowded together into a brush , and are finer than those on the upper parts .
the <unk> are less straight than is usual , and at their origin take , in all the species , a rather abrupt bend ; their extremity is enlarged into a little disc , which in l .
dorsalis is covered with strong points , but in the other species is , as usual , smooth .
outer <unk>  the inner margin is slightly concave , and in l .
truncata alone , the bristles are hardly continuous , being interrupted in the middle part .
the olfactory orifices are only very slightly prominent .
the spines on all the trophi are more or less doubly serrated .
cirri.  the three posterior pair are elongated , with their anterior surfaces not at all protuberant .
the segments bear from three to five pair of spines , with a row of three or four small intermediate spines ; there are , as usual , some little lateral upper rim spines ; the dorsal tufts contain some thick and thin spines mingled .
first cirrus is short , and placed not quite close to the second pair ; the basal segments are broad and thickly paved with bristles .
the second pair is rather short compared with the third pair ; a varying number of the basal segments in both rami of both these cirri are protuberant , and are thickly paved with bristles ; such segments are more numerous and are broader on the anterior rami than on the posterior rami .
in l .
<unk> alone , none of the basal segments in the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are thickly paved with bristles .
the pedicels of the first three pair are irregularly covered with spines ; those of the three posterior pair have the spines arranged in a regular double line .
most of the spines are doubly serrated .
caudal appendages ( pl .
x , fig .
23 and 24 ) , <unk> , with thin elongated segments fringed with short spines ; in length generally exceeding the pedicel of the sixth cirrus , and in l .
nicobarica equalling half the entire length of this cirrus .
stomach , destitute of cæca ; oesophagus somewhat curled .
filamentary appendages , none .
ovaria filling up the peduncle and surrounding the sack , but not extending up to the bases of the scuta and terga ; i saw the ova only in l .
truncata ; they were here oval and large , being nearly <unk> of an inch in length .
penis , elongated ; vesiculæ seminales extending into the prosoma .
i noticed the ovigerous fræna only in l .
truncata ; here they were large , with an almost <unk> outline ; the margin and whole lateral surface being covered with elongated cylinders , finely pointed , but not enlarged at their extremities , as are the glands observed in most of the other genera .
<unk>  the posterior thoracic segments , the pedicels , the anterior and dorsal surfaces of the segments of the cirri , the caudal appendages , and the outer sides of the trophi are , in most of the species , more or less mottled with dark purple ; parts of the interior surfaces of the valves in some of the species are coloured fine purple .
geographical <unk>  the species are found all round the world in the tropical seas ; this fact may have some connection with the presence of soft coral-reef limestone and of massive corals in these seas .
the presence , however , of l .
<unk> on the shores of new south wales , shows that the genus is not strictly tropical .
affinities.  lithotrya is a <unk> distinct genus ; although there is a considerable difference in the shape of the valves between l .
dorsalis and l .
<unk> , at the opposite extremes of the genus , the strict uniformity of the internal characters shows that there are no grounds whatever for any generic separation ; moreover , l .
rhodiopus neatly blends together these extreme forms .
indeed it is not easy to imagine a better marked series of transitional forms , than those presented by the terga , in passing from l .
dorsalis through l .
nicobarica , l .
rhodiopus , and l .
truncata , to l .
<unk> .
lithotrya has most affinity to scalpellum villosum or to pollicipes spinosus and p .
sertus ; though the affinity is far from close .
in these two species of pollicipes , we have seen that large irregular calcified spines are formed at the base of the peduncle , whereas in the other <unk> the scales or spines are formed exclusively round the upper margin of the peduncle .
lithotrya , as has been remarked by sowerby and other authors , exhibits some affinity to the sessile cirripedes , as shown by the calcareous basis ,  by the manner in which the scuta and terga are locked together ,  by the two little fans of muscle attached to near the basal points of the terga ,  and perhaps by some of the characters of the trophi ; nevertheless , this affinity is far from being well-marked , and i think is hardly so plain as in pollicipes mitella .

the state of preservation of the valves in different specimens varies greatly ; generally only two or three , or even only the <unk> <name> layer , is preserved , the upper ones having scaled off ; in a few young specimens , however , all the layers were perfect .
the <name> is generally better preserved than the other valves , and hence the upper part usually projects freely ; in one specimen no less than ten zones of growth were preserved in the <name> , whilst the other valves consisted of only three : the terga generally project rather more than the scuta .
as each <unk> is thick , if the scaling process had not taken place , all the valves would have projected greatly .
the little teeth lie close together on the prominent serrated rims , on each zone of growth .
the internal surfaces of the valves are roughened with small <unk> points .
exteriorly the valves are covered with yellow membrane , with rows , corresponding with each zone of growth , of very minute , yellow , horny spines , generally having their tips bent over , and so made <unk> .
these spines are less than <unk> of an inch in length .
scuta , triangular ; internally concave , with a large depression for the adductor muscle ; there is the usual small roughened internal knob , or tooth , at the rostral <name> of both the right and left hand valves .
tergal margin straight , overlapping about one third of the entire width of the terga .
terga , irregularly oval , with the scutal margin straight ; basal point blunt , with the two sides placed at about an <name> of <unk> to each other ; the lower part of the carinal margin , immediately over the latera , ( as seen internally , ) is slightly hollowed out .
exteriorly , towards the bottom of the valve , from the overlapping of the scuta , of the latera , and of the <name> , only a narrow rounded ridge is exposed , which runs down to the basal <name> at about one third of the entire width of the valve , from the scutal margin .
internally the valve is slightly concave .
the <name> slightly <unk> the terga ; internally concave ; generally with a large upper portion freely projecting ; inwardly curved , without any central crest or ridge ; valve nearly as wide as the middle part of the terga ; inner growing or <unk> surface , with its basal margin , protuberant and arched .
rostrum ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 a´ , a , and greatly magnified 1 b´ ) very narrow ; rarely more than two or three layers of growth are preserved ; the sides are deeply sinuous , owing to each zone widening downwards ; basal margin rounded ; in width equalling about two and a half of the uppermost scales of the peduncle , and about half as wide as the latera .
latera , small , placed obliquely , and parallel to the lower carinal margin of the terga ; longer axis equal to five of the uppermost scales of the peduncle , and to nearly half the width of the base of the <name> ; growing surface ( or a section made parallel to the <unk> , ) is narrow , elliptic , pointed at both ends , but the carinal half rather thicker than the scutal half .
the peduncle varies in length , generally about twice as long as the capitulum , in one specimen above thrice as long .
the upper part as wide as the capitulum , the lower part sometimes much attenuated .
the calcified scales in the uppermost whorl ( pl .
viii , fig .
1 b´ ) are only slightly larger than those in the second whorl ; the scales in the succeeding three or four whorls , are considerably larger than those below , which latter very gradually decrease in size , till , low down on the peduncle , they are barely visible to the naked eye .
in this lower part , they may be called calcareous beads ; they stand some way apart from each other ; they are nearly hemispherical , smooth , translucent , and furnished with a conical <unk> ; some of the smallest were <unk> and <unk> of an inch in diameter .
the upper scales vary somewhat in the outline , the most usual shape being sub-triangular , with the lower margin arched and protuberant ; and this margin , in the two or three upper whorls , is <unk> with teeth , which are conical and sharp , after exuviation , but soon become reduced to mere notches .
the scales in the uppermost whorl are usually nearly quadrilateral ; the imbedded portion , or <unk> of each scale , is , in all , produced into a blunt rounded point .
the basal calcareous cup ( fig .
1 a´ and 1 <unk> ) is well developed , and is sometimes even half an inch in diameter .
before the cup is formed , there is a row of small , flat discs ( fig .
1 , and like those in fig .
2 a´ ) attached to the sides of the burrow : but a full account of these parts of the peduncle , and of the burrowing habits of this species , has been given under the generic description .
size and <unk>  full <unk> specimens have a capitulum half an inch in width and height ; the entire length , with the contracted peduncle , being about an inch and a half .
valves coloured dirty white , with the enveloping membrane , when preserved , yellow .
the outer maxillæ , palpi , pedicels of the cirri , anterior faces of the segments , dorsal tufts , caudal appendages , and penis , dark purple .
thoracic segments brown .
there is a purple spot between the bases of the first pair of cirri .
mouth.  labrum considerably bullate , equalling about half the longitudinal diameter of the mouth ; inferior part produced so as to separate the mouth some way from the adductor muscle ; crest with a row of blunt teeth and hairs ; central part depressed and flattened .

mandibles ( pl .
x , fig .
2 ) , with twice as many <unk> , namely 15 , between the first and second main teeth , as between the second and third teeth , namely about 7 ; inferior <name> strongly and coarsely pectinated ; distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , considerably less than between the tips of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> ; sides hirsute .
maxillæ ( fig .
10 ) , with the edge not quite straight , with the whole inferior part slightly projecting ; spines very numerous , thirty or forty pairs ; those close beneath the two upper great unequal spines , form a tuft and are rather thinner than the others , as are also those near the inferior <name> ; sides hirsute .
outer maxillæ , rather pointed , with the inner edge slightly concave , continuously and thickly clothed with short spines ; spines on the outer edge long ; there are also some minute , short , thinly scattered spines or points on the sides .
bristles on all the trophi doubly serrated .
cirri.  the first pair is placed at a small distance from the second .
the segments in the three posterior pairs , support five pairs of very long spines , with a row of ( i believe ) four small intermediate spines ; on the lateral upper edges , there are some short blunt spines ; anterior faces of the segments not protuberant ; the dorsal tufts consist of thick serrated , and of thin spines .
the whole integument is hirsute with minute pectinated scales .
two or three of the basal segments in the sixth cirrus are confluent .
first cirrus , anterior ramus rather shorter and thicker than the posterior ramus ; basal segments thickly paved with serrated spines ; in the posterior ramus , the six terminal segments are not paved with bristles .
second cirrus has the seven basal segments of the anterior ramus very broad , and paved with bristles ; the eight terminal segments having the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus the three or four basal segments are similarly paved , but to a very much less degree , and the remaining thirteen have the usual structure .
third cirrus has the six basal segments of the anterior ramus very broad and paved , and the fourteen terminal ones of the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus , the three or four basal segments are similarly paved , but to a very much less degree , and the seventeen terminal ones have the usual structure .
the pedicel of the first cirrus has very few spines ; those of the second and third cirrus are thickly and irregularly clothed with spines ; and those of the three posterior pair have a double row with intermediate small spines .
on the <unk> faces of the pedicels of the second , third , and fourth pairs of cirri , there is an elongated white swelling or shield .
moreover , on the posterior thoracic segments , there are similar <unk> <unk> , with the membrane more plainly marked with scales than in other parts .
the spines on the first three pairs of cirri are coarsely serrated .
caudal appendages ( pl .

general remarks.  it is difficult to give obvious characters , ( excepting the smallness of the rostrum compared with the scales on the peduncle , ) by which this species can be externally <unk> from l .
dorsalis , l .
nicobarica , and l .
rhodiopus ; yet almost all the valves differ slightly in shape .
in this species alone , ( the peduncle of l .
rhodiopus is not known , ) the lower , <unk> minute , bead-like scales of the peduncle are <unk> , though obscurely , all round .
in the animal 's body , the <unk> characters are strongly marked ;  the long spines on the terminal segment of the first cirrus ,  none of the segments in the posterior rami of the second and third cirri being thickened and paved with bristles ,  the <unk> being equal in number between the main teeth of the mandibles ,  are all characters exclusively confined to this species .

the teeth on the prominent rims of the valves are small and approximate ; but the specimen was much worn .
scuta , triangular , slightly overlapping the terga ; the line of junction between these valves slightly sinuous , the upper part of the tergal margin of the scuta being slightly hollowed out , and the corresponding upper portion of the margin of the terga being slightly protuberant .
internally , there is a considerable depression for the adductor muscle ; and besides the usual knob at the rostral <name> , there is a trace of a knob at the <unk> <name> .
terga , as seen internally , irregularly <unk> , ending downwards in a blunt point , of which the two sides , ( neither being sensibly hollowed out , ) stand at about an <name> of <unk> to each other .
scutal margin , with the upper part , ( as above remarked , ) slightly protuberant : near the bottom of this margin , there is a very slight projection , answering to the small knob at the <unk> <name> of the scutum .
externally , towards the basal <name> , the narrow strip not concealed by the overlapping of the latera and <name> is <unk> , with the zones of growth on it straight .
<name> , internally concave in the upper free part , with a slight , central , internal crest , caused by the projection of each successive zone of growth .
the inner growing surface is almost <unk> in outline ; with the basal margin square and truncated in the middle .
rostrum ( fig .
2 a ) , rather conspicuous , many zones of growth being preserved .
it equals in width six of the subjacent scales of the peduncle , but as these are rather smaller than elsewhere , the width equals about five of the ordinary uppermost scales ; compared with the latera , it is nearly <unk> of their width .
latera , unusually large ; as seen on their interior surfaces , ( or in a section parallel to the zones of growth , ) they are triangular , elongated transversely , with the carinal <name> a <unk> .
in width they equal the seven subjacent scales of the peduncle , and are more than half as long as the basal margin of the <name> .
peduncle , with the upper scales varying from circular to quadrilateral , thrice as large as those in the second whorl ; beneath which , in the next three or four whorls , the scales rapidly decrease in size ; and beneath these the whole peduncle is studded with <unk> , rounded , calcareous beads , so minute as to be quite invisible to the naked eye .
this specimen was nearly ready to moult , and perhaps in consequence of this , even the upper scales were most obscurely serrated on their lower margins , and all the others quite smooth : there were some much worn horny spines close to the bottom of the peduncle .
basal calcareous cup slightly concave , of moderate size ; its diameter , in the one specimen examined , was <unk> of an inch ; it was composed of several layers .
in the specimen figured ( 2 a´ ) by <unk> , instead of a cup , there is a straight row of small discs , which are attached to the walls of the cavity , as explained in the generic description .
mouth.  palpi with their ends square and truncated ; thickly clothed with long spines .
mandibles , with fully twice as many <unk> , ( viz .
from 16 to 20 , ) between the first and second main teeth , as between ( viz .
8 to 10 ) the second and third main teeth .
inferior <name> , coarsely pectinated .
the distance between the tips of the first and second teeth , is considerably less than between the tip of the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ , with the edge very slightly irregular ; beneath the two great upper spines there is a slight notch , with some small spines : inferior <name> slightly prominent , with a brush of moderately fine spines ; besides these , there are about seventeen pairs of large spines ; sides very hairy .
outer maxillæ , with the inner margin slightly concave , and with the spines continuous .
cirri.  the segments in the three posterior pairs support three or four pairs of long spines , with a single row of moderately long intermediate spines ; the dorsal tufts consist of a few rather thick , and some long and thin spines .
the front of the segments is not protuberant ; the whole surface is hirsute with minute <unk> scales .
second cirrus , with the anterior ramus having its eight basal segments highly protuberant and thickly clothed with spines , the upper nine having the usual structure ; the posterior ramus has four or five basal segments thickly clothed with spines , and the twelve upper ones with the usual structure .
third cirrus , with the anterior ramus having six segments highly protuberant and thickly clothed with bristles , and the fifteen upper ones on the usual structure ; in the posterior ramus , only three or four of the basal segments are paved with bristles .
the spines on the first three pairs of cirri , are coarsely and doubly serrated .
the caudal appendages are more than twice as long as the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , and equal half the length of the whole cirrus .
in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus contained twenty-two segments , the caudal appendages actually contained twenty .
the segments are thin , with their upper edges clothed with serrated spines .
the slip of membrane on each side , whence this organ springs is united , for a little space , to the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus .

the specimens are in a rather bad condition , and have been <unk> .
they are of rather small size ; the rostrum and peduncle are lost , and animal 's body much injured .
valves white , thin , translucent ; teeth on the projecting rims small , narrow , standing further apart than their own width .
the upper layers have undergone but little disintegration or scaling off , and consequently the <name> and terga project freely .
the valves , where not rubbed , are covered by bright yellow membrane , which is thickly clothed with rows of spines ; these are small on the exterior surfaces , but are very large and hooked in certain parts , as near the tergal margins of the scuta , and on the carinal margins of the terga , and especially on the inner face of the upper free part of the <name> .
here the hooked spines ( fig .
4 d ) are <unk> or quadrifid , and are very conspicuous .
scuta , as seen externally , triangular ; they overlap half the width of the terga ; on their internal faces ( fig .
4 a ) , in the upper projecting part , there is a strong ridge , against which the scutal margin of the terga <unk> .
there is a deep and conspicuous pit for the adductor muscle .
terga , as seen externally , nearly triangular .
the ridge which leads from the apex to the basal <name> , is rounded , central , and extremely prominent ; but does not form a furrow , or include the overlapping margin of the scuta .
the basal <name> is narrow , <unk> , and slightly hollowed out on both margins .
the growing <unk> surface ( fig .
4 b ) is transversely elongated , with the occludent margin rounded , and the carinal <name> much produced , but not forming a roughened knob .
<name> ( fig .
4 d ) , concave within , with a slight central ridge in the upper free portion .
the inner growing surface is concave , almost <unk> , with a just perceptibly raised central rim in the upper part , and with two minute prominences on each side , against which the produced carinal angles of the terga <unk> .
rostrum , lost .
latera ( fig .

several zones of growth preserved .
peduncle , lost , but a few scales accidentally adhering to one of the valves , show that they are <unk> in the three or four upper whorls .
no basal calcareous cup was preserved , but by clearing out the base of one of the holes in the <name> , in which a specimen had been imbedded , i found a little flat disc about the size of a pin 's head ; it was composed of two or three layers , and was externally coated by yellow membrane , including the usual <unk> bodies and tubuli .
the cement-ducts were also discovered after dissolution in acid .
so that there could be no doubt regarding the nature of the little disc .
mouth.  labrum with a row of little blunt teeth .
palpi , blunt , rather expanded at their ends , with the extreme margin much arched and furnished with two rows of long spines ; there is a fringe of short spines on the straight inner side .
<unk>  there are nine <unk> between the first and second main teeth , and only two between the second and third teeth ; the inferior <name> is coarsely pectinated , with one central spine twice as long as the others .
the distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , is greater than between the tip of the second tooth and the inferior <name> .
maxillæ ( pl .
x , fig .
12 ) .  these may be described as having their edge formed into three prominences ; or , as having a very wide notch under the two upper great spines , and with the whole inferior part forming two prominences .
there are , altogether , about twelve pairs of spines , of which two stand singly on the inferior side of the wide notch under the two upper great spines .
the spines on the inferior <name> are rather smaller than those above ; sides hirsute .
outer maxillæ , with the inner margin slightly concave , and sparingly covered with bristles .
cirri , imperfectly preserved ; the three posterior pairs have segments of the usual character , bearing five pairs of very long spines , with the usual little intermediate , the minute lateral , and the dorsal spines .
first cirrus lost ; second and third with only their few basal segments preserved , sufficient , however , to show that at least two or three segments , in both the anterior and posterior rami of both cirri , were paved with bristles .
pedicels , as in the other species .
caudal appendages , lost .
this species comes very close , as far as the characters derived from the trophi serve , to the l .
truncata , though readily distinguished from that species by the shape of the valves .
on the other hand , the capitulum of this species is distinguished with difficulty from that of l .
nicobarica and l .
<unk> ; no doubt this difficulty is much enhanced by the rostrum and peduncle having been lost .

caudal appendages shorter than , or barely exceeding in length , the pedicels of the sixth cirrus .
friendly archipelago , mus .
<name> ; philippine archipelago , mus .
cuming ; imbedded in <name> rock .
capitulum rather thick , with the five main valves having their free apices , diverging and truncated .
the upper and old layers of shell do not here scale off so readily as in many of the foregoing species ; and hence an unusually large proportional length of each valve projects freely above the sack ; and the valves are of unusual thickness .
the capitulum is very nearly as wide at its summit as at its base , owing to the divergence of the apices of the valves .
the scuta and terga are articulated together by a conspicuous fold , which , when seen from vertically above , ( pl .
ix , fig .
1 a´ , ) appears like a deep <unk> notch in the terga .
on the exterior surfaces of the valves , the teeth on the successive rims are approximate ; on the inner surfaces , the rims are covered by strong yellow membrane , which is generally fringed with small horny spines .
scuta , exterior surface convex , sub-triangular , with the apex truncated : seen vertically from above , there is a small rectangular indentation or fold which receives the projecting scutal margin of the terga .
the inner growing or <unk> surface ( fig .
1 b , b´ ) is triangular , with its tergal margin largely hollowed out .
along the occludent margin there is a slight ridge , which terminates at the rostral <name> , in both the right and left-hand valves , in a rounded , <unk> , roughened tooth .
the lower part of the tergal margin is slightly inflected and roughened , where it meets the corresponding lower part of the scutal margin of the terga .
there is a deep pit for the adductor muscle .
the interior surface of the valve above this pit is <unk> purple .
the inner surfaces of both scuta and terga , are roughened with little points .
terga , seen externally , are almost quadrilateral ( owing to the apex being truncated ) , with the free margin facing the scutum , arched .
seen vertically from above , each shows a deep fold , which receives the lower part of the tergal margin of the scutum .
in the foregoing species , a prominent ridge runs down the exterior surface of the terga from the apex to the basal <name> , against which ridge , the margin of the overlapping scuta <unk> : here this ridge , instead of projecting straight out , is oblique or folded over , and thus forms a furrow , receiving the margin of the scuta .
the interior growing surface of the tergum ( fig .
1 b´ , c ) , presents so irregular a figure , that it can hardly be described ; in area it quite equals the scuta ; it is slightly concave ; at the upper point of the carinal margin , there is a large , rounded , protuberant , roughened knob , which corresponds with a small knob on each side of the inner face of the <name> ; these knobs seem firmly united together by membrane .
the scutal margin of the terga , in the upper part , forms a shoulder , largely projecting over the scuta ; on its lower part , there is a small roughened projection .
the occludent margin is arched and protuberant , with a slight fold above the knob on the carinal margin , just mentioned : this fold is caused by the protuberance of the central internal ridge of the <name> , but is so small , that when the capitulum is seen from vertically above , it can hardly be distinguished .
finally , the basal half of the carinal margin , runs in the same line with the basal margin of the scuta .
<name> , moderately large ; seen externally , the surface presents an elongated triangle , with the apex truncated ; on the internal face ( fig .
1 b´ , d ) of the free part , there is ( instead of being concave as is usual ) a great central ridge , which projects between the diverging apices of the terga , as may be seen from vertically above ; hence the thickness of the upper part of the <name> , in a longitudinal plane , almost equals its breadth .
the edge of this ridge is rounded .
the inner or growing surface of the <name> is tinted purple , and lies in a plane , oblique to the longer axis of the valve ; it is triangular , with the apex cut off , and the basal margin rounded and protuberant ; it is not concave .
there is a central raised line or slight ridge on this inner surface , and on each side in the upper part there is a small , white , roughened knob , corresponding with the similar knobs on the carinal margins of the terga .
rostrum ( fig .
1 b´ , a ) , rudimentary ; in one specimen it was about <unk> of an inch in width ; it is either as wide , or only half as wide , as the subjacent scale on the peduncle .
latera , rudimentary , placed between the edges of the <name> and the terga ; rather smaller than the rostrum ; almost cylindrical , slightly flattened , enlarged at each zone of growth , with one or two sharp teeth or spines on both faces ; imperfectly calcified ; in width barely <unk> part of the <name> .
peduncle , short ; the scales alone in the uppermost whorl are plainly toothed ; they are transversely elongated , and almost <unk> , and are nearly twice as large as those in the second whorl .
beneath this second whorl , there are two or three whorls , with scales , graduated in size ; and the rest of the peduncle is covered by rather distantly scattered , minute , rounded or acutely pointed scales : the pointed scales are directed upwards , and are best developed under the <name> .
the basal calcareous cup , judging from two specimens , is thin , and not much developed .
size and <unk>  the largest specimen was nearly <unk> of an inch across its capitulum .
the calcareous valves are dirty white .
the sack is ( after having been long kept in spirits ) pale coloured , excepting a small purple space , between the scuta and another over the <name> .
the three posterior segments of the thorax and portions under the second and third cirri , the trophi , the pedicels and the anterior faces of the segments ( especially of the basal segments in the second and third cirri ) , and a spot on their dorsal surfaces , and the penis are all coloured dark <unk> .
the prosoma is pale coloured .
mouth.  crest of labrum with a row of bead-like teeth and hairs .
palpi bluntly pointed , with neither margin hollowed out .
mandibles , with eight <unk> between the first and second main teeth , and three between the second and third teeth ; inferior <name> coarsely pectinated , with a central spine much longer than the others ; the distance between the tips of the first and second main teeth , is about equal to that between the tip of the second tooth and of the inferior <name> .
<unk>  under the two upper long spines ( associated with some smaller ones ) , there is a slight and wide hollow ; and the whole inferior edge obscurely forms two blunt points , with the spines on the lower projection smaller than the upper spines .
outer maxillæ , considerably concave in front , with the spines almost <unk> in the middle part .
cirri.  first pair rather far separated from the second pair .
the segments of the three posterior cirri bear three or four pairs of main spines , and are otherwise characterised like the foregoing species .
first cirrus , with its anterior ramus much thicker than the posterior ramus , and of nearly equal length ; all the segments , except the two terminal ones , thickly clothed with serrated spines .
second cirrus considerably shorter than the third cirrus : anterior ramus with the seven basal segments very protuberant , and paved with bristles , and the four terminal ones on the usual structure ; posterior ramus , with the five basal segments paved ( but much less thickly than in the anterior ramus ) , and the nine terminal ones on the usual structure .
third cirrus , the anterior ramus , with the five basal segments , thick and paved , and eleven terminal segments on the usual structure : posterior ramus , with one basal segment paved , and sixteen other segments on the usual structure .
in the posterior rami , however , of both the second and third cirri , it is difficult to draw any distinct line between the paved segments and the others .
caudal appendages , short , either just exceeding in length the pedicels of the sixth cirrus , or equalling only the lower segment : segments flattened , cylindrical , six in number , there being , in the same individual , twenty-one segments in both rami of the sixth cirrus .

british museum .
general remarks.  the two specimens in the british museum are small , and in an imperfect condition , without the peduncle or the latera , and without the body of the animal .
the capitulum so closely resembles that of l .
truncata , that it is quite superfluous to do more than point out the few differences .
it is just possible , though not probable , that this form may prove to be merely a variety or younger state of l .
truncata , in which case this latter name would have to be sunk .
the difference , though one only of degree , in the form of the terga of the two species is conspicuous , and there is a slight difference in the <name> , and again some dissimilarity in habits .
<unk>  the valves , as just stated , generally resemble those of l .
truncata ; scarcely any appreciable difference can be detected in the scuta ; the apex , however , of the inner surface seems coloured a darker purple .
the terga , as seen from vertically above ( pl .
viii , fig .
5 b ) , have a fold or indentation on the upper or occludent margin , as large and as conspicuous as that receiving the margin of the scuta : this fold , as seen on the inner <unk> surface ( fig .
5 a ) , descends below the roughened knob at the upper <name> of the carinal margin , which is not the case with the slight fold in the same place in l .
truncata ; its presence seems caused by the edge of the central internal crest , in the upper part of the <name> , being square ( instead of round , as in l .
truncata ) , and thus more deeply affecting the outline of the terga , between which it is inserted .
the upper part of the scutal margin of the terga , as seen internally ( fig .
5 a ) , <unk> the scuta in a large rectangular projection .
from the depth of the two opposite folds , namely , that caused by the tergal edge of the scuta and that by the crest of the <name> , the inner face of the tergum is divided into two almost equal areas .
the <name> has its central crest square ( fig .
5 c , d , ) instead of being rounded as in l .
truncata .
the inner growing or <unk> face is nearly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the whole valve , instead of being oblique to it ; it is convex or protuberant , with a central raised line , and two little knobs on each side of the upper part ; the two lateral margins are slightly hollowed out , and the basal margin is not highly protuberant .
the rostrum is excessively minute , barely above <unk> of an inch in width ; it is a little enlarged at each zone of growth .
latera lost ; no doubt they were rudimentary .
a fragment of a posterior cirrus , which adhered to one of the valves , shows that each segment supported four pairs of spines .
width of the capitulum before <unk> , probably was about <unk> of an inch .

the a .

now , in young individuals of lepas australis , the peduncle is hairy , whilst in full-grown specimens it is quite smooth .
again , in some varieties of l .

this , i think , is certainly a distinct and new species , but i am unable to decide whether to place it in lepas or pæcilasma .
it is briefly described and pretty well figured in the above work .
it was procured at new zealand , but it is not stated to what object it was attached .
the capitulum is much elongated , and one inch in length ; the peduncle is from six to eight lines long .
the <name> is said to be very narrow ; it is not stated whether it terminates downwards in a fork or disc ; judging from the figure , it extends some way up between the terga , the basal ends of which are bluntly pointed .
the scuta are almost quadrilateral .
the peduncle is short , yellow , and <unk> .
the general appearance of the drawing makes me suspect that it is a pæcilasma .

leach has most briefly characterised a specimen in <unk> 's museum , from the red sea , under the above name of <unk> .

london <name> <name> , albemarle street 1913 .
to <name> lyell , esq. , <unk> , this second edition is dedicated with grateful pleasure , as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may possess , has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable principles of geology .
<unk> notice to the illustrated edition .
this work was described , on its first appearance , by a writer in the " quarterly review " as " one of the most interesting narratives of <unk> that it has fallen to our lot to take up , and one which must always occupy a distinguished place in the history of scientific navigation . "
this prophecy has been amply verified by experience ; the extraordinary minuteness and accuracy of mr. <name> 's observations , combined with the charm and simplicity of his descriptions , have ensured the popularity of this book with all classes of readers  and that popularity has even increased in recent years .
no attempt , however , has hitherto been made to produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work : numberless places and objects are mentioned and described , but the difficulty of obtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn for the purpose has never been overcome until now .
most of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by mr. <unk> , with mr. <name> 's book by his side .
some few of the others are taken from engravings which mr. <name> had himself selected for their interest as illustrating his voyage , and which have been kindly lent by his son .
mr. <unk> 's name is well known in connection with the voyages of the " <unk> " and " wanderer , " and it is believed that the illustrations , which have been chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains , <name> greatly add to the value and interest of the " voyage of a naturalist . "

author 's preface .
i have stated in the preface to the first edition of this work , and in the " zoology of the voyage of the beagle , " that it was in consequence of a wish expressed by captain fitz <name> , of having some scientific person on board , accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own accommodations , that i volunteered my services , which received , through the kindness of the <unk> , captain beaufort , the sanction of the lords of the admiralty .
as i feel that the opportunities which i enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we visited have been wholly due to captain fitz <name> , i <name> i may here be permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him ; and to add that , during the five years we were together , i received from him the most cordial friendship and steady assistance .
both to captain fitz <name> and to all the officers of the " beagle " i shall ever feel most thankful for the <unk> kindness with which i was treated during our long voyage .
( <unk> .
i must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr. <unk> , the surgeon of the " beagle , " for his very kind attention to me when i was ill at valparaiso . )
this volume contains , in the form of a journal , a history of our voyage , and a sketch of those observations in natural history and geology , which i think <name> possess some interest for the general reader .
i have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some parts , and have added a little to others , in order to render the volume more fitted for popular reading ; but i trust that naturalists <name> remember that they must refer for details to the larger publications which <unk> the scientific results of the expedition .
the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle ' " includes an account of the fossil mammalia , by professor <name> ; of the living mammalia , by mr. waterhouse ; of the birds , by mr. gould ; of the fish , by the reverend l. <unk> ; and of the reptiles , by mr. <name> .
i have appended to the descriptions of each species an account of its habits and range .
these works , which i owe to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished authors , could not have been undertaken had it not been for the liberality of the lords commissioners of her majesty 's treasury , who , through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of the <unk> , have been pleased to <name> a sum of one thousand pounds towards <unk> part of the expenses of publication .
i have myself published separate volumes on the " structure and distribution of <name> reefs " ; on the " volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the 'beagle ' " ; and on the " geology of south <name> . "
the sixth volume of the " geological transactions " contains two papers of mine on the erratic boulders and volcanic phenomena of south <name> .
messrs. waterhouse , <name> , newman , and white , have published several able papers on the insects which were collected , and i trust that many others <name> hereafter follow .
the plants from the southern parts of <name> <name> be given by dr. j. hooker , in his great work on the botany of the southern hemisphere .
the <name> of the galapagos archipelago is the subject of a separate memoir by him , in the " linnean transactions . "
the reverend professor henslow has published a list of the plants collected by me at the keeling islands ; and the reverend j.m .
berkeley has described my <unk> plants .
i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which i have received from several other naturalists in the course of this and my other works ; but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere thanks to the reverend professor henslow , who , when i was an <unk> at cambridge , was one chief means of giving me a taste for natural history ,  who , during my absence , took charge of the collections i sent home , and by his correspondence directed my endeavours ,  and who , since my return , has constantly rendered me every assistance which the kindest friend could offer .

st. jago  cape de verd islands .
after having been twice driven back by heavy south-western gales , her majesty 's ship " beagle , " a <unk> brig , under the command of captain fitz <name> , r.n. , sailed from <unk> on the 27th of december , 1831 .
the object of the expedition was to complete the survey of patagonia and <name> <name> fuego , commenced under captain king in 1826 to 1830  to survey the shores of chile , peru , and of some islands in the pacific  and to <name> a chain of <unk> measurements round the world .
on the 6th of <name> we reached teneriffe , but were prevented landing , by fears of our bringing the cholera : the next morning we saw the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the grand canary island , and suddenly <unk> the peak of teneriffe , whilst the lower parts were veiled in fleecy clouds .
this was the first of many delightful days never to be forgotten .
on the 16th of <name> 1832 we anchored at porto praya , in st. jago , the chief island of the cape de verd archipelago .
the neighbourhood of porto praya , viewed from the sea , wears a desolate aspect .
the volcanic fires of a past age , and the scorching heat of a tropical sun , have in most places rendered the soil unfit for vegetation .
the country rises in successive steps of table-land , interspersed with some <unk> conical hills , and the horizon is bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains .
the scene , as beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate , is one of great interest ; if , indeed , a person , fresh from sea , and who has just walked , for the first time , in a grove of cocoa-nut trees , can be a judge of anything but his own happiness .
the island would generally be considered as very uninteresting , but to any one accustomed only to an english landscape , the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil .
a single green leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains ; yet flocks of goats , together with a few cows , contrive to exist .
it rains very seldom , but during a short portion of the year heavy torrents fall , and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs out of every crevice .
this soon withers ; and upon such naturally formed hay the animals live .
it had not now rained for an entire year .
when the island was discovered , the immediate neighbourhood of porto praya was clothed with trees ( <unk> .
i state this on the authority of dr. e. <unk> , in his <name> translation of the first edition of this journal .
) , the reckless destruction of which has caused here , as at st. <name> , and at some of the canary islands , almost entire sterility .
the broad , flat-bottomed valleys , many of which serve during a few days only in the season as <unk> , are clothed with thickets of leafless bushes .
few living creatures inhabit these valleys .
the commonest bird is a kingfisher ( <unk> <unk> ) , which <unk> sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant , and thence darts on grasshoppers and lizards .
it is brightly coloured , but not so beautiful as the european species : in its flight , manners , and place of habitation , which is generally in the driest valley , there is also a wide difference .
one day , two of the officers and myself rode to <unk> grande , a village a few miles eastward of porto praya .
until we reached the valley of st. <name> , the country presented its usual dull brown appearance ; but here , a very small rill of water produces a most refreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation .
in the course of an hour we arrived at <unk> grande , and were surprised at the sight of a large ruined fort and cathedral .
this little town , before its harbour was filled up , was the principal place in the island : it now presents a melancholy , but very picturesque appearance .
having procured a black padre for a guide , and a spaniard who had served in the <unk> war as an interpreter , we visited a collection of buildings , of which an ancient church formed the principal part .
it is here the governors and <unk> of the islands have been buried .
some of the <unk> recorded dates of the sixteenth century .
( 1/2 .
the cape de verd islands were discovered in <unk> .
there was a tombstone of a bishop with the date of <unk> ; and a crest of a hand and dagger , dated <unk> . )
the <unk> ornaments were the only things in this retired place that reminded us of europe .
the church or chapel formed one side of a <unk> , in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were growing .
on another side was a hospital , containing about a dozen <unk> inmates .
we returned to the <unk> to eat our dinners .
a considerable number of men , women , and children , all as black as jet , collected to watch us .
our companions were extremely <name> ; and everything we said or did was followed by their hearty laughter .
before leaving the town we visited the cathedral .
it does not appear so <name> as the smaller church , but boasts of a little organ , which sent forth singularly <unk> cries .
we presented the black priest with a few shillings , and the spaniard , patting him on the head , said , with much <unk> , he thought his colour made no great difference .
we then returned , as fast as the ponies would go , to porto praya .
another day we rode to the village of st. <name> , situated near the centre of the island .
on a small plain which we crossed , a few stunted <unk> were growing ; their tops had been bent by the steady trade-wind , in a singular manner  some of them even at right angles to their trunks .
the direction of the branches was exactly north-east by north , and south-west by south , and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing direction of the force of the trade-wind .
the travelling had made so little impression on the barren soil , that we here missed our track , and took that to <unk> .
this we did not find out till we arrived there ; and we were afterwards glad of our mistake .
<unk> is a pretty village , with a small stream ; and everything appeared to prosper well , excepting , indeed , that which ought to do so most  its inhabitants .
the black children , completely naked , and looking very wretched , were carrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies .
near <unk> we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl  probably fifty or sixty in number .
they were extremely wary , and could not be approached .
they avoided us , like partridges on a rainy day in <name> , running with their heads cocked up ; and if pursued , they readily took to the wing .
the scenery of st. <name> possesses a beauty totally unexpected , from the prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island .
the village is situated at the bottom of a valley , bounded by lofty and jagged walls of stratified lava .
the black rocks afford a most striking contrast with the bright green vegetation , which follows the banks of a little stream of clear water .
it happened to be a grand <unk> , and the village was full of people .
on our return we overtook a party of about twenty young black girls , dressed in excellent taste ; their black skins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large shawls .
as soon as we approached near , they suddenly all turned round , and covering the path with their shawls , <name> with great energy a wild song , beating time with their hands upon their legs .
we threw them some <unk> , which were received with screams of laughter , and we left them <unk> the noise of their song .
one morning the view was singularly clear ; the distant mountains being projected with the sharpest outline , on a heavy bank of dark blue clouds .
judging from the appearance , and from similar cases in england , i supposed that the air was saturated with moisture .
the fact , however , turned out quite the contrary .
the <unk> gave a difference of <unk> degrees , between the temperature of the air , and the point at which dew was precipitated .
this difference was nearly double that which i had observed on the previous mornings .
this unusual degree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of lightning .
is it not an uncommon case , thus to find a remarkable degree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather ?
generally the atmosphere is hazy ; and this is caused by the falling of <unk> fine dust , which was found to have slightly injured the astronomical instruments .
the morning before we anchored at porto praya , i collected a little packet of this <unk> fine dust , which appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the vane at the masthead .
mr. lyell has also given me four packets of dust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these islands .
professor ehrenberg finds that this dust consists in great part of infusoria with siliceous shields , and of the siliceous tissue of plants .
( <unk> .
i must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my specimens .
i have sent ( <name> 1845 ) a full account of the falling of this dust to the geological society . )
in five little packets which i sent him , he has ascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms !
the infusoria , with the exception of two <name> species , are all inhabitants of fresh-water .
i have found no less than fifteen different accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the atlantic .
from the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen , and from its having always fallen during those months when the <unk> is known to raise clouds of dust high into the atmosphere , we may feel sure that it all comes from africa .
it is , however , a very singular fact , that , although professor ehrenberg knows many species of infusoria peculiar to africa , he finds none of these in the dust which i sent him .
on the other hand , he finds in it two species which hitherto he knows as living only in south <name> .
the dust falls in such quantities as to dirty everything on board , and to hurt people 's eyes ; vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the atmosphere .
it has often fallen on ships when several hundred , and even more than a thousand miles from the coast of africa , and at points sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction .
in some dust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land , i was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of an inch square , mixed with finer matter .
after this fact one need not be surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller <unk> of <unk> plants .
the geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural history .
on entering the harbour , a perfectly horizontal white band in the face of the sea <name> , may be seen running for some miles along the coast , and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water .
upon examination , this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous matter , with numerous shells embedded , most or all of which now exist on the neighbouring coast .
it rests on ancient volcanic rocks , and has been covered by a stream of basalt , which must have entered the sea when the white <name> bed was lying at the bottom .
it is interesting to trace the changes , produced by the heat of the overlying lava , on the friable mass , which in parts has been converted into a crystalline limestone , and in other parts into a compact spotted stone .
where the lime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower surface of the stream , it is converted into groups of beautifully <unk> fibres resembling <unk> .
the beds of lava rise in successive <unk> plains , towards the interior , whence the deluges of melted stone have originally proceeded .
within historical times no signs of volcanic activity have , i believe , been manifested in any part of st. jago .
even the form of a crater can but rarely be discovered on the summits of the many red <unk> hills ; yet the more recent streams can be distinguished on the coast , forming lines of cliffs of less height , but stretching out in advance of those belonging to an older series : the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude measure of the age of the streams .
during our stay , i observed the habits of some <name> animals .
a large <unk> is very common .
this <unk> is about five inches long ; and is of a dirty yellowish colour , <unk> with purple .
on each side of the lower surface , or foot , there is a broad membrane , which appears sometimes to act as a <unk> , in causing a current of water to flow over the dorsal branchiae or lungs .
it feeds on the delicate <unk> which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water ; and i found in its stomach several small pebbles , as in the gizzard of a bird .
this slug , when disturbed , emits a very fine <unk> fluid , which stains the water for the space of a foot around .
besides this means of defence , an acrid secretion , which is spread over its body , causes a sharp , stinging sensation , similar to that produced by the <unk> , or portuguese man-of-war .
i was much interested , on several occasions , by watching the habits of an <unk> , or cuttle-fish .
although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide , these animals were not easily caught .
by means of their long arms and suckers , they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices ; and when thus fixed , it required great force to remove them .
at other times they darted tail first , with the rapidity of an arrow , from one side of the pool to the other , at the same instant <unk> the water with a dark <unk> ink .
these animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary , <unk> power of changing their colour .
they appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass : when in deep water , their general shade was brownish purple , but when placed on the land , or in shallow water , this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green .
the colour , examined more carefully , was a french grey , with numerous minute spots of bright yellow : the former of these varied in intensity ; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns .
these changes were effected in such a manner that clouds , varying in tint between a <name> red and a <unk> , were continually passing over the body .
( 1/4 .
so named according to <name> <unk> 's nomenclature . )
any part , being subjected to a slight shock of <unk> , became almost black : a similar effect , but in a less degree , was produced by scratching the skin with a needle .
these clouds , or blushes as they may be called , are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids .
( <unk> .
see " encyclopedia of anatomy and physiology " article " <unk> . " )
this cuttle-fish displayed its <unk> power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom .
i was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual , which seemed fully aware that i was watching it .
remaining for a time motionless , it would then stealthily advance an inch or two , like a cat after a mouse ; sometimes changing its colour : it thus proceeded , till having gained a deeper part , it darted away , leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled .
while looking for <name> animals , with my head about two feet above the <name> shore , i was more than once saluted by a jet of water , accompanied by a slight grating noise .
at first i could not think what it was , but afterwards i found out that it was this cuttle-fish , which , though concealed in a hole , thus often led me to its discovery .
that it possesses the power of <unk> water there is no doubt , and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or <unk> on the under side of its body .
from the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads , they can not crawl with ease when placed on the ground .
i observed that one which i kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark .
st. <name> 's rocks .
in crossing the atlantic we <unk> , during the morning of february 16th , 1832 , close to the island of st. <name> 's .
this cluster of rocks is situated in 0 degrees 58 ' north latitude , and 29 degrees 15 ' west longitude .
it is <unk> miles distant from the coast of <name> , and 350 from the island of <name> noronha .
the highest point is only fifty feet above the level of the sea , and the entire circumference is under three-quarters of a mile .
this small point rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean .
its mineralogical constitution is not simple ; in some parts the rock is of a <unk> , in others of a feldspathic nature , including thin veins of serpentine .
it is a remarkable fact that all the many small islands , lying far from any continent , in the pacific , indian , and atlantic oceans , with the exception of the <unk> and this little point of rock , are , i believe , composed either of <name> or of erupted matter .
the volcanic nature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law , and the effect of those same causes , whether chemical or mechanical , from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either near <unk> or as islands in the midst of the sea .
( plate 4 .
incrustation of <name> sand . )
the rocks of st. <name> appear from a distance of a brilliantly white colour .
this is partly owing to the <name> of a vast multitude of <unk> , and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a <name> lustre , which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks .
this , when examined with a lens , is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers , its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch .
it contains much animal matter , and its origin , no doubt , is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds ' <name> .
below some small masses of <unk> at ascension , and on the <unk> islets , i found certain <unk> branching bodies , formed apparently in the same manner as the thin white coating on these rocks .
the branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae ( a family of hard calcareous <unk> ) , that in lately looking hastily over my collection i did not perceive the difference .
the globular extremities of the branches are of a <name> texture , like the enamel of teeth , but so hard as just to scratch plate-glass .
i may here mention , that on a part of the coast of ascension , where there is a vast accumulation of <name> sand , an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks , by the water of the sea , resembling , as represented in plate 4 , certain <unk> plants ( <unk> ) often seen on damp walls .
the surface of the fronds is beautifully glossy ; and those parts formed where fully exposed to the light , are of a jet black colour , but those shaded under ledges are only grey .
i have shown specimens of this incrustation to several geologists , and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous origin !
in its hardness and <unk>  in its polish , equal to that of the finest <unk>  in the bad smell given out , and loss of colour under the blowpipe  it shows a close similarity with living sea-shells .
moreover in sea-shells , it is known that the parts habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal , are of a paler colour than those fully exposed to the light , just as is the case with this incrustation .
when we remember that lime , either as a phosphate or carbonate , enters into the composition of the hard parts , such as bones and shells , of all living animals , it is an interesting physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of teeth , and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell , <unk> through inorganic means from dead organic matter  mocking , also , in shape , some of the lower vegetable productions .
( <unk> .
mr. <unk> and sir <name> brewster have described ( " philosophical transactions " 1836 <name> 65 ) a singular " artificial substance resembling shell . "
it is deposited in fine , transparent , highly polished , <unk> laminae , possessing peculiar optical properties , on the inside of a vessel , in which cloth , first prepared with glue and then with lime , is made to revolve rapidly in water .
it is much softer , more transparent , and contains more animal matter , than the natural incrustation at ascension ; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell . )
we found on st. <name> 's only two kinds of birds  the <unk> and the <unk> .
the former is a species of <unk> , and the latter a <unk> .
both are of a tame and stupid disposition , and are so unaccustomed to visitors , that i could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer .
the <unk> lays her eggs on the bare rock ; but the <unk> makes a very simple nest with seaweed .
by the side of many of these nests a small flying-fish was placed ; which i suppose , had been brought by the male bird for its partner .
it was amusing to watch how quickly a large and active crab ( <unk> ) , which inhabits the crevices of the rock , stole the fish from the side of the nest , as soon as we had disturbed the parent birds .
sir w. <unk> , one of the few persons who have landed here , informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even the young birds out of their nests , and devouring them .
not a single plant , not even a lichen , grows on this islet ; yet it is inhabited by several insects and spiders .
the following list <unk> , i believe , the terrestrial fauna : a fly ( <unk> ) living on the <unk> , and a tick which must have come here as a parasite on the birds ; a small brown moth , belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers ; a beetle ( <unk> ) and a woodlouse from beneath the <name> ; and lastly , numerous spiders , which i suppose prey on these small attendants and <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> description of the stately palm and other <name> tropical plants , then birds , and lastly man , taking possession of the <name> islets as soon as formed , in the pacific , is probably not quite correct ; i fear it destroys the poetry of this story , that feather and <unk> and parasitic insects and spiders should be the first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land .
the smallest rock in the tropical seas , by giving a foundation for the growth of innumerable kinds of seaweed and compound animals , supports likewise a large number of fish .
the sharks and the seamen in the boats maintained a constant struggle which should secure the greater share of the prey caught by the <unk> .
i have heard that a rock near the <unk> , lying many miles out at sea , and at a considerable depth , was first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed in the neighbourhood .
<name> noronha , february 20 , 1832 .
as far as i was enabled to observe , during the few hours we stayed at this place , the constitution of the island is volcanic , but probably not of a recent date .
the most remarkable feature is a conical hill , about one thousand feet high , the upper part of which is exceedingly steep , and on one side <unk> its base .
the rock is phonolite , and is divided into irregular columns .
on viewing one of these isolated masses , at first one is inclined to believe that it has been suddenly pushed up in a <unk> state .
at st. <name> , however , i ascertained that some pinnacles , of a nearly similar figure and constitution , had been formed by the injection of melted rock into yielding strata , which thus had formed the moulds for these gigantic <unk> .
the whole island is covered with wood ; but from the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance .
half-way up the mountain some great masses of the columnar rock , shaded by <unk> trees , and ornamented by others covered with fine pink flowers but without a single leaf , gave a pleasing effect to the nearer parts of the scenery .
bahia , or san <name> .
brazil , february 29 , 1832 .
the day has past delightfully .
delight itself , however , is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who , for the first time , has wandered by himself in a brazilian forest .
the elegance of the grasses , the novelty of the <unk> plants , the beauty of the flowers , the glossy green of the foliage , but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation , filled me with admiration .
a most paradoxical mixture of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood .
the noise from the insects is so loud , that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored several hundred yards from the shore ; yet within the recesses of the forest a universal silence appears to reign .
to a person fond of natural history , such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he can ever <name> to experience again .
after wandering about for some hours , i returned to the landing-place ; but , before reaching it , i was overtaken by a tropical storm .
i tried to find shelter under a tree , which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by common english rain ; but here , in a couple of minutes , a little torrent flowed down the trunk .
it is to this violence of the rain that we must attribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods : if the showers were like those of a colder clime , the greater part would be absorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground .
i <name> not at present attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this <name> bay , because , in our homeward voyage , we called here a second time , and i shall then have occasion to remark on it .
along the whole coast of brazil , for a length of at least 2000 miles , and certainly for a considerable space inland , wherever solid rock occurs , it belongs to a granitic formation .
the circumstance of this enormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists believe to have been crystallised when heated under pressure , gives rise to many curious reflections .
was this effect produced beneath the depths of a profound ocean ?
or did a covering of strata formerly extend over it , which has since been removed ?
can we believe that any power , acting for a time short of infinity , could have denuded the granite over so many thousand square leagues ?
on a point not far from the city , where a rivulet entered the sea , i observed a fact connected with a subject discussed by humboldt .
( <unk> .
" personal narrative " volume 5 part 1 <name> 18 . )
at the cataracts of the great rivers <unk> , nile , and congo , the <unk> rocks are coated by a black substance , appearing as if they had been polished with <unk> .
the layer is of extreme thinness ; and on analysis by <unk> it was found to consist of the oxides of manganese and iron .
in the <unk> it occurs on the rocks periodically washed by the floods , and in those parts alone where the stream is rapid ; or , as the indians say , " the rocks are black where the waters are white . "
here the coating is of a <name> brown instead of a black colour , and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone .
hand specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones which glitter in the sun 's rays .
they occur only within the limits of the tidal waves ; and as the rivulet slowly <unk> down , the surf must supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers .
in like manner , the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the periodical inundations ; and thus the same effects are produced under apparently different but really similar circumstances .
the origin , however , of these <unk> of metallic oxides , which seem as if cemented to the rocks , is not understood ; and no reason , i believe , can be assigned for their thickness remaining the same .
( plate 5 .
<unk> <unk> ( distended and contracted ) . )
one day i was amused by watching the habits of the <unk> <unk> , which was caught swimming near the shore .
this fish , with its <unk> skin , is well known to possess the singular power of <unk> itself into a nearly spherical form .
after having been taken out of water for a short time , and then again immersed in it , a considerable quantity both of water and air is absorbed by the mouth , and perhaps likewise by the branchial orifices .
this process is effected by two methods : the air is swallowed , and is then forced into the cavity of the body , its return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally visible : but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth , which is kept wide open and motionless ; this latter action must , therefore , depend on <unk> .
the skin about the abdomen is much <unk> than that on the back ; hence , during the inflation , the lower surface becomes far more distended than the upper ; and the fish , in consequence , floats with its back downwards .
cuvier doubts whether the <unk> in this position is able to swim ; but not only can it thus move forward in a straight line , but it can turn round to either side .
this latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the <unk> fins ; the tail being collapsed and not used .
from the body being buoyed up with so much air , the branchial openings are out of water , but a stream drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them .
the fish , having remained in this distended state for a short time , generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the branchial apertures and mouth .
it could emit , at <name> , a certain portion of the water , and it appears , therefore probable that this fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific gravity .
this <unk> possessed several means of defence .
it could give a severe bite , and could eject water from its mouth to some distance , at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of its jaws .
by the inflation of its body , the papillae , with which the skin is covered , become erect and pointed .
but the most curious circumstance is , that it <unk> from the skin of its belly , when handled , a most beautiful <unk> fibrous matter , which stains <name> and paper in so permanent a manner , that the tint is retained with all its brightness to the present day : i am quite ignorant of the nature and use of this secretion .
i have heard from dr. <name> of <unk> , that he has frequently found a <unk> , floating alive and distended , in the stomach of the shark ; and that on several occasions he has known it eat its way , not only through the coats of the stomach , but through the sides of the monster , which has thus been killed .
who would ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed the great and savage shark ?
march 18 , 1832 .
( plate 6 .
pelagic <unk> . )
we sailed from bahia .
a few days afterwards , when not far distant from the <unk> islets , my attention was called to a reddish-brown appearance in the sea .
the whole surface of the water , as it appeared under a weak lens , seemed as if covered by chopped bits of hay , with their ends jagged .
these are minute cylindrical <unk> , in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each .
mr. berkeley informs me that they are the same species ( <unk> <unk> ) with that found over large spaces in the red sea , and whence its name of red sea is derived .
( 1/8 .
m. <unk> in " <unk> rendus " etc .
<unk> 1844 ; and " annales des sciences <unk> " december 1844 . )
their <name> must be infinite : the ship passed through several bands of them , one of which was about ten yards wide , and , judging from the <unk> colour of the water , at least two and a half miles long .
in almost every long voyage some account is given of these <unk> .
they appear especially common in the sea near australia ; and off cape <unk> i found an allied , but smaller and apparently different species .
captain cook , in his third voyage , remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the name of <unk> .
near keeling atoll , in the indian ocean , i observed many little masses of <unk> a few inches square , consisting of long cylindrical threads of excessive thinness , so as to be barely visible to the naked eye , mingled with other rather larger bodies , finely conical at both ends .
two of these are shown in plate 6 united together .
they vary in length from <unk> to <unk> , and even to <unk> of an inch in length ; and in diameter from <unk> to <unk> of an inch .
near one extremity of the cylindrical part , a green <unk> , formed of granular matter , and thickest in the middle , may generally be seen .
this , i believe , is the bottom of a most delicate , colourless sac , composed of a pulpy substance , which lines the exterior case , but does not extend within the extreme conical points .
in some specimens , small but perfect spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the <unk> ; and i observed the curious process by which they were produced .
the pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into lines , some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre ; it then continued , with an irregular and rapid movement , to contract itself , so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a perfect little sphere , which occupied the position of the <unk> at one end of the now quite hollow case .
the formation of the granular sphere was hastened by any accidental injury .
i may add , that frequently a pair of these bodies were attached to each other , as represented above , cone beside cone , at that end where the <unk> occurs .
i <name> here add a few other observations connected with the <unk> of the sea from organic causes .
on the coast of chile , a few leagues north of <name> , the " beagle " one day passed through great bands of muddy water , exactly like that of a swollen river ; and again , a degree south of valparaiso , when fifty miles from the land , the same appearance was still more extensive .
some of the water placed in a glass was of a pale reddish tint ; and , examined under a microscope , was seen to swarm with minute <unk> darting about , and often exploding .
their shape is oval , and contracted in the middle by a ring of vibrating curved <unk> .
it was , however , very difficult to examine them with care , for almost the instant motion ceased , even while crossing the field of vision , their bodies burst .
sometimes both ends burst at once , sometimes only one , and a quantity of coarse , brownish , granular matter was ejected .
the animal an instant before bursting expanded to half again its natural size ; and the explosion took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had ceased : in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a <unk> movement on the longer axis .
about two minutes after any number were isolated in a drop of water , they thus perished .
the animals move with the narrow apex forwards , by the aid of their vibratory <unk> , and generally by rapid starts .
they are exceedingly minute , and quite invisible to the naked eye , only covering a space equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch .
their <name> were infinite ; for the smallest drop of water which i could remove contained very many .
in one day we passed through two spaces of water thus stained , one of which alone must have extended over several square miles .
what incalculable <name> of these microscopical animals !
the colour of the water , as seen at some distance , was like that of a river which has flowed through a red <name> district ; but under the shade of the vessel 's side it was quite as dark as chocolate .
the line where the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined .
the weather for some days previously had been calm , and the ocean abounded , to an unusual degree , with living creatures .
( <unk> .
m. lesson " voyage de la <unk> " tome 1 <name> 255 , mentions red water off lima , apparently produced by the same cause .
<unk> , the distinguished naturalist , in the " voyage aux <unk> <unk> , " gives no less than twelve references to voyagers who have alluded to the discoloured waters of the sea ( volume 2 <name> 239 ) .
to the references given by <unk> may be added , humboldt 's " personal narrative " volume 6 <name> <unk> ; <unk> " voyage " volume 1 <name> 92 ; <unk> , volume 1 <name> 287 ; <unk> 's " voyage " ; " voyage of the <unk> and of the <unk> " ; captain king 's " survey of australia " etc . )
in the sea around <name> <name> fuego , and at no great distance from the land , i have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour , from the number of crustacea , which somewhat resemble in form large <unk> .
the sealers call them <unk> .
whether whales feed on them i do not know ; but terns , <unk> , and immense herds of great unwieldy seals derive , on some parts of the coast , their chief sustenance from these swimming crabs .
seamen invariably attribute the <unk> of the water to spawn ; but i found this to be the case only on one occasion .
at the distance of several leagues from the archipelago of the galapagos , the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish , or <unk> water ; these strips were some miles long , but only a few yards wide , and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous yet distinct margin .
the colour was caused by little gelatinous balls , about the fifth of an inch in diameter , in which numerous minute spherical ovules were embedded : they were of two distinct kinds , one being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other .
i can not form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these belonged .
captain <unk> remarks that this appearance is very common among the galapagos islands , and that the direction of the bands indicates that of the currents ; in the described case , however , the line was caused by the wind .
the only other appearance which i have to notice , is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent colours .
i saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the coast of brazil ; the seamen attributed it to the <unk> carcass of some whale , which probably was floating at no great distance .
i do not here mention the minute gelatinous particles , hereafter to be referred to , which are frequently dispersed throughout the water , for they are not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour .
there are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear remarkable : first , how do the various bodies which form the bands with defined edges keep together ?
in the case of the <unk> crabs , their movements were as <unk> as in a regiment of soldiers ; but this can not happen from anything like voluntary action with the ovules , or the <unk> , nor is it probable among the infusoria .
secondly , what causes the length and narrowness of the bands ?
the appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent , where the stream <unk> into long streaks the froth collected in the eddies , that i must attribute the effect to a similar action either of the currents of the air or sea .
under this supposition we must believe that the various organised bodies are produced in certain favourable places , and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water .
i confess , however , there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of <unk> and <unk> : for whence come the germs at such points ?  the parent bodies having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean .
but on no other hypothesis can i understand their linear grouping .
i may add that <unk> remarks that green water abounding with pelagic animals is invariably found in a certain part of the arctic sea .

<name> 4 to july 5 , 1832 .
a few days after our arrival i became acquainted with an englishman who was going to visit his estate , situated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital , to the northward of cape <unk> .
i gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing me to accompany him .
<name> 8 , 1832 .
our party amounted to seven .
the first stage was very interesting .
the day was powerfully hot , and as we passed through the woods , everything was motionless , excepting the large and brilliant butterflies , which lazily fluttered about .
the view seen when crossing the hills behind <unk> grande was most beautiful ; the colours were intense , and the prevailing tint a dark blue ; the sky and the calm waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour .
after passing through some cultivated country , we entered a forest which in the grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded .
we arrived by midday at <unk> ; this small village is situated on a plain , and round the central house are the huts of the negroes .
these , from their regular form and position , reminded me of the drawings of the hottentot habitations in southern africa .
as the moon rose early , we determined to start the same evening for our <unk> at the <unk> <name> .
as it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive , bare , and steep hills of granite which are so common in this country .
this spot is notorious from having been , for a long time , the residence of some runaway slaves , who , by cultivating a little ground near the top , contrived to <unk> out a subsistence .
at length they were discovered , and a party of soldiers being sent , the whole were seized with the exception of one old woman , who , sooner than again be led into slavery , dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain .
in a <name> matron this would have been called the <name> love of freedom : in a poor negress it is mere brutal obstinacy .
we continued riding for some hours .
for the few last miles the road was intricate , and it passed through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons .
the scene by the dimmed light of the moon was most desolate .
a few <unk> flitted by us ; and the solitary snipe , as it rose , uttered its plaintive cry .
the distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night .
<name> 9 , 1832 .
we left our miserable <unk> before sunrise .
the road passed through a narrow <name> plain , lying between the sea and the interior salt lagoons .
the number of beautiful fishing birds , such as egrets and cranes , and the succulent plants assuming most <unk> forms , gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have possessed .
the few stunted trees were loaded with <unk> plants , among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the <unk> were most to be admired .
as the sun rose , the day became extremely hot , and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very distressing .
we dined at <unk> ; the thermometer in the shade being 84 degrees .
the beautiful view of the distant wooded hills , reflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon , quite refreshed us .
as the <unk> here was a very good one , and i have the pleasant , but rare remembrance , of an excellent dinner , i <name> be grateful and presently describe it , as the type of its class .
( <unk> .
<unk> , the portuguese name for an inn . )
these houses are often large , and are built of thick upright posts , with boughs <unk> , and afterwards plastered .
they seldom have floors , and never glazed windows ; but are generally pretty well roofed .
universally the front part is open , forming a kind of verandah , in which tables and benches are placed .
the bedrooms join on each side , and here the passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can , on a wooden platform covered by a thin straw mat .
the <unk> stands in a courtyard , where the horses are fed .
on first arriving , it was our custom to <unk> the horses and give them their indian corn ; then , with a low bow , to ask the <unk> to do us the favour to give us something to eat .
" anything you choose , sir , " was his usual answer .
for the few first times , vainly i thanked providence for having guided us to so good a man .
the conversation proceeding , the case universally became deplorable .
" any fish can you do us the favour of giving ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
 " any soup ? "
 " no , sir . "
 " any bread ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
 " any dried meat ? "
 " oh no , sir . "
if we were lucky , by waiting a couple of hours , we obtained fowls , rice , and <unk> .
it not unfrequently happened that we were obliged to kill , with stones , the poultry for our own supper .
when , thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger , we <unk> hinted that we should be glad of our meal , the pompous , and ( though true ) most unsatisfactory answer was , " it <name> be ready when it is ready . "
if we had dared to remonstrate any further , we should have been told to proceed on our journey , as being too impertinent .
the hosts are most <unk> and disagreeable in their manners ; their houses and their persons are often <unk> dirty ; the want of the accommodation of forks , knives , and spoons is common ; and i am sure no cottage or hovel in england could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every comfort .
at <unk> <unk> , however , we fared sumptuously ; having rice and fowls , biscuit , wine , and spirits , for dinner ; coffee in the evening , and fish with coffee for breakfast .
all this , with good food for the horses , only cost 2 shillings 6 pence per head .
yet the host of this <unk> , being asked if he knew anything of a whip which one of the party had lost , gruffly answered , " how should i know ?
why did you not take care of it ?  i suppose the dogs have eaten it . "
leaving <unk> , we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness of lakes ; in some of which were fresh , in others salt water shells .
of the former kind , i found a <unk> in great <name> in a lake , into which the inhabitants assured me that the sea enters once a year , and sometimes oftener , and makes the water quite salt .
i have no doubt many interesting facts in relation to <name> and fresh-water animals might be observed in this chain of lagoons which skirt the coast of brazil .
m. <name> has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of rio shells of the <name> genera <unk> and mytilus , and fresh-water <unk> , living together in brackish water .
( <unk> .
" annales des sciences <unk> " for 1833 . )
i also frequently observed in the lagoon near the botanic garden , where the water is only a little less salt than in the sea , a species of <unk> , very similar to a <unk> common in the ditches of england : in the same lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in <unk> .
( plate 9 .

head , full size . )
leaving the coast for a time , we again entered the forest .
the trees were very lofty , and remarkable , compared with those of europe , from the whiteness of their trunks .
i see by my notebook , " wonderful and beautiful flowering parasites , " invariably struck me as the most novel object in these grand scenes .
travelling onwards we passed through tracts of pasturage , much injured by the enormous conical ants ' nests , which were nearly twelve feet high .
they gave to the plain exactly the appearance of the mud volcanoes at <unk> , as figured by humboldt .
we arrived at <unk> after it was dark , having been ten hours on horseback .
i never ceased , during the whole journey , to be surprised at the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring ; they appeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our english breed .
the <unk> bat is often the cause of much trouble , by biting the horses on their withers .
the injury is generally not so much owing to the loss of blood , as to the inflammation which the pressure of the saddle afterwards produces .
the whole circumstance has lately been doubted in england ; i was therefore fortunate in being present when one ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> . )
was actually caught on a horse 's back .
we were <unk> late one evening near coquimbo , in chile , when my servant , noticing that one of the horses was very restive , went to see what was the matter , and <unk> he could distinguish something , suddenly put his hand on the beast 's withers , and secured the <unk> .
in the morning the spot where the bite had been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and bloody .
the third day afterwards we rode the horse , without any ill effects .
<name> 13 , 1832 .
after three days ' travelling we arrived at <unk> , the estate of <unk> <name> <unk> , a relation of one of our party .
the house was simple , and , though like a barn in form , was well suited to the climate .
in the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls , thatched roof , and windows without glass .
the house , together with the granaries , the stables , and workshops for the blacks , who had been taught various trades , formed a rude kind of <unk> ; in the centre of which a large pile of coffee was drying .
these buildings stand on a little hill , overlooking the cultivated ground , and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green luxuriant forest .
the chief produce of this part of the country is coffee .
each tree is supposed to yield annually , on an average , two pounds ; but some give as much as eight .
<unk> or <unk> is likewise cultivated in great quantity .
every part of this plant is useful : the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses , and the roots are ground into a pulp , which , when pressed dry and baked , forms the <unk> , the principal article of sustenance in the <unk> .
it is a curious , though well-known fact , that the juice of this most nutritious plant is highly poisonous .
a few years ago a cow died at this <unk> , in consequence of having drunk some of it .
<unk> <unk> told me that he had planted , the year before , one bag of <unk> or beans , and three of rice ; the former of which produced eighty , and the latter three hundred and twenty fold .
the pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle , and the woods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days .
this profusion of food showed itself at dinner , where , if the tables did not groan , the guests surely did ; for each person is expected to eat of every dish .
one day , having , as i thought , nicely calculated so that nothing should go away <unk> , to my utter dismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial reality .
during the meals , it was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds , and dozens of little black children , which crawled in together , at every opportunity .
as long as the idea of slavery could be banished , there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and <unk> style of living : it was such a perfect retirement and independence from the rest of the world .
as soon as any stranger is seen arriving , a large <name> is set tolling , and generally some small cannon are fired .
the event is thus announced to the rocks and woods , but to nothing else .
one morning i walked out an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene ; at last , the silence was broken by the morning hymn , raised on high by the whole body of the blacks ; and in this manner their daily work is generally begun .
on such <unk> as these , i have no doubt the slaves pass happy and contented lives .
on saturday and <name> they work for themselves , and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week .
<name> 14 , 1832 .
( plate 10 .
virgin forest . )
leaving <unk> , we rode to another estate on the rio <unk> , which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction .
the estate was two and a half miles long , and the owner had forgotten how many broad .
only a very small piece had been cleared , yet almost every acre was capable of yielding all the various <name> productions of a tropical land .
considering the enormous area of brazil , the proportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as anything compared to that which is left in the state of nature : at some future age , how vast a population it <name> support !
during the second day 's journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers .
the forest abounded with beautiful objects ; among which the tree ferns , though not large , were , from their bright green foliage , and the elegant curvature of their fronds , most worthy of admiration .
in the evening it rained very heavily , and although the thermometer stood at 65 degrees , i felt very cold .
as soon as the rain ceased , it was curious to observe the extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the forest .
at the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a dense white vapour , which rose like columns of smoke from the most <unk> parts , and especially from the valleys .
i observed this phenomenon on several occasions : i suppose it is owing to the large surface of foliage , previously heated by the sun 's rays .
while staying at this estate , i was very nearly being an <unk> to one of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave country .
owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit , the owner was on the point of taking all the women and children from the male slaves , and selling them separately at the public auction at rio .
interest , and not any feeling of compassion , prevented this act .
indeed , i do not believe the <unk> of separating thirty families , who had lived together for many years , even occurred to the owner .
yet i <name> pledge myself , that in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of men .
it may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest and selfish habit .
i may mention one very trifling anecdote , which at the time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty .
i was crossing a ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid .
in endeavouring to make him understand , i talked loud , and made signs , in doing which i passed my hand near his face .
he , i suppose , thought i was in a passion , and was going to strike him ; for instantly , with a frightened look and half-shut eyes , he dropped his hands .
i shall never forget my feelings of surprise , disgust , and shame , at seeing a great powerful man afraid even to <name> off a blow , directed , as he thought , at his face .
this man had been trained to a degradation lower than the slavery of the most helpless animal .
<name> 18 , 1832 .
( plate 11 .
cabbage palm . )
in returning we spent two days at <unk> , and i employed them in collecting insects in the forest .
the greater number of trees , although so lofty , are not more than three or four feet in circumference .
there are , of course , a few of much greater <unk> .
<unk> <name> was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid trunk , which had originally been 110 feet long , and of great thickness .
the contrast of palm trees , growing amidst the common branching kinds , never fails to give the scene an intertropical character .
here the woods were ornamented by the cabbage palm  one of the most beautiful of its family .
with a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two hands , it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet above the ground .
the woody creepers , themselves covered by other creepers , were of great thickness : some which i measured were two feet in circumference .
many of the older trees presented a very curious appearance from the tresses of a <name> hanging from their boughs , and resembling bundles of hay .
if the eye was turned from the world of foliage above , to the ground beneath , it was attracted by the extreme elegance of the leaves of the ferns and <unk> .
the latter , in some parts , covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high .
in walking across these thick beds of <unk> , a broad track was marked by the change of shade , produced by the drooping of their sensitive petioles .
it is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes ; but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder , astonishment , and devotion , which fill and elevate the mind .
( plate 12 .
<unk> or <unk> . )
<name> 19 , 1832 .
leaving <unk> , during the two first days we retraced our steps .
it was very wearisome work , as the road generally ran across a glaring hot <name> plain , not far from the coast .
i noticed that each time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand , a gentle chirping noise was produced .
on the third day we took a different line , and passed through the <name> little village of <unk> de <unk> .
this is one of the principal lines of road in brazil ; yet it was in so bad a state that no wheel vehicle , excepting the clumsy <unk> , could pass along .
in our whole journey we did not cross a single bridge built of stone ; and those made of logs of wood were frequently so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid them .
all distances are <unk> known .
the road is often marked by crosses , in the place of <unk> , to signify where human blood has been spilled .
on the evening of the 23rd we arrived at rio , having finished our pleasant little excursion .
during the remainder of my stay at rio , i resided in a cottage at <unk> bay .
it was impossible to wish for anything more delightful than thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country .
in england any person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great advantage , by always having something to attract his attention ; but in these fertile climates , teeming with life , the attractions are so numerous , that he is scarcely able to walk at all .
the few observations which i was enabled to make were almost exclusively confined to the <unk> animals .
the existence of a division of the genus <unk> , which inhabits the dry land , interested me much .
these animals are of so simple a structure , that cuvier has arranged them with the intestinal worms , though never found within the bodies of other animals .
numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh water ; but those to which i allude were found , even in the <unk> parts of the forest , beneath logs of rotten wood , on which i believe they feed .
in general form they resemble little slugs , but are very much narrower in proportion , and several of the species are beautifully coloured with longitudinal stripes .
their structure is very simple : near the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small transverse slits , from the anterior one of which a <unk> and highly irritable mouth can be protruded .
for some time after the rest of the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any other cause , this organ still retained its vitality .
i found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial <unk> in different parts of the southern hemisphere .
( <unk> .
i have described and named these species in the " annals of natural history " volume 14 <name> 241 . )
some specimens which i obtained at van <unk> 's land , i kept alive for nearly two months , feeding them on rotten wood .
having cut one of them transversely into two nearly equal parts , in the course of a fortnight both had the shape of perfect animals .
i had , however , so divided the body , that one of the halves contained both the inferior orifices , and the other , in consequence , none .
in the course of twenty-five days from the operation , the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from any other specimen .
the other had increased much in size ; and towards its posterior end , a clear space was formed in the <unk> mass , in which a rudimentary <unk> mouth could clearly be distinguished ; on the under surface , however , no corresponding slit was yet open .
if the increased heat of the weather , as we approached the equator , had not destroyed all the individuals , there can be no doubt that this last step would have completed its structure .
although so well known an experiment , it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every essential organ , out of the simple extremity of another animal .
it is extremely difficult to preserve these <unk> ; as soon as the cessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act , their entire bodies become soft and fluid , with a rapidity which i have never seen equalled .
i first visited the forest in which these <unk> were found , in company with an old portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him .
the sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs , and then patiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear .
we were accompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer  a good specimen of a wild brazilian youth .
he was dressed in a tattered old shirt and trousers , and had his head uncovered : he carried an old-fashioned gun and a large knife .
the habit of carrying the knife is universal ; and in traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary , on account of the creeping plants .
the frequent occurrence of murder may be partly attributed to this habit .
the <unk> are so dexterous with the knife that they can throw it to some distance with precision , and with sufficient force to cause a fatal wound .
i have seen a number of little boys practising this <name> as a game of play , and from their skill in hitting an upright stick , they promised well for more <name> attempts .
my companion , the day before , had shot two large bearded monkeys .
these animals have prehensile tails , the extremity of which , even after death , can support the whole weight of the body .
one of them thus remained fast to a branch , and it was necessary to cut down a large tree to procure it .
this was soon effected , and down came tree and monkey with an awful crash .
our day 's sport , besides the monkey , was confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans .
i profited , however , by my acquaintance with the portuguese padre , for on another occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the <unk> cat .
every one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near <unk> .
the house in which i lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain of the <unk> .
it has been remarked , with much truth , that abruptly conical hills are characteristic of the formation which humboldt <unk> as <unk> .
nothing can be more striking than the effect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the most luxuriant vegetation .
i was often interested by watching the clouds , which , rolling in from seaward , formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the <unk> .
this mountain , like most others , when thus partly veiled , appeared to rise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of <unk> feet .
mr. <name> has observed , in his <unk> essays , that a cloud sometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit , while the wind continues to blow over it .
the same phenomenon here presented a slightly different appearance .
in this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl over , and rapidly pass by the summit , and yet was neither diminished nor increased in size .
the sun was setting , and a gentle southerly breeze , striking against the southern side of the rock , mingled its current with the colder air above ; and the vapour was thus condensed : but as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge , and came within the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping bank , they were immediately <unk> .
the climate , during the months of may and <name> , or the beginning of <name> , was delightful .
the mean temperature , from observations taken at nine o'clock , both morning and evening , was only 72 degrees .
it often rained heavily , but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the walks pleasant .
one morning , in the course of six hours , <unk> inches of rain fell .
as this storm passed over the forests which surround the <unk> , the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless multitude of leaves was very remarkable , it could be heard at the distance of a quarter of a mile , and was like the rushing of a great body of water .
after the hotter days , it was delicious to sit quietly in the garden and watch the evening pass into night .
nature , in these climes , chooses her <unk> from more humble performers than in europe .
a small frog , of the genus <unk> , sits on a blade of grass about an inch above the surface of the water , and sends forth a pleasing chirp : when several are together they sing in <name> on different notes .
i had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this frog .
the genus <unk> has its toes terminated by small suckers ; and i found this animal could crawl up a pane of glass , when placed absolutely perpendicular .
various <unk> and crickets , at the same time , keep up a ceaseless shrill cry , but which , softened by the distance , is not unpleasant .
every evening after dark this great concert commenced ; and often have i sat listening to it , until my attention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect .
at these times the <unk> are seen flitting about from hedge to hedge .
on a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred paces distant .
it is remarkable that in all the different kinds of <unk> , shining <unk> , and various <name> animals ( such as the crustacea , <unk> , <unk> , a coralline of the genus <unk> , and <unk> ) , which i have observed , the light has been of a well-marked green colour .
all the <unk> , which i caught here , belonged to the <unk> ( in which family the english <unk> is included ) , and the greater number of specimens were of <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> .
i am greatly indebted to mr. waterhouse for his kindness in naming for me this and many other insects , and giving me much valuable assistance . )
i found that this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated : in the intervals , the abdominal rings were obscured .
the flash was almost <unk> in the two rings , but it was just perceptible first in the anterior one .
the shining matter was fluid and very adhesive : little spots , where the skin had been torn , continued bright with a slight <unk> , whilst the uninjured parts were obscured .
when the insect was <unk> the rings remained uninterruptedly bright , but not so brilliant as before : local irritation with a needle always increased the vividness of the light .
the rings in one instance retained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the death of the insect .
from these facts it would appear probable , that the animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light for short intervals , and that at other times the display is involuntary .
on the muddy and wet <unk> i found the larvae of this <unk> in great <name> : they resembled in general form the female of the english <unk> .
these larvae possessed but feeble luminous powers ; very differently from their parents , on the slightest touch they feigned death , and ceased to shine ; nor did irritation excite any fresh display .
i kept several of them alive for some time : their tails are very singular organs , for they act , by a <unk> contrivance , as suckers or organs of attachment , and likewise as <unk> for saliva , or some such fluid .
i repeatedly fed them on raw meat ; and i invariably observed , that every now and then the extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth , and a drop of fluid <unk> on the meat , which was then in the act of being consumed .
the tail , notwithstanding so much practice , does not seem to be able to find its way to the mouth ; at least the neck was always touched first , and apparently as a guide .
when we were at bahia , an <unk> or beetle ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> . )
seemed the most common luminous insect .
the light in this case was also rendered more brilliant by irritation .
i amused myself one day by observing the springing powers of this insect , which have not , as it appears to me , been properly described .
( <unk> .
<name> 's " entomology " volume 2 <name> 317 . )
the <unk> , when placed on its back and preparing to spring , moved its head and thorax backwards , so that the <unk> spine was drawn out , and rested on the edge of its sheath .
the same backward movement being continued , the spine , by the full action of the muscles , was bent like a spring ; and the insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and <unk> .
the effort being suddenly relaxed , the head and thorax flew up , and in consequence , the base of the <unk> struck the supporting surface with such force , that the insect by the reaction was jerked upwards to the height of one or two inches .
the projecting points of the thorax , and the sheath of the spine , served to steady the whole body during the spring .
in the descriptions which i have read , sufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity of the spine : so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple muscular contraction , without the aid of some mechanical contrivance .
on several occasions i enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions in the neighbouring country .
one day i went to the botanic garden , where many plants , well known for their great utility , might be seen growing .
the leaves of the camphor , pepper , <unk> , and <unk> trees were delightfully <unk> ; and the <unk> , the <unk> , and the mango , vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage .
the landscape in the neighbourhood of bahia almost takes its character from the two latter trees .
before seeing them , i had no idea that any trees could cast so black a shade on the ground .
both of them bear to the evergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which laurels and <unk> in england do to the lighter green of the <unk> trees .
it may be observed that the houses within the tropics are surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation , because many of them are at the same time most useful to man .
who can doubt that these qualities are united in the banana , the cocoa-nut , the many kinds of palm , the orange , and the <unk> tree ?
during this day i was particularly struck with a remark of humboldt 's , who often alludes to " the thin vapour which , without changing the transparency of the air , renders its tints more harmonious , and <unk> its effects . "
this is an appearance which i have never observed in the temperate zones .
the atmosphere , seen through a short space of half or three-quarters of a mile , was perfectly lucid , but at a greater distance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze , of a pale french grey , mingled with a little blue .
the condition of the atmosphere between the morning and about noon , when the effect was most evident , had undergone little change , excepting in its dryness .
in the interval , the difference between the dew point and temperature had increased from <unk> to 17 degrees .
on another occasion i started early and walked to the <unk> , or <unk> mountain .
the air was delightfully cool and fragrant ; and the drops of dew still glittered on the leaves of the large <unk> plants , which shaded the <unk> of clear water .
sitting down on a block of granite , it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as they flew past .
the humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady retired spots .
whenever i saw these little creatures buzzing round a flower , with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely visible , i was reminded of the sphinx moths : their movements and habits are indeed in many respects very similar .
( plate 13 .
rio de janeiro . )
following a pathway i entered a <name> forest , and from a height of five or six hundred feet , one of those splendid views was presented , which are so common on every side of rio .
at this elevation the landscape attains its most brilliant tint ; and every form , every shade , so completely <unk> in magnificence all that the european has ever beheld in his own country , that he knows not how to express his feelings .
the general effect frequently recalled to my mind the <unk> scenery of the <unk> or the great theatres .
i never returned from these excursions empty-handed .
this day i found a specimen of a curious fungus , called <unk> .
most people know the english <unk> , which in autumn <unk> the air with its odious smell : this , however , as the entomologist is aware , is to some of our beetles a delightful fragrance .
so was it here ; for a <unk> , attracted by the odour , alighted on the fungus as i carried it in my hand .
we here see in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and insects of the same families , though the species of both are different .
when man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species this relation is often broken : as one instance of this i may mention that the leaves of the cabbages and <unk> , which in england afford food to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars , in the gardens near rio are untouched .
during our stay at brazil i made a large collection of insects .
a few general observations on the comparative importance of the different orders may be interesting to the english entomologist .
the large and <unk> lepidoptera <unk> the zone they inhabit , far more plainly than any other race of animals .
i allude only to the butterflies ; for the moths , contrary to what might have been expected from the <unk> of the vegetation , certainly appeared in much fewer <name> than in our own temperate regions .
i was much surprised at the habits of papilio <unk> .
this butterfly is not uncommon , and generally <unk> the <unk> .
although a high <unk> , yet it very frequently alights on the trunks of trees .
on these occasions its head is invariably placed downwards ; and its wings are expanded in a horizontal plane , instead of being folded vertically , as is commonly the case .
this is the only butterfly which i have ever seen that uses its legs for running .
not being aware of this fact , the insect , more than once , as i cautiously approached with my <unk> , shuffled on one side just as the instrument was on the point of closing , and thus escaped .
but a far more singular fact is the power which this species possesses of making a noise .
( <unk> .
mr. doubleday has lately described ( before the entomological society , march 3 , 1845 ) a peculiar structure in the wings of this butterfly , which seems to be the means of its making its noise .
he says , " it is remarkable for having a sort of drum at the base of the fore wings , between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
these two nervures , moreover , have a peculiar <unk> diaphragm or vessel in the interior . "
i find in <unk> 's travels ( in the years <unk> <name> 74 ) it is said , that in the island of st. <unk> on the coast of brazil , a butterfly called <unk> <unk> , makes a noise , when flying away , like a rattle . )
several times when a pair , probably male and female , were chasing each other in an irregular course , they passed within a few yards of me ; and i distinctly heard a clicking noise , similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a spring catch .
the noise was continued at short intervals , and could be distinguished at about twenty yards ' distance : i am certain there is no error in the observation .
i was disappointed in the general aspect of the coleoptera .
the number of minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great .
( <unk> .
i may mention , as a common instance of one day 's ( <name> 23rd ) collecting , when i was not attending particularly to the coleoptera , that i caught sixty-eight species of that order .
among these , there were only two of the <unk> , four <unk> , fifteen <unk> , and fourteen of the <unk> .
thirty-seven species of <unk> , which i brought home , <name> be sufficient to prove that i was not paying overmuch attention to the generally favoured order of coleoptera . )
the cabinets of europe can , as yet , boast only of the larger species from tropical climates .
it is sufficient to disturb the composure of an entomologist 's mind , to look forward to the future dimensions of a complete catalogue .
the carnivorous beetles , or <unk> , appear in extremely few <name> within the tropics : this is the more remarkable when compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds , which are so abundant in hot countries .
i was struck with this observation both on entering brazil , and when i saw the many elegant and active forms of the <unk> <unk> on the temperate plains of la plata .
do the very numerous spiders and <unk> hymenoptera supply the place of the carnivorous beetles ?
the <unk> and <unk> are very uncommon ; on the other hand , the <unk> and <unk> , all of which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence , are present in astonishing <name> .
i do not here refer to the number of different species , but to that of the individual insects ; for on this it is that the most striking character in the entomology of different countries depends .
the orders orthoptera and <unk> are particularly numerous ; as likewise is the stinging division of the hymenoptera ; the bees , perhaps , being excepted .
a person , on first entering a tropical forest , is astonished at the labours of the ants : <unk> paths branch off in every direction , on which an army of <unk> <unk> may be seen , some going forth , and others returning , burdened with pieces of green leaf , often larger than their own bodies .
a small dark-coloured ant sometimes <unk> in countless <name> .
one day , at bahia , my attention was drawn by observing many spiders , <unk> , and other insects , and some lizards , rushing in the greatest agitation across a bare piece of ground .
a little way behind , every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant .
the swarm having crossed the bare space , divided itself , and descended an old wall .
by this means many insects were fairly enclosed ; and the efforts which the poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death were wonderful .
when the ants came to the road they changed their course , and in narrow files <unk> the wall .
having placed a small stone so as to intercept one of the lines , the whole body attacked it , and then immediately retired .
shortly afterwards another body came to the charge , and again having failed to make any impression , this line of march was entirely given up .
by going an inch round , the file might have avoided the stone , and this doubtless would have happened , if it had been originally there : but having been attacked , the <unk> little warriors scorned the idea of yielding .
certain <unk> insects , which construct in the corners of the verandahs <name> cells for their larvae , are very numerous in the neighbourhood of rio .
these cells they stuff full of <unk> spiders and caterpillars , which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive , until their eggs are hatched ; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless , <unk> victims  a sight which has been described by an enthusiastic naturalist as curious and pleasing !

i was much interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a <unk> and a large spider of the genus <unk> .
the wasp made a sudden dash at its prey , and then flew away : the spider was evidently wounded , for , trying to escape , it rolled down a little slope , but had still strength sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass .
the wasp soon returned , and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim .
it then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox ; making short semicircular casts , and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings and antennae .
the spider , though well concealed , was soon discovered , and the wasp , evidently still afraid of its <unk> jaws , after much manoeuvring , inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax .
at last , carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless spider , it proceeded to drag away the body .
but i stopped both tyrant and prey .
( <unk> .
<name> <name> azara volume 1 <name> 175 , mentioning a hymenopterous insect , probably of the same genus , says he saw it dragging a dead spider through tall grass , in a straight line to its nest , which was one hundred and sixty-three paces distant .
he adds that the wasp , in order to find the road , every now and then made " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . " )
the number of spiders , in proportion to other insects , is here compared with england very much larger ; perhaps more so than with any other division of the articulate animals .
the variety of species among the jumping spiders appears almost infinite .
the genus , or rather family of epeira , is here characterized by many singular forms ; some species have pointed <unk> shells , others enlarged and <unk> <unk> .
every path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a species , belonging to the same division with the epeira <unk> of fabricius , which was formerly said by <unk> to make , in the west indies , webs so strong as to catch birds .
a small and pretty kind of spider , with very long fore-legs , and which appears to belong to an <unk> genus , lives as a parasite on almost every one of these webs .
i suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great epeira , and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects , which , adhering to the lines , would otherwise be wasted .
when frightened , this little spider either <unk> death by extending its front legs , or suddenly drops from the web .
a large epeira of the same division with epeira <unk> and <unk> is extremely common , especially in dry situations .
its web , which is generally placed among the great leaves of the common <unk> , is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a pair or even four zigzag ribbons , which connect two adjoining rays .
when any large insect , as a grasshopper or wasp , is caught , the spider , by a dexterous movement , makes it revolve very rapidly , and at the same time emitting a band of threads from its <unk> , soon <unk> its prey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm .
the spider now examines the powerless victim , and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of its thorax ; then retreating , patiently waits till the poison has taken effect .
the <unk> of this poison may be judged of from the fact that in half a minute i opened the <unk> , and found a large wasp quite lifeless .
this epeira always stands with its head downwards near the centre of the web .
when disturbed , it acts differently according to circumstances : if there is a thicket below , it suddenly falls down ; and i have distinctly seen the thread from the <unk> lengthened by the animal while yet stationary , as preparatory to its fall .
if the ground is clear beneath , the epeira seldom falls , but moves quickly through a central passage from one to the other side .
when still further disturbed , it <unk> a most curious manoeuvre : standing in the middle , it violently jerks the web , which is attached to elastic twigs , till at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement , that even the outline of the spider 's body becomes indistinct .
it is well known that most of the british spiders , when a large insect is caught in their webs , endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their prey , to save their nets from being entirely spoiled .
i once , however , saw in a hot-house in shropshire a large female wasp caught in the irregular web of a quite small spider ; and this spider , instead of cutting the web , most perseveringly continued to <unk> the body , and especially the wings , of its prey .
the wasp at first aimed in vain repeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist .
pitying the wasp , after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour , i killed it and put it back into the web .
the spider soon returned ; and an hour afterwards i was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the orifice through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp .
i drove the spider away two or three times , but for the next twenty-four hours i always found it again sucking at the same place .
the spider became much distended by the <unk> of its prey , which was many times larger than itself .
i may here just mention , that i found , near st. fé bajada , many large black spiders , with <unk> marks on their backs , having gregarious habits .
the webs were placed vertically , as is invariably the case with the genus epeira : they were separated from each other by a space of about two feet , but were all attached to certain common lines , which were of great length , and extended to all parts of the community .
in this manner the tops of some large bushes were encompassed by the united nets .
azara has described a gregarious spider in paraguay , which <unk> thinks must be a theridion , but probably it is an epeira , and perhaps even the same species with mine .
( <unk> .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 213 . )
i can not , however , recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat , in which , during autumn , when the spiders die , azara says the eggs are deposited .
as all the spiders which i saw were of the same size , they must have been nearly of the same age .
this gregarious habit , in so typical a genus as epeira , among insects , which are so bloodthirsty and solitary that even the two sexes attack each other , is a very singular fact .
in a lofty valley of the cordillera , near mendoza , i found another spider with a <unk> web .
strong lines <unk> in a vertical plane from a common centre , where the insect had its station ; but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical <unk> ; so that the net , instead of being , as is generally the case , circular , consisted of a <unk> segment .
all the webs were similarly constructed .

july 5 , 1832 .
in the morning we got under way , and stood out of the splendid harbour of rio de janeiro .
in our passage to the plata , we saw nothing particular , excepting on one day a great shoal of porpoises , many hundreds in number .
the whole sea was in places furrowed by them ; and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented , as hundreds , proceeding together by jumps , in which their whole bodies were exposed , thus cut the water .
when the ship was running nine knots an hour , these animals could cross and <unk> the bows with the greatest ease , and then dash away right ahead .
as soon as we entered the estuary of the plata , the weather was very unsettled .
one dark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and <unk> , which made such strange noises , that the officer on watch reported he could hear the cattle bellowing on shore .
on a second night we witnessed a splendid scene of natural fireworks ; the <unk> and <unk> shone with st. <name> 's light ; and the form of the vane could almost be traced , as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus .
the sea was so highly luminous , that the tracks of the <unk> were marked by a fiery wake , and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the most vivid lightning .
when within the mouth of the river , i was interested by observing how slowly the waters of the sea and river mixed .
the latter , muddy and discoloured , from its less specific gravity , floated on the surface of the salt water .
this was curiously exhibited in the wake of the vessel , where a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies with the adjoining fluid .
july 26 , 1832 .
we anchored at <name> video .
the " beagle " was employed in surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of <name> , south of the plata , during the two succeeding years .
to prevent useless repetitions , i <name> extract those parts of my journal which refer to the same districts , without always attending to the order in which we visited them .
maldonado is situated on the northern bank of the plata , and not very far from the mouth of the estuary .
it is a most quiet , forlorn , little town ; built , as is universally the case in these countries , with the streets running at right angles to each other , and having in the middle a large plaza or square , which , from its size , renders the <unk> of the population more evident .
it possesses scarcely any trade ; the <unk> being confined to a few hides and living cattle .
the inhabitants are chiefly <unk> , together with a few shopkeepers and the necessary tradesmen , such as <unk> and carpenters , who do nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round .
the town is separated from the river by a band of <unk> , about a mile broad : it is surrounded on all other sides by an open <unk> country , covered by one uniform layer of fine green turf , on which countless herds of cattle , sheep , and horses graze .
there is very little land cultivated even close to the town .
a few hedges made of <unk> and <unk> <name> out where some wheat or indian corn has been planted .
the features of the country are very similar along the whole northern bank of the plata .
the only difference is , that here the granitic hills are a little bolder .
the scenery is very uninteresting ; there is scarcely a house , an enclosed piece of ground , or even a tree , to give it an air of cheerfulness .
yet , after being imprisoned for some time in a ship , there is a charm in the <unk> feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf .
moreover , if your view is limited to a small space , many objects possess beauty .
some of the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured ; and the bright green <unk> , <unk> short by the cattle , is ornamented by dwarf flowers , among which a plant , looking like the <name> , claimed the place of an old friend .
what would a <unk> say to whole tracts , so thickly covered by the <unk> <unk> , as , even at a distance , to appear of the most gaudy <name> ?
i stayed ten weeks at maldonado , in which time a nearly perfect collection of the animals , birds , and reptiles , was procured .
before making any observations respecting them , i <name> give an account of a little excursion i made as far as the river <unk> , which is about seventy miles distant , in a northerly direction .
i may mention , as a proof how cheap everything is in this country , that i paid only two dollars a day or eight shillings , for two men , together with a troop of about a dozen <unk> .
my companions were well armed with pistols and sabres ; a precaution which i thought rather unnecessary ; but the first piece of news we heard was , that , the day before , a traveller from <name> video had been found dead on the road , with his throat cut .
this happened close to a cross , the record of a former murder .
on the first night we slept at a retired little <unk> ; and there i soon found out that i possessed two or three articles , especially a pocket compass , which created unbounded astonishment .
in every house i was asked to show the compass , and by its aid , together with a map , to point out the direction of various places .
it excited the liveliest admiration that i , a perfect stranger , should know the road ( for direction and road are synonymous in this open country ) to places where i had never been .
at one house a young woman who was ill in bed , sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass .
if their surprise was great , mine was greater , to find such ignorance among people who possessed their thousands of cattle , and " <unk> " of great extent .
it can only be accounted for by the circumstance that this retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners .
i was asked whether the earth or sun moved ; whether it was hotter or colder to the north ; where spain was , and many other such questions .
the greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that england , london , and north <name> , were different names for the same place ; but the better informed well knew that london and north <name> were separate countries close together , and that england was a large town in london !
i carried with me some <unk> matches , which i ignited by biting ; it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike fire with his teeth , that it was usual to collect the whole family to see it : i was once offered a dollar for a single one .
washing my face in the morning caused much speculation at the village of las <unk> ; a superior <unk> closely <unk> me about so singular a practice ; and likewise why on board we wore our beards ; for he had heard from my guide that we did so .
he eyed me with much suspicion ; perhaps he had heard of <unk> in the <unk> religion , and knowing me to be a heretic , probably he came to the conclusion that all <unk> were turks .
it is the general custom in this country to ask for a night 's lodging at the first convenient house .
the astonishment at the compass , and my other feats of <unk> , was to a certain degree advantageous , as with that , and the long stories my guides told of my breaking stones , knowing venomous from harmless snakes , collecting insects , etc. , i repaid them for their hospitality .
i am writing as if i had been among the inhabitants of central africa : banda oriental would not be flattered by the comparison ; but such were my feelings at the time .
the next day we rode to the village of las <unk> .
the country was rather more hilly , but otherwise continued the same ; an inhabitant of the pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly alpine .
the country is so thinly inhabited , that during the whole day we scarcely met a single person .
las <unk> is much smaller even than maldonado .
it is seated on a little plain , and is surrounded by low <name> mountains .
it is of the usual symmetrical form , and with its whitewashed church standing in the centre , had rather a pretty appearance .
the <unk> houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings , without the accompaniment of gardens or <unk> .
this is generally the case in the country , and all the houses have , in consequence , an uncomfortable aspect .
at night we stopped at a <unk> , or <unk> .
during the evening a great number of gauchos came in to drink spirits and smoke cigars : their appearance is very striking ; they are generally tall and handsome , but with a proud and dissolute expression of countenance .
they frequently wear their moustaches , and long black hair curling down their backs .
with their brightly coloured garments , great spurs clanking about their heels , and knives stuck as daggers ( and often so used ) at their waists , they look a very different race of men from what might be expected from their name of gauchos , or simple countrymen .
their politeness is excessive ; they never drink their spirits without expecting you to taste it ; but whilst making their exceedingly graceful bow , they seem quite as ready , if occasion offered , to cut your throat .
on the third day we pursued rather an irregular course , as i was employed in examining some beds of marble .
on the fine plains of turf we saw many ostriches ( <unk> <name> ) .
some of the flocks contained as many as twenty or thirty birds .
these , when standing on any little eminence , and seen against the clear sky , presented a very <name> appearance .
i never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of the country : it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them ; but then , expanding their wings , they made all sail right before the wind , and soon left the horse astern .
at night we came to the house of <name> <name> <unk> , a <name> landed proprietor , but not personally known to either of my companions .
on approaching the house of a stranger , it is usual to follow several little points of etiquette : riding up slowly to the door , the salutation of <unk> <name> is given , and until somebody comes out and asks you to alight , it is not customary even to get off your horse : the formal answer of the owner is , " sin <unk> <unk> "  that is , conceived without sin .
having entered the house , some general conversation is kept up for a few minutes , till permission is asked to pass the night there .
this is granted as a matter of course .
the stranger then takes his meals with the family , and a room is assigned him , where with the <unk> belonging to his <unk> ( or saddle of the pampas ) he makes his bed .
it is curious how similar circumstances produce such similar results in manners .
at the cape of good <name> the same hospitality , and very nearly the same points of etiquette , are universally observed .
the difference , however , between the character of the spaniard and that of the dutch <unk> is shown , by the former never asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of politeness , whilst the honest dutchman demands where he has been , where he is going , what is his business , and even how many brothers , sisters , or children he may happen to have .
shortly after our arrival at <name> <name> 's one of the largest herds of cattle was driven in towards the house , and three beasts were picked out to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment .
these half-wild cattle are very active ; and knowing full well the fatal lazo , they led the horses a long and laborious <name> .
after witnessing the rude wealth displayed in the number of cattle , men , and horses , <name> <name> 's miserable house was quite curious .
the floor consisted of hardened mud , and the windows were without glass ; the sitting-room boasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools , with a couple of tables .
the supper , although several strangers were present , consisted of two huge piles , one of roast beef , the other of boiled , with some pieces of pumpkin : besides this latter there was no other vegetable , and not even a morsel of bread .
for drinking , a large earthenware jug of water served the whole party .
yet this man was the owner of several square miles of land , of which nearly every acre would produce corn , and , with a little trouble , all the common vegetables .
the evening was spent in smoking , with a little impromptu singing , accompanied by the guitar .
the <unk> all sat together in one corner of the room , and did not sup with the men .
( plate 16 .
<unk> or <unk> of gaucho . )
so many works have been written about these countries , that it is almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas .
the lazo consists of a very strong , but thin , <unk> rope , made of raw hide .
one end is attached to the broad <unk> , which <unk> together the complicated gear of the <unk> , or saddle used in the pampas ; the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass , by which a noose can be formed .
the gaucho , when he is going to use the lazo , keeps a small coil in his <unk> , and in the other holds the running noose , which is made very large , generally having a diameter of about eight feet .
this he whirls round his head , and by the dexterous movement of his wrist keeps the noose open ; then , throwing it , he causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses .
the lazo , when not used , is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the <unk> .
the bolas , or balls , are of two kinds : the simplest , which is chiefly used for catching ostriches , consists of two round stones , covered with leather , and united by a thin plaited thong , about eight feet long .
( see chapter 11 . )
the other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a common centre .
the gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand , and whirls the other two round and round his head ; then , taking aim , sends them like chain shot revolving through the air .
the balls no sooner strike any object , than , winding round it , they cross each other , and become firmly hitched .
the size and weight of the balls varies , according to the purpose for which they are made : when of stone , although not larger than an apple , they are sent with such force as sometimes to break the leg even of a horse .
i have seen the balls made of wood , and as large as a turnip , for the sake of catching these animals without injuring them .
the balls are sometimes made of iron , and these can be hurled to the greatest distance .
the main difficulty in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full speed , and while suddenly turning about , to whirl them so steadily round the head , as to take aim : on foot any person would soon learn the <name> .
one day , as i was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head , by accident the free one struck a bush , and its revolving motion being thus destroyed , it immediately fell to the ground , and , like magic caught one hind leg of my horse ; the other ball was then jerked out of my hand , and the horse fairly secured .
luckily he was an old practised animal , and knew what it meant ; otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself down .
the gauchos roared with laughter ; they cried out that they had seen every sort of animal caught , but had never before seen a man caught by himself .
during the two succeeding days , i reached the farthest point which i was anxious to examine .
the country wore the same aspect , till at last the fine green turf became more wearisome than a <name> turnpike road .
we everywhere saw great <name> of partridges ( <unk> <name> ) .
these birds do not go in <unk> , nor do they conceal themselves like the english kind .
it appears a very silly bird .
a man on horseback by riding round and round in a circle , or rather in a spire , so as to approach closer each time , may knock on the head as many as he pleases .
the more common method is to catch them with a running noose , or little lazo , made of the stem of an ostrich 's feather , fastened to the end of a long stick .
a boy on a quiet old horse <name> frequently thus catch thirty or forty in a day .
in arctic north <name> the indians catch the varying hare by walking spirally round and round it , when on its form : the middle of the day is reckoned the best time , when the sun is high , and the shadow of the <name> not very long .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's " journey " <name> 383 . )
on our return to maldonado , we followed rather a different line of road .
near pan de <unk> , a landmark well known to all those who have sailed up the plata , i stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable old spaniard .
early in the morning we ascended the <name> de las <unk> .
by the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost picturesque .
to the westward the view extended over an immense level plain as far as the mount , at <name> video , and to the eastward , over the <unk> country of maldonado .
on the summit of the mountain there were several small heaps of stones , which evidently had lain there for many years .
my companion assured me that they were the work of the indians in the old time .
the heaps were similar , but on a much smaller scale , to those so commonly found on the mountains of wales .
the <name> to <unk> any event , on the highest point of the neighbouring land , seems a universal passion with mankind .
at the present day , not a single indian , either civilised or wild , exists in this part of the province ; nor am i aware that the former inhabitants have left behind them any more permanent records than these insignificant piles on the summit of the <name> de las <unk> .
the general , and almost entire absence of trees in banda oriental is remarkable .
some of the <name> hills are partly covered by thickets , and on the banks of the larger streams , especially to the north of las <unk> , <unk> are not uncommon .
near the <unk> <unk> i heard of a wood of palms ; and one of these trees , of considerable size , i saw near the pan de <unk> , in latitude 35 degrees .
these , and the trees planted by the spaniards , offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of wood .
among the introduced kinds may be enumerated <unk> , olives , peach , and other fruit trees : the peaches succeed so well , that they afford the main supply of firewood to the city of buenos ayres .
extremely level countries , such as the pampas , seldom appear favourable to the growth of trees .
this may possibly be attributed either to the force of the winds , or the kind of drainage .
in the nature of the land , however , around maldonado , no such reason is apparent ; the <name> mountains afford protected situations ; enjoying various kinds of soil ; <unk> of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley ; and the <unk> nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture .
it has been inferred , with much probability , that the presence of woodland is generally determined by the annual amount of moisture ( <unk> .
<unk> , article " <name> " " encyclopedia <unk> .
" ) ; yet in this province abundant and heavy rain falls during the <name> ; and the summer , though dry , is not so in any excessive degree .
( <unk> .
azara says " je <unk> que la <unk> <unk> des <unk> est , dans toutes ces <unk> , plus <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
 volume 1 <name> 36 . )
we see nearly the whole of australia covered by lofty trees , yet that country possesses a far more arid climate .
hence we must look to some other and unknown cause .
confining our view to south <name> , we should certainly be tempted to believe that trees flourished only under a very humid climate ; for the limit of the <unk> follows , in a most remarkable manner , that of the damp winds .
in the southern part of the continent , where the western gales , charged with moisture from the pacific , prevail , every island on the broken west coast , from latitude 38 degrees to the extreme point of <name> <name> fuego , is densely covered by impenetrable forests .
on the eastern side of the cordillera , over the same extent of latitude , where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere has been deprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains , the arid plains of patagonia support a most scanty vegetation .
in the more northern parts of the continent , within the limits of the constant south-eastern trade-wind , the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent forests ; whilst the western coast , from latitude 4 degrees south to latitude 32 degrees south , may be described as a desert ; on this western coast , northward of latitude 4 degrees south , where the trade-wind loses its regularity , and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically , the shores of the pacific , so utterly desert in peru , assume near cape blanco the character of luxuriance so celebrated at <unk> and panama .
hence in the southern and northern parts of the continent , the forest and desert lands occupy reversed positions with respect to the cordillera , and these positions are apparently determined by the direction of the prevalent winds .
in the middle of the continent there is a broad intermediate band , including central chile and the provinces of la plata , where the <unk> winds have not to pass over lofty mountains , and where the land is neither a desert nor covered by forests .
but even the rule , if confined to south <name> , of trees flourishing only in a climate rendered humid by <unk> winds , has a strongly marked exception in the case of the falkland islands .
these islands , situated in the same latitude with <name> <name> fuego and only between two and three hundred miles distant from it , having a nearly similar climate , with a geological formation almost identical , with favourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil , yet can boast of few plants deserving even the title of bushes ; whilst in <name> <name> fuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the <unk> forest .
in this case , both the direction of the heavy gales of wind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of seeds from <name> <name> fuego , as is shown by the canoes and trunks of trees drifted from that country , and frequently thrown on the shores of the western falkland .
hence perhaps it is , that there are many plants in common to the two countries : but with respect to the trees of <name> <name> fuego , even attempts made to <unk> them have failed .
during our stay at maldonado i collected several quadrupeds , eighty kinds of birds , and many reptiles , including nine species of snakes .
of the indigenous mammalia , the only one now left of any size , which is common , is the cervus campestris .
this deer is exceedingly abundant , often in small herds , throughout the countries bordering the plata and in northern patagonia .
if a person crawling close along the ground , slowly advances towards a herd , the deer frequently , out of curiosity , approach to reconnoitre him .
i have by this means , killed from one spot , three out of the same herd .
although so tame and inquisitive , yet when approached on horseback , they are exceedingly wary .
in this country nobody goes on foot , and the deer knows man as its enemy only when he is mounted and armed with the bolas .
at bahia <name> , a recent establishment in northern patagonia , i was surprised to find how little the deer cared for the noise of a gun : one day i fired ten times from within eighty yards at one animal ; and it was much more startled at the ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle .
my powder being exhausted , i was obliged to get up ( to my shame as a sportsman be it spoken , though well able to kill birds on the wing ) and halloo till the deer ran away .
the most curious fact with respect to this animal , is the <unk> strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the <name> .
it is quite indescribable : several times whilst skinning the specimen which is now mounted at the zoological museum , i was almost overcome by nausea .
i tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief , and so carried it home : this handkerchief , after being well washed , i continually used , and it was of course as repeatedly washed ; yet every time , for a space of one year and seven months , when first unfolded , i distinctly perceived the odour .
this appears an astonishing instance of the permanence of some matter , which nevertheless in its nature must be most <unk> and volatile .
frequently , when passing at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a herd , i have perceived the whole air tainted with the <unk> .
i believe the smell from the <name> is most powerful at the period when its horns are perfect , or free from the hairy skin .
when in this state the meat is , of course , quite <unk> ; but the gauchos assert , that if buried for some time in fresh earth , the taint is removed .
i have somewhere read that the islanders in the north of scotland treat the rank carcasses of the <unk> birds in the same manner .
the order <unk> is here very numerous in species : of mice alone i obtained no less than eight kinds .
( 3/4 .
in south <name> i collected altogether twenty-seven species of mice , and thirteen more are known from the works of azara and other authors .
those collected by myself have been named and described by mr. waterhouse at the meetings of the zoological society .
i must be allowed to take this opportunity of returning my cordial thanks to mr. waterhouse , and to the other gentleman attached to that society , for their kind and most liberal assistance on all occasions . )
the largest gnawing animal in the world , the <unk> capybara ( the <unk> ) , is here also common .
one which i shot at <name> video weighed <unk> pounds : its length , from the end of the snout to the <unk> tail , was three feet two inches ; and its girth three feet eight .
these great rodents occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the plata , where the water is quite salt , but are far more abundant on the borders of fresh-water lakes and rivers .
near maldonado three or four generally live together .
in the daytime they either lie among the aquatic plants , or openly feed on the turf plain .
( <unk> .
in the stomach and <unk> of a capybara which i opened , i found a very large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid , in which scarcely a fibre could be distinguished .
mr. <name> informs me that a part of the oesophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a <unk> can be passed down .
certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this animal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which it feeds . )
when viewed at a distance , from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs : but when seated on their haunches , and attentively watching any object with one eye , they <unk> the appearance of their <unk> , <unk> and rabbits .
both the front and side view of their head has quite a ludicrous aspect , from the great depth of their jaw .
these animals , at maldonado , were very tame ; by cautiously walking , i approached within three yards of four old ones .
this tameness may probably be accounted for , by the jaguar having been banished for some years , and by the gaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them .
as i approached nearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise , which is a low abrupt grunt , not having much actual sound , but rather arising from the sudden expulsion of air : the only noise i know at all like it , is the first hoarse bark of a large dog .
having watched the four from almost within arm 's length ( and they me ) for several minutes , they rushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity , and emitted at the same time their bark .
after diving a short distance they came again to the surface , but only just showed the upper part of their heads .
when the female is swimming in the water , and has young ones , they are said to sit on her back .
these animals are easily killed in <name> ; but their skins are of trifling value , and the meat is very indifferent .
on the islands in the rio parana they are exceedingly abundant , and afford the ordinary prey to the jaguar .
the <unk> ( ctenomys <unk> ) is a curious small animal , which may be briefly described as a <unk> , with the habits of a mole .
it is extremely numerous in some parts of the country , but it is difficult to be procured , and never , i believe , comes out of the ground .
it throws up at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the mole , but smaller .
considerable tracts of country are so completely undermined by these animals that horses , in passing over , sink above their <unk> .
the <unk> appear , to a certain degree , to be gregarious : the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six together , and he said this was a common occurrence .
they are nocturnal in their habits ; and their principal food is the roots of plants , which are the object of their extensive and superficial burrows .
this animal is universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when beneath the ground .
a person , the first time he hears it , is much surprised ; for it is not easy to tell whence it comes , nor is it possible to guess what kind of creature utters it .
the noise consists in a short , but not rough , nasal grunt , which is monotonously repeated about four times in quick succession ( <unk> .
at the r. negro , in northern patagonia , there is an animal of the same habits , and probably a closely allied species , but which i never saw .
its noise is different from that of the maldonado kind ; it is repeated only twice instead of three or four times , and is more distinct and sonorous : when heard from a distance it so closely resembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe , that i have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it .
) : the name <unk> is given in imitation of the sound .
where this animal is abundant , it may be heard at all times of the day , and sometimes directly beneath one 's feet .
when kept in a room , the <unk> move both slowly and clumsily , which appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs ; and they are quite incapable , from the socket of the <unk> not having a certain <unk> , of jumping even the smallest vertical height .
they are very stupid in making any attempt to escape ; when angry or frightened they utter the <unk> .
of those i kept alive , several , even the first day , became quite tame , not attempting to bite or to run away ; others were a little wilder .
the man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found blind .
a specimen which i preserved in spirits was in this state ; mr. <name> considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating membrane .
when the animal was alive i placed my finger within half an inch of its head , and not the slightest notice was taken : it made its way , however , about the room nearly as well as the others .
considering the strictly subterranean habits of the <unk> , the blindness , though so common , can not be a very serious evil ; yet it appears strange that any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured .
lamarck would have been delighted with this fact , had he known it , when speculating ( probably with more truth than usual with him ) on the <unk> blindness of the <unk> , a <unk> living under ground , and of the proteus , a reptile living in dark caverns filled with water ; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost rudimentary state , and is covered by a <unk> membrane and skin .
( <unk> .
" <unk> .
zoolog . "
tome 1 <name> 242 . )
in the common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect , though many anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic nerve ; its vision must certainly be imperfect , though probably useful to the animal when it leaves its burrow .
in the <unk> , which i believe never comes to the surface of the ground , the eye is rather larger , but often rendered blind and useless , though without apparently causing any inconvenience to the animal ; no doubt lamarck would have said that the <unk> is now passing into the state of the <unk> and proteus .
birds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy plains around maldonado .
there are several species of a family allied in structure and manners to our starling : one of these ( molothrus niger ) is remarkable from its habits .
several may often be seen standing together on the back of a cow or horse ; and while perched on a hedge , <unk> themselves in the sun , they sometimes attempt to sing , or rather to hiss ; the noise being very peculiar , resembling that of bubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water , so as to produce an acute sound .
according to azara , this bird , like the cuckoo , deposits its eggs in other birds ' nests .
i was several times told by the country people that there certainly is some bird having this habit ; and my assistant in collecting , who is a very accurate person , found a nest of the sparrow of this country ( <unk> <unk> ) , with one egg in it larger than the others , and of a different colour and shape .
in north <name> there is another species of molothrus ( m. <unk> ) , which has a similar <unk> habit , and which is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the plata , even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of cattle ; it differs only in being a little smaller , and in its plumage and eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour .
this close agreement in structure and habits , in representative species coming from opposite quarters of a great continent , always strikes one as interesting , though of common occurrence .
mr. <unk> has well remarked , that with the exception of the molothrus <unk> , to which must be added the m. niger , the <unk> are the only birds which can be called truly <unk> ; namely , such as " fasten themselves , as it were , on another living animal , whose animal heat brings their young into life , whose food they live upon , and whose death would cause theirs during the period of infancy . "
( 3/8 .
" magazine of zoology and botany " volume 1 <name> 217 . )
it is remarkable that some of the species , but not all , both of the cuckoo and molothrus should agree in this one strange habit of their <unk> propagation , whilst opposed to each other in almost every other habit : the molothrus , like our starling , is eminently sociable , and lives on the open plains without <name> or disguise : the cuckoo , as every one knows , is a singularly shy bird ; it <unk> the most retired thickets , and feeds on fruit and caterpillars .
in structure also these two genera are widely removed from each other .
many theories , even <unk> theories , have been advanced to explain the origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds ' nests .
m. <unk> alone , i think , has thrown light by his observations on this puzzle : he finds that the female cuckoo , which , according to most observers , lays at least from four to six eggs , must pair with the male each time after laying only one or two eggs .
( <unk> .
read before the academy of sciences in <name> .
<unk> 1834 <name> 418 . )
now , if the cuckoo was obliged to sit on her own eggs , she would either have to sit on all together , and therefore leave those first laid so long , that they probably would become <unk> ; or she would have to hatch separately each egg or two eggs , as soon as laid : but as the cuckoo stays a shorter time in this country than any other migratory bird , she certainly would not have time enough for the successive <unk> .
hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times , and laying her eggs at intervals , the cause of her depositing her eggs in other birds ' nests , and leaving them to the care of <unk> .
i am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct , from having been independently led ( as we shall hereafter see ) to an analogous conclusion with regard to the south american ostrich , the females of which are <unk> , if i may so express it , on each other ; each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other females , and the male ostrich undertaking all the cares of incubation , like the strange <unk> with the cuckoo .
i <name> mention only two other birds , which are very common , and render themselves prominent from their habits .
the <unk> <unk> is typical of the great american tribe of <unk> .
in its structure it closely approaches the true <unk> , but in its habits may be compared to many birds .
i have frequently observed it , hunting a field , hovering over one spot like a hawk , and then proceeding on to another .
when seen thus suspended in the air , it might very readily at a short distance be mistaken for one of the <unk> order ; its stoop , however , is very inferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk .
at other times the <unk> haunts the neighbourhood of water , and there , like a kingfisher , remaining stationary , it catches any small fish which may come near the margin .
these birds are not unfrequently kept either in cages or in <unk> , with their wings cut .
they soon become tame , and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners , which were described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie .
their flight is undulatory , for the weight of the head and <name> appears too great for the body .
in the evening the <unk> takes its stand on a bush , often by the roadside , and continually repeats without change a shrill and rather agreeable cry , which somewhat resembles articulate words : the spaniards say it is like the words " bien te <unk> " ( i see you well ) , and accordingly have given it this name .
a <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , called by the inhabitants <unk> , is remarkable , from possessing a song far superior to that of any other bird in the country : indeed , it is nearly the only bird in south <name> which i have observed to take its stand for the purpose of singing .
the song may be compared to that of the <unk> <unk> , but is more powerful ; some harsh notes and some very high ones , being mingled with a pleasant <unk> .
it is heard only during the spring .
at other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious .
near maldonado these birds were tame and bold ; they constantly attended the country houses in <name> , to pick the meat which was <name> up on the posts or walls : if any other small bird joined the feast , the <unk> soon chased it away .
on the wide uninhabited plains of patagonia another closely allied species , o. patagonica of d'orbigny , which <unk> the valleys clothed with <unk> bushes , is a wilder bird , and has a slightly different tone of voice .
it appears to me a curious circumstance , as showing the fine shades of difference in habits , that judging from this latter respect alone , when i first saw this second species , i thought it was different from the maldonado kind .
having afterwards procured a specimen , and comparing the two without particular care , they appeared so very similar , that i changed my opinion ; but now mr. gould says that they are certainly distinct ; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit , of which , however , he was not aware .
the number , tameness , and disgusting habits of the <unk> hawks of south <name> make them <unk> striking to any one accustomed only to the birds of northern europe .
in this list may be included four species of the <unk> or <unk> , the turkey buzzard , the <unk> , and the condor .
the <unk> are , from their structure , placed among the eagles : we shall soon see how ill they become so high a rank .
in their habits they well supply the place of our <unk> , magpies , and ravens ; a tribe of birds widely distributed over the rest of the world , but entirely absent in south <name> .
to begin with the <unk> <unk> : this is a common bird , and has a wide geographical range ; it is most numerous on the grassy <unk> of la plata ( where it goes by the name of <unk> ) , and is far from <unk> throughout the sterile plains of patagonia .
in the desert between the rivers negro and colorado , <name> constantly attend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted animals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst .
although thus common in these dry and open countries , and likewise on the arid shores of the pacific , it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious forests of west patagonia and <name> <name> fuego .
the <unk> , together with the <unk> , constantly attend in <name> the <unk> and <unk> .
if an animal dies on the plain the <unk> commences the feast , and then the two species of <unk> pick the bones clean .
these birds , although thus commonly feeding together , are far from being friends .
when the <unk> is quietly seated on the branch of a tree or on the ground , the <unk> often continues for a long time flying backwards and forwards , up and down , in a semicircle , trying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger relative .
the <unk> takes little notice , except by bobbing its head .
although the <unk> frequently assemble in <name> , they are not gregarious ; for in desert places they may be seen solitary , or more commonly by pairs .
the <unk> are said to be very crafty , and to steal great <name> of eggs .
they attempt , also , together with the <unk> , to pick off the <unk> from the sore backs of horses and mules .
the poor animal , on the one hand , with its ears down and its back arched ; and , on the other , the hovering bird , eyeing at the distance of a yard the disgusting morsel , form a picture , which has been described by captain head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy .
these false eagles most rarely kill any living bird or animal ; and their <unk> , <unk> habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep on the desolate plains of patagonia , for when he wakes , he <name> see , on each surrounding hillock , one of these birds patiently watching him with an evil eye : it is a feature in the landscape of these countries , which <name> be recognised by every one who has wandered over them .
if a party of men go out hunting with dogs and horses , they <name> be accompanied , during the day , by several of these attendants .
after feeding , the uncovered <unk> <unk> ; at such times , and indeed generally , the <unk> is an inactive , tame , and cowardly bird .
its flight is heavy and slow , like that of an english <unk> .
it seldom <unk> ; but i have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the air with much ease .
it runs ( in <unk> to hopping ) , but not quite so quickly as some of its <unk> .
at times the <unk> is noisy , but is not generally so : its cry is loud , very harsh and peculiar , and may be likened to the sound of the spanish guttural g , followed by a rough double r r ; when uttering this cry it <unk> its head higher and higher , till at last , with its beak wide open , the crown almost touches the lower part of the back .
this fact , which has been doubted , is quite true ; i have seen them several times with their heads backwards in a completely inverted position .
to these observations i may add , on the high authority of azara , that the <unk> feeds on worms , shells , slugs , grasshoppers , and frogs ; that it destroys young lambs by tearing the <unk> cord ; and that it pursues the <unk> , till that bird is compelled to <unk> up the carrion it may have recently gorged .
lastly , azara states that several <unk> , five or six together , <name> unite in <name> of large birds , even such as herons .
all these facts show that it is a bird of very versatile habits and considerable ingenuity .
the <unk> <unk> is considerably smaller than the last species .
it is truly <unk> , and <name> eat even bread ; and i was assured that it materially <unk> the <unk> in chiloe , by stocking up the roots when first planted .
of all the <unk> it is generally the last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal , and may often be seen within the ribs of a cow or horse , like a bird in a cage .
another species is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is exceedingly common in the falkland islands .
these birds in many respects resemble in their habits the <unk> .
they live on the flesh of dead animals and on <name> productions ; and on the <unk> rocks their whole sustenance must depend on the sea .
they are extraordinarily tame and fearless , and haunt the neighbourhood of houses for offal .
if a hunting party kills an animal , a number soon collect and patiently await , standing on the ground on all sides .
after eating , their uncovered <unk> are largely protruded , giving them a disgusting appearance .
they readily attack wounded birds : a <unk> in this state having taken to the shore , was immediately seized on by several , and its death hastened by their blows .
the " beagle " was at the falklands only during the summer , but the officers of the " adventure , " who were there in the <name> , mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and <unk> of these birds .
they actually pounced on a dog that was lying fast asleep close by one of the party ; and the sportsmen had difficulty in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes .
it is said that several together ( in this respect resembling the <unk> ) wait at the mouth of a <unk> , and together seize on the animal when it comes out .
they were constantly flying on board the vessel when in the harbour ; and it was necessary to keep a good look-out to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging , and the meat or game from the stern .
these birds are very mischievous and inquisitive ; they <name> pick up almost anything from the ground ; a large black glazed hat was carried nearly a mile , as was a pair of the heavy balls used in catching cattle .
mr. <unk> experienced during the survey a more severe loss , in their stealing a small <unk> 's compass in a red morocco leather case , which was never recovered .
these birds are , moreover , quarrelsome and very passionate ; tearing up the grass with their bills from rage .
they are not truly gregarious ; they do not soar , and their flight is heavy and clumsy ; on the ground they run extremely fast , very much like pheasants .
they are noisy , uttering several harsh cries , one of which is like that of the english <unk> , hence the sealers always call them <unk> .
it is a curious circumstance that , when crying out , they throw their heads upwards and backwards , after the same manner as the <unk> .
they build in the <name> cliffs of the sea-coast , but only on the small adjoining islets , and not on the two main islands : this is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird .
the sealers say that the flesh of these birds , when cooked , is quite white , and very good eating ; but bold must the man be who attempts such a meal .
we have now only to mention the <unk> ( <unk> <name> ) , and the <unk> .
the former is found wherever the country is moderately damp , from cape horn to north <name> .
differently from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it has found its way to the falkland islands .
the <unk> is a solitary bird , or at most goes in pairs .
it may at once be recognised from a long distance , by its lofty , soaring , and most elegant flight .
it is well known to be a true <unk> .
on the west coast of patagonia , among the <unk> islets and broken land , it lives exclusively on what the sea throws up , and on the carcasses of dead seals .
wherever these animals are congregated on the rocks , there the vultures may be seen .
the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) has a different range from the last species , as it never occurs southward of latitude 41 degrees .
azara states that there exists a tradition that these birds , at the time of the conquest , were not found near <name> video , but that they subsequently followed the inhabitants from more northern districts .
at the present day they are numerous in the valley of the colorado , which is three hundred miles due south of <name> video .
it seems probable that this additional migration has happened since the time of azara .
the <unk> generally prefers a humid climate , or rather the neighbourhood of fresh water ; hence it is extremely abundant in brazil and la plata , while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of northern patagonia , excepting near some stream .
these birds frequent the whole pampas to the foot of the cordillera , but i never saw or heard of one in chile : in peru they are preserved as <unk> .
these vultures certainly may be called gregarious , for they seem to have pleasure in society , and are not solely brought together by the attraction of a common prey .
on a fine day a flock may often be observed at a great height , each bird wheeling round and round without closing its wings , in the most graceful evolutions .
this is clearly performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise , or perhaps is connected with their matrimonial alliances .
i have now mentioned all the <unk> , excepting the condor , an account of which <name> be more appropriately introduced when we visit a country more congenial to its habits than the plains of la plata .
in a broad band of <unk> which separate the laguna <name> <unk> from the shores of the plata , at the distance of a few miles from maldonado , i found a group of those <unk> , siliceous tubes , which are formed by lightning entering loose sand .
these tubes resemble in every particular those from <unk> in cumberland , described in the " geological transactions . "
( <unk> .
" geological transactions " volume 2 <name> <unk> .
in the " philosophical transactions " <unk> <name> 294 , dr. <unk> has described some imperfect siliceous tubes and a melted pebble of quartz , found in digging into the ground , under a tree , where a man had been killed by lightning . )
the <unk> of maldonado , not being protected by vegetation , are constantly changing their position .
from this cause the tubes projected above the surface ; and numerous fragments lying near , showed that they had formerly been buried to a greater depth .
four sets entered the sand perpendicularly : by working with my hands i traced one of them two feet deep ; and some fragments which evidently had belonged to the same tube , when added to the other part , measured five feet three inches .
the diameter of the whole tube was nearly equal , and therefore we must suppose that originally it extended to a much greater depth .
these dimensions are however small , compared to those of the tubes from <unk> , one of which was traced to a depth of not less than thirty feet .
the internal surface is completely <unk> , glossy , and smooth .
a small fragment examined under the microscope appeared , from the number of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles , like an <unk> fused before the blowpipe .
the sand is entirely , or in greater part , siliceous ; but some points are of a black colour , and from their glossy surface possess a metallic lustre .
the thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch , and occasionally even equals a tenth .
on the outside the grains of sand are rounded , and have a slightly glazed appearance : i could not distinguish any signs of <unk> .
in a similar manner to that described in the " geological transactions , " the tubes are generally compressed , and have deep longitudinal furrows , so as closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk , or the bark of the elm or cork tree .
their circumference is about two inches , but in some fragments , which are cylindrical and without any furrows , it is as much as four inches .
the compression from the surrounding loose sand , acting while the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat , has evidently caused the creases or furrows .
judging from the <unk> fragments , the measure or bore of the lightning ( if such a term may be used ) must have been about one inch and a quarter .
at <name> , m. <unk> and m. <unk> succeeded in making tubes , in most respects similar to these <unk> , by passing very strong shocks of <unk> through <unk> glass : when salt was added , so as to increase its <unk> , the tubes were larger in every <unk> .
( <unk> .
" annales de chimie et de physique " tome 37 <name> 319 . )
they failed both with powdered feldspar and quartz .
one tube , formed with pounded glass , was very nearly an inch long , namely <unk> , and had an internal diameter of <unk> of an inch .
when we hear that the strongest battery in <name> was used , and that its power on a substance of such easy <unk> as glass was to form tubes so diminutive , we must feel greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning , which , striking the sand in several places , has formed cylinders , in one instance of at least thirty feet long , and having an internal bore , where not compressed , of full an inch and a half ; and this in a material so extraordinarily <unk> as quartz !
the tubes , as i have already remarked , enter the sand nearly in a vertical direction .
one , however , which was less regular than the others , <unk> from a right line , at the most considerable bend , to the amount of thirty-three degrees .
from this same tube , two small branches , about a foot apart , were sent off ; one pointed downwards , and the other upwards .
this latter case is remarkable , as the electric fluid must have turned back at the acute <name> of 26 degrees , to the line of its main course .
besides the four tubes which i found vertical , and traced beneath the surface , there were several other groups of fragments , the original sites of which without doubt were near .
all occurred in a level area of shifting sand , sixty yards by twenty , situated among some high <unk> , and at the distance of about half a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height .
the most remarkable circumstance , as it appears to me , in this case as well as in that of <unk> , and in one described by m. <unk> in germany , is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces .
at <unk> , within an area of fifteen yards , three were observed , and the same number occurred in germany .
in the case which i have described , certainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by twenty yards .
as it does not appear probable that the tubes are produced by successive distinct shocks , we must believe that the lightning , shortly before entering the ground , divides itself into separate branches .
the neighbourhood of the rio plata seems peculiarly subject to electric phenomena .
in the year 1793 , one of the most destructive <unk> perhaps on record happened at buenos ayres : thirty-seven places within the city were struck by lightning , and nineteen people killed .
( <unk> .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 36 . )
from facts stated in several books of travels , i am inclined to suspect that <unk> are very common near the mouths of great rivers .
is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh and salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium ?
even during our occasional visits to this part of south <name> , we heard of a ship , two churches , and a house having been struck .
both the church and the house i saw shortly afterwards : the house belonged to mr .
hood , the <unk> at <name> video .
some of the effects were curious : the paper , for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the <unk> had run , was blackened .
the metal had been fused , and although the room was about fifteen feet high , the globules , dropping on the chairs and furniture , had drilled in them a chain of minute holes .
a part of the wall was shattered as if by gunpowder , and the fragments had been blown off with force sufficient to <unk> the wall on the opposite side of the room .
the frame of a looking-glass was blackened , and the gilding must have been <unk> , for a <unk> , which stood on the <unk> , was coated with bright metallic particles , which adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled .

july 24 , 1833 .
the " beagle " sailed from maldonado , and on <name> the 3rd she arrived off the mouth of the rio negro .
this is the principal river on the whole line of coast between the strait of magellan and the plata .
it enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the estuary of the plata .
about fifty years ago , under the old spanish government , a small colony was established here ; and it is still the most southern position ( latitude 41 degrees ) on this eastern coast of <name> inhabited by civilised man .
the country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme : on the south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences , which exposes a section of the geological nature of the country .
the strata are of sandstone , and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a <unk> conglomerate of pumice pebbles , which must have travelled more than four hundred miles , from the andes .
the surface is everywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel , which extends far and wide over the open plain .
water is extremely scarce , and , where found , is almost invariably brackish .
the vegetation is scanty ; and although there are bushes of many kinds , all are armed with formidable thorns , which seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable regions .
the settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river .
the road follows the foot of the sloping <name> , which forms the northern boundary of the great valley in which the rio negro flows .
on the way we passed the ruins of some fine <unk> , which a few years since had been destroyed by the indians .
they withstood several attacks .
a man present at one gave me a very lively description of what took place .
the inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle and horses into the corral which surrounded the house , and likewise to mount some small cannon .
( <unk> .
the corral is an enclosure made of tall and strong stakes .
every estancia , or farming estate , has one attached to it . )
the indians were <unk> from the south of chile ; several hundreds in number , and highly disciplined .
they first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill ; having there dismounted , and taken off their fur <unk> , they advanced naked to the charge .
the only weapon of an indian is a very long bamboo or <unk> , ornamented with ostrich feathers , and pointed by a sharp <unk> .
my <unk> seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of these <unk> as they approached near .
when close , the <unk> <unk> hailed the besieged to give up their arms , or he would cut all their throats .
as this would probably have been the result of their entrance under any circumstances , the answer was given by a volley of musketry .
the indians , with great steadiness , came to the very fence of the corral : but to their surprise they found the posts fastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs , and , of course , in vain attempted to cut them with their knives .
this saved the lives of the christians : many of the wounded indians were carried away by their companions , and at last , one of the under <unk> being wounded , the bugle sounded a retreat .
they retired to their horses , and seemed to hold a council of war .
this was an awful pause for the spaniards , as all their ammunition , with the exception of a few cartridges , was expended .
in an instant the indians mounted their horses , and galloped out of sight .
another attack was still more quickly repulsed .
a cool frenchman managed the gun ; he stopped till the indians approached close , and then raked their line with <unk> : he thus laid thirty-nine of them on the ground ; and , of course , such a blow immediately routed the whole party .
the town is indifferently called el <name> or <unk> .
it is built on the face of a <name> which fronts the river , and many of the houses are excavated even in the sandstone .
the river is about two or three hundred yards wide , and is deep and rapid .
the many islands , with their <unk> , and the flat headlands , seen one behind the other on the northern boundary of the broad green valley , form , by the aid of a bright sun , a view almost picturesque .
the number of inhabitants does not exceed a few hundreds .
these spanish colonies do not , like our british ones , <name> within themselves the elements of growth .
many indians of pure blood reside here : the tribe of the <unk> <unk> constantly have their <unk> on the outskirts of the town .
( <unk> .
the hovels of the indians are thus called . )
the local government partly supplies them with provisions , by giving them all the old worn-out horses , and they earn a little by making <unk> and other articles of <unk> .
these indians are considered civilised ; but what their character may have gained by a lesser degree of ferocity , is almost counterbalanced by their entire immorality .
some of the younger men are , however , improving ; they are willing to labour , and a short time since a party went on a <unk> , and behaved very well .
they were now enjoying the fruits of their labour , by being dressed in very <name> , clean clothes , and by being very idle .
the taste they showed in their dress was admirable ; if you could have turned one of these young indians into a statue of bronze , his drapery would have been perfectly graceful .
one day i rode to a large <unk> , or <name> , which is distant fifteen miles from the town .
during the <name> it consists of a shallow lake of brine , which in summer is converted into a field of snow-white salt .
the layer near the margin is from four to five inches thick , but towards the centre its thickness increases .
this lake was two and a half miles long , and one broad .
others occur in the neighbourhood many times larger , and with a floor of salt , two and three feet in thickness , even when under water during the <name> .
one of these brilliantly white and level expanses , in the midst of the brown and desolate plain , offers an extraordinary spectacle .
a large quantity of salt is annually drawn from the <name> : and great piles , some hundred tons in weight , were lying ready for <unk> .
the season for working the salinas forms the harvest of <unk> ; for on it the prosperity of the place depends .
nearly the whole population <unk> on the bank of the river , and the people are employed in drawing out the salt in <unk> .
this salt is crystallised in great cubes , and is remarkably pure : mr. <unk> reeks has kindly <unk> some for me , and he finds in it only <unk> of gypsum and <unk> of earthy matter .
it is a singular fact that it does not serve so well for preserving meat as <unk> from the cape de verd islands ; and a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per cent less valuable .
hence the cape de verd salt is constantly imported , and is mixed with that from these salinas .
the purity of the patagonian salt , or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all sea-water , is the only assignable cause for this inferiority : a conclusion which no one , i think , would have suspected , but which is supported by the fact lately ascertained , that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the <unk> chlorides .
( <unk> .
report of the agricultural chemistry association in the " agricultural gazette " 1845 <name> 93 . )
the border of the lake is formed of mud : and in this numerous large crystals of gypsum , some of which are three inches long , lie embedded ; whilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about .
the gauchos call the former the " padre <name> <name> , " and the latter the " <unk> ; " they state that these <unk> salts always occur on the borders of the salinas , when the water begins to <unk> .
the mud is black , and has a fetid odour .
i could not at first imagine the cause of this , but i afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind drifted on shore was coloured green , as if by <unk> ; i attempted to <name> home some of this green matter , but from an accident failed .
parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish colour , and this perhaps was owing to some <unk> <unk> .
the mud in many places was thrown up by <name> of some kind of worm , or <unk> animal .
how surprising it is that any creatures should be able to exist in brine , and that they should be crawling among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime !
and what becomes of these worms when , during the long summer , the surface is hardened into a solid layer of salt ?
<unk> in considerable <name> inhabit this lake , and breed here , throughout patagonia , in northern chile , and at the galapagos islands , i met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine .
i saw them here wading about in search of food  probably for the worms which burrow in the mud ; and these latter probably feed on infusoria or <unk> .
thus we have a little living world within itself , adapted to these inland lakes of brine .
a minute <unk> animal ( cancer <unk> ) is said to live in countless <name> in the <unk> at <unk> : but only in those in which the fluid has attained , from evaporation , considerable strength  namely , about a quarter of a pound of salt to a pint of water .
( <unk> .
" <unk> transactions " volume 11 <name> 205 .
it is remarkable how all the circumstances connected with the <unk> in siberia and patagonia are similar .
siberia , like patagonia , appears to have been recently elevated above the waters of the sea .
in both countries the <unk> occupy shallow depressions in the plains ; in both the mud on the borders is black and fetid ; beneath the crust of common salt , sulphate of soda or of magnesia occurs , imperfectly crystallised ; and in both , the muddy sand is mixed with <unk> of gypsum .
the siberian <unk> are inhabited by small <unk> animals ; and <unk> ( " edinburgh new <unk> journal " <name> 1830 ) likewise frequent them .
as these circumstances , apparently so trifling , occur in two distant continents , we may feel sure that they are the necessary results of common <unk>  see " pallas 's travels " 1793 to 1794 pages 129 to 134 . )
well may we affirm that every part of the world is habitable !
whether lakes of brine , or those subterranean ones hidden beneath volcanic mountains  warm mineral springs  the wide expanse and depths of the ocean  the upper regions of the atmosphere , and even the surface of perpetual snow  all support organic beings .
to the northward of the rio negro , between it and the inhabited country near buenos ayres , the spaniards have only one small settlement , recently established at bahia <name> .
the distance in a straight line to buenos ayres is very nearly five hundred british miles .
the wandering tribes of horse indians , which have always occupied the greater part of this country , having of late much harassed the outlying <unk> , the government at buenos ayres equipped some time since an army under the command of general rosas for the purpose of <unk> them .
the troops were now encamped on the banks of the colorado ; a river lying about eighty miles northward of the rio negro .
when general rosas left buenos ayres he struck in a direct line across the unexplored plains : and as the country was thus pretty well cleared of indians , he left behind him , at wide intervals , a small party of soldiers with a troop of horses ( a posta ) , so as to be enabled to keep up a communication with the capital .
as the " beagle " intended to call at bahia <name> , i determined to proceed there by land ; and ultimately i extended my plan to travel the whole way by the <unk> to buenos ayres .
<name> 11 , 1833 .
mr. <name> , an englishman residing at <unk> , a guide , and five gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business , were my companions on the journey .
the colorado , as i have already said , is nearly eighty miles distant : and as we travelled slowly , we were two days and a half on the road .
the whole line of country deserves scarcely a better name than that of a desert .
water is found only in two small wells ; it is called fresh ; but even at this time of the year , during the rainy season , it was quite brackish .
in the summer this must be a distressing passage ; for now it was sufficiently desolate .
the valley of the rio negro , broad as it is , has merely been excavated out of the sandstone plain ; for immediately above the bank on which the town stands , a level country commences , which is interrupted only by a few trifling valleys and depressions .
everywhere the landscape wears the same sterile aspect ; a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown withered grass , and low scattered bushes , armed with thorns .
shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous tree , which the indians reverence as the altar of <unk> .
it is situated on a high part of the plain ; and hence is a landmark visible at a great distance .
as soon as a tribe of indians come in sight of it , they offer their <unk> by loud shouts .
the tree itself is low , much branched , and thorny : just above the root it has a diameter of about three feet .
it stands by itself without any neighbour , and was indeed the first tree we saw ; afterwards we met with a few others of the same kind , but they were far from common .
being <name> the tree had no leaves , but in their place numberless threads , by which the various offerings , such as cigars , bread , meat , pieces of cloth , etc. , had been suspended .
poor indians , not having anything better , only pull a thread out of their <unk> , and fasten it to the tree .
richer indians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole , and likewise to smoke upwards , thinking thus to afford all possible gratification to <unk> .
to complete the scene , the tree was surrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered as sacrifices .
all indians of every age and sex make their offerings ; they then think that their horses <name> not tire , and that they themselves shall be prosperous .
the gaucho who told me this , said that in the time of peace he had witnessed this scene , and that he and others used to wait till the indians had passed by , for the sake of stealing from <unk> the offerings .
the gauchos think that the indians consider the tree as the god itself ; but it seems far more probable that they regard it as the altar .
the only cause which i can imagine for this choice , is its being a landmark in a dangerous passage .
the <name> de la ventana is visible at an immense distance ; and a gaucho told me that he was once riding with an indian a few miles to the north of the rio colorado , when the indian commenced making the same loud noise , which is usual at the first sight of the distant tree , putting his hand to his head , and then pointing in the direction of the <name> .
upon being asked the reason of this , the indian said in broken spanish , " first see the <name> . "
about two leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night : at this instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the <unk> gauchos , who set off in full <name> , and in a few minutes dragged her in with their <unk> , and slaughtered her .
we here had the four necessaries of life " en el <unk> , "  pasture for the horses , water ( only a muddy puddle ) , meat and firewood .
the gauchos were in high spirits at finding all these luxuries ; and we soon set to work at the poor cow .
this was the first night which i passed under the open sky , with the gear of the <unk> for my bed .
there is high enjoyment in the independence of the gaucho life  to be able at any moment to pull up your horse , and say , " here we <name> pass the night . "
the <unk> stillness of the plain , the dogs keeping watch , the <unk> of gauchos making their beds round the fire , have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this first night , which <name> never be forgotten .
the next day the country continued similar to that above described .
it is inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind .
occasionally a deer , or a guanaco ( wild <unk> ) may be seen ; but the agouti ( <unk> patagonica ) is the commonest quadruped .
this animal here represents our hares .
it differs , however , from that genus in many essential respects ; for instance , it has only three toes behind .
it is also nearly twice the size , weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds .
the agouti is a true friend of the desert ; it is a common feature of the landscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a straight line across these wild plains .
they are found as far north as the <name> tapalguen ( latitude 37 degrees 30 ' ) , where the plain rather suddenly becomes greener and more humid ; and their southern limit is between port <name> and st. <name> , where there is no change in the nature of the country .
it is a singular fact , that although the agouti is not now found as far south as port st. <name> , yet that captain wood , in his voyage in <unk> , talks of them as being numerous there .
what cause can have altered , in a wide , uninhabited , and <unk> country , the range of an animal like this ?
it appears also , from the number shot by captain wood in one day at port <name> , that they must have been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present .
where the bizcacha lives and makes its burrows , the agouti uses them ; but where , as at bahia <name> , the bizcacha is not found , the agouti burrows for itself .
the same thing occurs with the little owl of the pampas ( <unk> <unk> ) , which has so often been described as standing like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows ; for in banda oriental , owing to the absence of the bizcacha , it is obliged to hollow out its own habitation .
the next morning , as we approached the rio colorado , the appearance of the country changed ; we soon came on a plain covered with turf , which , from its flowers , tall clover , and little owls , resembled the pampas .
we passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent , which in summer dries , and becomes <unk> with various salts ; and hence is called a <unk> .
it was covered by low succulent plants , of the same kind with those growing on the sea-shore .
the colorado , at the pass where we crossed it , is only about sixty yards wide ; generally it must be nearly double that width .
its course is very tortuous , being marked by <unk> and beds of reeds : in a direct line the distance to the mouth of the river is said to be nine leagues , but by water twenty-five .
we were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense troops of mares , which were swimming the river in order to follow a division of troops into the interior .
a more ludicrous spectacle i never beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads , all directed one way , with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils , appearing just above the water like a great shoal of some <unk> animal .
mare 's flesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition .
this gives them a great facility of movement ; for the distance to which horses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising : i have been assured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for many days successively .
the encampment of general rosas was close to the river .
it consisted of a square formed by <unk> , artillery , straw huts , etc .
the soldiers were nearly all cavalry ; and i should think such a villainous , <unk> army was never before collected together .
the greater number of men were of a mixed breed , between negro , indian , and spaniard .
i know not the reason , but men of such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance .
i called on the secretary to show my passport .
he began to <unk> me in the most dignified and mysterious manner .
by good luck i had a letter of recommendation from the government of buenos ayres to the commandant of <unk> .
( <unk> .
i am bound to express , in the strongest terms , my obligation to the government of buenos ayres for the obliging manner in which passports to all parts of the country were given me , as naturalist of the " beagle . " )
this was taken to general rosas , who sent me a very obliging message ; and the secretary returned all smiles and <unk> .
we took up our residence in the <unk> , or hovel , of a curious old spaniard , who had served with <name> in the expedition against russia .
we stayed two days at the colorado ; i had little to do , for the surrounding country was a swamp , which in summer ( december ) , when the snow melts on the cordillera , is overflowed by the river .
my chief amusement was watching the indian families as they came to buy little articles at the <unk> where we stayed .
it was supposed that general rosas had about six hundred indian allies .
the men were a tall , fine race , yet it was afterwards easy to see in the fuegian savage the same countenance rendered hideous by cold , want of food , and less civilisation .
some authors , in defining the primary races of mankind , have separated these indians into two classes ; but this is certainly incorrect .
among the young women or <unk> , some deserve to be called even beautiful .
their hair was coarse , but bright and black ; and they wore it in two <unk> hanging down to the waist .
they had a high colour , and eyes that glistened with brilliancy ; their legs , feet , and arms were small and elegantly formed ; their ankles , and sometimes their waists , were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads .
nothing could be more interesting than some of the family groups .
a mother with one or two daughters would often come to our <unk> , mounted on the same horse .
they ride like men , but with their knees tucked up much higher .
this habit , perhaps , arises from their being accustomed , when travelling , to ride the loaded horses .
the duty of the women is to load and unload the horses ; to make the tents for the night ; in short to be , like the wives of all savages , useful slaves .
the men fight , hunt , take care of the horses , and make the riding gear .
one of their chief <unk> occupations is to knock two stones together till they become round , in order to make the bolas .
with this important weapon the indian catches his game , and also his horse , which <unk> free over the plain .
in fighting , his first attempt is to throw down the horse of his adversary with the bolas , and when entangled by the fall to kill him with the <unk> .
if the balls only catch the neck or body of an animal , they are often carried away and lost .
as the making the stones round is the labour of two days , the manufacture of the balls is a very common employment .
several of the men and women had their faces painted red , but i never saw the horizontal bands which are so common among the fuegians .
their chief pride consists in having everything made of silver ; i have seen a <unk> with his spurs , stirrups , handle of his knife , and bridle made of this metal : the <unk> and reins being of wire , were not thicker than <unk> ; and to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a chain , gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance .
( plate 19 .
brazilian whips , <unk> , and spurs . )
general rosas intimated a wish to see me ; a circumstance which i was afterwards very glad of .
he is a man of an extraordinary character , and has a most predominant influence in the country , which it seems probable he <name> use to its prosperity and advancement .
( <unk> .
this prophecy has turned out entirely and miserably wrong .
1845 . )
he is said to be the owner of seventy-four square leagues of land , and to have about three hundred thousand head of cattle .
his estates are admirably managed , and are far more productive of corn than those of others .
he first gained his celebrity by his laws for his own <unk> , and by <unk> several hundred men , so as to resist with success the attacks of the indians .
there are many stories current about the rigid manner in which his laws were enforced .
one of these was , that no man , on penalty of being put into the stocks , should <name> his knife on a <name> : this being the principal day for gambling and drinking , many quarrels arose , which from the general manner of fighting with the knife often proved fatal .
one <name> the governor came in great form to pay the estancia a visit , and general rosas , in his hurry , walked out to receive him with his knife , as usual , stuck in his belt .
the steward touched his arm , and reminded him of the law ; upon which turning to the governor , he said he was extremely sorry , but that he must go into the stocks , and that till let out , he possessed no power even in his own house .
after a little time the steward was persuaded to open the stocks , and to let him out , but no sooner was this done , than he turned to the steward and said , " you now have broken the laws , so you must take my place in the stocks . "
such actions as these delighted the gauchos , who all possess high notions of their own equality and dignity .
general rosas is also a perfect horseman  an accomplishment of no small consequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by the following trial : a troop of unbroken horses being driven into a corral , were let out through a gateway , above which was a <unk> : it was agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild animals , as it rushed out , and should be able , without saddle or bridle , not only to ride it , but also to bring it back to the door of the corral , should be their general .
the person who succeeded was accordingly elected ; and doubtless made a fit general for such an army .
this extraordinary feat has also been performed by rosas .
by these means , and by <unk> to the dress and habits of the gauchos , he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country , and in consequence a despotic power .
i was assured by an english merchant , that a man who had murdered another , when arrested and questioned concerning his motive , answered , " he spoke <unk> of general rosas , so i killed him . "
at the end of a week the murderer was at <name> .
this doubtless was the act of the general 's party , and not of the general himself .
in conversation he is enthusiastic , sensible , and very grave .
his gravity is carried to a high pitch : i heard one of his mad <unk> ( for he keeps two , like the barons of old ) relate the following anecdote .
" i wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music , so i went to the general two or three times to ask him ; he said to me , 'go about your business , for i am engaged . '
i went a second time ; he said , 'if you come again i <name> punish you . '
a third time i asked , and he laughed .
i rushed out of the tent , but it was too late  he ordered two soldiers to catch and stake me .
i begged by all the saints in heaven he would let me off ; but it would not do ,  when the general laughs he spares neither mad man nor sound . "
the poor <unk> gentleman looked quite <unk> , at the very recollection of the <unk> .
this is a very severe punishment ; four posts are driven into the ground , and the man is extended by his arms and legs horizontally , and there left to stretch for several hours .
the idea is evidently taken from the usual method of drying hides .
my interview passed away without a smile , and i obtained a passport and order for the government <unk> , and this he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner .
in the morning we started for bahia <name> , which we reached in two days .
leaving the regular encampment , we passed by the <unk> of the indians .
these are round like <unk> , and covered with hides ; by the mouth of each , a tapering <unk> was stuck in the ground .
the <unk> were divided into separate groups , which belonged to the different <unk> ' tribes , and the groups were again divided into smaller ones , according to the relationship of the owners .
for several miles we travelled along the valley of the colorado .
the alluvial plains on the side appeared fertile , and it is supposed that they are well adapted to the growth of corn .
turning northward from the river , we soon entered on a country , differing from the plains south of the river .
the land still continued dry and sterile : but it supported many different kinds of plants , and the grass , though brown and withered , was more abundant , as the thorny bushes were less so .
these latter in a short space entirely disappeared , and the plains were left without a thicket to cover their nakedness .
this change in the vegetation marks the commencement of the grand <unk> deposit , which forms the wide extent of the pampas , and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental .
from the strait of magellan to the colorado , a distance of about eight hundred miles , the face of the country is everywhere composed of shingle : the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry , and probably owe their origin to the rocks of the cordillera .
north of the colorado this bed <unk> out , and the pebbles become exceedingly small , and here the characteristic vegetation of patagonia ceases .
having ridden about twenty-five miles , we came to a broad belt of sand-dunes , which stretches , as far as the eye can reach , to the east and west .
the <unk> resting on the <name> , allow small pools of water to collect , and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable supply of fresh water .
the great advantage arising from depressions and elevations of the soil , is not often brought home to the mind .
the two miserable springs in the long passage between the rio negro and colorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain , without them not a drop of water would have been found .
the belt of sand-dunes is about eight miles wide ; at some former period , it probably formed the margin of a grand estuary , where the colorado now flows .
in this district , where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land occur , such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one , although merely considering the physical geography of the country .
having crossed the <name> tract , we arrived in the evening at one of the <unk> ; and , as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we determined to pass the night there .
the house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two hundred feet high  a most remarkable feature in this country .
this posta was commanded by a negro lieutenant , born in africa : to his credit be it said , there was not a <unk> between the colorado and buenos ayres in nearly such neat order as his .
he had a little room for strangers , and a small corral for the horses , all made of sticks and reeds ; he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case of being attacked .
this would , however , have been of little avail , if the indians had come ; but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the thought of selling his life dearly .
a short time before , a body of indians had travelled past in the night ; if they had been aware of the posta , our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been slaughtered .
i did not anywhere meet a more civil and obliging man than this negro ; it was therefore the more painful to see that he would not sit down and eat with us .
in the morning we sent for the horses very early , and started for another exhilarating gallop .
we passed the <unk> <name> <unk> , an old name given to the head of a large marsh , which extends from bahia <name> .
here we changed horses , and passed through some leagues of swamps and saline marshes .
changing horses for the last time , we again began wading through the mud .
my animal fell , and i was well <unk> in black mire  a very disagreeable accident , when one does not possess a change of clothes .
some miles from the fort we met a man , who told us that a great gun had been fired , which is a signal that indians are near .
we immediately left the road , and followed the edge of a marsh , which when chased offers the best mode of escape .
we were glad to arrive within the walls , when we found all the alarm was about nothing , for the indians turned out to be friendly ones , who wished to join general rosas .
bahia <name> scarcely deserves the name of a village .
a few houses and the barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified wall .
the settlement is only of recent standing ( since 1828 ) ; and its growth has been one of trouble .
the government of buenos ayres unjustly occupied it by force , instead of following the wise example of the spanish viceroys , who purchased the land near the older settlement of the rio negro , from the indians .
hence the need of the fortifications ; hence the few houses and little cultivated land without the limits of the walls ; even the cattle are not safe from the attacks of the indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the fortress stands .
the part of the harbour where the " beagle " intended to anchor being distant twenty-five miles , i obtained from the commandant a guide and horses , to take me to see whether she had arrived .
leaving the plain of green turf , which extended along the course of a little <name> , we soon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand , saline marshes , or bare mud .
some parts were clothed by low thickets , and others with those succulent plants which <unk> only where salt abounds .
bad as the country was , ostriches , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were abundant .
my guide told me , that two months before he had a most narrow escape of his life : he was out hunting with two other men , at no great distance from this part of the country , when they were suddenly met by a party of indians , who giving <name> , soon overtook and killed his two friends .
his own horse 's legs were also caught by the bolas , but he jumped off , and with his knife cut them free : while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse , and received two severe wounds from their <unk> .
springing on the saddle , he managed , by a most wonderful exertion , just to keep ahead of the long spears of his pursuers , who followed him to within sight of the fort .
from that time there was an order that no one should stray far from the settlement .
i did not know of this when i started , and was surprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer , which appeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter .
we found the " beagle " had not arrived , and consequently set out on our return , but the horses soon tiring , we were obliged to bivouac on the plain .
in the morning we had caught an <unk> , which , although a most excellent dish when roasted in its shell , did not make a very substantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men .
the ground at the place where we stopped for the night was <unk> with a layer of sulphate of soda , and hence , of course , was without water .
yet many of the smaller rodents managed to exist even here , and the <unk> was making its odd little grunt beneath my head , during half the night .
our horses were very poor ones , and in the morning they were soon exhausted from not having had anything to drink , so that we were obliged to walk .
about noon the dogs killed a kid , which we roasted .
i ate some of it , but it made me intolerably thirsty .
this was the more distressing as the road , from some recent rain , was full of little puddles of clear water , yet not a drop was <unk> .
i had scarcely been twenty hours without water , and only part of the time under a hot sun , yet the thirst rendered me very weak .
how people survive two or three days under such circumstances , i can not imagine : at the same time , i must confess that my guide did not suffer at all , and was astonished that one day 's deprivation should be so troublesome to me .
i have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being <unk> with salt .
this phenomenon is quite different from that of the salinas , and more extraordinary .
in many parts of south <name> , wherever the climate is moderately dry , these incrustations occur ; but i have nowhere seen them so abundant as near bahia <name> .
the salt here , and in other parts of patagonia , consists chiefly of sulphate of soda with some common salt .
as long as the ground remains moist in the <unk> ( as the spaniards <unk> call them , mistaking this substance for <unk> ) , nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain composed of a black , muddy soil , supporting scattered tufts of succulent plants .
on returning through one of these tracts , after a week 's hot weather , one is surprised to see square miles of the plain white , as if from a slight fall of snow , here and there heaped up by the wind into little drifts .
this latter appearance is chiefly caused by the salts being drawn up , during the slow evaporation of the moisture , round blades of dead grass , stumps of wood , and pieces of broken earth , instead of being crystallised at the bottoms of the puddles of water .
the <unk> occur either on level tracts elevated only a few feet above the level of the sea , or on alluvial land bordering rivers .
m. <unk> found that the saline incrustation on the plain , at the distance of some miles from the sea , consisted chiefly of sulphate of soda , with only seven per cent of common salt ; whilst nearer to the coast , the common salt increased to 37 parts in a hundred .
( <unk> .

this circumstance would tempt one to believe that the sulphate of soda is generated in the soil , from the muriate left on the surface during the slow and recent elevation of this dry country .
the whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists .
have the succulent , <unk> plants , which are well known to contain much soda , the power of decomposing the muriate ?
does the black fetid mud , abounding with organic matter , yield the sulphur and ultimately the sulphuric acid ?
two days afterwards i again rode to the harbour : when not far from our destination , my companion , the same man as before , spied three people hunting on horseback .
he immediately dismounted , and watching them intently , said , " they do n't ride like christians , and nobody can leave the fort . "
the three hunters joined company , and likewise dismounted from their horses .
at last one mounted again and rode over the hill out of sight .
my companion said , " we must now get on our horses : load your pistol ; " and he looked to his own sword .
i asked , " are they indians ? "
 " <unk> <unk> ?
( who knows ? )
if there are no more than three , it does not signify . "
it then struck me , that the one man had gone over the hill to fetch the rest of his tribe .
i suggested this ; but all the answer i could extort was , " <unk> <unk> ? "
his head and eye never for a minute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon .
i thought his uncommon coolness too good a joke , and asked him why he did not return home .
i was startled when he answered , " we are returning , but in a line so as to pass near a swamp , into which we can gallop the horses as far as they can go , and then trust to our own legs ; so that there is no danger . "
i did not feel quite so confident of this , and wanted to increase our pace .
he said , " no , not until they do . "
when any little inequality concealed us , we galloped ; but when in sight , continued walking .
at last we reached a valley , and turning to the left , galloped quickly to the foot of a hill ; he gave me his horse to hold , made the dogs lie down , and then crawled on his hands and knees to reconnoitre .
he remained in this position for some time , and at last , bursting out in laughter , exclaimed , " <unk> ! "
( women ! )
he knew them to be the wife and sister-in-law of the <name> 's son , hunting for ostrich 's eggs .
i have described this man 's conduct , because he acted under the full impression that they were indians .
as soon , however , as the absurd mistake was found out , he gave me a hundred reasons why they could not have been indians ; but all these were forgotten at the time .
we then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called punta <name> , whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of bahia <name> .
the wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great <unk> , which the inhabitants call <unk> , or <unk> , from the number of small crabs .
the mud is so soft that it is impossible to walk over them , even for the shortest distance .
many of the banks have their surfaces covered with long rushes , the tops of which alone are visible at high water .
on one occasion , when in a boat , we were so entangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way .
nothing was visible but the flat beds of mud ; the day was not very clear , and there was much <unk> , or , as the sailors expressed it , " things loomed high . "
the only object within our view which was not level was the horizon ; rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air , and water like <unk> , and <unk> like water .
we passed the night in punta <name> , and i employed myself in searching for fossil bones ; this point being a perfect <unk> for monsters of extinct races .
the evening was perfectly calm and clear ; the extreme monotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of <unk> and gulls , <unk> and solitary vultures .
in riding back in the morning we came across a very fresh track of a puma , but did not succeed in finding it .
we saw also a couple of <unk> , or <unk> ,  odious animals , which are far from uncommon .
in general appearance the <unk> resembles a <unk> , but it is rather larger , and much thicker in proportion .
conscious of its power , it <unk> by day about the open plain , and fears neither dog nor man .
if a dog is urged to the attack , its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the fetid oil , which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose .
whatever is once polluted by it , is for ever useless .
azara says the smell can be perceived at a league distant ; more than once , when entering the harbour of <name> video , the wind being off shore , we have perceived the odour on board the " beagle . "
certain it is , that every animal most willingly makes room for the <unk> .

bahia <name> .
the " beagle " arrived here on the 24th of <name> , and a week afterwards sailed for the plata .
with captain fitz <name> 's consent i was left behind , to travel by land to buenos ayres .
i <name> here add some observations , which were made during this visit and on a previous occasion , when the " beagle " was employed in surveying the harbour .
the plain , at the distance of a few miles from the coast , belongs to the great pampean formation , which consists in part of a reddish <name> , and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock .
nearer the coast there are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain , and from mud , gravel , and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow elevation of the land , of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent shells , and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country .
at punta <name> we have a section of one of these <unk> little plains , which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary character of the remains of gigantic <unk> embedded in it .
these have been fully described by professor <name> , in the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle , ' " and are deposited in the college of surgeons .
i <name> here give only a brief outline of their nature .
first , parts of three heads and other bones of the megatherium , the huge dimensions of which are expressed by its name .
secondly , the <unk> , a great allied animal .
thirdly , the <unk> , also an allied animal , of which i obtained a nearly perfect skeleton .
it must have been as large as a rhinoceros : in the structure of its head it comes , according to mr. <name> , nearest to the cape <unk> , but in some other respects it approaches to the <unk> .
fourthly , the mylodon darwinii , a closely related genus of little inferior size .
fifthly , another gigantic <unk> quadruped .
<unk> , a large animal , with an <unk> coat in compartments , very like that of an <unk> .
<unk> , an extinct kind of horse , to which i shall have again to refer .
<unk> , a tooth of a <unk> animal , probably the same with the macrauchenia , a huge beast with a long neck like a camel , which i shall also refer to again .
lastly , the toxodon , perhaps one of the strangest animals ever discovered : in size it equalled an elephant or megatherium , but the structure of its teeth , as mr. <name> states , proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the <unk> , the order which , at the present day , includes most of the smallest quadrupeds : in many details it is allied to the <unk> : judging from the position of its eyes , ears , and nostrils , it was probably aquatic , like the dugong and <unk> , to which it is also allied .
how wonderfully are the different orders , at the present time so well separated , blended together in different points of the structure of the toxodon !
the remains of these nine great quadrupeds and many detached bones were found embedded on the beach , within the space of about 200 yards square .
it is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species should be found together ; and it proves how numerous in kind the ancient inhabitants of this country must have been .
at the distance of about thirty miles from punta <name> , in a <name> of red earth , i found several fragments of bones , some of large size .
among them were the teeth of a <unk> , equalling in size and closely resembling those of the capybara , whose habits have been described ; and therefore , probably , an aquatic animal .
there was also part of the head of a ctenomys ; the species being different from the <unk> , but with a close general resemblance .
the red earth , like that of the pampas , in which these remains were embedded , contains , according to professor ehrenberg , eight fresh-water and one salt-water <unk> <unk> ; therefore , probably , it was an estuary deposit .
the remains at punta <name> were embedded in stratified gravel and reddish mud , just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank .
they were associated with twenty-three species of shells , of which thirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent forms .
( <unk> .
since this was written , m. <unk> d'orbigny has examined these shells , and <unk> them all to be recent . )
from the bones of the <unk> , including even the <unk> , being entombed in their proper relative positions , and from the <unk> armour of the great <unk> animal being so well preserved , together with the bones of one of its legs , we may feel assured that these remains were fresh and united by their <unk> , when deposited in the gravel together with the shells .
( <unk> .
m. aug. <unk> has described , in a spanish work " <unk> <unk> " 1857 , this district , and he believes that the bones of the extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying pampean deposit , and subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells ; but i am not convinced by his remarks .
m. <unk> believes that the whole enormous pampean deposit is a <unk> formation , like sand-dunes : this seems to me to be an untenable doctrine . )
hence we have good evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds , more different from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary quadrupeds of europe , lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its present inhabitants ; and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often insisted on by mr. lyell , namely , that the " longevity of the species in the mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the <unk> . "
( <unk> .
" principles of geology " volume 4 <name> 40 . )
the great size of the bones of the <unk> animals , including the megatherium , <unk> , <unk> , and mylodon , is truly wonderful .
the habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle to naturalists , until professor <name> solved the problem with remarkable ingenuity .
( <unk> .
this theory was first developed in the " zoology of the voyage of the 'beagle , ' " and subsequently in professor <name> 's " memoir on mylodon <unk> . " )
the teeth indicate , by their simple structure , that these <unk> animals lived on vegetable food , and probably on the leaves and small twigs of trees ; their ponderous forms and great strong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion , that some eminent naturalists have actually believed that , like the <unk> , to which they are intimately related , they subsisted by climbing back downwards on trees , and feeding on the leaves .
it was a bold , not to say preposterous , idea to conceive even <unk> trees , with branches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants .
professor <name> , with far more probability , believes that , instead of climbing on the trees , they pulled the branches down to them , and tore up the smaller ones by the roots , and so fed on the leaves .
the colossal breadth and weight of their hinder quarters , which can hardly be imagined without having been seen , become , on this view , of obvious service , instead of being an <unk> : their apparent <unk> disappears .
with their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed like a tripod on the ground , they could freely exert the full force of their most powerful arms and great claws .
strongly rooted , indeed , must that tree have been , which could have resisted such force !
the mylodon , moreover , was furnished with a long <unk> tongue like that of the giraffe , which , by one of those beautiful provisions of nature , thus reaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food .
i may remark , that in abyssinia the elephant , according to <name> , when it can not reach with its proboscis the branches , deeply scores with its tusks the trunk of the tree , up and down and all round , till it is sufficiently weakened to be broken down .
the beds including the above fossil remains stand only from fifteen to twenty feet above the level of high water ; and hence the elevation of the land has been small ( without there has been an intercalated period of subsidence , of which we have no evidence ) since the great quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding plains ; and the external features of the country must then have been very nearly the same as now .
what , it may naturally be asked , was the character of the vegetation at that period ; was the country as <unk> sterile as it now is ?
as so many of the <unk> shells are the same with those now living in the bay , i was at first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably similar to the existing one ; but this would have been an erroneous inference , for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of brazil ; and generally , the characters of the inhabitants of the sea are useless as guides to judge of those on the land .
nevertheless , from the following considerations , i do not believe that the simple fact of many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round bahia <name> , is any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant vegetation : i have no doubt that the sterile country a little southward , near the rio negro , with its scattered thorny trees , would support many and large quadrupeds .
that large animals require a luxuriant vegetation , has been a general assumption which has passed from one work to another ; but i do not hesitate to say that it is completely false , and that it has vitiated the reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the ancient history of the world .
the prejudice has probably been derived from <name> , and the indian islands , where troops of elephants , <name> forests , and impenetrable jungles , are associated together in every one 's mind .
if , however , we refer to any work of travels through the southern parts of africa , we shall find allusions in almost every <name> either to the desert character of the country , or to the <name> of large animals inhabiting it .
the same thing is rendered evident by the many engravings which have been published of various parts of the interior .
when the " beagle " was at cape town , i made an excursion of some days ' length into the country , which at least was sufficient to render that which i had read more fully intelligible .
dr. <name> smith , who , at the head of his adventurous party , has lately succeeded in passing the tropic of <unk> , informs me that , taking into consideration the whole of the southern part of africa , there can be no doubt of its being a sterile country .
on the southern and south-eastern coasts there are some fine forests , but with these exceptions , the traveller may pass for days together through open plains , covered by a poor and scanty vegetation .
it is difficult to convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility ; but it may be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one time by great britain , exceeds , perhaps even tenfold , the quantity on an equal area in the interior parts of southern africa .
( <unk> .
i mean by this to exclude the total amount which may have been successively produced and consumed during a given period . )
the fact that <unk> can travel in any direction , excepting near the coast , without more than occasionally half an hour 's delay in cutting down bushes , gives , perhaps , a more definite notion of the <unk> of the vegetation .
now , if we look to the animals inhabiting these wide plains , we shall find their <name> extraordinarily great , and their bulk immense .
we must enumerate the elephant , three species of rhinoceros , and probably , according to dr. smith , two others , the hippopotamus , the giraffe , the bos <unk>  as large as a full-grown bull , and the <unk>  but little less , two <unk> , and the <unk> , two <unk> , and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals .
it may be supposed that although the species are numerous , the individuals of each kind are few .
by the kindness of dr. smith , i am enabled to show that the case is very different .
he informs me , that in latitude 24 degrees , in one day 's march with the <unk> , he saw , without wandering to any great distance on either side , between one hundred and one hundred and fifty <unk> , which belonged to three species : the same day he saw several herds of <unk> , amounting together to nearly a hundred ; and that , although no elephant was observed , yet they are found in this district .
at the distance of a little more than one hour 's march from their place of encampment on the previous night , his party actually killed at one spot eight <unk> , and saw many more .
in this same river there were likewise crocodiles .
of course it was a case quite extraordinary , to see so many great animals crowded together , but it evidently proves that they must exist in great <name> .
dr. smith describes the country passed through that day , as " being thinly covered with grass , and bushes about four feet high , and still more thinly with <unk> . "
the <unk> were not prevented travelling in a nearly straight line .
besides these large animals , every one the least acquainted with the natural history of the cape has read of the herds of antelopes , which can be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds .
the <name> indeed of the lion , panther , and <unk> , and the multitude of birds of prey , plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds : one evening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round dr. smith 's encampment .
as this able naturalist remarked to me , the carnage each day in southern africa must indeed be terrific !
i confess it is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in a country producing so little food .
the larger quadrupeds no doubt roam over wide tracts in search of it ; and their food chiefly consists of <unk> , which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk .
dr. smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth ; no sooner is a part consumed , than its place is supplied by a fresh stock .
there can be no doubt , however , that our ideas respecting the apparent amount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much exaggerated : it should have been remembered that the camel , an animal of no mean bulk , has always been considered as the emblem of the desert .
the belief that where large quadrupeds exist , the vegetation must necessarily be luxuriant , is the more remarkable , because the converse is far from true .
mr. burchell observed to me that when entering brazil , nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the south american vegetation contrasted with that of south africa , together with the absence of all large quadrupeds .
in his " travels , " he has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights ( if there were sufficient data ) of an equal number of the largest <unk> quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious .
( <unk> .
" travels in the interior of south africa " volume 2 <name> 207 . )
if we take on the one side , the elephant , hippopotamus , giraffe , bos <unk> , <unk> , certainly three , and probably five species of rhinoceros ; and on the american side , two <unk> , the guanaco , three deer , the <unk> , <unk> , capybara ( after which we must choose from the monkeys to complete the number ) , and then place these two groups alongside each other , it is not easy to conceive ranks more <unk> in size .
( <unk> .
the elephant which was killed at exeter change was estimated ( being partly weighed ) at five tons and a half .
the elephant actress , as i was informed , weighed one ton less ; so that we may take five as the average of a full-grown elephant .
i was told at the <unk> gardens , that a hippopotamus which was sent to england cut up into pieces was estimated at three tons and a half ; we <name> call it three .
from these premises we may give three tons and a half to each of the five <unk> ; perhaps a ton to the giraffe , and half to the bos <unk> as well as to the <unk> ( a large ox weighs from 1200 to 1500 pounds ) .
this <name> give an average ( from the above estimates ) of <unk> of a ton for the ten largest <unk> animals of southern africa .
in south <name> , allowing 1200 pounds for the two <unk> together , 550 for the guanaco and <unk> , 500 for three deer , 300 for the capybara , <unk> , and a monkey , we shall have an average of 250 pounds , which i believe is <unk> the result .
the ratio <name> therefore be as <unk> to 250 , or 24 to 1 , for the ten largest animals from the two continents . )
after the above facts , we are compelled to conclude , against anterior probability , that among the mammalia there exists no close relation between the bulk of the species and the quantity of the vegetation in the countries which they inhabit .
( 5/8 .
if we suppose the case of the discovery of a skeleton of a greenland whale in a fossil state , not a single <unk> animal being known to exist , what naturalist would have ventured conjecture on the possibility of a carcass so gigantic being supported on the minute crustacea and mollusca living in the frozen seas of the extreme north ? )
with regard to the number of large quadrupeds , there certainly exists no quarter of the globe which <name> bear comparison with southern africa .
after the different statements which have been given , the extremely desert character of that region <name> not be disputed .
in the european division of the world , we must look back to the tertiary epochs , to find a condition of things among the mammalia , resembling that now existing at the cape of good <name> .
those tertiary epochs , which we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with large animals , because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at certain spots , could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than southern africa does at present .
if we speculate on the condition of the vegetation during those epochs , we are at least bound so far to consider existing analogies , as not to urge as absolutely necessary a luxuriant vegetation , when we see a state of things so totally different at the cape of good <name> .
we know that the extreme regions of north <name> many degrees beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains perpetually <unk> , are covered by forests of large and tall trees .
( <unk> .
see " zoological remarks to captain <unk> expedition " by dr. richardson .
he says , " the <unk> north of latitude 56 degrees is perpetually frozen , the thaw on the coast not penetrating above three feet , and at bear lake , in latitude 64 degrees , not more than twenty inches .
the frozen <unk> does not of itself destroy vegetation , for forests flourish on the surface , at a distance from the coast . " )
in a like manner , in siberia , we have woods of birch , fir , <unk> , and <unk> , growing in a latitude ( 64 degrees ) where the mean temperature of the air falls below the freezing point , and where the earth is so completely frozen , that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is perfectly preserved .
( <unk> .
see humboldt " <unk> <unk> " <name> 386 : <name> 's " geography of plants " ; and <unk> <unk> .
in the latter work it is said that the limit of the growth of trees in siberia may be drawn under the parallel of 70 degrees . )
with these facts we must <name> , as far as quantity alone of vegetation is concerned , that the great quadrupeds of the later tertiary epochs might , in most parts of northern europe and <name> , have lived on the spots where their remains are now found .
i do not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their support ; because , as there is evidence of physical changes , and as the animals have become extinct , so may we suppose that the species of plants have likewise been changed .
these remarks , i may be permitted to add , directly bear on the case of the siberian animals preserved in ice .
the firm conviction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical luxuriance , to support such large animals , and the impossibility of <unk> this with the proximity of perpetual <unk> , was one chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate , and of overwhelming <unk> , which were invented to account for their <unk> .
i am far from supposing that the climate has not changed since the period when those animals lived , which now lie buried in the ice .
at present i only wish to show , that as far as quantity of food alone is concerned , the ancient <unk> might have roamed over the <unk> of central siberia ( the northern parts probably being under water ) even in their present condition , as well as the living <unk> and elephants over the <unk> of southern africa .
i <name> now give an account of the habits of some of the more interesting birds which are common on the wild plains of northern patagonia : and first for the largest , or south american ostrich .
the ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one .
they live on vegetable matter , such as roots and grass ; but at bahia <name> i have repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive <unk> which are then dry , for the sake , as the gauchos say , of feeding on small fish .
although the ostrich in its habits is so shy , wary , and solitary , and although so fleet in its pace , it is caught without much difficulty by the indian or gaucho armed with the bolas .
when several horsemen appear in a semicircle , it becomes confounded , and does not know which way to escape .
they generally prefer running against the wind ; yet at the first start they expand their wings , and like a vessel make all sail .
on one fine hot day i saw several ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes , where they squatted concealed , till quite closely approached .
it is not generally known that ostriches readily take to the water .
mr. king informs me that at the bay of san blas , and at port <unk> in patagonia , he saw these birds swimming several times from island to island .
they ran into the water both when driven down to a point , and likewise of their own accord when not frightened : the distance crossed was about two hundred yards .
when swimming , very little of their bodies appear above water ; their necks are extended a little forward , and their progress is slow .
on two occasions i saw some ostriches swimming across the <name> <name> river , where its course was about four hundred yards wide , and the stream rapid .
captain <unk> , when descending the <unk> , in australia , saw two <unk> in the act of swimming .
( <unk> .
<unk> 's travels , volume 2 <name> 74 . )
the inhabitants of the country readily distinguish , even at a distance , the cock bird from the hen .
the former is larger and <unk> , and has a bigger head .
( <unk> .
a <unk> assured me that he had once seen a snow-white or albino variety , and that it was a most beautiful bird . )
the ostrich , i believe the cock , emits a singular , <unk> , hissing note : when first i heard it , standing in the midst of some <unk> , i thought it was made by some wild beast , for it is a sound that one can not tell whence it comes , or from how far distant .
when we were at bahia <name> in the months of <name> and october , the eggs , in extraordinary <name> , were found all over the country .
they lie either scattered and single , in which case they are never hatched , and are called by the spaniards <unk> ; or they are collected together into a shallow excavation , which forms the nest .
out of the four nests which i saw , three contained twenty-two eggs each , and the fourth twenty-seven .
in one day 's hunting on horseback sixty-four eggs were found ; forty-four of these were in two nests , and the remaining twenty , scattered <unk> .
the gauchos unanimously affirm , and there is no reason to doubt their statement , that the male bird alone hatches the eggs , and for some time afterwards accompanies the young .
the cock when on the nest lies very close ; i have myself almost ridden over one .
it is asserted that at such times they are occasionally fierce , and even dangerous , and that they have been known to attack a man on horseback , trying to kick and leap on him .
my <unk> pointed out to me an old man , whom he had seen much terrified by one chasing him .
i observe in <unk> " travels in south africa " that he remarks , " having killed a male ostrich , and the feathers being dirty , it was said by the <unk> to be a nest bird . "
i understand that the male <unk> in the zoological gardens takes charge of the nest : this habit , therefore , is common to the family .
the gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest .
i have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched to go in the middle of the day , one after the other , to the same nest .
i may add , also , that it is believed in africa that two or more females lay in one nest .
( <unk> .
<unk> " travels " volume 1 <name> 280 . )
although this habit at first appears very strange , i think the cause may be explained in a simple manner .
the number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty , and even to fifty ; and according to azara , sometimes to seventy or eighty .
now although it is most probable , from the number of eggs found in one district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the parent birds , and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen , that she may in the course of the season lay a large number , yet the time required must be very long .
azara states that a female in a state of domestication laid seventeen eggs , each at the interval of three days one from another .
( <unk> .
azara volume 4 <name> 173 . )
if the hen was obliged to hatch her own eggs , before the last was laid the first probably would be <unk> ; but if each laid a few eggs at successive periods , in different nests , and several hens , as is stated to be the case , combined together , then the eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age .
if the number of eggs in one of these nests is , as i believe , not greater on an average than the number laid by one female in the season , then there must be as many nests as females , and each cock bird <name> have its fair share of the labour of incubation ; and that during a period when the females probably could not sit , from not having finished laying .
( <unk> .
<unk> , however , asserts " travels " volume 2 <name> 25 , that the hens begin sitting when they have laid ten or twelve eggs ; and that they continue laying , i presume in another nest .
this appears to me very improbable .
he asserts that four or five hens associate for incubation with one cock , who sits only at night . )
i have before mentioned the great <name> of <unk> , or deserted eggs ; so that in one day 's hunting twenty were found in this state .
it appears odd that so many should be wasted .
does it not arise from the difficulty of several females associating together , and finding a male ready to undertake the office of incubation ?
it is evident that there must at first be some degree of association between at least two females ; otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plains , at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into one nest : some authors have believed that the scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to feed on .
this can hardly be the case in <name> , because the <unk> , although often found <unk> and putrid , are generally whole .
when at the rio negro in northern patagonia , i repeatedly heard the gauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called <unk> <unk> .
they described it as being less than the common ostrich ( which is there abundant ) , but with a very close general resemblance .
they said its colour was dark and mottled , and that its legs were shorter , and feathered lower down than those of the common ostrich .
it is more easily caught by the bolas than the other species .
the few inhabitants who had seen both kinds , affirmed they could distinguish them apart from a long distance .
the eggs of the small species appeared , however , more generally known ; and it was remarked , with surprise , that they were very little less than those of the <name> but of a slightly different form , and with a tinge of pale blue .
this species occurs most rarely on the plains bordering the rio negro ; but about a degree and a half farther south they are tolerably abundant .
when at port <name> , in patagonia ( latitude 48 degrees ) , mr. <unk> shot an ostrich ; and i looked at it , forgetting at the moment , in the most unaccountable manner , the whole subject of the <unk> , and thought it was a not full-grown bird of the common sort .
it was cooked and eaten before my memory returned .
fortunately the head , neck , legs , wings , many of the larger feathers , and a large part of the skin , had been preserved ; and from these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together , and is now exhibited in the museum of the zoological society .
mr. gould , in describing this new species , has done me the honour of calling it after my name .
among the patagonian indians in the strait of magellan , we found a half indian , who had lived some years with the tribe , but had been born in the northern provinces .
i asked him if he had ever heard of the <unk> <unk> .
he answered by saying , " why , there are none others in these southern countries . "
he informed me that the number of eggs in the nest of the <unk> is considerably less than in that of the other kind , namely , not more than fifteen on an average , but he asserted that more than one female deposited them .
at <name> <name> we saw several of these birds .
they were excessively wary : i think they could see a person approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves .
in ascending the river few were seen ; but in our quiet and rapid descent many , in pairs and by fours or <unk> , were observed .
it was remarked that this bird did not expand its wings , when first starting at full speed , after the manner of the northern kind .
in conclusion i may observe that the <unk> <name> inhabits the country of la plata as far as a little south of the rio negro in latitude 41 degrees , and that the <unk> darwinii takes its place in southern patagonia ; the part about the rio negro being neutral territory .
m. a. d'orbigny , when at the rio negro , made great exertions to procure this bird , but never had the good fortune to succeed .
( <unk> .
when at the rio negro , we heard much of the indefatigable labours of this naturalist .
m. <unk> d'orbigny , during the years 1825 to 1833 , traversed several large portions of south <name> , and has made a collection , and is now publishing the results on a scale of magnificence , which at once places himself in the list of american travellers second only to humboldt . )
<unk> long ago was aware of there being two kinds of ostriches , he says , " you must know , moreover , that <unk> differ in size and habits in different tracts of land ; for those that inhabit the plains of buenos ayres and <unk> are larger , and have black , white and grey feathers ; those near to the strait of magellan are smaller and more beautiful , for their white feathers are tipped with black at the extremity , and their black ones in like manner terminate in white . "
( <unk> .
" account of the <unk> " a.d. <unk> volume 1 english translation <name> 314 . )
a very singular little bird , <unk> <unk> , is here common : in its habits and general appearance it nearly equally partakes of the characters , different as they are , of the quail and snipe .
the <unk> is found in the whole of southern south <name> , wherever there are sterile plains , or open dry pasture land .
it <unk> in pairs or small flocks the most desolate places , where scarcely another living creature can exist .
upon being approached they squat close , and then are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground .
when feeding they walk rather slowly , with their legs wide apart .
they dust themselves in roads and <name> places , and frequent particular spots , where they may be found day after day : like partridges , they take wing in a flock .
in all these respects , in the muscular gizzard adapted for vegetable food , in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils , short legs and form of foot , the <unk> has a close affinity with quails .
but as soon as the bird is seen flying , its whole appearance changes ; the long pointed wings , so different from those in the gallinaceous order , the irregular manner of flight , and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of rising , recall the idea of a snipe .
the sportsmen of the " beagle " unanimously called it the <unk> snipe .
to this genus , or rather to the family of the waders , its skeleton shows that it is really related .
the <unk> is closely related to some other south american birds .
two species of the genus <unk> are in almost every respect <unk> in their habits ; one lives in <name> <name> fuego , above the limits of the forest land ; and the other just beneath the snow-line on the cordillera of central chile .
a bird of another closely allied genus , <unk> <name> , is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions ; it feeds on seaweed and shells on the tidal rocks .
although not <unk> , from some unaccountable habit it is frequently met with far out at sea .
this small family of birds is one of those which , from its varied relations to other families , although at present offering only difficulties to the systematic naturalist , ultimately may assist in revealing the grand scheme , common to the present and past ages , on which organised beings have been created .
the genus <unk> contains several species , all small birds , living on the ground , and inhabiting open dry countries .
in structure they can not be compared to any european form .
ornithologists have generally included them among the creepers , although opposed to that family in every habit .
the best known species is the common <unk> of la plata , the <unk> or <unk> of the spaniards .
the nest , whence it takes its name , is placed in the most exposed situations , as on the top of a post , a bare rock , or on a cactus .
it is composed of mud and bits of straw , and has strong thick walls : in shape it precisely resembles an oven , or depressed <unk> .
the opening is large and arched , and directly in front , within the nest , there is a partition , which reaches nearly to the roof , thus forming a passage or <unk> to the true nest .
another and smaller species of <unk> ( f. <unk> ) , resembles the <unk> in the general reddish tint of its plumage , in a peculiar shrill reiterated cry , and in an odd manner of running by starts .
from its affinity , the spaniards call it <unk> ( or little <unk> ) , although its nidification is quite different .
the <unk> builds its nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole , which is said to extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground .
several of the country people told me , that when boys , they had attempted to dig out the nest , but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the passage .
the bird chooses any low bank of firm <name> soil by the side of a road or stream .
here ( at bahia <name> ) the walls round the houses are built of hardened mud , and i noticed that one , which enclosed a courtyard where i lodged , was bored through by round holes in a score of places .
on asking the owner the cause of this , he bitterly complained of the little <unk> , several of which i afterwards observed at work .
it is rather curious to find how incapable these birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness , for although they were constantly flitting over the low wall , they continued vainly to bore through it , thinking it an excellent bank for their nests .
i do not doubt that each bird , as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side , was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact .
i have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this country .
of <unk> three species occur , namely , the <unk> <unk> or <unk> , the d. <unk> or <unk> , and the <unk> .
the first extends ten degrees farther south than any other kind ; a fourth species , the <unk> , does not come as far south as bahia <name> .
the four species have nearly similar habits ; the <unk> , however , is nocturnal , while the others wander by day over the open plains , feeding on beetles , larvae , roots , and even small snakes .
the <unk> , commonly called <unk> , is remarkable by having only three movable bands ; the rest of its <unk> covering being nearly inflexible .
it has the power of rolling itself into a perfect sphere , like one kind of english woodlouse .
in this state it is safe from the attack of dogs ; for the dog not being able to take the whole in its mouth , tries to bite one side , and the ball slips away .
the smooth hard covering of the <unk> offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog .
the <unk> prefers a very dry soil ; and the sand-dunes near the coast , where for many months it can never taste water , is its favourite resort : it often tries to escape notice , by squatting close to the ground .
in the course of a day 's ride , near bahia <name> , several were generally met with .
the instant one was perceived , it was necessary , in order to catch it , almost to tumble off one 's horse ; for in soft soil the animal burrowed so quickly , that its hinder quarters would almost disappear before one could alight .
it seems almost a pity to kill such nice little animals , for as a gaucho said , while sharpening his knife on the back of one , " son tan <unk> " ( they are so quiet ) .
of reptiles there are many kinds : one snake ( a <unk> , or <unk> , subsequently called by m. <unk> t. <unk> ) , from the size of the poison channel in its fangs , must be very deadly .
cuvier , in opposition to some other naturalists , makes this a <unk> of the rattlesnake , and intermediate between it and the viper .
in confirmation of this opinion , i observed a fact , which appears to me very curious and instructive , as showing how every character , even though it may be in some degree independent of structure , has a tendency to vary by slow degrees .
the extremity of the tail of this snake is terminated by a point , which is very slightly enlarged ; and as the animal glides along , it constantly <unk> the last inch ; and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood , produces a rattling noise , which can be distinctly heard at the distance of six feet .
as often as the animal was irritated or surprised , its tail was shaken ; and the vibrations were extremely rapid .
even as long as the body retained its irritability , a tendency to this habitual movement was evident .
this <unk> has , therefore , in some respects the structure of a viper , with the habits of a rattlesnake : the noise , however , being produced by a simpler device .
the expression of this <unk> face was hideous and fierce ; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and <unk> <name> ; the jaws were broad at the base , and the nose terminated in a triangular projection .
i do not think i ever saw anything more ugly , excepting , perhaps , some of the <unk> bats .
i imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions , with respect to each other , somewhat proportional to those of the human face ; and thus we obtain a scale of <unk> .
amongst the <unk> reptiles , i found only one little toad ( <unk> <unk> ) , which was most singular from its colour .
if we imagine , first , that it had been steeped in the blackest ink , and then , when dry , allowed to crawl over a board , freshly painted with the brightest vermilion , so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of its stomach , a good idea of its appearance <name> be gained .
if it had been an unnamed species , surely it ought to have been called <unk> , for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of <name> .
instead of being nocturnal in its habits , as other toads are , and living in damp obscure recesses , it crawls during the heat of the day about the dry <unk> and arid plains , where not a single drop of water can be found .
it must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture ; and this probably is absorbed by the skin , for it is known that these reptiles possess great powers of <unk> absorption .
at maldonado , i found one in a situation nearly as dry as at bahia <name> , and thinking to give it a great treat , carried it to a pool of water ; not only was the little animal unable to swim , but i think without help it would soon have been drowned .
of lizards there were many kinds , but only one ( <unk> <unk> ) remarkable from its habits .
it lives on the bare sand near the sea-coast , and from its mottled colour , the brownish scales being speckled with white , yellowish red , and dirty blue , can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface .
when frightened , it attempts to avoid discovery by <unk> death , with outstretched legs , depressed body , and closed eyes : if further molested , it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand .
this lizard , from its flattened body and short legs , can not run quickly .
i <name> here add a few remarks on the <unk> of animals in this part of south <name> .
when we first arrived at bahia <name> , <name> 7th , 1832 , we thought nature had granted scarcely a living creature to this <name> and dry country .
by digging , however , in the ground , several insects , large spiders , and lizards were found in a <unk> state .
on the 15th , a few animals began to appear , and by the 18th ( three days from the <unk> ) , everything announced the commencement of spring .
the plains were ornamented by the flowers of a pink <unk> , wild peas , <unk> , and geraniums ; and the birds began to lay their eggs .
numerous lamellicorn and <unk> insects , the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies , were slowly crawling about ; while the lizard tribe , the constant inhabitants of a <name> soil , darted about in every direction .
during the first eleven days , whilst nature was dormant , the mean temperature taken from observations made every two hours on board the " beagle , " was 51 degrees ; and in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 55 degrees .
on the eleven succeeding days , in which all living things became so animated , the mean was 58 degrees , and the range in the middle of the day between sixty and seventy .
here then an increase of seven degrees in mean temperature , but a greater one of extreme heat , was sufficient to awake the functions of life .
at <name> video , from which we had just before sailed , in the twenty-three days included between the 26th of july and the 19th of <name> , the mean temperature from 276 observations was <unk> degrees ; the mean hottest day being <unk> degrees , and the coldest 46 degrees .
the lowest point to which the thermometer fell was <unk> degrees , and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to 69 or 70 degrees .
yet with this high temperature , almost every beetle , several genera of spiders , <unk> , and land-shells , toads and lizards , were all lying torpid beneath stones .
but we have seen that at bahia <name> , which is four degrees southward , and therefore with a climate only a very little colder , this same temperature , with a rather less extreme heat , was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings .
this shows how nicely the stimulus required to arouse <unk> animals is governed by the usual climate of the district , and not by the absolute heat .
it is well known that within the tropics the <unk> , or more properly <unk> , of animals is determined not by the temperature , but by the times of drought .
near rio de janeiro , i was at first surprised to observe that , a few days after some little depressions had been filled with water , they were peopled by numerous full-grown shells and beetles , which must have been lying dormant .
humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened mud .
he adds , " the indians often find enormous <unk> , which they call <unk> , or water serpents , in the same <unk> state .
to <unk> them , they must be irritated or wetted with water . "
i <name> only mention one other animal , a <unk> ( i believe <unk> patagonica ) , a kind of <unk> .
it consists of a thin , straight , fleshy stem , with alternate rows of <unk> on each side , and surrounding an elastic stony axis , varying in length from eight inches to two feet .
the stem at one extremity is <unk> , but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage .
the stony axis which gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter .
at low water hundreds of these <unk> might be seen , projecting like stubble , with the <unk> end upwards , a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand .
when touched or pulled they suddenly <name> themselves in with force , so as nearly or quite to disappear .
by this action , the highly elastic axis must be bent at the lower extremity , where it is naturally slightly curved ; and i imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the <unk> is enabled to rise again through the mud .
each <unk> , though closely united to its brethren , has a distinct mouth , body , and <unk> .
of these <unk> , in a large specimen , there must be many thousands ; yet we see that they act by one movement : they have also one central axis connected with a system of obscure circulation , and the ova are produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals .
( <unk> .
the cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter , which , examined under a microscope , presented an extraordinary appearance .
the mass consisted of rounded , <unk> , irregular grains , aggregated together into particles of various sizes .
all such particles , and the separate grains , possessed the power of rapid movement ; generally revolving around different axes , but sometimes progressive .
the movement was visible with a very weak power , but even with the highest its cause could not be perceived .
it was very different from the circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag , containing the thin extremity of the axis .
on other occasions , when <unk> small <name> animals beneath the microscope , i have seen particles of pulpy matter , some of large size , as soon as they were disengaged , commence revolving .
i have imagined , i know not with how much truth , that this <unk> matter was in process of being converted into ova .
certainly in this <unk> such appeared to be the case . )
well may one be allowed to ask , what is an individual ?
it is always interesting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old voyagers ; and i have no doubt but that the habits of this <unk> explain one such case .
captain lancaster , in his voyage in 1601 , <unk> that on the <unk> of the island of <unk> , in the east indies , he " found a small twig growing up like a young tree , and on offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground , and sinks , unless held very hard .
on being plucked up , a great worm is found to be its root , and as the tree <unk> in greatness , so doth the worm diminish , and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it <unk> in the earth , and so becomes great .
this transformation is one of the strangest wonders that i saw in all my travels : for if this tree is plucked up , while young , and the leaves and bark stripped off , it becomes a hard stone when dry , much like white <name> : thus is this worm twice transformed into different natures .
of these we gathered and brought home many . "

during my stay at bahia <name> , while waiting for the " beagle , " the place was in a constant state of excitement , from rumours of wars and victories , between the troops of rosas and the wild indians .
one day an account came that a small party forming one of the <unk> on the line to buenos ayres had been found all murdered .
the next day three hundred men arrived from the colorado , under the command of commandant <name> .
a large portion of these men were indians ( <unk> , or tame ) , belonging to the tribe of the <unk> <unk> .
they passed the night here ; and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage than the scene of their bivouac .
some drank till they were intoxicated ; others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle slaughtered for their suppers , and then , being sick from drunkenness , they cast it up again , and were <unk> with filth and gore .
in the morning they started for the scene of the murder , with orders to follow the <unk> , or track , even if it led them to chile .
we subsequently heard that the wild indians had escaped into the great pampas , and from some cause the track had been missed .
one glance at the <unk> tells these people a whole history .
supposing they examine the track of a thousand horses , they <name> soon guess the number of mounted ones by seeing how many have cantered ; by the depth of the other impressions , whether any horses were loaded with cargoes ; by the irregularity of the footsteps , how far tired ; by the manner in which the food has been cooked , whether the pursued travelled in haste ; by the general appearance , how long it has been since they passed .
they consider a <unk> of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be hunted out .
we also heard that <name> struck from the west end of the <name> ventana , in a direct line to the island of <unk> , situated seventy leagues up the rio negro .
this is a distance of between two and three hundred miles , through a country completely unknown .
what other troops in the world are so independent ?
with the sun for their guide , <unk> flesh for food , their <unk> for beds ,  as long as there is a little water , these men would penetrate to the end of the world .
a few days afterwards i saw another troop of these <unk> soldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of indians at the small salinas , who had been betrayed by a prisoner <unk> .
the spaniard who brought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man .
he gave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present .
some indians , who had been taken prisoners , gave information of a tribe living north of the colorado .
two hundred soldiers were sent ; and they first discovered the indians by a cloud of dust from their horses ' feet as they chanced to be travelling .
the country was mountainous and wild , and it must have been far in the interior , for the cordillera were in sight .
the indians , men , women , and children , were about one hundred and ten in number , and they were nearly all taken or killed , for the soldiers sabre every man .
the indians are now so terrified that they offer no resistance in a body , but each flies , neglecting even his wife and children ; but when overtaken , like wild animals , they fight against any number to the last moment .
one dying indian seized with his teeth the thumb of his adversary , and allowed his own eye to be forced out sooner than relinquish his hold .
another , who was wounded , feigned death , keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal blow .
my <unk> said , when he was pursuing an indian , the man cried out for <name> , at the same time that he was covertly <unk> the bolas from his waist , meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his pursuer .
" i however struck him with my sabre to the ground , and then got off my horse , and cut his throat with my knife . "
this is a dark picture ; but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact , that all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold blood ?
when i exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman , he answered , " why , what can be done ?
they breed so ! "
every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war , because it is against barbarians .
who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a <name> civilised country ?
the children of the indians are saved , to be sold or given away as servants , or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make them believe themselves slaves ; but i believe in their treatment there is little to complain of .
in the battle four men ran away together .
they were pursued , one was killed , and the other three were taken alive .
they turned out to be messengers or ambassadors from a large body of indians , united in the common cause of defence , near the cordillera .
the tribe to which they had been sent was on the point of holding a grand council , the feast of mare 's flesh was ready , and the dance prepared : in the morning the ambassadors were to have returned to the cordillera .
they were remarkably fine men , very fair , above six feet high , and all under thirty years of age .
the three survivors of course possessed very valuable information and to extort this they were placed in a line .
the two first being questioned , answered , " no <unk> " ( i do not know ) , and were one after the other shot .
the third also said " no <unk> ; " adding , " fire , i am a man , and can die ! "
not one syllable would they breathe to injure the united cause of their country !
the conduct of the above-mentioned <unk> was very different ; he saved his life by betraying the intended plan of warfare , and the point of union in the andes .
it was believed that there were already six or seven hundred indians together , and that in summer their <name> would be doubled .
ambassadors were to have been sent to the indians at the small salinas , near bahia <name> , whom i have mentioned that this same <unk> had betrayed .
the communication , therefore , between the indians , extends from the cordillera to the coast of the atlantic .
general rosas 's plan is to kill all stragglers , and having driven the remainder to a common point , to attack them in a body , in the summer , with the assistance of the <unk> .
this operation is to be repeated for three successive years .
i imagine the summer is chosen as the time for the main attack , because the plains are then without water , and the indians can only travel in particular directions .
the escape of the indians to the south of the rio negro , where in such a vast unknown country they would be safe , is prevented by a treaty with the <unk> to this effect ;  that rosas pays them so much to slaughter every indian who passes to the south of the river , but if they fail in so doing , they themselves are to be exterminated .
the war is waged chiefly against the indians near the cordillera ; for many of the tribes on this eastern side are fighting with rosas .
the general , however , like lord chesterfield , thinking that his friends may in a future day become his enemies , always places them in the front ranks , so that their <name> may be thinned .
since leaving south <name> we have heard that this war of extermination completely failed .
among the captive girls taken in the same engagement , there were two very pretty spanish ones , who had been carried away by the indians when young , and could now only speak the indian tongue .
from their account they must have come from <unk> , a distance in a straight line of nearly one thousand miles .
this gives one a grand idea of the immense territory over which the indians roam : yet , great as it is , i think there <name> not , in another <unk> , be a wild indian northward of the rio negro .
the warfare is too bloody to last ; the christians killing every indian , and the indians doing the same by the christians .
it is melancholy to trace how the indians have given way before the spanish invaders .
<unk> says that in <unk> , when buenos ayres was founded , there were villages containing two and three thousand inhabitants .
( <unk> .
<unk> " collection of voyages . "
i believe the date was really <unk> . )
even in falconer 's time ( <unk> ) the indians made inroads as far as luxan , <unk> , and <unk> , but now they are driven beyond the salado .
not only have whole tribes been exterminated , but the remaining indians have become more barbarous : instead of living in large villages , and being employed in the arts of fishing , as well as of the <name> , they now wander about the open plains , without home or fixed occupation .
i heard also some account of an engagement which took place , a few weeks previously to the one mentioned , at <unk> .
this is a very important station on account of being a pass for horses ; and it was , in consequence , for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army .
when the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of indians , of whom they killed twenty or thirty .
the <unk> escaped in a manner which astonished every one .
the chief indians always have one or two picked horses , which they keep ready for any urgent occasion .
on one of these , an old white horse , the <unk> sprung , taking with him his little son .
the horse had neither saddle nor bridle .
to avoid the shots , the indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation ; namely , with an arm round the horse 's neck , and one leg only on its back .
thus hanging on one side , he was seen patting the horse 's head , and talking to him .
the pursuers urged every effort in the <name> ; the commandant three times changed his horse , but all in vain .
the old indian father and his son escaped , and were free .
what a fine picture one can form in one 's mind ,  the naked , <unk> figure of the old man with his little boy , riding like a mazeppa on the white horse , thus leaving far behind him the host of his pursuers !
i saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint , which i immediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow .
he told me it was found near the island of <unk> , and that they are frequently picked up there .
it was between two and three inches long , and therefore twice as large as those now used in <name> <name> fuego : it was made of opaque cream-coloured flint , but the point and barbs had been intentionally broken off .
it is well known that no pampas indians now use bows and arrows .
i believe a small tribe in banda oriental must be excepted ; but they are widely separated from the pampas indians , and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest , and live on foot .
it appears , therefore , that these arrow-heads are <unk> relics of the indians , before the great change in habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into south <name> .
( <unk> .
azara has even doubted whether the pampas indians ever used bows .
[ several similar agate arrow-heads have since been dug up at <unk> , and two were given to me , on the occasion of my visit there , by the <unk>  <unk> .

<name> 8 , 1833 .
i hired a gaucho to accompany me on my ride to buenos ayres , though with some difficulty , as the father of one man was afraid to let him go , and another who seemed willing , was described to me as so fearful that i was afraid to take him , for i was told that even if he saw an ostrich at a distance , he would mistake it for an indian , and would fly like the wind away .
the distance to buenos ayres is about four hundred miles , and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited country .
we started early in the morning ; ascending a few hundred feet from the basin of green turf on which bahia <name> stands , we entered on a wide desolate plain .
it consists of a crumbling <unk> rock , which , from the dry nature of the climate , supports only scattered tufts of withered grass , without a single bush or tree to break the monotonous uniformity .
the weather was fine , but the atmosphere remarkably hazy ; i thought the appearance <unk> a <name> , but the gauchos said it was owing to the plain , at some great distance in the interior , being on fire .
after a long gallop , having changed horses twice , we reached the rio sauce : it is a deep , rapid , little stream , not above twenty-five feet wide .
the second posta on the road to buenos ayres stands on its banks , a little above there is a ford for horses , where the water does not reach to the horses ' belly ; but from that point , in its course to the sea , it is quite impassable , and hence makes a most useful barrier against the indians .
insignificant as this stream is , the jesuit falconer , whose information is generally so very correct , figures it as a considerable river , rising at the foot of the cordillera .
with respect to its source , i do not doubt that this is the case ; for the gauchos assured me , that in the middle of the dry summer this stream , at the same time with the colorado , has periodical floods , which can only originate in the snow melting on the andes .
it is extremely improbable that a stream so small as the sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the continent ; and indeed , if it were the residue of a large river , its waters , as in other ascertained cases , would be saline .
during the <name> we must look to the springs round the <name> ventana as the source of its pure and limpid stream .
i suspect the plains of patagonia , like those of australia , are traversed by many <unk> , which only perform their proper parts at certain periods .
probably this is the case with the water which flows into the head of port <name> , and likewise with the rio <unk> , on the banks of which masses of highly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the survey .
as it was early in the afternoon when we arrived , we took fresh horses and a soldier for a guide , and started for the <name> de la ventana .
this mountain is visible from the anchorage at bahia <name> ; and captain fitz <name> <unk> its height to be <unk> feet  an altitude very remarkable on this eastern side of the continent .
i am not aware that any foreigner , previous to my visit , had ascended this mountain ; and indeed very few of the soldiers at bahia <name> knew anything about it .
hence we heard of beds of coal , of gold and silver , of caves , and of forests , all of which inflamed my curiosity , only to disappoint it .
the distance from the posta was about six leagues , over a level plain of the same character as before .
the ride was , however , interesting , as the mountain began to show its true form .
when we reached the foot of the main ridge , we had much difficulty in finding any water , and we thought we should have been obliged to have passed the night without any .
at last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain , for at the distance even of a few hundred yards , the <unk> were buried and entirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus .
i do not think nature ever made a more solitary , desolate pile of rock ;  it well deserves its name of <unk> , or separated .
the mountain is steep , extremely rugged , and broken , and so entirely destitute of trees , and even bushes , that we actually could not make a <unk> to stretch out our meat over the fire of <unk> .
( <unk> .
i call these <unk> for the want of a more correct name .
i believe it is a species of <unk> . )
the strange aspect of this mountain is contrasted by the <unk> plain , which not only <unk> against its steep sides , but likewise separates the parallel ranges .
the uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to the view ;  the whitish grey of the quartz rock , and the light brown of the withered grass of the plain , being <unk> by any brighter tint .
from custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and bold mountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments .
here nature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is changed into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity .
under these circumstances i was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any pebbles could be found .
on the shores of bahia <name> , and near the settlement , there were some of quartz , which certainly must have come from this source : the distance is forty-five miles .
the dew , which in the early part of the night wetted the <unk> under which we slept , was in the morning frozen .
the plain , though appearing horizontal , had insensibly sloped up to a height of between 800 and 900 feet above the sea .
in the morning ( 9th of <name> ) the guide told me to ascend the nearest ridge , which he thought would lead me to the four peaks that crown the summit .
the climbing up such rough rocks was very fatiguing ; the sides were so indented , that what was gained in one five minutes was often lost in the next .
at last , when i reached the ridge , my disappointment was extreme in finding a precipitous valley as deep as the plain , which cut the chain <unk> in two , and separated me from the four points .
this valley is very narrow , but flat-bottomed , and it forms a fine <unk> for the indians , as it connects the plains on the northern and southern sides of the range .
having descended , and while crossing it , i saw two horses grazing : i immediately hid myself in the long grass , and began to reconnoitre ; but as i could see no signs of indians i proceeded cautiously on my second ascent .
it was late in the day , and this part of the mountain , like the other , was steep and rugged .
i was on the top of the second peak by two o'clock , but got there with extreme difficulty ; every twenty yards i had the cramp in the upper part of both thighs , so that i was afraid i should not have been able to have got down again .
it was also necessary to return by another road , as it was out of the question to pass over the <unk> .
i was therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks .
their altitude was but little greater , and every purpose of geology had been answered ; so that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion .
i presume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of muscular action , from that of hard riding to that of still harder climbing .
it is a lesson worth remembering , as in some cases it might cause much difficulty .
i have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock , and with it a little glossy clay-slate is associated .
at the height of a few hundred feet above the plain , patches of conglomerate adhered in several places to the solid rock .
they resembled in hardness , and in the nature of the cement , the masses which may be seen daily forming on some coasts .
i do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner aggregated , at a period when the great calcareous formation was depositing beneath the surrounding sea .
we may believe that the jagged and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves of an open ocean .
i was , on the whole , disappointed with this ascent .
even the view was insignificant ;  a plain like the sea , but without its beautiful colour and defined outline .
the scene , however , was novel , and a little danger , like salt to meat , gave it a relish .
that the danger was very little was certain , for my two companions made a good fire  a thing which is never done when it is suspected that indians are near .
i reached the place of our bivouac by sunset , and drinking much <unk> , and smoking several <unk> , soon made up my bed for the night .
the wind was very strong and cold , but i never slept more comfortably .
<name> 10 , 1833 .
in the morning , having fairly <unk> before the <name> , we arrived by the middle of the day at the sauce posta .
on the road we saw great <name> of deer , and near the mountain a guanaco .
the plain , which <unk> against the <name> , is traversed by some curious <unk> , of which one was about twenty feet wide , and at least thirty deep ; we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we could find a pass .
we stayed the night at the posta , the conversation , as was generally the case , being about the indians .
the <name> ventana was formerly a great place of resort ; and three or four years ago there was much fighting there .
my guide had been present when many indians were killed : the women escaped to the top of the ridge , and fought most desperately with great stones ; many thus saving themselves .
<name> 11 , 1833 .
proceeded to the third posta in company with the lieutenant who commanded it .
the distance is called fifteen leagues ; but it is only <unk> , and is generally <unk> .
the road was uninteresting , over a dry grassy plain ; and on our left hand at a greater or less distance there were some low hills ; a continuation of which we crossed close to the posta .
before our arrival we met a large herd of cattle and horses , guarded by fifteen soldiers ; but we were told many had been lost .
it is very difficult to drive animals across the plains ; for if in the night a puma , or even a fox , approaches , nothing can prevent the horses <unk> in every direction ; and a storm <name> have the same effect .
a short time since , an officer left buenos ayres with five hundred horses , and when he arrived at the army he had under twenty .
soon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust , that a party of horsemen were coming towards us ; when far distant my companions knew them to be indians , by their long hair streaming behind their backs .
the indians generally have a <unk> round their heads , but never any covering ; and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces , <unk> to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance .
they turned out to be a party of <unk> friendly tribe , going to a <name> for salt .
the indians eat much salt , their children sucking it like sugar .
this habit is very different from that of the spanish gauchos , who , leading the same kind of life , eat scarcely any : according to mungo park , it is people who live on vegetable food who have an <unk> <name> for salt .
( <unk> .
" travels in africa " <name> 233 . )
the indians gave us <unk> nods as they passed at full gallop , driving before them a troop of horses , and followed by a train of lanky dogs .
<name> 12 and 13 , 1833 .
i stayed at this posta two days , waiting for a troop of soldiers , which general rosas had the kindness to send to inform me would shortly travel to buenos ayres ; and he advised me to take the opportunity of the escort .
in the morning we rode to some neighbouring hills to view the country , and to examine the geology .
after dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a trial of skill with the bolas .
two spears were stuck in the ground twenty-five yards apart , but they were struck and entangled only once in four or five times .
the balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards , but with little certainty .
this , however , does not apply to a man on horseback ; for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the arm , it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance of eighty yards .
as a proof of their force , i may mention , that at the falkland islands , when the spaniards murdered some of their own countrymen and all the englishmen , a young friendly spaniard was running away , when a great tall man , by name <name> , came at full gallop after him , shouting to him to stop , and saying that he only wanted to speak to him .
just as the spaniard was on the point of reaching the boat , <name> threw the balls : they struck him on the legs with such a jerk , as to throw him down and to render him for some time insensible .
the man , after <name> had had his talk , was allowed to escape .
he told us that his legs were marked by great <unk> , where the thong had wound round , as if he had been flogged with a whip .
in the middle of the day two men arrived , who brought a parcel from the next posta to be forwarded to the general : so that besides these two , our party consisted this evening of my guide and self , the lieutenant , and his four soldiers .
the latter were strange beings ; the first a fine young negro ; the second half indian and negro ; and the two others <unk> ; namely , an old chilian miner , the colour of mahogany , and another partly a mulatto ; but two such mongrels , with such detestable expressions , i never saw before .
at night , when they were sitting round the fire , and playing at cards , i retired to view such a <unk> <name> scene .
they were seated under a low <name> , so that i could look down upon them ; around the party were lying dogs , arms , remnants of deer and ostriches ; and their long spears were stuck in the turf .
farther in the dark background their horses were tied up , ready for any sudden danger .
if the stillness of the desolate plain was broken by one of the dogs barking , a soldier , leaving the fire , would place his head close to the ground , and thus slowly scan the horizon .
even if the noisy <unk> uttered its scream , there would be a pause in the conversation , and every head , for a moment , a little inclined .
what a life of misery these men appear to us to lead !
they were at least ten leagues from the sauce posta , and since the murder committed by the indians , twenty from another .
the indians are supposed to have made their attack in the middle of the night ; for very early in the morning after the murder , they were luckily seen approaching this posta .
the whole party here , however , escaped , together with the troop of horses ; each one taking a line for himself , and driving with him as many animals as he was able to manage .
the little hovel , built of <unk> , in which they slept , neither kept out the wind nor rain ; indeed in the latter case the only effect the roof had , was to condense it into larger drops .
they had nothing to eat excepting what they could catch , such as ostriches , deer , <unk> , etc. , and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small plant , somewhat resembling an <unk> .
the sole luxury which these men enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars , and sucking <unk> .
i used to think that the carrion vultures , man's constant attendants on these dreary plains , while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs , seemed by their very <name> to say , " ah !
when the indians come we shall have a feast . "
( plate 25 .
<unk> pots and <unk> . )
in the morning we all sallied forth to hunt , and although we had not much success , there were some animated <unk> .
soon after starting the party separated , and so arranged their plans , that at a certain time of the day ( in guessing which they show much skill ) they should all meet from different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground , and thus drive together the wild animals .
one day i went out hunting at bahia <name> , but the men there merely rode in a crescent , each being about a quarter of a mile apart from the other .
a fine male ostrich being turned by the <unk> riders , tried to escape on one side .
the gauchos pursued at a reckless pace , twisting their horses about with the most admirable command , and each man whirling the balls round his head .
at length the foremost threw them , revolving through the air : in an instant the ostrich rolled over and over , its legs fairly lashed together by the thong .
the plains abound with three kinds of partridge , two of which are as large as hen pheasants .
( <unk> .
two species of <unk> and <unk> elegans of a. d'orbigny , which can only be called a partridge with regard to its habits . )
their destroyer , a small and pretty fox , was also singularly numerous ; in the course of the day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty .
they were generally near their <unk> , but the dogs killed one .
when we returned to the posta , we found two of the party returned who had been hunting by themselves .
they had killed a puma , and had found an ostrich 's nest with twenty-seven eggs in it .
each of these is said to equal in weight eleven hens ' eggs ; so that we obtained from this one nest as much food as 297 hens ' eggs would have given .
<name> 14 , 1833 .
as the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to return , and we should together make a party of five , and all armed , i determined not to wait for the expected troops .
my host , the lieutenant , pressed me much to stop .
as he had been very obliging  not only providing me with food , but lending me his private horses  i wanted to make him some <unk> .
i asked my guide whether i might do so , but he told me certainly not ; that the only answer i should receive probably would be , " we have meat for the dogs in our country , and therefore do not grudge it to a <name> . "
it must not be supposed that the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the acceptance of payment : it was only the high sense of hospitality , which every traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout these provinces .
after galloping some leagues , we came to a low swampy country , which extends for nearly eighty miles northward , as far as the <name> tapalguen .
in some parts there were fine damp plains , covered with grass , while others had a soft , black , and peaty soil .
there were also many extensive but shallow lakes , and large beds of reeds .
the country on the whole resembled the better parts of the <unk> fens .
at night we had some difficulty in finding , amidst the swamps , a dry place for our bivouac .
<name> 15 , 1833 .
rose very early in the morning , and shortly after passed the posta where the indians had murdered the five soldiers .
the officer had eighteen <unk> wounds in his body .
by the middle of the day , after a hard gallop , we reached the fifth posta : on account of some difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night .
as this point was the most exposed on the whole line , twenty-one soldiers were stationed here ; at sunset they returned from hunting , bringing with them seven deer , three ostriches , and many <unk> and partridges .
when riding through the country , it is a common practice to set fire to the plain ; and hence at night , as on this occasion , the horizon was illuminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations .
this is done partly for the sake of puzzling any stray indians , but chiefly for improving the pasture .
in grassy plains unoccupied by the larger <unk> quadrupeds , it seems necessary to remove the superfluous vegetation by fire , so as to render the new year 's growth serviceable .
the <unk> at this place did not boast even of a roof , but merely consisted of a ring of <unk> , to break the force of the wind .
it was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake , swarming with wild fowl , among which the <unk> swan was conspicuous .
the kind of <unk> which appears as if mounted on stilts ( <unk> <unk> ) , is here common in flocks of considerable size .
it has been <unk> accused of <unk> ; when wading about in shallow water , which is its favourite resort , its gait is far from awkward .
these birds in a flock utter a noise , that singularly resembles the cry of a pack of small dogs in full <name> : waking in the night , i have more than once been for a moment startled at the distant sound .
the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) is another bird which often disturbs the stillness of the night .
in appearance and habits it resembles in many respects our <unk> ; its wings , however , are armed with sharp spurs , like those on the legs of the common cock .
as our <unk> takes its name from the sound of its voice , so does the <unk> .
while riding over the grassy plains , one is constantly pursued by these birds , which appear to hate mankind , and i am sure deserve to be hated for their <unk> , <unk> , harsh screams .
to the sportsman they are most annoying , by telling every other bird and animal of his approach : to the traveller in the country they may possibly , as <unk> says , do good , by warning him of the midnight robber .
during the breeding season , they attempt , like our <unk> , by <unk> to be wounded , to draw away from their nests dogs and other enemies .
the eggs of this bird are esteemed a great delicacy .
<name> 16 , 1833 .
to the seventh posta at the foot of the <name> tapalguen .
the country was quite level , with a coarse herbage and a soft peaty soil .
the hovel was here remarkably neat , the posts and rafters being made of about a dozen dry <unk> bound together with thongs of hide ; and by the support of these <unk> columns , the roof and sides were thatched with reeds .
we were here told a fact , which i would not have credited , if i had not had partly <unk> proof of it ; namely , that , during the previous night , hail as large as small apples , and extremely hard , had fallen with such violence as to kill the greater number of the wild animals .
one of the men had already found thirteen deer ( cervus campestris ) lying dead , and i saw their fresh hides ; another of the party , a few minutes after my arrival , brought in seven more .
now i well know , that one man without dogs could hardly have killed seven deer in a week .
the men believed they had seen about fifteen dead ostriches ( part of one of which we had for dinner ) ; and they said that several were running about evidently blind in one eye .
<name> of smaller birds , as ducks , hawks , and partridges , were killed .
i saw one of the latter with a black <name> on its back , as if it had been struck with a <unk> .
a fence of <unk> round the hovel was nearly broken down , and my <unk> , putting his head out to see what was the matter , received a severe cut , and now wore a bandage .
the storm was said to have been of limited extent : we certainly saw from our last night 's bivouac a dense cloud and lightning in this direction .
it is marvellous how such strong animals as deer could thus have been killed ; but i have no doubt , from the evidence i have given , that the story is not in the least exaggerated .
i am glad , however , to have its <unk> supported by the jesuit <unk> , who , speaking of a country much to the northward , says , hail fell of an enormous size and killed vast <name> of cattle ( <unk> .
" history of the <unk> " volume 2 <name> 6 .
) : the indians hence called the place <unk> , meaning " the little white things . "
dr. <unk> , also , informs me that he witnessed in 1831 in <name> a <unk> , which killed <name> of large birds and much injured the cattle .
these <unk> were flat , and one was ten inches in circumference , and another weighed two ounces .
they ploughed up a <unk> like <unk> , and passed through <unk> , making round holes , but not cracking them .
having finished our dinner of <unk> meat , we crossed the <name> tapalguen ; a low range of hills , a few hundred feet in height , which commences at cape <unk> .
the rock in this part is pure quartz ; farther eastward i understand it is granitic .
the hills are of a remarkable form ; they consist of flat patches of table-land , surrounded by low perpendicular cliffs , like the <unk> of a sedimentary deposit .
the hill which i ascended was very small , not above a couple of hundred yards in diameter ; but i saw others larger .
one which goes by the name of the " corral , " is said to be two or three miles in diameter , and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs between thirty and forty feet high , excepting at one spot , where the entrance lies .
falconer gives a curious account of the indians driving troops of wild horses into it , and then by guarding the entrance keeping them secure .
( <unk> .
<unk> " patagonia " <name> 70 . )
i have never heard of any other instance of table-land in a formation of quartz , and which , in the hill i examined , had neither cleavage nor stratification .
i was told that the rock of the " corral " was white , and would strike fire .
we did not reach the posta on the rio tapalguen till after it was dark .
at supper , from something which was said , i was suddenly struck with horror at thinking that i was eating one of the favourite dishes of the country , namely , a half formed calf , long before its proper time of birth .
it turned out to be puma ; the meat is very white , and remarkably like <unk> in taste .
dr. shaw was laughed at for stating that " the flesh of the lion is in great esteem , having no small affinity with <unk> , both in colour , taste , and flavour . "
such certainly is the case with the puma .
the gauchos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar is good eating , but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent .
<name> 17 , 1833 .
we followed the course of the rio tapalguen , through a very fertile country , to the ninth posta .
tapalguen itself , or the town of tapalguen , if it may be so called , consists of a perfectly level plain , studded over , as far as the eye can reach , with the <unk> , or <unk> huts of the indians .
the families of the friendly indians , who were fighting on the side of rosas , resided here .
we met and passed many young indian women , riding by two or three together on the same horse : they , as well as many of the young men , were strikingly handsome ,  their fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health .
besides the <unk> , there were three <unk> ; one inhabited by the commandant , and the two others by spaniards with small shops .
we were here able to buy some biscuit .
i had now been several days without tasting anything besides meat : i did not at all dislike this new <unk> ; but i felt as if it would only have agreed with me with hard exercise .
i have heard that patients in england , when desired to confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet , even with the <name> of life before their eyes , have hardly been able to endure it .
yet the gaucho in the pampas , for months together , touches nothing but beef .
but they eat , i observe , a very large proportion of fat , which is of a less <unk> nature ; and they particularly dislike dry meat , such as that of the agouti .
dr. richardson , also , has remarked , " that when people have fed for a long time solely upon <name> animal food , the <name> for fat becomes so insatiable , that they can consume a large quantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea " ( <unk> .
" fauna <unk> " volume 1 <name> 35 .
) : this appears to me a curious physiological fact .
it is , perhaps , from their meat <unk> that the gauchos , like other carnivorous animals , can abstain long from food .
i was told that at <unk> some troops voluntarily pursued a party of indians for three days , without eating or drinking .
we saw in the shops many articles , such as <unk> , belts , and <unk> , woven by the indian women .
the patterns were very pretty , and the colours brilliant ; the workmanship of the <unk> was so good that an english merchant at buenos ayres maintained they must have been manufactured in england , till he found the tassels had been fastened by split sinew .
<name> 18 , 1833 .
we had a very long ride this day .
at the twelfth posta , which is seven leagues south of the rio salado , we came to the first estancia with cattle and white women .
afterwards we had to ride for many miles through a country flooded with water above our <unk> knees .
by crossing the stirrups , and riding <unk> with our legs bent up , we contrived to keep tolerably dry .
it was nearly dark when we arrived at the salado ; the stream was deep , and about forty yards wide ; in summer , however , its bed becomes almost dry , and the little remaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea .
we slept at one of the great <unk> of general rosas .
it was fortified , and of such an extent , that arriving in the dark i thought it was a town and fortress .
in the morning we saw immense herds of cattle , the general here having seventy-four square leagues of land .
formerly nearly three hundred men were employed about this estate , and they defied all the attacks of the indians .
<name> 19 , 1833 .
passed the <unk> <name> <name> .
this is a nice scattered little town , with many gardens , full of peach and quince trees .
the plain here looked like that around buenos ayres ; the turf being short and bright green , with beds of clover and thistles , and with bizcacha holes .
i was very much struck with the marked change in the aspect of the country after having crossed the salado .
from a coarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure .
i at first attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil , but the inhabitants assured me that here , as well as in banda oriental , where there is as great a difference between the country around <name> video and the <unk> <unk> of colonia , the whole was to be attributed to the <unk> and grazing of the cattle .
exactly the same fact has been observed in the prairies of north <name> , where coarse grass , between five and six feet high , when grazed by cattle , changes into common pasture land .
( <unk> .
see mr. <unk> 's " account of the prairies " in " silliman 's north american journal " volume 1 <name> 117 . )
i am not botanist enough to say whether the change here is owing to the introduction of new species , to the altered growth of the same , or to a difference in their proportional <name> .
azara has also observed with astonishment this change : he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of plants not occurring in the neighbourhood , on the borders of any track that leads to a <unk> hovel .
in another part he says , " ces <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> la <name> de <unk> <name> <unk> , et <name> <unk> des routes pour <unk> leurs <unk> , dont on <unk> des <unk> dans ces <unk> . "
( 6/8 .
azara 's " voyage " volume 1 <name> 373 . )
does this not partly explain the circumstance ?
we thus have lines of richly manured land serving as channels of communication across wide districts .
( plate 26 .
giant thistle of pampas . )
( plate 27 .
<unk> <unk> or cardoon . )
near the <unk> we find the southern limit of two european plants , now become extraordinarily common .
the <unk> in great profusion covers the <unk> in the neighbourhood of buenos ayres , <name> video , and other towns .
but the cardoon ( <unk> <unk> ) has a far wider range : it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the cordillera , across the continent .
( <unk> .
m. a. d'orbigny volume 1 <name> <unk> , says that the cardoon and <unk> are both found wild .
dr. hooker " botanical magazine " volume 40 <name> <unk> , has described a variety of the <unk> from this part of south <name> under the name of <unk> .
he states that botanists are now generally agreed that the cardoon and the <unk> are varieties of one plant .
i may add , that an intelligent farmer assured me that he had observed in a deserted garden some <unk> changing into the common cardoon .
dr. hooker believes that head 's vivid description of the thistle of the pampas applies to the cardoon , but this is a mistake .
captain head referred to the plant which i have mentioned a few lines lower down under the title of giant thistle .
whether it is a true thistle , i do not know ; but it is quite different from the cardoon ; and more like a thistle properly so called . )
i saw it in unfrequented spots in chile , entre rios , and banda oriental .
in the latter country alone , very many ( probably several hundred ) square miles are covered by one mass of these prickly plants , and are impenetrable by man or beast .
over the undulating plains , where these great beds occur , nothing else can now live .
before their introduction , however , the surface must have supported , as in other parts , a rank herbage .
i doubt whether any case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over the aborigines .
as i have already said , i nowhere saw the cardoon south of the salado ; but it is probable that in proportion as that country becomes inhabited , the cardoon <name> extend its limits .
the case is different with the giant thistle ( with variegated leaves ) of the pampas , for i met with it in the valley of the sauce .
according to the principles so well laid down by mr. lyell , few countries have undergone more remarkable changes , since the year <unk> , when the first <unk> of la plata landed with seventy-two horses .
the countless herds of horses , cattle , and sheep , not only have altered the whole aspect of the vegetation , but they have almost banished the guanaco , deer , and ostrich .
numberless other changes must likewise have taken place ; the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the <unk> ; packs of wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the <unk> streams ; and the common cat , altered into a large and fierce animal , inhabits <name> hills .
as m. d'orbigny has remarked , the increase in <name> of the <unk> , since the introduction of the domestic animals , must have been infinitely great ; and we have given reasons for believing that they have extended their southern range .
no doubt many plants , besides the cardoon and <unk> , are naturalised ; thus the islands near the mouth of the parana are thickly clothed with peach and orange trees , springing from seeds carried there by the waters of the river .
while changing horses at the <unk> several people questioned us much about the army ,  i never saw anything like the enthusiasm for rosas , and for the success of the " most just of all wars , because against barbarians . "
this expression , it must be confessed , is very natural , for till lately , neither man , woman , nor horse was safe from the attacks of the indians .
we had a long day 's ride over the same <name> green plain , abounding with various flocks , and with here and there a solitary estancia , and its one <unk> tree .
in the evening it rained heavily : on arriving at a <unk> we were told by the owner that if we had not a regular passport we must pass on , for there were so many robbers he would trust no one .
when he read , however , my passport , which began with " el <unk> <name> <name> , " his respect and civility were as unbounded as his suspicions had been before .
what a naturalist might be , neither he nor his countrymen , i suspect , had any idea ; but probably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause .
<name> 20 , 1833 .
we arrived by the middle of the day at buenos ayres .
the outskirts of the city looked quite pretty , with the <unk> hedges , and groves of <name> , peach and <name> trees , all just throwing out their fresh green leaves .
i rode to the house of mr. <unk> , an english merchant , to whose kindness and hospitality , during my stay in the country , i was greatly indebted .
the city of buenos ayres is large ; and i should think one of the most regular in the world .
( <unk> .
it is said to contain 60,000 inhabitants .
<name> video , the second town of importance on the banks of the plata , has 15,000 . )
every street is at right angles to the one it crosses , and the parallel ones being equidistant , the houses are collected into solid squares of equal dimensions , which are called <unk> .
on the other hand , the houses themselves are hollow squares ; all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard .
they are generally only one story high , with flat roofs , which are fitted with seats , and are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer .
in the centre of the town is the plaza , where the public offices , fortress , cathedral , etc. , stand .
here also , the old viceroys , before the revolution , had their palaces .
the general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable architectural beauty , although none individually can boast of any .
the great corral , where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply food to this <unk> population , is one of the spectacles best worth seeing .
the strength of the horse as compared to that of the bullock is quite astonishing : a man on horseback having thrown his lazo round the horns of a beast , can drag it anywhere he chooses .
the animal ploughing up the ground with outstretched legs , in vain efforts to resist the force , generally dashes at full speed to one side ; but the horse , immediately turning to receive the shock , stands so firmly that the bullock is almost thrown down , and it is surprising that their necks are not broken .
the struggle is not , however , one of fair strength ; the horse 's girth being matched against the bullock 's extended neck .
in a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse , if caught with the lazo , just behind the ears .
when the bullock has been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered , the <unk> with great caution cuts the <unk> .
then is given the death bellow ; a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any i know .
i have often distinguished it from a long distance , and have always known that the struggle was then drawing to a close .
the whole sight is horrible and revolting : the ground is almost made of bones ; and the horses and riders are drenched with gore .

buenos ayres to st. fé .
<name> 27 , 1833 .
in the evening i set out on an excursion to st. fé , which is situated nearly three hundred english miles from buenos ayres , on the banks of the parana .
the roads in the neighbourhood of the city , after the rainy weather , were extraordinarily bad .
i should never have thought it possible for a bullock <unk> to have crawled along : as it was , they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour , and a man was kept ahead , to survey the best line for making the attempt .
the bullocks were terribly jaded : it is a great mistake to suppose that with improved roads , and an accelerated rate of travelling , the sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion .
we passed a train of <unk> and a troop of beasts on their road to mendoza .
the distance is about <unk> geographical miles , and the journey is generally performed in fifty days .
these <unk> are very long , narrow , and thatched with reeds ; they have only two wheels , the diameter of which in some cases is as much as ten feet .
each is drawn by six bullocks , which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long : this is suspended from within the roof ; for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is kept ; and for the intermediate pair , a point projects at right angles from the middle of the long one .
the whole apparatus looked like some implement of war .
<name> 28 , 1833 .
we passed the small town of luxan , where there is a wooden bridge over the river  a most unusual convenience in this country .
we passed also <unk> .
the plains appeared level , but were not so in fact ; for in various places the horizon was distant .
the <unk> are here wide apart ; for there is little good pasture , owing to the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover , or of the great thistle .
the latter , well known from the animated description given by sir f. head , were at this time of the year two-thirds grown ; in some parts they were as high as the horse 's back , but in others they had not yet sprung up , and the ground was bare and <name> as on a <unk> .
the clumps were of the most brilliant green , and they made a pleasing <unk> of broken forest land .
when the thistles are full grown , the great beds are impenetrable , except by a few tracks , as intricate as those in a labyrinth .
these are only known to the robbers , who at this season inhabit them , and <name> forth at night to <name> and cut throats with impunity .
upon asking at a house whether robbers were numerous , i was answered , " the thistles are not up yet ; "  the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious .
there is little interest in passing over these tracts , for they are inhabited by few animals or birds , excepting the bizcacha and its friend the little owl .
the bizcacha is well known to form a prominent feature in the zoology of the pampas .
( <unk> .
the bizcacha ( <unk> <unk> ) somewhat resembles a large rabbit , but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail ; it has , however , only three toes behind , like the agouti .
during the last three or four years the skins of these animals have been sent to england for the sake of the fur . )
it is found as far south as the rio negro , in latitude 41 degrees , but not beyond .
it can not , like the agouti , subsist on the gravelly and desert plains of patagonia , but prefers a <unk> or <name> soil , which produces a different and more abundant vegetation .
near mendoza , at the foot of the cordillera , it occurs in close neighbourhood with the allied alpine species .
it is a very curious circumstance in its geographical distribution , that it has never been seen , fortunately for the inhabitants of banda oriental , to the eastward of the river uruguay : yet in this province there are plains which appear admirably adapted to its habits .
the uruguay has formed an insuperable obstacle to its migration : although the broader barrier of the parana has been passed , and the bizcacha is common in entre rios , the province between these two great rivers .
near buenos ayres these animals are exceedingly common .
their most favourite resort appears to be those parts of the plain which during one-half of the year are covered with giant thistles , to the exclusion of other plants .
the gauchos affirm that it lives on roots ; which , from the great strength of its gnawing teeth , and the kind of places frequented by it , seems probable .
in the evening the <unk> come out in <name> , and quietly sit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches .
at such times they are very tame , and a man on horseback passing by seems only to present an object for their grave contemplation .
they run very awkwardly , and when running out of danger , from their elevated tails and short front legs , much resemble great rats .
their flesh , when cooked , is very white and good , but it is seldom used .
the bizcacha has one very singular habit ; namely , dragging every hard object to the mouth of its burrow : around each group of holes many bones of cattle , stones , <unk> , hard lumps of earth , dry <name> , etc. , are collected into an irregular heap , which frequently amounts to as much as a wheelbarrow would contain .
i was <unk> informed that a gentleman , when riding on a dark night , dropped his watch ; he returned in the morning , and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha hole on the line of road , as he expected , he soon found it .
this habit of picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its habitation must cost much trouble .
for what purpose it is done , i am quite unable to form even the most remote conjecture : it can not be for defence , because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the burrow , which enters the ground at a very small inclination .
no doubt there must exist some good reason ; but the inhabitants of the country are quite ignorant of it .
the only fact which i know analogous to it , is the habit of that extraordinary australian bird , the <unk> <unk> , which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing in , and which collects near the spot land and sea-shells , bones , and the feathers of birds , especially brightly coloured ones .
mr. gould , who has described these facts , informs me , that the natives , when they lose any hard object , search the playing passages , and he has known a <unk> thus recovered .
the little owl ( <unk> <unk> ) , which has been so often mentioned , on the plains of buenos ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the bizcacha ; but in banda oriental it is its own workman .
during the open day , but more especially in the evening , these birds may be seen in every direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their burrows .
if disturbed they either enter the hole , or , uttering a shrill harsh cry , move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short distance , and then turning round , steadily gaze at their pursuer .
occasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting .
i found in the stomachs of two which i opened the remains of mice , and i one day saw a small snake killed and carried away .
it is said that snakes are their common prey during the daytime .
i may here mention , as showing on what various kinds of food owls subsist , that a species killed among the islets of the chonos archipelago had its stomach full of good-sized crabs .
in <name> there is a fishing genus of owls , which likewise catches crabs .
( <unk> .

in the evening we crossed the rio <unk> on a simple raft made of barrels lashed together , and slept at the <unk> on the other side .
i this day paid <unk> for thirty-one leagues ; and although the sun was glaring hot i was but little fatigued .
when captain head talks of riding fifty leagues a day , i do not imagine the distance is equal to 150 english miles .
at all events , the thirty-one leagues was only 76 miles in a straight line , and in an open country i should think four additional miles for <unk> would be a sufficient allowance .
<name> 29 and 30 , 1833 .
( plate 30 .
parana river . )
we continued to ride over plains of the same character .
at san <name> i first saw the <name> river of the parana .
at the foot of the <name> on which the town stands , some large vessels were at anchor .
before arriving at <unk> , we crossed the <unk> , a stream of fine clear running water , but too saline to drink .
<unk> is a large town built on a dead level plain , which forms a <name> about sixty feet high over the parana .
the river here is very broad , with many islands , which are low and wooded , as is also the opposite shore .
the view would resemble that of a great lake , if it were not for the <unk> islets , which alone give the idea of running water .
the cliffs are the most picturesque part ; sometimes they are absolutely perpendicular , and of a red colour ; at other times in large broken masses , covered with <unk> and <unk> .
the real grandeur , however , of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how important a means of communication and commerce it forms between one nation and another ; to what a distance it travels , and from how vast a territory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your feet .
for many leagues north and south of san <name> and <unk> , the country is really level .
scarcely anything which travellers have written about its extreme flatness can be considered as exaggeration .
yet i could never find a spot where , by slowly turning round , objects were not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others ; and this manifestly proves inequality in the plain .
at sea , a person 's eye being six feet above the surface of the water , his horizon is two miles and four-fifths distant .
in like manner , the more level the plain , the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow limits ; and this , in my opinion , entirely destroys that grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed .

toxodon <unk> .
( found at <unk> . ) )
october 1 , 1833 .
we started by moonlight and arrived at the rio <unk> by sunrise .
this river is also called the <unk> , and it deserves the name , for the water is brackish .
i stayed here the greater part of the day , searching for fossil bones .
besides a perfect tooth of the toxodon , and many scattered bones , i found two immense skeletons near each other , projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular <name> of the parana .
they were , however , so completely decayed , that i could only bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth ; but these are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a mastodon , probably to the same species with that which formerly must have inhabited the cordillera in upper peru in such great <name> .
the men who took me in the canoe said they had long known of these skeletons , and had often wondered how they had got there : the necessity of a theory being felt , they came to the conclusion that , like the bizcacha , the mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal !
in the evening we rode another stage , and crossed the <unk> , another brackish stream , bearing the <unk> of the <unk> of the pampas .
october 2 , 1833 .
we passed through <unk> , which , from the luxuriance of its gardens , was one of the prettiest villages i saw .
from this point to st. fé the road is not very safe .
the western side of the parana northward ceases to be inhabited ; and hence the indians sometimes come down thus far , and <unk> travellers .
the nature of the country also favours this , for instead of a grassy plain , there is an open woodland , composed of low prickly <unk> .
we passed some houses that had been ransacked and since deserted ; we saw also a spectacle , which my guides viewed with high satisfaction ; it was the skeleton of an indian with the dried skin hanging on the bones , suspended to the branch of a tree .
in the morning we arrived at st. fé .
i was surprised to observe how great a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of latitude between this place and buenos ayres had caused .
this was evident from the dress and complexion of the men  from the increased size of the <unk>  the number of new <unk> and other plants  and especially from the birds .
in the course of an hour i remarked half-a-dozen birds , which i had never seen at buenos ayres .
considering that there is no natural boundary between the two places , and that the character of the country is nearly similar , the difference was much greater than i should have expected .
october 3 and 4 , 1833 .
i was confined for these two days to my bed by a headache .
a good-natured old woman , who attended me , wished me to try many odd remedies .
a common practice is , to bind an <unk> or a bit of black plaster to each <name> : and a still more general plan is , to split a bean into halves , <unk> them , and place one on each <name> , where they <name> easily adhere .
it is not thought proper ever to remove the beans or plaster , but to allow them to drop off , and sometimes , if a man , with patches on his head , is asked , what is the matter ?
he <name> answer , " i had a headache the day before yesterday . "
many of the remedies used by the people of the country are ludicrously strange , but too disgusting to be mentioned .
one of the least nasty is to kill and cut open two puppies and bind them on each side of a broken limb .
little hairless dogs are in great request to sleep at the feet of invalids .
st. fé is a quiet little town , and is kept clean and in good order .
the governor , <unk> , was a common soldier at the time of the revolution ; but has now been seventeen years in power .
this stability of government is owing to his tyrannical habits ; for tyranny seems as yet better adapted to these countries than <unk> .
the governor 's favourite occupation is hunting indians : a short time since he slaughtered forty-eight , and sold the children at the rate of three or four pounds apiece .
october 5 , 1833 .
we crossed the parana to st. fé bajada , a town on the opposite shore .
the passage took some hours , as the river here consisted of a labyrinth of small streams , separated by low wooded islands .
i had a letter of introduction to an old <unk> spaniard , who treated me with the most uncommon hospitality .
the bajada is the capital of entre rios .
in 1825 the town contained <unk> inhabitants , and the province <unk> ; yet , few as the inhabitants are , no province has suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions .
they boast here of representatives , ministers , a standing army , and governors : so it is no wonder that they have their revolutions .
at some future day this must be one of the richest countries of la plata .
the soil is varied and productive ; and its almost insular form gives it two grand lines of communication by the rivers parana and uruguay .
i was delayed here five days , and employed myself in examining the geology of the surrounding country , which was very interesting .
we here see at the bottom of the cliffs , beds containing sharks ' teeth and sea-shells of extinct species , passing above into an indurated marl , and from that into the red <unk> earth of the pampas , with its calcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds .
this vertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water , gradually <unk> on , and at last converted into the bed of a muddy estuary , into which floating carcasses were swept .
at punta gorda , in banda oriental , i found an alternation of the <unk> estuary deposit , with a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells ; and this shows either a change in the former currents , or more probably an oscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary .
until lately , my reasons for considering the <unk> formation to be an estuary deposit were , its general appearance , its position at the mouth of the existing great river the plata , and the presence of so many bones of terrestrial quadrupeds : but now professor ehrenberg has had the kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth , taken from low down in the deposit , close to the skeletons of the mastodon , and he finds in it many infusoria , partly salt-water and partly fresh-water forms , with the latter rather <unk> ; and therefore , as he remarks , the water must have been brackish .
m. a. d'orbigny found on the banks of the parana , at the height of a hundred feet , great beds of an estuary shell , now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea ; and i found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the uruguay ; this shows that just before the pampas was slowly elevated into dry land , the water covering it was brackish .
below buenos ayres there are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species , which also proves that the period of elevation of the pampas was within the recent period .
in the <unk> deposit at the bajada i found the <unk> armour of a gigantic <unk> animal , the inside of which , when the earth was removed , was like a great <unk> ; i found also teeth of the toxodon and mastodon , and one tooth of a horse , in the same stained and decayed state .
this latter tooth greatly interested me , and i took scrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded contemporaneously with the other remains ; for i was not then aware that amongst the fossils from bahia <name> there was a horse 's tooth hidden in the <unk> : nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of horses are common in north <name> .
( <unk> .
i need hardly state here that there is good evidence against any horse living in <name> at the time of <name> . )
mr. lyell has lately brought from the united states a tooth of a horse ; and it is an interesting fact , that professor <name> could find in no species , either fossil or recent , a slight but peculiar curvature <unk> it , until he thought of comparing it with my specimen found here : he has named this american horse equus <unk> .
certainly it is a marvellous fact in the history of the mammalia , that in south <name> a native horse should have lived and disappeared , to be succeeded in after ages by the countless herds descended from the few introduced with the spanish colonists !

cuvier " <unk> fossils " tome 1 <name> 158 .
) , and of a <unk> <unk> , discovered by mm .
lund and <unk> in the caves of brazil , are highly interesting facts with respect to the geographical distribution of animals .
at the present time , if we divide <name> , not by the isthmus of panama , but by the southern part of mexico in latitude 20 degrees , where the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of species , by affecting the climate , and by forming , with the exception of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast , a broad barrier ; we shall then have the two zoological provinces of north and south <name> strongly contrasted with each other .
( <unk> .
this is the geographical division followed by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and richardson .
the section from <name> <name> to <unk> , given by humboldt in the " <unk> .
essay on kingdom of n. spain " <name> show how immense a barrier the mexican table-land forms .
dr. richardson , in his admirable " report on the zoology of n. <name> " read before the british association 1836 <name> 157 , talking of the identification of a mexican animal with the <unk> <unk> , says , " we do not know with what propriety , but if correct , it is , if not a solitary instance , at least very nearly so , of a rodent animal being common to north and south <name> . " )
some few species alone have passed the barrier , and may be considered as wanderers from the south , such as the puma , opossum , <unk> , and <unk> .
south <name> is characterised by possessing many peculiar <unk> , a family of monkeys , the <unk> , <unk> , tapir , <unk> , and , especially , several genera of edentata , the order which includes the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
north <name> , on the other hand , is characterised ( putting on one side a few wandering species ) by numerous peculiar <unk> , and by four genera ( the ox , sheep , goat , and antelope ) of <unk> ruminants , of which great division south <name> is not known to possess a single species .
formerly , but within the period when most of the now existing shells were living , north <name> possessed , besides <unk> ruminants , the elephant , mastodon , horse , and three genera of edentata , namely , the megatherium , <unk> , and mylodon .
within nearly this same period ( as proved by the shells at bahia <name> ) south <name> possessed , as we have just seen , a mastodon , horse , <unk> <unk> , and the same three genera ( as well as several others ) of the edentata .
hence it is evident that north and south <name> , in having within a late geological period these several genera in common , were much more closely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than they now are .
the more i reflect on this case , the more interesting it appears : i know of no other instance where we can almost <name> the period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two <unk> zoological provinces .
the geologist , who is fully impressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the <unk> crust within late periods , <name> not fear to speculate on the recent elevation of the mexican platform , or , more probably , on the recent <unk> of land in the west indian archipelago , as the cause of the present zoological separation of north and south <name> .
the south american character of the west indian mammals seems to indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern continent , and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence .
( <unk> .
see dr. richardson 's " report " <name> 157 ; also " <unk> " 1837 <name> 253 .
cuvier says the <unk> is found in the larger <unk> , but this is doubtful .
m. gervais states that the <unk> <unk> is found there .
it is certain that the west indies possess some mammifers peculiar to themselves .

when <name> , and especially north <name> , possessed its elephants , <unk> , horse , and <unk> ruminants , it was much more closely related in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of europe and <name> than it now is .
as the remains of these genera are found on both sides of <unk> 's straits and on the plains of siberia , we are led to look to the north-western side of north <name> as the former point of communication between the old and so-called new world .
( <unk> .
see the admirable appendix by dr. buckland to beechey 's " voyage " ; also the writings of chamisso in kotzebue 's " voyage . " )
and as so many species , both living and extinct , of these same genera inhabit and have inhabited the old world , it seems most probable that the north american elephants , <unk> , horse , and <unk> ruminants migrated , on land since submerged near <unk> 's straits , from siberia into north <name> , and thence , on land since submerged in the west indies , into south <name> , where for a time they mingled with the forms characteristic of that southern continent , and have since become extinct .
while travelling through the country , i received several vivid descriptions of the effects of a late great drought ; and the account of this may throw some light on the cases where vast <name> of animals of all kinds have been embedded together .
the period included between the years 1827 and 1830 is called the " gran <unk> , " or the great drought .
during this time so little rain fell , that the vegetation , even to the thistles , failed ; the <name> were dried up , and the whole country assumed the appearance of a <name> <unk> .
this was especially the case in the northern part of the province of buenos ayres and the southern part of st. fé .
very great <name> of birds , wild animals , cattle , and horses perished from the want of food and water .
a man told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well , which he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water ; and that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued .
( 7/8 .
in captain <name> 's " surveying voyage " volume 2 <name> 274 , there is a curious account of the effects of a drought on the elephants , at <unk> ( west coast of africa ) .
" a number of these animals had some time since entered the town , in a body , to possess themselves of the wells , not being able to procure any water in the country .
the inhabitants mustered , when a desperate conflict ensued , which terminated in the ultimate discomfiture of the invaders , but not until they had killed one man , and wounded several others . "
the town is said to have a population of nearly three thousand !
dr. <unk> informs me , that during a great drought in <name> the wild animals entered the tents of some troops at <unk> , and that a hare drank out of a vessel held by the adjutant of the regiment . )
the lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of buenos ayres alone , was taken at one million head .
a proprietor at san <name> had previously to these years 20,000 cattle ; at the end not one remained .
san <name> is situated in the middle of the finest country ; and even now abounds again with animals ; yet during the latter part of the " gran <unk> , " live cattle were brought in vessels for the consumption of the inhabitants .
the animals roamed from their <unk> , and , wandering far southward , were mingled together in such multitudes , that a government commission was sent from buenos ayres to settle the disputes of the owners .
sir <unk> parish informed me of another and very curious source of dispute ; the ground being so long dry , such quantities of dust were blown about , that in this open country the landmarks became obliterated , and people could not tell the limits of their estates .
i was informed by an <unk> that the cattle in herds of thousands rushed into the parana , and being exhausted by hunger they were unable to crawl up the muddy banks , and thus were drowned .
the arm of the river which runs by san <name> was so full of putrid carcasses , that the master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable .
without doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the river : their bodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream ; and many in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the plata .
all the small rivers became highly saline , and this caused the death of vast <name> in particular spots ; for when an animal drinks of such water it does not recover .
azara describes the fury of the wild horses on a similar occasion , rushing into the marshes , those which arrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which followed .
( <unk> .
" travels " volume 1 <name> 374 . )
he adds that more than once he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a thousand wild horses thus destroyed .
i noticed that the smaller streams in the pampas were paved with a breccia of bones , but this probably is the effect of a gradual increase , rather than of the destruction at any one period .
subsequently to the drought of 1827 to 1832 , a very rainy season followed which caused great floods .
hence it is almost certain that some thousands of the skeletons were buried by the deposits of the very next year .
what would be the opinion of a geologist , viewing such an enormous collection of bones , of all kinds of animals and of all ages , thus embedded in one thick earthy mass ?
would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of the land , rather than to the common order of things ?
( <unk> .
these <unk> to a certain degree seem to be almost periodical ; i was told the dates of several others , and the intervals were about fifteen years . )
october 12 , 1833 .
i had intended to push my excursion farther , but not being quite well , i was compelled to return by a <unk> , or <unk> vessel of about a hundred tons ' burden , which was bound to buenos ayres .
as the weather was not fair , we moored early in the day to a branch of a tree on one of the islands .
the parana is full of islands , which undergo a constant round of decay and <unk> .
in the memory of the master several large ones had disappeared , and others again had been formed and protected by vegetation .
they are composed of muddy sand , without even the smallest pebble , and were then about four feet above the level of the river ; but during the periodical floods they are <unk> .
they all present one character ; numerous willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of creeping plants , thus forming a thick jungle .
these thickets afford a retreat for <unk> and <unk> .
the fear of the latter animal quite destroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods .
this evening i had not proceeded a hundred yards , before , finding <unk> signs of the recent presence of the tiger , i was obliged to come back .
on every island there were tracks ; and as on the former excursion " el <unk> de los <unk> " had been the subject of conversation , so in this was " el <unk> <name> <unk> . "
the wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be the favourite haunts of the jaguar ; but south of the plata , i was told that they frequented the reeds bordering lakes : wherever they are , they seem to require water .
their common prey is the capybara , so that it is generally said , where <unk> are numerous there is little danger from the jaguar .
falconer states that near the southern side of the mouth of the plata there are many <unk> , and that they chiefly live on fish ; this account i have heard repeated .
on the parana they have killed many <unk> , and have even entered vessels at night .
there is a man now living in the bajada , who , coming up from below when it was dark , was seized on the deck ; he escaped , however , with the loss of the use of one arm .
when the floods drive these animals from the islands , they are most dangerous .
i was told that a few years since a very large one found its way into a church at st. fé : two <unk> entering one after the other were killed , and a third , who came to see what was the matter , escaped with difficulty .
the beast was destroyed by being shot from a corner of the building which was <unk> .
they commit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses .
it is said that they kill their prey by breaking their necks .
if driven from the carcass , they seldom return to it .
the gauchos say that the jaguar , when wandering about at night , is much tormented by the foxes yelping as they follow him .
this is a curious coincidence with the fact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying , in a similarly <unk> manner , the east indian tiger .
the jaguar is a noisy animal , roaring much by night , and especially before bad weather .
one day , when hunting on the banks of the uruguay , i was shown certain trees , to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose , as it is said , of sharpening their claws .
i saw three well-known trees ; in front , the bark was worn smooth , as if by the breast of the animal , and on each side there were deep scratches , or rather grooves , extending in an oblique line , nearly a yard in length .
the scars were of different ages .
a common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the neighbourhood is to examine these trees .
i imagine this habit of the jaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the common cat , as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it <unk> the leg of a chair ; and i have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in england having been thus much injured .
some such habit must also be common to the puma , for on the bare hard soil of patagonia i have frequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made them .
the object of this practice is , i believe , to tear off the ragged points of their claws , and not , as the gauchos think , to sharpen them .
the jaguar is killed , without much difficulty , by the aid of dogs baying and driving him up a tree , where he is despatched with bullets .
owing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings .
our only amusement was catching fish for our dinner : there were several kinds , and all good eating .
a fish called the " <unk> " ( a <unk> ) is remarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by hook and line , and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is beneath the water .
this same fish has the power of firmly catching hold of any object , such as the blade of an oar or the <unk> , with the strong spine both of its <unk> and dorsal fin .
in the evening the weather was quite tropical , the thermometer standing at 79 degrees .
<name> of <unk> were hovering about , and the <unk> were very troublesome .
i exposed my hand for five minutes , and it was soon black with them ; i do not suppose there could have been less than fifty , all busy sucking .
october 15 , 1833 .
( plate 34 .
head of <unk> . )
( plate 35 .
<unk> nigra , or <unk> . )
we got under way and passed punta gorda , where there is a colony of tame indians from the province of <unk> .
we sailed rapidly down the current , but before sunset , from a silly fear of bad weather , we <unk> in a narrow arm of the river .
i took the boat and rowed some distance up this creek .
it was very narrow , winding , and deep ; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high , formed by trees <unk> with creepers , gave to the canal a singularly gloomy appearance .
i here saw a very extraordinary bird , called the <unk> ( <unk> nigra ) .
it has short legs , web feet , extremely <unk> wings , and is of about the size of a <unk> .
the beak is flattened laterally , that is , in a plane at right angles to that of a <unk> or duck .
it is as flat and elastic as an <name> <unk> , and the lower mandible , differently from every other bird , is an inch and a half longer than the upper .
in a lake near maldonado , from which the water had been nearly drained , and which , in consequence , swarmed with small fry , i saw several of these birds , generally in small flocks , flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake .
they kept their bills wide open , and the lower mandible half buried in the water .
thus skimming the surface , they ploughed it in their course : the water was quite smooth , and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock , each bird leaving its narrow wake on the <unk> surface .
in their flight they frequently twist about with extreme quickness , and <unk> manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough up small fish , which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their <unk> bills .
this fact i repeatedly saw , as , like swallows , they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before me .
occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild , irregular , and rapid ; they then uttered loud harsh cries .
when these birds are fishing , the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings , in keeping them dry , is very evident .
when thus employed , their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists represent <name> birds .
their tails are much used in steering their irregular course .
these birds are common far inland along the course of the rio parana ; it is said that they remain here during the whole year , and breed in the marshes .
during the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains , at some distance from the water .
being at anchor , as i have said , in one of the deep creeks between the islands of the parana , as the evening <name> to a close , one of these <unk> suddenly appeared .
the water was quite still , and many little fish were rising .
the bird continued for a long time to skim the surface , flying in its wild and irregular manner up and down the narrow canal , now dark with the growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees .
at <name> video , i observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the mud-banks at the head of the harbour , in the same manner as on the grassy plains near the parana ; and every evening they took flight seaward .
from these facts i suspect that the <unk> generally fishes by night , at which time many of the lower animals come most abundantly to the surface .
m. lesson states that he has seen these birds opening the shells of the <unk> buried in the <unk> on the coast of chile : from their weak bills , with the lower mandible so much projecting , their short legs and long wings , it is very improbable that this can be a general habit .
in our course down the parana , i observed only three other birds , whose habits are worth mentioning .
one is a small kingfisher ( <unk> americana ) ; it has a longer tail than the european species , and hence does not sit in so stiff and upright a position .
its flight also , instead of being direct and rapid , like the course of an arrow , is weak and undulatory , as among the <unk> birds .
it utters a low note , like the clicking together of two small stones .
a small green parrot ( <unk> <unk> ) , with a grey breast , appears to prefer the tall trees on the islands to any other situation for its <unk> .
a number of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of sticks .
these parrots always live in flocks , and commit great ravages on the <unk> .
i was told that near colonia <unk> were killed in the course of one year .
a bird with a forked tail , terminated by two long feathers ( <unk> <unk> ) , and named by the spaniards <unk> , is very common near buenos ayres : it commonly sits on a branch of the <unk> tree , near a house , and thence takes a short flight in pursuit of insects , and returns to the same spot .
when on the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a <unk> of the common swallow .
it has the power of turning very shortly in the air , and in so doing opens and shuts its tail , sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical direction , just like a pair of scissors .
october 16 , 1833 .
some leagues below <unk> , the western shore of the parana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs , which extend in a long line to below san <name> ; hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of a fresh-water river .
it is a great drawback to the scenery of the parana , that , from the soft nature of its banks , the water is very muddy .
the uruguay , flowing through a granitic country , is much clearer ; and where the two channels unite at the head of the plata , the waters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red colours .
in the evening , the wind being not quite fair , as usual we immediately moored , and the next day , as it blew rather freshly , though with a favouring current , the master was much too indolent to think of starting .
at bajada , he was described to me as " <unk> <unk> <unk> "  a man always miserable to get on ; but certainly he bore all delays with admirable resignation .
he was an old spaniard , and had been many years in this country .
he professed a great liking to the english , but stoutly maintained that the battle of <unk> was merely won by the spanish captains having been all bought over ; and that the only really gallant action on either side was performed by the spanish admiral .
it struck me as rather characteristic , that this man should prefer his countrymen being thought the worst of traitors , rather than <unk> or cowardly .
october 18 and 19 , 1833 .
we continued slowly to sail down the <name> stream : the current helped us but little .
we met , during our descent , very few vessels .
one of the best gifts of nature , in so grand a channel of communication , seems here wilfully thrown away  a river in which ships might navigate from a temperate country , as surprisingly abundant in certain productions as destitute of others , to another possessing a tropical climate , and a soil which , according to the best of judges , m. <unk> , is perhaps <unk> in fertility in any part of the world .
how different would have been the aspect of this river if english colonists had by good fortune first sailed up the plata !
what <name> towns would now have occupied its shores !
till the death of <unk> , the dictator of paraguay , these two countries must remain distinct , as if placed on opposite sides of the globe .
and when the old <unk> tyrant is gone to his long account , paraguay <name> be torn by revolutions , violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm .
that country <name> have to learn , like every other south american state , that a republic can not succeed till it contains a certain body of men imbued with the principles of justice and honour .
october 20 , 1833 .
being arrived at the mouth of the parana , and as i was very anxious to reach buenos ayres , i went on shore at las <unk> , with the intention of riding there .
upon landing , i found to my great surprise that i was to a certain degree a prisoner .
a violent revolution having broken out , all the ports were laid under an <unk> .
i could not return to my vessel , and as for going by land to the city , it was out of the question .
after a long conversation with the commandant , i obtained permission to go the next day to general <unk> , who commanded a division of the rebels on this side the capital .
in the morning i rode to the encampment .
the general , officers , and soldiers , all appeared , and i believe really were , great villains .
the general , the very evening before he left the city , voluntarily went to the governor , and with his hand to his heart , pledged his word of honour that he at least would remain faithful to the last .
the general told me that the city was in a state of close blockade , and that all he could do was to give me a passport to the commander-in-chief of the rebels at <unk> .
we had therefore to take a great sweep round the city , and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses .
my reception at the encampment was quite civil , but i was told it was impossible that i could be allowed to enter the city .
i was very anxious about this , as i anticipated the " beagle 's " departure from the rio plata earlier than it took place .
having mentioned , however , general rosas 's obliging kindness to me when at the colorado , magic itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this conversation .
i was instantly told that though they could not give me a passport , if i chose to leave my guide and horses , i might pass their sentinels .
i was too glad to accept of this , and an officer was sent with me to give directions that i should not be stopped at the bridge .
the road for the space of a league was quite deserted .
i met one party of soldiers , who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport : and at length i was not a little pleased to find myself within the city .
this revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances : but in a state which , in the course of nine months ( from february to october , 1820 ) , underwent fifteen changes in its government  each governor , according to the constitution , being elected for three years  it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts .
in this case , a party of men  who , being attached to rosas , were disgusted with the governor <unk>  to the number of seventy left the city , and with the cry of rosas the whole country took arms .
the city was then <unk> , no provisions , cattle or horses , were allowed to enter ; besides this , there was only a little <unk> , and a few men daily killed .
the outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of meat they would certainly be victorious .
general rosas could not have known of this rising ; but it appears to be quite <unk> with the plans of his party .
a year ago he was elected governor , but he refused it , unless the <unk> would also confer on him extraordinary powers .
this was refused , and since then his party have shown that no other governor can keep his place .
the warfare on both sides was <unk> protracted till it was possible to hear from rosas .
a note arrived a few days after i left buenos ayres , which stated that the general disapproved of peace having been broken , but that he thought the outside party had justice on their side .
on the bare reception of this the governor , ministers , and part of the military , to the number of some hundreds , fled from the city .
the rebels entered , elected a new governor , and were paid for their services to the number of <unk> men .
from these proceedings , it was clear that rosas ultimately would become the dictator : to the term king , the people in this , as in other republics , have a particular dislike .
since leaving south <name> , we have heard that rosas has been elected , with powers and for a time altogether opposed to the constitutional principles of the republic .

having been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city , i was glad to escape on board a packet bound for <name> video .
a town in a state of blockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence ; in this case moreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within .
the sentinels were the worst of all ; for , from their office and from having arms in their hands , they robbed with a degree of authority which other men could not imitate .
our passage was a very long and tedious one .
the plata looks like a <name> estuary on the map ; but is in truth a poor affair .
a wide expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty .
at one time of the day , the two shores , both of which are extremely low , could just be distinguished from the deck .
on arriving at <name> video i found that the " beagle " would not sail for some time , so i prepared for a short excursion in this part of banda oriental .
everything which i have said about the country near maldonado is applicable to <name> video ; but the land , with the one exception of the green mount , 450 feet high , from which it takes its name , is far more level .
very little of the undulating grassy plain is enclosed ; but near the town there are a few <unk> , covered with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
november 14 , 1833 .
we left <name> video in the afternoon .
i intended to proceed to colonia <name> <unk> , situated on the northern bank of the plata and opposite to buenos ayres , and thence , following up the uruguay , to the village of <name> on the rio negro ( one of the many rivers of this name in south <name> ) , and from this point to return direct to <name> video .
we slept at the house of my guide at <unk> .
in the morning we rose early , in the hopes of being able to ride a good distance ; but it was a vain attempt , for all the rivers were flooded .
we passed in boats the streams of <unk> , st. <name> , and san <unk> , and thus lost much time .
on a former excursion i crossed the <name> near its mouth , and i was surprised to observe how easily our horses , although not used to swim , passed over a width of at least six hundred yards .
on mentioning this at <name> video , i was told that a vessel containing some <unk> and their horses , being wrecked in the plata , one horse swam seven miles to the shore .
in the course of the day i was amused by the dexterity with which a gaucho forced a restive horse to swim a river .
he stripped off his clothes , and jumping on its back , rode into the water till it was out of its depth ; then slipping off over the <unk> , he caught hold of the tail , and as often as the horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its face .
as soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side , the man pulled himself on , and was firmly seated , bridle in hand , before the horse gained the bank .
a naked man on a naked horse is a fine spectacle ; i had no idea how well the two animals suited each other .
the tail of a horse is a very useful appendage ; i have passed a river in a boat with four people in it , which was <unk> across in the same way as the gaucho .
if a man and horse have to cross a broad river , the best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane , and help himself with the other arm .
we slept and stayed the following day at the post of <unk> .
in the evening the postman or <unk> arrived .
he was a day after his time , owing to the rio <unk> being flooded .
it would not , however , be of much consequence ; for , although he had passed through some of the principal towns in banda oriental , his luggage consisted of two letters !
the view from the house was pleasing ; an undulating green surface , with distant glimpses of the plata .
i find that i look at this province with very different eyes from what i did upon my first arrival .
i recollect i then thought it singularly level ; but now , after galloping over the pampas , my only surprise is , what could have induced me ever to have called it level .
the country is a series of undulations , in themselves perhaps not absolutely great , but , as compared to the plains of st. fé , real mountains .
from these inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets , and the turf is green and luxuriant .
november 17 , 1833 .
we crossed the <unk> , which was deep and rapid , and passing the village of <unk> , arrived at mid-day at colonia <name> <unk> .
the distance is twenty leagues , through a country covered with fine grass , but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants .
i was invited to sleep at colonia , and to accompany on the following day a gentleman to his estancia , where there were some limestone rocks .
the town is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at <name> video .
it is strongly fortified , but both fortifications and town suffered much in the brazilian war .
it is very ancient ; and the irregularity of the streets , and the surrounding groves of old orange and peach trees , gave it a pretty appearance .
the church is a curious ruin ; it was used as a <unk> , and was struck by lightning in one of the ten thousand <unk> of the rio plata .
two-thirds of the building were blown away to the very foundation ; and the rest stands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of lightning and gunpowder .
in the evening i wandered about the <unk> walls of the town .
it was the chief seat of the brazilian war  a war most injurious to this country , not so much in its immediate effects , as in being the origin of a multitude of generals and all other grades of officers .
more generals are numbered ( but not paid ) in the united provinces of la plata than in the united kingdom of great britain .
these gentlemen have learned to like power , and do not object to a little <unk> .
hence there are many always on the watch to create disturbance and to <unk> a government which as yet has never rested on any stable foundation .
i noticed , however , both here and in other places , a very general interest in the ensuing election for the president ; and this appears a good sign for the prosperity of this little country .
the inhabitants do not require much education in their representatives ; i heard some men discussing the merits of those for colonia ; and it was said that , " although they were not men of business , they could all sign their names : " with this they seemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied .
november 18 , 1833 .
rode with my host to his estancia , at the <unk> de san <name> .
in the evening we took a ride round the estate : it contained two square leagues and a half , and was situated in what is called a <unk> ; that is , one side was fronted by the plata , and the two others guarded by impassable <name> .
there was an excellent port for little vessels , and an abundance of small wood , which is valuable as supplying fuel to buenos ayres .
i was curious to know the value of so complete an estancia .
of cattle there were 3000 , and it would well support three or four times that number ; of mares 800 , together with 150 <unk> horses , and 600 sheep .
there was plenty of water and limestone , a rough house , excellent <unk> , and a peach orchard .
for all this he had been offered 2000 pounds <name> , and he only wanted 500 pounds <name> additional , and probably would sell it for less .
the chief trouble with an estancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot , in order to make them tame , and to count them .
this latter operation would be thought difficult , where there are ten or fifteen thousand head together .
it is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably divide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred .
each troop is recognised by a few peculiarly marked animals , and its number is known : so that , one being lost out of ten thousand , it is perceived by its absence from one of the <unk> .
during a <name> night the cattle all mingle together ; but the next morning the <unk> separate as before ; so that each animal must know its fellow out of ten thousand others .
on two occasions i met with in this province some oxen of a very curious breed , called <unk> or niata .
they appear externally to hold nearly the same relation to other cattle , which bull or <unk> dogs do to other dogs .
their forehead is very short and broad , with the nasal end turned up , and the upper lip much drawn back ; their lower jaws project beyond the upper , and have a corresponding upward curve ; hence their teeth are always exposed .
their nostrils are seated high up and are very open ; their eyes project outwards .
when walking they <name> their heads low , on a short neck ; and their hinder legs are rather longer compared with the front legs than is usual .
their bare teeth , their short heads , and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous <unk> air of defiance imaginable .
since my return , i have procured a skeleton head , through the kindness of my friend captain sulivan , r.n. , which is now deposited in the college of surgeons .
( <unk> .
mr. waterhouse has drawn up a detailed description of this head , which i <name> he <name> publish in some journal . )
<name> f. <unk> , of luxan , has kindly collected for me all the information which he could respecting this breed .
from his account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago , they were rare and kept as curiosities at buenos ayres .
the breed is universally believed to have originated amongst the indians southward of the plata ; and that it was with them the commonest kind .
even to this day , those reared in the provinces near the plata show their less civilised origin , in being fiercer than common cattle , and in the cow easily deserting her first calf , if visited too often or molested .
it is a singular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal one of the niata breed , <unk> , as i am informed by dr. falconer , that great extinct <unk> of <name> , the <unk> .
( <unk> .
a nearly similar abnormal , but i do not know whether hereditary , structure has been observed in the carp , and likewise in the crocodile of the ganges : " <unk> des anomalies " par m. isid .
geoffroy st. hilaire tome 1 <name> 244 . )
the breed is very true ; and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves .
a niata bull with a common cow , or the reverse cross , produces offspring having an intermediate character , but with the niata characters strongly displayed : according to <unk> <unk> , there is the clearest evidence , contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in analogous cases , that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when crossed with a common cow .
when the pasture is tolerably long , the niata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle ; but during the great <unk> , when so many animals perish , the niata breed is under a great disadvantage , and would be exterminated if not attended to ; for the common cattle , like horses , are able just to keep alive , by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds ; this the <unk> can not so well do , as their lips do not join , and hence they are found to perish before the common cattle .
this strikes me as a good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of life , on what circumstances , occurring only at long intervals , the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined .
november 19 , 1833 .
passing the valley of las <unk> , we slept at a house of a north american , who worked a <unk> on the <unk> de las <unk> .
in the morning we rode to a projecting headland on the banks of the river , called punta gorda .
on the way we tried to find a jaguar .
there were plenty of fresh tracks , and we visited the trees on which they are said to sharpen their claws ; but we did not succeed in disturbing one .
from this point the rio uruguay presented to our view a <name> volume of water .
from the clearness and rapidity of the stream , its appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the parana .
on the opposite coast , several branches from the latter river entered the uruguay .
as the sun was shining , the two colours of the waters could be seen quite distinct .
in the evening we proceeded on our road towards <name> on the rio negro .
at night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which we happened to arrive .
it was a very large estate , being ten leagues square , and the owner is one of the greatest <unk> in the country .
his nephew had charge of it , and with him there was a captain in the army , who the other day ran away from buenos ayres .
considering their station , their conversation was rather amusing .
they expressed , as was usual , unbounded astonishment at the globe being round , and could scarcely credit that a hole would , if deep enough , come out on the other side .
they had , however , heard of a country where there were six months of light and six of darkness , and where the inhabitants were very tall and thin !
they were curious about the price and condition of horses and cattle in england .
upon finding out we did not catch our animals with the lazo , they cried out , " ah , then , you use nothing but the bolas : " the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them .
the captain at last said , he had one question to ask me , which he should be very much obliged if i would answer with all truth .
i trembled to think how deeply scientific it would be : it was , " whether the ladies of buenos ayres were not the handsomest in the world . "
i replied , like a <unk> , " charmingly so . "
he added , " i have one other question : do ladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs ? "
i solemnly assured him that they did not .
they were absolutely delighted .
the captain exclaimed , " look there !
a man who has seen half the world says it is the case ; we always thought so , but now we know it . "
my excellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most hospitable reception ; the captain forced me to take his bed , and he would sleep on his <unk> .
november 21 , 1833 .
started at sunrise , and rode slowly during the whole day .
the geological nature of this part of the province was different from the rest , and closely resembled that of the pampas .
in consequence , there were immense beds of the thistle , as well as of the cardoon : the whole country , indeed , may be called one great bed of these plants .
the two sorts grow separate , each plant in company with its own kind .
the cardoon is as high as a horse 's back , but the pampas thistle is often higher than the crown of the rider 's head .
to leave the road for a yard is out of the question ; and the road itself is partly , and in some cases entirely , closed .
pasture , of course , there is none ; if cattle or horses once enter the bed , they are for the time completely lost .
hence it is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the year ; for when jaded enough to face the thistles , they rush among them , and are seen no more .
in these districts there are very few <unk> , and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys , where fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist .
as night came on before we arrived at our journey 's end , we slept at a miserable little hovel inhabited by the poorest people .
the extreme though rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess , considering their grade of life , was quite delightful .
november 22 , 1833 .
arrived at an estancia on the <unk> belonging to a very hospitable englishman , to whom i had a letter of introduction from my friend mr. <unk> .
i stayed here three days .
one morning i rode with my host to the <name> <name> <name> <unk> , about twenty miles up the rio negro .
nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse grass , which was as high as a horse 's belly ; yet there were square leagues without a single head of cattle .
the province of banda oriental , if well stocked , would support an astonishing number of animals , at present the annual export of hides from <name> video amounts to three hundred thousand ; and the home consumption , from waste , is very considerable .
an <unk> told me that he often had to send large herds of cattle a long journey to a <unk> establishment , and that the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned ; but that he could never persuade the gauchos to eat of them , and every evening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers !
the view of the rio negro from the <name> was more picturesque than any other which i saw in this province .
the river , broad , deep , and rapid , wound at the foot of a <name> precipitous <name> : a belt of wood followed its course , and the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the <unk> .
when in this neighbourhood , i several times heard of the <name> de las <unk> : a hill distant many miles to the northward .
the name signifies hill of beads .
i was assured that vast <name> of little round stones , of various colours , each with a small cylindrical hole , are found there .
formerly the indians used to collect them , for the purpose of making <unk> and bracelets  a taste , i may observe , which is common to all savage nations , as well as to the most polished .
i did not know what to understand from this story , but upon mentioning it at the cape of good <name> to dr. <name> smith , he told me that he recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of africa , about one hundred miles to the eastward of st. <name> 's river , some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from attrition , and mixed with gravel on the sea-beach .
each <name> was about five lines in diameter , and from an inch to an inch and a half in length .
many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to the other , perfectly cylindrical , and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine <unk> .
their colour was red or dull white .
the natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals .
i have mentioned these circumstances because , although no crystallised body is at present known to assume this form , it may lead some future traveller to investigate the real nature of such stones .
while staying at this estancia , i was amused with what i saw and heard of the <unk> of the country .
( <unk> .
m. a. d'orbigny has given nearly a similar account of these dogs , tome 1 <name> 175 . )
when riding , it is a common thing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs , at the distance of some miles from any house or man .
i often wondered how so firm a friendship had been established .
the method of education consists in separating the puppy , while very young , from the bitch , and in <unk> it to its future companions .
an <unk> is held three or four times a day for the little thing to suck , and a nest of wool is made for it in the <unk> ; at no time is it allowed to associate with other dogs , or with the children of the family .
the puppy is , moreover , generally castrated ; so that , when grown up , it can scarcely have any feelings in common with the rest of its kind .
from this education it has no wish to leave the flock , and just as another dog <name> defend its master , man , so <name> these the sheep .
it is amusing to observe , when approaching a flock , how the dog immediately advances barking , and the sheep all close in his rear , as if round the oldest ram .
these dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a certain hour in the evening .
their most troublesome fault , when young , is their <name> of playing with the sheep ; for in their sport they sometimes gallop their poor subjects most <unk> .
the <unk> comes to the house every day for some meat , and as soon as it is given him , he <unk> away as if ashamed of himself .
on these occasions the <unk> are very tyrannical , and the least of them <name> attack and pursue the stranger .
the minute , however , the latter has reached the flock , he turns round and begins to bark , and then all the <unk> take very quickly to their heels .
in a similar manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs <name> scarcely ever ( and i was told by some never ) venture to attack a flock guarded by even one of these faithful shepherds .
the whole account appears to me a curious instance of the <unk> of the affections in the dog ; and yet , whether wild or however educated , he has a feeling of respect or fear for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association .
for we can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the single one with its flock , except that they consider , from some confused notion , that the one thus associated gains power , as if in company with its own kind .
f. cuvier has observed that all animals that readily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their own society , and thus fulfil their instinct of association .
in the above case the <unk> ranks the sheep as its <unk> , and thus gains confidence ; and the wild dogs , though knowing that the individual sheep are not dogs , but are good to eat , yet partly consent to this view when seeing them in a flock with a <unk> at their head .
one evening a " <unk> " ( a <unk> of horses ) came for the purpose of <unk> some colts .
i <name> describe the preparatory steps , for i believe they have not been mentioned by other travellers .
a troop of wild young horses is driven into the corral , or large enclosure of stakes , and the door is shut .
we <name> suppose that one man alone has to catch and mount a horse , which as yet had never felt bridle or saddle .
i conceive , except by a gaucho , such a feat would be utterly impracticable .
the gaucho picks out a full-grown colt ; and as the beast rushes round the circus , he throws his lazo so as to catch both the front legs .
instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock , and whilst struggling on the ground , the gaucho , holding the lazo tight , makes a circle , so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the fetlock , and draws it close to the two front legs : he then <unk> the lazo , so that the three are bound together .
then sitting on the horse 's neck , he fixes a strong bridle , without a bit , to the lower jaw : this he does by passing a narrow thong through the <unk> at the end of the reins , and several times round both jaw and tongue .
the two front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern thong , fastened by a <unk> .
the lazo , which bound the three together , being then loosed , the horse rises with difficulty .
the gaucho , now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw , leads the horse outside the corral .
if a second man is present ( otherwise the trouble is much greater ) he holds the animal 's head , whilst the first puts on the <unk> and saddle , and <unk> the whole together .
during this operation , the horse , from dread and astonishment at thus being bound round the waist , throws himself over and over again on the ground , and , till beaten , is unwilling to rise .
at last , when the <unk> is finished , the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear , and is white with foam and sweat .
the man now prepares to mount by pressing heavily on the stirrup , so that the horse may not lose its balance ; and at the moment that he throws his leg over the <unk> back , he pulls the <unk> binding the front legs , and the beast is free .
some " <unk> " pull the knot while the animal is lying on the ground , and , standing over the saddle , allow him to rise beneath them .
the horse , wild with dread , gives a few most violent bounds , and then starts off at full gallop : when quite exhausted , the man , by <name> , brings him back to the corral , where , reeking hot and scarcely alive , the poor beast is let free .
those animals which <name> not gallop away , but obstinately throw themselves on the ground , are by far the most troublesome .
this process is tremendously severe , but in two or three trials the horse is tamed .
it is not , however , for some weeks that the animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring , for it must learn to associate the <name> of its rider with the feel of the rein , before the most powerful bridle can be of any service .
animals are so abundant in these countries , that humanity and self-interest are not closely united ; therefore i fear it is that the former is here scarcely known .
one day , riding in the pampas with a very respectable " <unk> , " my horse , being tired , <unk> behind .
the man often shouted to me to spur him .
when i remonstrated that it was a pity , for the horse was quite exhausted , he cried out , " why not ?  never mind  spur him  it is my horse . "
i had then some difficulty in making him comprehend that it was for the horse 's sake , and not on his account , that i did not choose to use my spurs .
he exclaimed , with a look of great surprise , " ah , <name> <name> , que <unk> ! "
it was clear that such an idea had never before entered his head .
the gauchos are well known to be perfect riders .
the idea of being thrown , let the horse do what it likes ; never enters their head .
their criterion of a good rider is , a man who can manage an <unk> colt , or who , if his horse falls , alights on his own feet , or can perform other such exploits .
i have heard of a man betting that he would throw his horse down twenty times , and that nineteen times he would not fall himself .
i recollect seeing a gaucho riding a very stubborn horse , which three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with great violence .
the man judged with uncommon coolness the proper moment for slipping off , not an instant before or after the right time ; and as soon as the horse got up , the man jumped on his back , and at last they started at a gallop .
the gaucho never appears to exert any muscular force .
i was one day watching a good rider , as we were galloping along at a rapid pace , and thought to myself , " surely if the horse starts , you appear so careless on your seat , you must fall . "
at this moment a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the horse 's nose : the young colt bounded on one side like a stag ; but as for the man , all that could be said was , that he started and took fright with his horse .
in chile and peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than in la plata , and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate nature of the country .
in chile a horse is not considered perfectly broken till he can be brought up standing , in the midst of his full speed , on any particular spot ,  for instance , on a cloak thrown on the ground : or , again , he <name> charge a wall , and rearing , scrape the surface with his hoofs .
i have seen an animal bounding with spirit , yet merely reined by a forefinger and thumb , taken at full gallop across a courtyard , and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda with great speed , but at so equal a distance , that the rider , with outstretched arm , all the while kept one finger rubbing the post .
then making a <unk> in the air , with the other arm outstretched in a like manner , he wheeled round , with astonishing force , in an opposite direction .
such a horse is well broken ; and although this at first may appear useless , it is far otherwise .
it is only carrying that which is daily necessary into perfection .
when a bullock is checked and caught by the lazo , it <name> sometimes gallop round and round in a circle , and the horse being alarmed at the great strain , if not well broken , <name> not readily turn like the pivot of a wheel .
in consequence many men have been killed ; for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man 's body , it <name> instantly , from the power of the two opposed animals , almost cut him in twain .
on the same principle the races are managed ; the course is only two or three hundred yards long , the wish being to have horses that can make a rapid dash .
the racehorses are trained not only to stand with their hoofs touching a line , but to draw all four feet together , so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action of the <unk> .
in chile i was told an anecdote , which i believe was true ; and it offers a good illustration of the use of a <unk> animal .
a respectable man riding one day met two others , one of whom was mounted on a horse , which he knew to have been stolen from himself .
he challenged them ; they answered him by drawing their sabres and giving <name> .
the man , on his good and fleet beast , kept just ahead : as he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it , and brought up his horse to a dead check .
the pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and ahead .
then instantly dashing on , right behind them , he buried his knife in the back of one , wounded the other , recovered his horse from the dying robber , and rode home .
for these feats of horsemanship two things are necessary : a most severe bit , like the <unk> , the power of which , though seldom used , the horse knows full well ; and large blunt spurs , that can be applied either as a mere touch , or as an instrument of extreme pain .
i conceive that with english spurs , the slightest touch of which <unk> the skin , it would be impossible to break in a horse after the south american fashion .
at an estancia near las <unk> large <name> of mares are weekly slaughtered for the sake of their hides , although worth only five paper dollars , or about half a crown apiece .
it seems at first strange that it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle ; but as it is thought ridiculous in this country ever to break in or ride a mare , they are of no value except for breeding .
the only thing for which i ever saw mares used , was to tread out wheat from the ear , for which purpose they were driven round a circular enclosure , where the <unk> were strewed .
the man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo .
standing at the distance of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral , he has laid a wager that he would catch by the legs every animal , without missing one , as it rushed past him .
there was another man who said he would enter the corral on foot , catch a mare , fasten her front legs together , drive her out , throw her down , kill , skin , and stake the hide for drying ( which latter is a tedious job ) ; and he engaged that he would perform this whole operation on twenty-two animals in one day .
or he would kill and take the skin off fifty in the same time .
this would have been a prodigious task , for it is considered a good day 's work to skin and stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals .
november 26 , 1833 .
i set out on my return in a direct line for <name> video .
having heard of some giant 's bones at a neighbouring farmhouse on the <unk> , a small stream entering the rio negro , i rode there accompanied by my host , and purchased for the value of <unk> the head of the toxodon .
( <unk> .
i must express my obligation to mr. <unk> , at whose house i was staying on the <unk> , and to mr. <unk> at buenos ayres , for without their assistance these valuable remains would never have reached england . )
when found it was quite perfect ; but the boys knocked out some of the teeth with stones , and then set up the head as a <name> to throw at .
by a most fortunate chance i found a perfect tooth , which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull , embedded by itself on the banks of the rio <unk> , at the distance of about 180 miles from this place .
i found remains of this extraordinary animal at two other places , so that it must formerly have been common .
i found here , also , some large portions of the armour of a gigantic <unk> animal , and part of the great head of a mylodon .
the bones of this head are so fresh , that they contain , according to the analysis by mr. t. reeks , seven per cent of animal matter ; and when placed in a spirit-lamp , they burn with a small flame .
the number of the remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental , must be extraordinarily great .
i believe a straight line drawn in any direction through the pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones .
besides those which i found during my short excursions , i heard of many others , and the origin of such names as " the stream of the animal , " " the hill of the giant , " is obvious .
at other times i heard of the marvellous property of certain rivers , which had the power of changing small bones into large ; or , as some maintained , the bones themselves grew .
as far as i am aware , not one of these animals perished , as was formerly supposed , in the marshes or muddy <unk> of the present land , but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the <unk> deposit in which they were originally embedded .
we may conclude that the whole area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic quadrupeds .
by the middle of the day , on the 28th , we arrived at <name> video , having been two days and a half on the road .
the country for the whole way was of a very uniform character , some parts being rather more <name> and hilly than near the plata .
not far from <name> video we passed through the village of las <unk> , so named from some large rounded masses of syenite .
its appearance was rather pretty .
in this country a few <unk> round a group of houses , and a site elevated a hundred feet above the general level , ought always to be called picturesque .
during the last six months i have had an opportunity of seeing a little of the character of the inhabitants of these provinces .
the gauchos , or countrymen , are very superior to those who reside in the towns .
the gaucho is invariably most obliging , polite , and hospitable : i did not meet with even one instance of rudeness or <unk> .
he is modest , both respecting himself and country , but at the same time a spirited , bold fellow .
on the other hand , many robberies are committed , and there is much bloodshed : the habit of constantly wearing the knife is the chief cause of the latter .
it is lamentable to hear how many lives are lost in trifling quarrels .
in fighting , each party tries to <name> the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes ; as is often attested by deep and <unk> scars .
robberies are a natural consequence of universal gambling , much drinking , and extreme indolence .
at <name> i asked two men why they did not work .
one gravely said the days were too long ; the other that he was too poor .
the number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of all industry .
moreover , there are so many <unk> ; and again , nothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on the increase ; so that half the month is lost from these two causes .
police and justice are quite inefficient .
if a man who is poor commits murder and is taken , he <name> be imprisoned , and perhaps even shot ; but if he is <name> and has friends , he may rely on it no very severe consequence <name> ensue .
it is curious that the most respectable inhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape : they seem to think that the individual sins against the government , and not against the people .
a traveller has no protection besides his firearms ; and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to more frequent robberies .
the character of the higher and more educated classes who reside in the towns , partakes , but perhaps in a lesser degree , of the good parts of the gaucho , but is , i fear , stained by many vices of which he is free .
<unk> , mockery of all religion , and the <unk> corruption , are far from uncommon .
nearly every public officer can be bribed .
the head man in the post-office sold forged government <unk> .
the governor and prime minister openly combined to plunder the state .
justice , where gold came into play , was hardly expected by any one .
i knew an englishman who went to the chief justice ( he told me that , not then understanding the ways of the place , he trembled as he entered the room ) , and said , " sir , i have come to offer you two hundred ( paper ) dollars ( value about five pounds <name> ) if you <name> arrest before a certain time a man who has cheated me .
i know it is against the law , but my lawyer ( naming him ) recommended me to take this step . "
the chief justice smiled acquiescence , thanked him , and the man before night was safe in prison .
with this entire want of principle in many of the leading men , with the country full of <unk> turbulent officers , the people yet <name> that a democratic form of government can succeed !
on first entering society in these countries , two or three features strike one as particularly remarkable .
the polite and dignified manners pervading every rank of life , the excellent taste displayed by the women in their dresses , and the equality amongst all ranks .
at the rio colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with general rosas .
a son of a <name> at bahia <name> gained his livelihood by making paper cigars , and he wished to accompany me , as guide or servant , to buenos ayres , but his father objected on the score of the danger alone .
many officers in the army can neither read nor write , yet all meet in society as equals .
in entre rios , the <unk> consisted of only six representatives .
one of them kept a common shop , and evidently was not degraded by the office .
all this is what would be expected in a new country ; nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by profession appears to an englishman something strange .
when speaking of these countries , the manner in which they have been brought up by their unnatural parent , spain , should always be borne in mind .
on the whole , perhaps , more credit is due for what has been done , than blame for that which may be deficient .
it is impossible to doubt but that the extreme <unk> of these countries must ultimately lead to good results .
the very general toleration of foreign religions , the regard paid to the means of education , the freedom of the press , the facilities offered to all foreigners , and especially , as i am bound to add , to every one professing the humblest pretensions to science , should be recollected with gratitude by those who have visited spanish south <name> .
december 6 , 1833 .
the " beagle " sailed from the rio plata , never again to enter its muddy stream .
our course was directed to port <name> , on the coast of patagonia .
before proceeding any farther , i <name> here put together a few observations made at sea .
several times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the plata , and at other times when off the shores of northern patagonia , we have been surrounded by insects .
one evening , when we were about ten miles from the bay of san blas , vast <name> of butterflies , in bands or flocks of countless myriads , extended as far as the eye could range .
even by the aid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free from butterflies .
the seamen cried out " it was snowing butterflies , " and such in fact was the appearance .
more species than one were present , but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to , but not identical with , the common english <unk> <unk> .
some moths and hymenoptera accompanied the butterflies ; and a fine beetle ( <unk> ) flew on board .
other instances are known of this beetle having been caught far out at sea ; and this is the more remarkable , as the greater number of the <unk> seldom or never take wing .
the day had been fine and calm , and the one previous to it equally so , with light and variable airs .
hence we can not suppose that the insects were blown off the land , but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight .
the great bands of the <unk> seem at first to afford an instance like those on record of the migrations of another butterfly , <name> <unk> ( <unk> .
lyell 's " principles of geology " volume 3 <name> 63 .
) ; but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct , and even less intelligible .
before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the north , and this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies and other insects to have perished .
on another occasion , when seventeen miles off cape <unk> , i had a net overboard to catch pelagic animals .
upon drawing it up , to my surprise i found a considerable number of beetles in it , and although in the open sea , they did not appear much injured by the salt water .
i lost some of the specimens , but those which i preserved belonged to the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( two species ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
at first i thought that these insects had been blown from the shore ; but upon reflecting that out of the eight species four were aquatic , and two others partly so in their habits , it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the sea by a small stream which drains a lake near cape <unk> .
on any supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects swimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of land .
there are several accounts of insects having been blown off the patagonian shore .
captain cook observed it , as did more lately captain king of the " adventure . "
the cause probably is due to the want of shelter , both of trees and hills , so that an insect on the wing with an <unk> breeze , would be very apt to be blown out to sea .
the most remarkable instance i have known of an insect being caught far from the land , was that of a large grasshopper ( <unk> ) , which flew on board , when the " beagle " was to windward of the cape de verd islands , and when the nearest point of land , not directly opposed to the trade-wind , was cape blanco on the coast of africa , 370 miles distant .
( <unk> .
the flies which frequently accompany a ship for some days on its passage from harbour to harbour , wandering from the vessel , are soon lost , and all disappear . )
on several occasions , when the " beagle " has been within the mouth of the plata , the rigging has been coated with the web of the gossamer spider .
one day ( november 1st , 1832 ) i paid particular attention to this subject .
the weather had been fine and clear , and in the morning the air was full of patches of the <unk> web , as on an autumnal day in england .
the ship was sixty miles distant from the land , in the direction of a steady though light breeze .
vast <name> of a small spider , about one-tenth of an inch in length , and of a dusky red colour , were attached to the webs .
there must have been , i should suppose , some thousands on the ship .
the little spider , when first coming in contact with the rigging , was always seated on a single thread , and not on the <unk> mass .
this latter seems merely to be produced by the <unk> of the single threads .
the spiders were all of one species , but of both sexes , together with young ones .
these latter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour .
i <name> not give the description of this spider , but merely state that it does not appear to me to be included in any of <unk> 's genera .
the little <unk> as soon as it arrived on board was very active , running about , sometimes letting itself fall , and then <unk> the same thread ; sometimes employing itself in making a small and very irregular <unk> in the corners between the ropes .
it could run with facility on the surface of water .
when disturbed it lifted up its front legs , in the attitude of attention .
on its first arrival it appeared very thirsty , and with exserted <unk> drank eagerly of drops of water ; this same circumstance has been observed by <unk> : may it not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a dry and rarefied atmosphere ?
its stock of web seemed inexhaustible .
while watching some that were suspended by a single thread , i several times observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of sight , in a horizontal line .
on another occasion ( 25th ) under similar circumstances , i repeatedly observed the same kind of small spider , either when placed or having crawled on some little eminence , elevate its abdomen , send forth a thread , and then sail away horizontally , but with a rapidity which was quite unaccountable .
i thought i could perceive that the spider , before performing the above preparatory steps , connected its legs together with the most delicate threads , but i am not sure whether this observation was correct .
one day , at st. fé , i had a better opportunity of observing some similar facts .
a spider which was about <unk> of an inch in length , and which in its general appearance resembled a <unk> ( therefore quite different from the gossamer ) , while standing on the summit of a post , darted forth four or five threads from its <unk> .
these , glittering in the <name> , might be compared to diverging rays of light ; they were not , however , straight , but in undulations like films of silk blown by the wind .
they were more than a yard in length , and diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices .
the spider then suddenly let go its hold of the post , and was quickly borne out of sight .
the day was hot and apparently quite calm ; yet under such circumstances , the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect a vane so delicate as the thread of a spider 's web .
if during a warm day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank , or over a level plain at a distant landmark , the effect of an ascending current of heated air is almost always evident : such upward currents , it has been remarked , are also shown by the ascent of <unk> , which <name> not rise in an indoors room .
hence i think there is not much difficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider 's <unk> , and afterwards of the spider itself ; the divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained , i believe by mr. <name> , by their similar electrical condition .
the circumstance of spiders of the same species , but of different sexes and ages , being found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the land , attached in vast <name> to the lines , renders it probable that the habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this tribe , as that of diving is of the <unk> .
we may then reject <unk> 's supposition , that the gossamer owes its origin indifferently to the young of several genera of spiders : although , as we have seen , the young of other spiders do possess the power of performing aerial voyages .
( <unk> .
mr. blackwall in his " researches in zoology " has many excellent observations on the habits of spiders . )
during our different passages south of the plata , i often towed astern a net made of bunting , and thus caught many curious animals .
of crustacea there were many strange and <unk> genera .
one , which in some respects is allied to the <unk> ( or those crabs which have their posterior legs placed almost on their backs , for the purpose of adhering to the under side of rocks ) , is very remarkable from the structure of its hind pair of legs .
the penultimate joint , instead of terminating in a simple claw , ends in three <unk> appendages of dissimilar lengths  the longest equalling that of the entire leg .
these claws are very thin , and are serrated with the finest teeth , directed backwards : their curved extremities are flattened , and on this part five most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner as the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish .
as the animal lives in the open sea , and probably wants a place of rest , i suppose this beautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of floating <name> animals .
in deep water , far from the land , the number of living creatures is extremely small : south of the latitude 35 degrees , i never succeeded in catching anything besides some <unk> , and a few species of minute <unk> crustacea .
in <unk> water , at the distance of a few miles from the coast , very many kinds of crustacea and some other animals are numerous , but only during the night .
between latitudes 56 and 57 degrees south of cape horn , the net was put astern several times ; it never , however , brought up anything besides a few of two extremely minute species of <unk> .
yet whales and seals , petrels and albatross , are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean .
it has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross , which lives far from the shore , can subsist ; i presume that , like the condor , it is able to fast long ; and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid whale lasts for a long time .
the central and intertropical parts of the atlantic swarm with <unk> , crustacea , and <unk> , and with their <unk> the flying-fish , and again with their <unk> the <unk> and <unk> ; i presume that the numerous lower pelagic animals feed on the infusoria , which are now known , from the researches of ehrenberg , to abound in the open ocean : but on what , in the clear blue water , do these infusoria subsist ?
while sailing a little south of the plata on one very dark night , the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle .
there was a fresh breeze , and every part of the surface , which during the day is seen as foam , now glowed with a pale light .
the vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus , and in her wake she was followed by a milky train .
as far as the eye reached , the crest of every wave was bright , and the sky above the horizon , from the reflected glare of these livid flames , was not so utterly obscure as over the vault of the heavens .
as we proceed farther southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent ; and off cape horn i do not recollect more than once having seen it so , and then it was far from being brilliant .
this circumstance probably has a close connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of the ocean .
after the elaborate paper by ehrenberg , on the <unk> of the sea , it is almost superfluous on my part to make any observations on the subject .
( <unk> .
an abstract is given in no .
4 of the " magazine of zoology and botany . " )
i may however add , that the same torn and irregular particles of gelatinous matter , described by ehrenberg , seem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the common cause of this phenomenon .
the particles were so minute as easily to pass through fine gauze ; yet many were distinctly visible by the naked eye .
the water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave out sparks , but a small portion in a <unk> scarcely ever was luminous .
ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain degree of irritability .
my observations , some of which were made directly after taking up the water , gave a different result .
i may also mention , that having used the net during one night , i allowed it to become partially dry , and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to employ it again , i found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when first taken out of the water .
it does not appear probable in this case that the particles could have remained so long alive .
on one occasion having kept a <unk> of the genus <unk> till it was dead , the water in which it was placed became luminous .
when the waves <unk> with bright green sparks , i believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea .
but there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals , when alive , are phosphorescent .
on two occasions i have observed the sea luminous at considerable depths beneath the surface .
near the mouth of the plata some circular and oval patches , from two to four yards in diameter , and with defined outlines , shone with a steady but pale light ; while the surrounding water only gave out a few sparks .
the appearance resembled the reflection of the moon , or some luminous body ; for the edges were sinuous from the undulations of the surface .
the ship , which <name> thirteen feet water , passed over , without disturbing these patches .
therefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together at a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel .
near <name> noronha the sea gave out light in flashes .
the appearance was very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish moving rapidly through a luminous fluid .
to this cause the sailors attributed it ; at the time , however , i entertained some doubts , on account of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes .
i have already remarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in cold countries ; and i have sometimes imagined that a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its production .
certainly i think the sea is most luminous after a few days of more calm weather than ordinary , during which time it has swarmed with various animals .
observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in an impure state , and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the fluid in contact with the atmosphere , i am inclined to consider that the <unk> is the result of the decomposition of the organic particles , by which process ( one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration ) the ocean becomes purified .
december 23 , 1833 .
we arrived at port <name> , situated in latitude 47 degrees , on the coast of patagonia .
the creek runs for about twenty miles inland , with an irregular width .
the " beagle " anchored a few miles within the entrance , in front of the ruins of an old spanish settlement .
the same evening i went on shore .
the first landing in any new country is very interesting , and especially when , as in this case , the whole aspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character .
at the height of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of porphyry a wide plain extends , which is truly characteristic of patagonia .
the surface is quite level , and is composed of well-rounded shingle mixed with a whitish earth .
here and there scattered tufts of brown wiry grass are supported , and still more rarely , some low thorny bushes .
