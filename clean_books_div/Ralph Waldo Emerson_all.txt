history .

as the air i breathe is drawn from the great <unk> of nature , as the light on my book is yielded by a <name> a hundred millions of miles distant , as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces , so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages explained by the hours .

all laws derive hence their ultimate reason ; all express more or less distinctly some command of this supreme , illimitable essence .

it is remarkable that involuntarily we always read as superior beings .
universal history , the poets , the <unk> , do not in their stateliest pictures ,  in the <unk> , the imperial palaces , in the triumphs of <name> or of genius ,  anywhere lose our ear , anywhere make us feel that we intrude , that this is for better men ; but rather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel most at home .
all that shakspeare says of the king , yonder slip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of himself .
we sympathize in the great moments of history , in the great discoveries , the great <unk> , the great <unk> of men ;  because there law was enacted , the sea was searched , the land was found , or the blow was struck , for us , as we ourselves in that place would have done or applauded .

a gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by us .

we put ourselves into the place and state of the builder .

when we have gone through this process , and added thereto the catholic church , its cross , its music , its processions , its <unk> days and <unk> , we have as it were been the man that made the minster ; we have seen how it could and must be .

why should we make account of time , or of magnitude , or of figure ?
the soul knows them not , and genius , obeying its law , knows how to play with them as a young child plays with <unk> and in churches .
genius studies the <unk> thought , and far back in the womb of things sees the rays parting from one orb , that diverge , ere they fall , by infinite diameters .
genius watches the <unk> through all his masks as he performs the <unk> of nature .
genius detects through the fly , through the caterpillar , through the grub , through the egg , the constant individual ; through countless individuals the fixed species ; through many species the genus ; through all genera the steadfast type ; through all the kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity .
nature is a <unk> cloud which is always and never the same .
she casts the same thought into troops of forms , as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral .
through the <unk> and <unk> of matter , a subtle spirit bends all things to its own <name> .

the identity of history is equally intrinsic , the diversity equally obvious .
there is , at the surface , infinite variety of things ; at the centre there is simplicity of cause .
how many are the acts of one man in which we recognize the same character !
observe the sources of our information in respect to the greek genius .
we have the civil history of that people , as herodotus , <unk> , xenophon , and plutarch have given it ; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were and what they did .
we have the same national mind expressed for us again in their literature , in epic and lyric poems , drama , and philosophy ; a very complete form .
then we have it once more in their architecture , a beauty as of temperance itself , limited to the straight line and the square ,  a builded geometry .
then we have it once again in sculpture , the " tongue on the balance of expression , " a multitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action and never <unk> the ideal serenity ; like <unk> performing some religious dance before the gods , and , though in convulsive pain or mortal combat , never daring to break the figure and decorum of their dance .

in a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse works .

it has been said that " common souls pay with what they do , nobler souls with that which they are . "
and why ?
because a profound nature awakens in us by its actions and words , by its very looks and manners , the same power and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses .
civil and natural history , the history of <name> and of literature , must be explained from individual history , or must remain words .

a <name> with whom i was riding in the forest said to me that the woods always seemed to her to wait , as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the <unk> had passed onward ; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies , which breaks off on the approach of human feet .
the man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight , has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world .
i remember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out to me a broad cloud , which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to the horizon , quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches ,  a round block in the centre , which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth , supported on either side by <unk> symmetrical wings .
what appears once in the atmosphere may appear often , and it was undoubtedly the <unk> of that familiar ornament .

i have seen a <unk> along the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll to <unk> a tower .
by surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture , as we see how each people merely decorated its primitive abodes .

the chinese pagoda is plainly a tartar tent .
the indian and egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers .
" the custom of making houses and tombs in the living rock , " says <unk> in his researches on the <unk> , " determined very naturally the principal character of the <unk> egyptian architecture to the colossal form which it assumed .

in the early history of <name> and africa , <unk> and agriculture are the two antagonist facts .
the geography of <name> and of africa necessitated a nomadic life .
but the <unk> were the terror of all those whom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build towns .
agriculture therefore was a religious injunction , because of the perils of the state from <unk> .
and in these late and civil countries of england and <name> these propensities still fight out the old battle , in the nation and in the individual .

the <unk> of <name> follow the pasturage from month to month .
in <name> and europe the <unk> is of trade and curiosity ; a progress , certainly , from the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> of boston bay .
sacred cities , to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was enjoined , or <unk> laws and customs , tending to <unk> the national bond , were the check on the old rovers ; and the cumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the <unk> of the present day .
the antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals , as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to <unk> .
a man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid domestication , lives in his wagon and <unk> through all latitudes as easily as a <unk> .
at sea , or in the forest , or in the snow , he sleeps as warm , <unk> with as good appetite , and associates as happily as beside his own chimneys .

the primeval world ,  the <unk> , as the germans say ,  i can dive to it in myself as well as grope for it with <unk> fingers in catacombs , libraries , and the broken <unk> and <unk> of ruined villas .
what is the foundation of that interest all men feel in greek history , letters , <name> , and poetry , in all its periods from the heroic or <unk> age down to the domestic life of the athenians and spartans , four or five centuries later ?
what but this , that every man passes personally through a grecian period .
the grecian state is the <name> of the bodily nature , the perfection of the senses ,  of the spiritual nature unfolded in strict unity with the body .
in it existed those human forms which supplied the sculptor with his models of hercules , <unk> , and jove ; not like the forms abounding in the streets of modern cities , wherein the face is a confused blur of features , but composed of <unk> , sharply defined and symmetrical features , whose <unk> are so formed that it would be impossible for such eyes to <unk> and take furtive glances on this side and on that , but they must turn the whole head .
the manners of that period are plain and fierce .
the reverence exhibited is for personal qualities ; courage , address , self-command , justice , strength , swiftness , a loud voice , a broad chest .
luxury and elegance are not known .
a <unk> population and want make every man his own valet , cook , butcher and soldier , and the habit of supplying his own needs <unk> the body to wonderful performances .
such are the <unk> and <unk> of <name> , and not far different is the picture xenophon gives of himself and his <unk> in the retreat of the ten thousand .

who does not see that this is a gang of great boys , with such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have ?
the costly charm of the ancient tragedy , and indeed of all the old literature , is that the persons speak simply ,  speak as persons who have great good sense without knowing it , before yet the reflective habit has become the predominant habit of the mind .
our admiration of the antique is not admiration of the old , but of the natural .
the greeks are not reflective , but perfect in their senses and in their health , with the finest physical organization in the world .
adults acted with the simplicity and <name> of children .
they made vases , tragedies , and statues , such as healthy senses should ,  that is , in good taste .
such things have continued to be made in all ages , and are now , wherever a healthy physique exists ; but , as a class , from their superior organization , they have surpassed all .
they combine the energy of manhood with the engaging unconsciousness of childhood .
the attraction of these manners is that they belong to man , and are known to every man in virtue of his being once a child ; besides that there are always individuals who retain these characteristics .
a person of childlike genius and inborn energy is still a greek , and <unk> our love of the muse of <unk> .
i admire the love of nature in the <unk> .
in reading those fine <unk> to sleep , to the stars , rocks , mountains and waves , i feel time passing away as an ebbing sea .
i feel the eternity of man , the identity of his thought .

the sun and moon , water and fire , met his heart precisely as they meet mine .
then the <unk> distinction between greek and english , between classic and romantic schools , seems superficial and <unk> .
when a thought of plato becomes a thought to me ,  when a truth that fired the soul of pindar fires mine , time is no more .
when i feel that we two meet in a perception , that our two souls are tinged with the same <name> , and do as it were run into one , why should i measure degrees of latitude , why should i count egyptian years ?
the student <unk> the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry , and the days of maritime adventure and <unk> by quite parallel miniature experiences of his own .
to the sacred history of the world he has the same key .
when the voice of a prophet out of the deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of his infancy , a prayer of his youth , he then <unk> to the truth through all the confusion of tradition and the caricature of institutions .
rare , extravagant spirits come by us at intervals , who disclose to us new facts in nature .
i see that men of god have from time to time walked among men and made their commission felt in the heart and soul of the commonest hearer .
hence evidently the tripod , the priest , the priestess inspired by the divine <unk> .
<name> <unk> and <unk> sensual people .
they can not unite him to history , or reconcile him with themselves .

i can not find any antiquity in them .
they are mine as much as theirs .
i have seen the first monks and <unk> , without crossing seas or centuries .
more than once some individual has appeared to me with such negligence of labor and such commanding contemplation , a haughty <unk> begging in the name of god , as made good to the nineteenth century <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , and the first <unk> .
the <unk> of the east and west , of the magian , brahmin , <unk> , and inca , is expounded in the individual 's private life .
the <unk> influence of a hard <unk> on a young child , in <unk> his spirits and courage , paralyzing the understanding , and that without producing indignation , but only fear and obedience , and even much sympathy with the tyranny ,  is a familiar fact , explained to the child when he becomes a man , only by seeing that the oppressor of his youth is himself a child <unk> over by those names and words and forms of whose influence he was merely the organ to the youth .
the fact teaches him how <unk> was worshipped and how the pyramids were built , better than the discovery by <unk> of the names of all the workmen and the cost of every tile .
he finds <unk> and the mounds of <unk> at his door , and himself has laid the courses .
again , in that protest which each considerate person makes against the superstition of his times , he repeats step for step the part of old reformers , and in the search after truth finds , like them , new perils to virtue .
he learns again what moral vigor is needed to supply the girdle of a superstition .
a great licentiousness <unk> on the heels of a reformation .
how many times in the history of the world has the <name> of the day had to lament the decay of piety in his own household !
" doctor , " said his wife to <name> <name> , one day , " how is it that whilst subject to <unk> we prayed so often and with such fervor , whilst now we pray with the utmost coldness and very seldom ? "
the advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in literature ,  in all fable as well as in all history .
he finds that the poet was no odd fellow who described strange and impossible situations , but that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true for one and true for all .
his own secret biography he finds in lines wonderfully intelligible to him , dotted down before he was born .
one after another he comes up in his private adventures with every fable of <unk> , of <name> , of hafiz , of <unk> , of chaucer , of <name> , and <unk> them with his own head and hands .
the beautiful fables of the greeks , being proper creations of the imagination and not of the fancy , are universal <unk> .
what a range of meanings and what perpetual <unk> has the story of prometheus !
beside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of europe , ( the mythology thinly <unk> authentic facts , the invention of the mechanic arts and the migration of colonies , ) it gives the history of religion , with some <unk> to the <name> of later ages .
prometheus is the <name> of the old mythology .
he is the friend of man ; stands between the unjust " justice " of the eternal father and the race of mortals , and readily suffers all things on their account .
but where it departs from the <unk> christianity and exhibits him as the <unk> of jove , it represents a state of mind which readily appears wherever the doctrine of <unk> is taught in a crude , objective form , and which seems the self-defence of man against this untruth , namely a discontent with the believed fact that a god exists , and a feeling that the obligation of reverence is <unk> .
it would steal if it could the fire of the creator , and live apart from him and independent of him .
the prometheus <unk> is the romance of skepticism .
not less true to all time are the details of that stately <unk> .
apollo kept the flocks of <unk> , said the poets .
when the gods come among men , they are not known .
<name> was not ; socrates and shakspeare were not .

the philosophical perception of identity through endless <unk> of form makes him know the proteus .
what else am i who laughed or wept yesterday , who slept last night like a corpse , and this morning stood and ran ?
and what see i on any side but the <unk> of proteus ?
i can <unk> my thought by using the name of any creature , of any fact , because every creature is man agent or patient .
<unk> is but a name for you and me .
<unk> means the impossibility of drinking the waters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within sight of the soul .
the <unk> of souls is no fable .
i would it were ; but men and women are only half human .
every animal of the <unk> , the field and the forest , of the earth and of the waters that are under the earth , has contrived to get a footing and to leave the print of its features and form in some one or other of these upright , <unk> speakers .
ah !
brother , stop the ebb of thy soul ,  ebbing downward into the forms into whose habits thou hast now for many years slid .
as near and proper to us is also that old fable of the sphinx , who was said to sit in the road-side and put riddles to every passenger .
if the man could not answer , she swallowed him alive .
if he could solve the riddle , the sphinx was slain .
what is our life but an endless flight of winged facts or events ?
in splendid variety these changes come , all putting questions to the human spirit .
those men who can not answer by a superior wisdom these facts or questions of time , serve them .
facts <unk> them , <unk> over them , and make the men of routine , the men of sense , in whom a literal obedience to facts has extinguished every spark of that light by which man is truly man .
but if the man is true to his better instincts or sentiments , and refuses the dominion of facts , as one that comes of a higher race ; remains fast by the soul and sees the principle , then the facts fall aptly and supple into their places ; they know their master , and the meanest of them <unk> him .
see in goethe 's <name> the same <name> that every word should be a thing .
these figures , he would say , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <name> and <name> , are somewhat , and do exert a specific influence on the mind .
so far then are they eternal <unk> , as real to-day as in the first <unk> .
much revolving them he writes out freely his humor , and gives them body to his own imagination .
and although that poem be as vague and fantastic as a dream , yet is it much more attractive than the more regular dramatic pieces of the same author , for the reason that it <unk> a wonderful relief to the mind from the routine of customary images ,  awakens the reader 's invention and fancy by the wild freedom of the design , and by the unceasing succession of brisk shocks of surprise .
the universal nature , too strong for the petty nature of the bard , sits on his neck and writes through his hand ; so that when he seems to vent a mere <name> and wild romance , the issue is an exact allegory .
hence plato said that " poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand . "
all the <unk> of the middle age explain themselves as a masked or frolic expression of that which in grave <name> the mind of that period toiled to achieve .
magic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science .
the shoes of swiftness , the sword of sharpness , the power of subduing the elements , of using the secret virtues of minerals , of understanding the voices of birds , are the obscure efforts of the mind in a right direction .
the <unk> prowess of the hero , the gift of perpetual youth , and the like , are alike the endeavour of the human spirit " to bend the shows of things to the desires of the mind . "
in <unk> and <unk> de gaul a <name> and a rose bloom on the head of her who is faithful , and fade on the brow of the inconstant .
in the story of the boy and the mantle even a mature reader may be surprised with a glow of virtuous pleasure at the triumph of the gentle <unk> ; and indeed all the <unk> of <unk> annals ,  that the fairies do not like to be named ; that their gifts are capricious and not to be trusted ; that who seeks a treasure must not speak ; and the like ,  i find true in concord , however they might be in cornwall or <unk> .
is it otherwise in the newest romance ?
i read the bride of <unk> .
sir <name> <name> is a mask for a vulgar temptation , <unk> castle a fine name for proud poverty , and the foreign mission of state only a <unk> disguise for honest industry .
we may all shoot a wild bull that would toss the good and beautiful , by fighting down the unjust and sensual .
<name> <name> is another name for fidelity , which is always beautiful and always liable to calamity in this world .
but along with the civil and metaphysical history of man , another history goes daily forward ,  that of the external world ,  in which he is not less strictly implicated .
he is the <unk> of time ; he is also the <unk> of nature .
his power consists in the multitude of his affinities , in the fact that his life is <unk> with the whole chain of organic and inorganic being .
in old rome the public roads beginning at the forum proceeded north , south , east , west , to the centre of every province of the empire , making each <unk> of persia , spain and britain <unk> to the soldiers of the capital : so out of the human heart go as it were highways to the heart of every object in nature , to reduce it under the dominion of man .
a man is a bundle of relations , a knot of roots , whose flower and <unk> is the world .
his faculties refer to natures out of him and predict the world he is to inhabit , as the fins of the fish <unk> that water exists , or the wings of an eagle in the egg <unk> air .
he can not live without a world .
put <name> in an island prison , let his faculties find no men to act on , no alps to climb , no stake to play for , and he would beat the air , and appear stupid .
transport him to large countries , dense population , complex interests and antagonist power , and you shall see that the man <name> , bounded that is by such a profile and outline , is not the <unk> <name> .
this is but talbot 's shadow ;  " his substance is not here .
for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity ; but were the whole frame here , it is of such a spacious , lofty pitch , your roof were not sufficient to contain it . "
 <name> <name> .
<name> needs a planet to shape his course upon .
<name> and laplace need myriads of age and <unk> celestial areas .
one may say a <unk> solar system is already prophesied in the nature of <unk> mind .
not less does the <name> of davy or of <unk> , from childhood exploring the affinities and <unk> of particles , anticipate the laws of organization .
does not the eye of the human embryo predict the light ?
the ear of <unk> predict the witchcraft of <unk> sound ?
do not the constructive fingers of <unk> , fulton , <unk> , <unk> , predict the fusible , hard , and <unk> texture of metals , the properties of stone , water , and wood ?
do not the lovely attributes of the maiden child predict the <unk> and decorations of civil society ?
here also we are reminded of the action of man on man .
a mind might ponder its thought for ages and not gain so much <unk> as the passion of love shall teach it in a day .
who knows himself before he has been thrilled with indignation at an outrage , or has heard an eloquent tongue , or has shared the throb of thousands in a national exultation or alarm ?
no man can <unk> his experience , or guess what faculty or feeling a new object shall unlock , any more than he can draw to-day the face of a person whom he shall see to-morrow for the first time .
i <name> not now go behind the general statement to explore the reason of this <unk> .
let it suffice that in the light of these two facts , namely , that the mind is one , and that nature is its <unk> , history is to be read and written .
thus in all ways does the soul concentrate and reproduce its treasures for each pupil .
he too shall pass through the whole cycle of experience .
he shall collect into a focus the rays of nature .
history no longer shall be a dull book .
it shall walk incarnate in every just and wise man .
you shall not tell me by languages and titles a catalogue of the volumes you have read .
you shall make me feel what periods you have lived .
a man shall be the <name> of fame .
he shall walk , as the poets have described that goddess , in a robe painted all over with wonderful events and experiences ;  his own form and features by their exalted intelligence shall be that variegated vest .
i shall find in him the <unk> ; in his childhood the age of gold , the apples of knowledge , the <unk> expedition , the calling of <name> , the building of the <name> , the advent of christ , dark ages , the revival of letters , the reformation , the discovery of new lands , the opening of new sciences and new regions in man .
he shall be the priest of pan , and bring with him into humble cottages the blessing of the morning stars , and all the recorded benefits of heaven and earth .
is there somewhat <unk> in this claim ?
then i reject all i have written , for what is the use of pretending to know what we know not ?
but it is the fault of our rhetoric that we can not strongly state one fact without seeming to <unk> some other .
i hold our actual knowledge very cheap .
hear the rats in the wall , see the lizard on the fence , the fungus under foot , the lichen on the log .
what do i know sympathetically , morally , of either of these worlds of life ?
as old as the caucasian man ,  perhaps older ,  these creatures have kept their counsel beside him , and there is no record of any word or sign that has passed from one to the other .
what connection do the books show between the fifty or sixty chemical elements and the historical <unk> ?
nay , what does history yet record of the metaphysical annals of man ?
what light does it shed on those mysteries which we hide under the names death and immortality ?
yet every history should be written in a wisdom which divined the range of our affinities and looked at facts as symbols .
i am ashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called history is .
how many times we must say rome , and <name> , and constantinople !
what does rome know of rat and lizard ?
what are <unk> and <unk> to these neighboring systems of being ?
nay , what food or experience or succor have they for the esquimaux <unk> , for the kanaka in his canoe , for the fisherman , the <unk> , the <name> ?
broader and deeper we must write our annals ,  from an ethical reformation , from an influx of the ever new , ever <unk> conscience ,  if we would <unk> express our central and <unk> nature , instead of this old <unk> of selfishness and pride to which we have too long lent our eyes .
already that day exists for us , shines in on us at unawares , but the path of science and of letters is not the way into nature .
the idiot , the indian , the child and <unk> farmer 's boy stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read , than the <unk> or the <unk> .
***** self-reliance .
" ne te <unk> extra . "
" man is his own <name> ; and the soul that can render an honest and a perfect man , commands all light , all influence , all fate ; nothing to him falls early or too late .
our acts our angels are , or good or ill , our fatal shadows that walk by us still . "
<unk> to beaumont and <name> 's honest man 's fortune .
cast the <unk> on the rocks , <unk> him with the <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> with the hawk and fox .
power and speed be hands and feet .
ii .
self-reliance .
i read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional .
the soul always hears an admonition in such lines , let the subject be what it may .
the sentiment they <unk> is of more value than any thought they may contain .
to believe your own thought , to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men ,  that is genius .
speak your latent conviction , and it shall be the universal sense ; for the inmost in due time becomes the <unk> , and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the last judgment .
familiar as the voice of the mind is to each , the highest merit we <unk> to <name> , plato and <name> is that they set at naught books and traditions , and spoke not what men , but what they thought .
a man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within , more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages .
yet he <unk> without notice his thought , because it is his .
in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts ; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty .
great works of <name> have no more affecting lesson for us than this .
they teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored <unk> then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side .
else to-morrow a stranger <name> say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time , and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another .
there is a time in every man 's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance ; that imitation is suicide ; that he must take himself for better for worse as his portion ; that though the wide universe is full of good , no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till .
the power which resides in him is new in nature , and none but he knows what that is which he can do , nor does he know until he has tried .
not for nothing one face , one character , one fact , makes much impression on him , and another none .
this sculpture in the memory is not without <unk> <name> .
the eye was placed where one <name> should fall , that it might testify of that particular <name> .
we but half express ourselves , and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents .
it may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues , so it be faithfully imparted , but god <name> not have his work made manifest by cowards .
a man is relieved and <name> when he has put his heart into his work and done his best ; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace .
it is a deliverance which does not deliver .
in the attempt his genius deserts him ; no muse <unk> ; no invention , no <name> .
trust thyself : every heart <unk> to that iron string .
accept the place the divine providence has found for you , the society of your contemporaries , the connection of events .
great men have always done so , and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age , betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart , working through their hands , <unk> in all their being .
and we are now men , and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent <name> ; and not <unk> and invalids in a protected corner , not cowards fleeing before a revolution , but guides , <unk> and benefactors , obeying the almighty effort and advancing on chaos and the dark .
what pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the face and behavior of children , babes , and even brutes !
that divided and rebel mind , that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has <unk> the strength and means opposed to our purpose , these have not .
their mind being whole , their eye is as yet <unk> , and when we look in their faces we are disconcerted .
infancy <unk> to nobody ; all conform to it ; so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who <unk> and play to it .
so god has armed youth and <unk> and manhood no less with its own <unk> and charm , and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by , if it <name> stand by itself .
do not think the youth has no force , because he can not speak to you and me .
hark !
in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic .
it seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries .
bashful or bold then , he <name> know how to make us seniors very unnecessary .
the nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner , and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one , is the healthy attitude of human nature .
a boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the <unk> ; independent , irresponsible , looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by , he tries and sentences them on their merits , in the swift , summary way of boys , as good , bad , interesting , silly , eloquent , troublesome .
he <unk> himself never about consequences , about interests ; he gives an independent , genuine verdict .
you must court him ; he does not court you .
but the man is as it were clapped into jail by his consciousness .
as soon as he has once acted or spoken with <unk> he is a committed person , watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds , whose affections must now enter into his account .
there is no <unk> for this .
ah , that he could pass again into his <unk> !
who can thus avoid all <unk> and , having observed , observe again from the same unaffected , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> innocence ,  must always be formidable .
he would utter opinions on all passing affairs , which being seen to be not private but necessary , would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in fear .
these are the voices which we hear in solitude , but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world .
society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members .
society is a <unk> company , in which the members agree , for the better securing of his bread to each <unk> , to surrender the <name> and culture of the eater .
the virtue in most request is conformity .
self-reliance is its aversion .
it loves not realities and <unk> , but names and customs .
whoso would be a man , must be a <unk> .
he who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness , but must explore if it be goodness .
nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind .
<unk> you to yourself , and you shall have the suffrage of the world .
i remember an answer which when quite young i was prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to <unk> me with the dear old doctrines of the church .
on my saying , " what have i to do with the sacredness of traditions , if i live wholly from within ? "
my friend suggested ,  " but these impulses may be from below , not from above . "
i replied , " they do not seem to me to be such ; but if i am the devil 's child , i <name> live then from the devil . "
no law can be sacred to me but that of my nature .
good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this ; the only right is what is after my constitution ; the only wrong what is against it .
a man is to <name> himself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were <unk> and <unk> but he .
i am ashamed to think how easily we <unk> to badges and names , to large societies and dead institutions .
every decent and <unk> individual affects and <unk> me more than is right .
i ought to go upright and vital , and speak the rude truth in all ways .
if malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy , shall that pass ?
if an angry <unk> assumes this bountiful cause of abolition , and comes to me with his last news from <unk> , why should i not say to him , 'go love thy infant ; love thy <unk> ; be good-natured and modest ; have that <name> ; and never varnish your hard , <unk> ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off .
thy love afar is spite at home . '
rough and <unk> would be such greeting , but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love .
your goodness must have some edge to it ,  else it is none .
the doctrine of hatred must be preached , as the <unk> of the doctrine of love , when that <unk> and <unk> .
i shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me .
i would write on the <unk> of the door-post , whim .
i <name> it is somewhat better than whim at last , but we can not spend the day in explanation .
expect me not to show cause why i seek or why i exclude company .
then again , do not tell me , as a good man did to-day , of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations .
are they my poor ?
i tell thee thou foolish <unk> that i grudge the dollar , the dime , the cent , i give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom i do not belong .
there is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity i am bought and sold ; for them i <name> go to prison if need be ; but your miscellaneous popular charities ; the education at college of fools ; the building of <unk> to the vain end to which many now stand ; alms to <unk> , and the <unk> relief societies ;  though i confess with shame i sometimes succumb and give the dollar , it is a wicked dollar which by and by i shall have the manhood to withhold .
virtues are , in the popular estimate , rather the exception than the rule .
there is the man and his virtues .
men do what is called a good action , as some piece of courage or <name> , much as they would pay a fine in <unk> of daily <unk> on parade .
their works are done as an apology or <unk> of their living in the world ,  as invalids and the insane pay a high board .
their virtues are <unk> .
i do not wish to <unk> , but to live .
my life is for itself and not for a spectacle .
i much prefer that it should be of a lower strain , so it be genuine and equal , than that it should be glittering and unsteady .
i wish it to be sound and sweet , and not to need diet and bleeding .
i ask primary evidence that you are a man , and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions .
i know that for myself it makes no difference whether i do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent .
i can not consent to pay for a privilege where i have intrinsic right .
few and mean as my gifts may be , i actually am , and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony .
what i must do is all that concerns me , not what the people think .
this rule , equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life , may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness .
it is the harder because you <name> always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it .
it is easy in the world to live after the world 's opinion ; it is easy in solitude to live after our own ; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude .
the objection to <unk> to usages that have become dead to you is that it <unk> your force .
it loses your time and <unk> the impression of your character .
if you maintain a dead church , contribute to a dead <unk> , vote with a great party either for the government or against it , spread your table like base <unk> ,  under all these screens i have difficulty to detect the precise man you are : and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life .
but do your work , and i shall know you .
do your work , and you shall <unk> yourself .
a man must consider what a <unk> is this game of conformity .
if i know your sect , i anticipate your argument .
i hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church .
do i not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word ?
do i not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he <name> do no such thing ?
do i not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side , the permitted side , not as a man , but as a parish minister ?
he is a retained attorney , and these airs of the bench are the <unk> affectation .
well , most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief , and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion .
this conformity makes them not false in a few particulars , authors of a few lies , but false in all particulars .
their every truth is not quite true .
their two is not the real two , their four not the real four ; so that every word they say <unk> us and we know not where to begin to set them right .
meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the <unk> of the party to which we adhere .
we come to wear one cut of face and figure , and acquire by degrees the gentlest <unk> expression .
there is a <unk> experience in particular , which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history ; i mean " the foolish face of praise , " the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us .
the muscles , not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping <unk> , grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation .
for <unk> the world whips you with its displeasure .
and therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face .
the by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend 's parlor .
if this <unk> had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance ; but the sour faces of the multitude , like their sweet faces , have no deep cause , but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper <unk> .
yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college .
it is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to <name> the rage of the cultivated classes .
their rage is decorous and prudent , for they are timid , as being very vulnerable themselves .
but when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added , when the ignorant and the poor are aroused , when the <unk> brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and <unk> , it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no <unk> .
the other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency ; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for <unk> our orbit than our past acts , and we are loath to disappoint them .
but why should you keep your head over your shoulder ?
why drag about this corpse of your memory , lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place ?
suppose you should contradict yourself ; what then ?
it seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone , scarcely even in acts of pure memory , but to bring the past for judgment into the <unk> present , and live ever in a new day .
in your metaphysics you have denied personality to the deity , yet when the devout motions of the soul come , yield to them heart and life , though they should clothe god with shape and color .
leave your theory , as <name> his coat in the hand of the harlot , and flee .
a foolish consistency is the <unk> of little minds , adored by little statesmen and philosophers and <unk> .
with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do .
he may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall .
speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again , though it contradict every thing you said <unk>  'ah , so you shall be sure to be misunderstood . '
 is it so bad then to be misunderstood ?
<unk> was misunderstood , and socrates , and <name> , and <name> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <name> , and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh .
to be great is to be misunderstood .
i suppose no man can violate his nature .
all the sallies of his <name> are rounded in by the law of his being , as the inequalities of andes and <unk> are insignificant in the curve of the sphere .
nor does it matter how you gauge and try him .
a character is like an <unk> or alexandrian stanza ;  read it forward , backward , or across , it still spells the same thing .
in this pleasing <unk> <unk> which god allows me , let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect , and , i can not doubt , it <name> be found symmetrical , though i mean it not and see it not .
my book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects .
the swallow over my window should <unk> that thread or straw he carries in his <name> into my web also .
we pass for what we are .
character teaches above our wills .
men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by <unk> actions , and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment .
there <name> be an agreement in whatever variety of actions , so they be each honest and natural in their hour .
for of one <name> , the actions <name> be harmonious , however unlike they seem .
these varieties are lost sight of at a little distance , at a little height of thought .
one tendency unites them all .
the voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred <unk> .
see the line from a sufficient distance , and it straightens itself to the average tendency .
your genuine action <name> explain itself and <name> explain your other genuine actions .
your conformity explains nothing .
act singly , and what you have already done singly <name> justify you now .
greatness appeals to the future .
if i can be firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes , i must have done so much right before as to defend me now .
be it how it <name> , do right now .
always scorn appearances and you always may .
the force of character is cumulative .
all the <unk> days of virtue work their health into this .
what makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field , which so fills the imagination ?
the consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind .
they shed an united light on the advancing actor .
he is attended as by a visible escort of angels .
that is it which throws thunder into chatham 's voice , and dignity into washington 's port , and <name> into adams 's eye .
honor is venerable to us because it is no <unk> .
it is always ancient virtue .
we worship it to-day because it is not of to-day .
we love it and pay it homage because it is not a trap for our love and homage , but is <unk> , <unk> , and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree , even if shown in a young person .
i <name> in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency .
let the words be <unk> and ridiculous henceforward .
instead of the gong for dinner , let us hear a whistle from the spartan fife .
let us never bow and apologize more .
a great man is coming to eat at my house .
i do not wish to please him ; i wish that he should wish to please me .
i <name> stand here for humanity , and though i would make it kind , i would make it true .
let us affront and reprimand the smooth <unk> and squalid contentment of the times , and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office , the fact which is the upshot of all history , that there is a great responsible thinker and actor working wherever a man works ; that a true man belongs to no other time or place , but is the centre of things .
where he is , there is nature .
he measures you and all men and all events .
ordinarily , every body in society reminds us of somewhat else , or of some other person .
character , reality , reminds you of nothing else ; it takes place of the whole creation .
the man must be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent .
every true man is a cause , a country , and an age ; requires infinite spaces and <name> and time fully to accomplish his design ;  and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients .
a man caesar is born , and for ages after we have a <name> empire .
christ is born , and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man .
an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man ; as , <unk> , of the hermit <name> ; the reformation , of <name> ; <unk> , of fox ; <unk> , of <name> ; abolition , of <unk> .
scipio , <name> called " the height of rome " ; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and <name> persons .
let a man then know his worth , and keep things under his feet .
let him not peep or steal , or <unk> up and down with the air of a <unk> , a bastard , or an <unk> in the world which exists for him .
but the man in the street , finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god , feels poor when he looks on these .
to him a palace , a statue , or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air , much like a <name> equipage , and seem to say like that , 'who are you , sir ? '
yet they all are his , suitors for his notice , <unk> to his faculties that they <name> come out and take possession .
the picture waits for my verdict ; it is not to command me , but i am to settle its claims to praise .
that popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street , carried to the duke 's house , washed and dressed and laid in the duke 's bed , and , on his waking , treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke , and assured that he had been insane , owes its popularity to the fact that it <unk> so well the state of man , who is in the world a sort of sot , but now and then wakes up , exercises his reason and finds himself a true <name> .
our reading is mendicant and <unk> .
in history our imagination plays us false .
kingdom and lordship , power and estate , are a <unk> vocabulary than private <name> and <name> in a small house and common day 's work ; but the things of life are the same to both ; the sum total of both is the same .
why all this deference to <name> and <unk> and <unk> ?
suppose they were virtuous ; did they wear out virtue ?
as great a stake depends on your private act to-day , as followed their public and renowned steps .
when private men shall act with original views , the lustre <name> be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen .
the world has been instructed by its kings , who have so <unk> the eyes of nations .
it has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man .
the joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king , the <name> , or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own , make his own scale of men and things and reverse theirs , pay for benefits not with money but with honor , and represent the law in his person , was the <unk> by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and <unk> , the right of every man .
the magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust .
who is the trustee ?
what is the aboriginal self , on which a universal reliance may be grounded ?
what is the nature and power of that <unk> <name> , without <unk> , without <unk> elements , which shoots a <name> of beauty even into trivial and impure actions , if the least <name> of independence appear ?
the inquiry leads us to that source , at once the essence of genius , of virtue , and of life , which we call spontaneity or instinct .
we denote this primary wisdom as intuition , whilst all later teachings are <unk> .
in that deep force , the last fact behind which analysis can not go , all things find their common origin .
for the sense of being which in calm hours rises , we know not how , in the soul , is not diverse from things , from space , from light , from time , from man , but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed .
we first share the life by which things exist and afterwards see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have shared their cause .
here is the fountain of action and of thought .
here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom and which can not be denied without <unk> and <unk> .
we lie in the lap of immense intelligence , which makes us <unk> of its truth and organs of its activity .
when we discern justice , when we discern truth , we do nothing of ourselves , but allow a passage to its beams .
if we ask whence this comes , if we seek to pry into the soul that causes , all philosophy is at fault .
its presence or its absence is all we can affirm .
every man <unk> between the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary perceptions , and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect <name> is due .
he may err in the expression of them , but he knows that these things are so , like day and night , not to be disputed .
my wilful actions and <unk> are but roving ;  the <unk> reverie , the faintest native emotion , command my curiosity and respect .
thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions , or rather much more readily ; for they do not distinguish between perception and notion .
they fancy that i choose to see this or that thing .
but perception is not whimsical , but fatal .
if i see a trait , my children <name> see it after me , and in course of time all mankind ,  although it may chance that no one has seen it before me .
for my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun .
the relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps .
it must be that when god <unk> he should communicate , not one thing , but all things ; should fill the world with his voice ; should scatter forth light , nature , time , souls , from the centre of the present thought ; and new date and new create the whole .
whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom , old things pass away ,  means , teachers , texts , temples fall ; it lives now , and absorbs past and future into the present hour .
all things are made sacred by relation to it ,  one as much as another .
all things are dissolved to their centre by their cause , and in the universal miracle petty and particular miracles disappear .
if therefore a man claims to know and speak of god and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old <unk> nation in another country , in another world , believe him not .
is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion ?
is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being ?
whence then this worship of the past ?
the centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul .
time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes , but the soul is light : where it is , is day ; where it was , is night ; and history is an impertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than a cheerful <unk> or parable of my being and becoming .
man is timid and apologetic ; he is no longer upright ; he dares not say 'i think , ' 'i am , ' but quotes some saint or sage .
he is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose .
these roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones ; they are for what they are ; they exist with god to-day .
there is no time to them .
there is simply the rose ; it is perfect in every moment of its existence .
before a <unk> has burst , its whole life acts ; in the <unk> flower there is no more ; in the leafless root there is no less .
its nature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all moments alike .
but man <unk> or remembers ; he does not live in the present , but with reverted eye <unk> the past , or , heedless of the riches that surround him , stands on tiptoe to foresee the future .
he can not be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present , above time .
this should be plain enough .
yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear god himself unless he speak the phraseology of i know not what <name> , or <name> , or <name> .
we shall not always set so great a price on a few texts , on a few lives .
we are like children who repeat by <unk> the sentences of <unk> and <unk> , and , as they grow older , of the men of talents and character they chance to see ,  painfully <unk> the exact words they spoke ; afterwards , when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings , they understand them and are willing to let the words go ; for at any time they can use words as good when occasion comes .
if we live truly , we shall see truly .
it is as easy for the strong man to be strong , as it is for the weak to be weak .
when we have new perception , we shall gladly <unk> the memory of its <unk> treasures as old rubbish .
when a man lives with god , his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the <name> and the rustle of the corn .
and now at last the highest truth on this subject remains <unk> ; probably can not be said ; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition .
that thought by what i can now nearest approach to say it , is this .
when good is near you , when you have life in yourself , it is not by any known or accustomed way ; you shall not discern the footprints of any other ; you shall not see the face of man ; you shall not hear any name ;  the way , the thought , the good shall be wholly strange and new .
it shall exclude example and experience .
you take the way from man , not to man .
all persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers .
fear and <name> are alike beneath it .
there is somewhat low even in <name> .
in the hour of vision there is nothing that can be called gratitude , nor properly <name> .
the soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal <unk> , perceives the <unk> of truth and right , and <unk> itself with knowing that all things go well .
vast spaces of nature , the atlantic ocean , the south sea ; long intervals of time , years , centuries , are of no account .
this which i think and feel <unk> every former state of life and circumstances , as it does <unk> my present , and what is called life , and what is called death .
life only avails , not the having lived .
power ceases in the instant of repose ; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state , in the shooting of the gulf , in the darting to an aim .
this one fact the world hates ; that the soul becomes ; for that for ever <unk> the past , turns all riches to poverty , all reputation to a shame , <unk> the saint with the rogue , <unk> <name> and judas equally aside .
why then do we prate of self-reliance ?
inasmuch as the soul is present there <name> be power not confident but agent .
to talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking .
speak rather of that which <unk> because it works and is .
who has more obedience than i masters me , though he should not raise his finger .
round him i must revolve by the gravitation of spirits .
we fancy it rhetoric when we speak of eminent virtue .
we do not yet see that virtue is height , and that a man or a company of men , plastic and <unk> to principles , by the law of nature must <unk> and ride all cities , nations , kings , <name> men , poets , who are not .
this is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this , as on every topic , the resolution of all into the <unk> one .
<unk> is the attribute of the supreme cause , and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms .
all things real are so by so much virtue as they contain .
commerce , <unk> , hunting , whaling , war , eloquence , personal weight , are somewhat , and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action .
i see the same law working in nature for <unk> and growth .
power is , in nature , the essential measure of right .
nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which can not help itself .
the <name> and <unk> of a planet , its poise and orbit , the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind , the vital resources of every animal and vegetable , are demonstrations of the <unk> and therefore <unk> soul .
thus all <unk> : let us not <unk> ; let us sit at home with the cause .
let us <unk> and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions , by a simple declaration of the divine fact .
bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet , for god is here within .
let our simplicity judge them , and our <unk> to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches .
but now we are a mob .
man does not stand in awe of man , nor is his genius admonished to stay at home , to put itself in communication with the internal ocean , but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the <unk> of other men .
we must go alone .
i like the silent church before the service begins , better than any preaching .
how far off , how cool , how chaste the persons look , <unk> each one with a <unk> or sanctuary !
so let us always sit .
why should we assume the faults of our friend , or wife , or father , or child , because they sit around our hearth , or are said to have the same blood ?
all men have my blood and i have all men 's .
not for that <name> i adopt their <unk> or folly , even to the extent of being ashamed of it .
but your isolation must not be mechanical , but spiritual , that is , must be elevation .
at times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to <unk> you with emphatic trifles .
friend , client , child , sickness , fear , want , <name> , all knock at once at thy closet door and say ,  'come out unto us . '
but keep thy state ; come not into their confusion .
the power men possess to annoy me i give them by a weak curiosity .
no man can come near me but through my act .
" what we love that we have , but by <name> we <unk> ourselves of the love . "
if we can not at once rise to the <unk> of obedience and <name> , let us at least resist our temptations ; let us enter into the state of war and wake thor and <unk> , courage and constancy , in our saxon breasts .
this is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth .
check this lying hospitality and lying affection .
live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse .
say to them , 'o father , o mother , o wife , o brother , o friend , i have lived with you after appearances hitherto .
henceforward i am the truth 's .
be it known unto you that henceforward i obey no law less than the eternal law .
i <name> have no <unk> but <unk> .
i shall endeavour to nourish my parents , to support my family , to be the chaste husband of one wife ,  but these relations i must fill after a new and unprecedented way .
i appeal from your customs .
i must be myself .
i can not break myself any longer for you , or you .
if you can love me for what i am , we shall be the happier .
if you can not , i <name> still seek to deserve that you should .
i <name> not hide my tastes or <unk> .
i <name> so trust that what is deep is holy , that i <name> do strongly before the sun and moon whatever <unk> rejoices me and the heart <unk> .
if you are <name> , i <name> love you : if you are not , i <name> not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions .
if you are true , but not in the same truth with me , cleave to your companions ; i <name> seek my own .
i do this not <unk> but humbly and truly .
it is alike your interest , and mine , and all men 's , however long we have dwelt in lies , to live in truth .
does this sound harsh to-day ?
you <name> soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine , and if we follow the truth it <name> bring us out safe at last . '
 but so may you give these friends pain .
yes , but i can not sell my <name> and my power , to save their sensibility .
besides , all persons have their moments of reason , when they look out into the region of absolute truth ; then <name> they justify me and do the same thing .
the populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard , and mere <unk> ; and the bold <unk> <name> use the name of philosophy to <unk> his crimes .
but the law of consciousness abides .
there are two <unk> , in one or the other of which we must be <unk> .
you may fulfil your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct , or in the reflex way .
consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father , mother , cousin , neighbor , town , cat , and dog ; whether any of these can upbraid you .
but i may also neglect this reflex standard and <unk> me to myself .
i have my own stern claims and perfect circle .
it denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties .
but if i can discharge its debts it enables me to dispense with the popular code .
if any one imagines that this law is lax , let him keep its commandment one day .
and truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity and has ventured to trust himself for a <unk> .
high be his heart , faithful his <name> , clear his sight , that he may in good <name> be doctrine , society , law , to himself , that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others !
if any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society , he <name> see the need of these ethics .
the sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out , and we are become <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
we are afraid of truth , afraid of fortune , afraid of death and afraid of each other .
our age yields no great and perfect persons .
we want men and women who shall <unk> life and our social state , but we see that most natures are <unk> , can not satisfy their own wants , have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force and do <name> and beg day and night continually .
our housekeeping is mendicant , our arts , our occupations , our marriages , our religion we have not chosen , but society has chosen for us .
we are parlor soldiers .
we shun the rugged battle of fate , where strength is born .
if our young men <unk> in their first enterprises they lose all heart .
if the young merchant fails , men say he is ruined .
if the finest genius studies at one of our colleges and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of boston or new york , it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened and in complaining the rest of his life .
a sturdy lad from new hampshire or vermont , who in turn tries all the professions , who teams it , farms it , <unk> , keeps a school , <unk> , <unk> a newspaper , goes to congress , buys a township , and so forth , in successive years , and always like a cat falls on his feet , is worth a hundred of these city dolls .
he walks abreast with his days and feels no shame in not <unk> a profession , ' for he does not postpone his life , but lives already .
he has not one chance , but a hundred chances .
let a <unk> open the resources of man and tell men they are not leaning willows , but can and must detach themselves ; that with the exercise of self-trust , new powers shall appear ; that a man is the word made flesh , born to shed healing to the nations ; that he should be ashamed of our compassion , and that the moment he acts from himself , tossing the laws , the books , <unk> and customs out of the window , we pity him no more but thank and revere him ;  and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor and make his name dear to all history .
it is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men ; in their religion ; in their education ; in their pursuits ; their modes of living ; their association ; in their property ; in their speculative views .
1 .
in what prayers do men allow themselves !
that which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly .
prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue , and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural , and <unk> and miraculous .
prayer that <unk> a particular commodity , any thing less than all good , is vicious .
prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view .
it is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul .
it is the spirit of god pronouncing his works good .
but prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft .
it supposes <unk> and not unity in nature and consciousness .
as soon as the man is at one with god , he <name> not beg .
he <name> then see prayer in all action .
the prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it , the prayer of the <unk> kneeling with the stroke of his oar , are true prayers heard throughout nature , though for cheap ends .
<unk> , in <name> 's <unk> , when admonished to inquire the mind of the god <unk> , replies ,  " his hidden meaning lies in our endeavors ; our <unk> are our best gods . "
another sort of false prayers are our regrets .
discontent is the want of self-reliance : it is infirmity of <name> .
regret calamities if you can thereby help the sufferer ; if not , attend your own work and already the evil begins to be repaired .
our sympathy is just as base .
we come to them who weep foolishly and sit down and cry for company , instead of <unk> to them truth and health in rough electric shocks , putting them once more in communication with their own reason .
the secret of fortune is <name> in our hands .
welcome evermore to gods and men is the <unk> man .
for him all doors are flung wide ; him all tongues greet , all honors crown , all eyes follow with <name> .
our love goes out to him and embraces him because he did not need it .
we <unk> and apologetically caress and celebrate him because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation .
the gods love him because men hated him .
" to the persevering mortal , " said <unk> , " the blessed immortals are swift . "
as men 's prayers are a disease of the <name> , so are their creeds a disease of the intellect .
they say with those foolish israelites , 'let not god speak to us , lest we die .
speak thou , speak any man with us , and we <name> obey . '
everywhere i am hindered of meeting god in my brother , because he has shut his own <name> doors and <unk> fables merely of his brother 's , or his brother 's brother 's god .
every new mind is a new classification .
if it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power , a locke , a <unk> , a hutton , a bentham , a <unk> , it <unk> its classification on other men , and lo !
a new system .
in proportion to the depth of the thought , and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil , is his complacency .
but chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches , which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty , and man's relation to the highest .
such is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the pupil takes the same delight in <unk> every thing to the new <unk> as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby .
it <name> happen for a time that the pupil <name> find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master 's mind .
but in all <unk> minds the classification is idolized , passes for the end and not for a speedily <unk> means , so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe ; the <unk> of heaven seem to them <name> on the arch their master built .
they can not imagine how you aliens have any right to see ,  how you can see ; 'it must be somehow that you stole the light from us . '
they do not yet perceive that light , <unk> , indomitable , <name> break into any cabin , even into theirs .
let them chirp awhile and call it their own .
if they are honest and do well , presently their neat new <unk> <name> be too strait and low , <name> crack , <name> <name> , <name> rot and vanish , and the immortal light , all young and joyful , <unk> , <unk> , <name> beam over the universe as on the first morning .
2 .
it is for want of <unk> that the superstition of travelling , whose idols are italy , england , egypt , retains its fascination for all educated americans .
they who made england , italy , or greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were , like an axis of the earth .
in manly hours we feel that duty is our place .
the soul is no traveller ; the wise man stays at home , and when his necessities , his duties , on any occasion call him from his house , or into foreign lands , he is at home still and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance that he goes , the missionary of wisdom and virtue , and visits cities and men like a sovereign and not like an <unk> or a valet .
i have no <unk> objection to the <unk> of the globe for the purposes of <name> , of study , and benevolence , so that the man is first domesticated , or does not go abroad with the <name> of finding somewhat greater than he knows .
he who travels to be amused , or to get somewhat which he does not <name> , travels away from himself , and grows old even in youth among old things .
in thebes , in palmyra , his <name> and mind have become old and dilapidated as they .
he carries ruins to ruins .
travelling is a fool 's paradise .
our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places .
at home i dream that at naples , at rome , i can be intoxicated with beauty and lose my sadness .
i pack my trunk , embrace my friends , embark on the sea and at last wake up in naples , and there beside me is the stern fact , the sad self , <unk> , identical , that i fled from .
i seek the vatican and the palaces .
i affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions , but i am not intoxicated .
my giant goes with me wherever i go .
3 .
but the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper <unk> affecting the whole intellectual action .
the intellect is vagabond , and our system of education fosters restlessness .
our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home .
we imitate ; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind ?
our houses are built with foreign taste ; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments ; our opinions , our tastes , our faculties , <name> , and follow the past and the distant .
the soul created the arts wherever they have flourished .
it was in his own mind that the artist sought his model .
it was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed .
and why need we copy the <unk> or the gothic model ?
beauty , convenience , grandeur of thought and quaint expression are as near to us as to any , and if the american artist <name> study with <name> and love the precise thing to be done by him , considering the climate , the soil , the length of the day , the wants of the people , the habit and form of the government , he <name> create a house in which all these <name> find themselves fitted , and taste and sentiment <name> be satisfied also .
insist on yourself ; never imitate .
your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life 's cultivation ; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an <unk> half possession .
that which each can do best , none but his maker can teach him .
no man yet knows what it is , nor can , till that person has exhibited it .
where is the master who could have taught shakspeare ?
where is the master who could have instructed <name> , or washington , or bacon , or <name> ?
every great man is a unique .
the <unk> of scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow .
shakspeare <name> never be made by the study of shakspeare .
do that which is assigned you , and you can not <name> too much or dare too much .
there is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of phidias , or trowel of the egyptians , or the pen of <name> or <name> , but different from all these .
not possibly <name> the soul , all <name> , all eloquent , with <unk> tongue , deign to repeat itself ; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say , surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice ; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature .
abide in the simple and <name> regions of thy life , obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the <unk> again .
4 .
as our religion , our education , our <name> look abroad , so does our spirit of society .
all men plume themselves on the improvement of society , and no man improves .
society never advances .
it <unk> as fast on one side as it gains on the other .
it undergoes continual changes ; it is barbarous , it is civilized , it is <unk> , it is <name> , it is scientific ; but this change is not <unk> .
for every thing that is given something is taken .
society acquires new arts and loses old instincts .
what a contrast between the <unk> , reading , writing , thinking american , with a watch , a pencil and a <name> of exchange in his pocket , and the naked new <unk> , whose property is a club , a spear , a mat and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under !
but compare the health of the two men and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength .
if the traveller tell us truly , strike the savage with a broad axe and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch , and the same blow shall send the white to his grave .
the civilized man has built a coach , but has lost the use of his feet .
he is supported on crutches , but lacks so much support of muscle .
he has a fine <name> watch , but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun .
a greenwich nautical almanac he has , and so being sure of the information when he wants it , the man in the street does not know a <name> in the sky .
the <unk> he does not observe ; the <unk> he knows as little ; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind .
his <unk> impair his memory ; his libraries <unk> his wit ; the <unk> increases the number of accidents ; and it may be a question whether machinery does not <unk> ; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy , by a christianity <unk> in establishments and forms some vigor of wild virtue .
for every <unk> was a <unk> ; but in christendom where is the <name> ?
there is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk .
no greater men are now than ever were .
a singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages ; nor can all the science , <name> , religion , and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than <unk> heroes , three or four and twenty centuries ago .
not in time is the race progressive .
<unk> , socrates , <unk> , <unk> , are great men , but they leave no class .
he who is really of their class <name> not be called by their name , but <name> be his own man , and in his turn the founder of a sect .
the arts and inventions of each period are only its costume and do not <unk> men .
the harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good .
hudson and <unk> accomplished so much in their <unk> as to astonish parry and <name> , whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and <name> .
<unk> , with an <unk> , discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since .
<name> found the new world in an <unk> boat .
it is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery which were introduced with loud <unk> a few years or centuries before .
the great genius returns to essential man .
we reckoned the improvements of the <name> of war among the triumphs of science , and yet <name> conquered europe by the bivouac , which consisted of falling back on naked valor and <unk> it of all aids .
the emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army , says las cases , " without <unk> our arms , magazines , <unk> and carriages , until , in imitation of the <name> custom , the soldier should receive his supply of corn , grind it in his <unk> , and bake his bread himself . "
society is a wave .
the wave moves onward , but the water of which it is composed does not .
the same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge .
its unity is only <unk> .
the persons who make up a nation to-day , next year die , and their experience with them .
and so the reliance on property , including the reliance on governments which protect it , is the want of self-reliance .
men have looked away from themselves and at things so long that they have come to esteem the religious , learned and civil institutions as guards of property , and they <unk> assaults on these , because they feel them to be assaults on property .
they measure their esteem of each other by what each has , and not by what each is .
but a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property , out of new respect for his nature .
especially he hates what he has if he see that it is accidental ,  came to him by inheritance , or gift , or crime ; then he feels that it is not having ; it does not belong to him , has no root in him and merely lies there because no revolution or no robber takes it away .
but that which a man is , does always by necessity acquire , and what the man acquires is living property , which does not wait the beck of rulers , or mobs , or revolutions , or fire , or storm , or <unk> , but perpetually <unk> itself wherever the man breathes .
" thy lot or portion of life , " said the <unk> <name> , " is seeking after thee ; therefore be at rest from seeking after it . "
our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our <unk> respect for <name> .
the political parties meet in numerous conventions ; the greater the concourse and with each new uproar of announcement , the delegation from essex !
the democrats from new hampshire !
the <unk> of maine !
the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms .
in like manner the reformers summon conventions and vote and resolve in multitude .
not so , o friends !
<name> the god deign to enter and inhabit you , but by a method precisely the reverse .
it is only as a man puts off all foreign support and stands alone that i see him to be strong and to prevail .
he is weaker by every recruit to his banner .
is not a man better than a town ?
ask nothing of men , and , in the endless <unk> , thou only firm column must presently appear the <unk> of all that surrounds thee .
he who knows that power is inborn , that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere , and so perceiving , throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought , instantly rights himself , stands in the erect position , commands his limbs , works miracles ; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head .
so use all that is called fortune .
most men gamble with her , and gain all , and lose all , as her wheel rolls .
but do thou leave as unlawful these <unk> , and deal with cause and effect , the <unk> of god .
in the <name> work and acquire , and thou hast chained the wheel of chance , and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her <unk> .
a political victory , a rise of rents , the recovery of your sick or the return of your absent friend , or some other favorable event raises your spirits , and you think good days are preparing for you .
do not believe it .
nothing can bring you peace but yourself .
nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles .
***** compensation .
the wings of time are black and white , pied with morning and with night .
mountain tall and ocean deep trembling balance duly keep .
in changing moon , in tidal wave , glows the feud of want and have .
gauge of more and less through space electric <name> and pencil plays .
the lonely earth amid the balls that hurry through the eternal halls , a <unk> flying to the void , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> spark , shoots across the neutral dark .
man 's the elm , and wealth the vine , stanch and strong the tendrils twine : though the frail ringlets thee deceive , none from its stock that vine can <unk> .
fear not , then , thou child infirm , there 's no god dare wrong a worm .
<name> crowns cleave to deserts and power to him who power exerts ; hast not thy share ?
on winged feet , lo !
it rushes thee to meet ; and all that nature made thy own , floating in air or pent in stone , <name> rive the hills and swim the sea and , like thy shadow , follow thee .
iii .
compensation .
ever since i was a boy i have wished to write a discourse on compensation ; for it seemed to me when very young that on this subject life was ahead of theology and the people knew more than the preachers taught .
the documents too from which the doctrine is to be drawn , charmed my fancy by their endless variety , and lay always before me , even in sleep ; for they are the tools in our hands , the bread in our basket , the transactions of the street , the farm and the <unk> ; greetings , relations , debts and <unk> , the influence of character , the nature and endowment of all men .
it seemed to me also that in it might be shown men a <name> of divinity , the present action of the soul of this world , clean from all vestige of tradition ; and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love , conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be , because it really is now .
it appeared moreover that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us , it would be a <name> in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey , that would not suffer us to lose our way .
i was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church .
the preacher , a man esteemed for his orthodoxy , unfolded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the last judgment .
he assumed that judgment is not executed in this world ; that the wicked are successful ; that the good are miserable ; and then urged from reason and from scripture a compensation to be made to both parties in the next life .
no offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine .
as far as i could observe when the meeting broke up they separated without remark on the sermon .
yet what was the import of this teaching ?
what did the preacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in the present life ?
was it that houses and lands , offices , wine , horses , dress , luxury , are had by unprincipled men , whilst the saints are poor and despised ; and that a compensation is to be made to these last hereafter , by giving them the like <unk> another day ,  <unk> and <unk> , venison and champagne ?
this must be the compensation intended ; for what else ?
is it that they are to have leave to pray and praise ?
to love and serve men ?
why , that they can do now .
the legitimate inference the disciple would draw was ,  'we are to have such a good time as the sinners have now ' ;  or , to push it to its extreme import ,  'you sin now ; we shall sin by and by ; we would sin now , if we could ; not being successful , we expect our revenge to-morrow . '
the fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful ; that justice is not done now .
the blindness of the preacher consisted in <unk> to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly success , instead of confronting and <unk> the world from the truth ; announcing the presence of the soul ; the <unk> of the <name> ; and so establishing the standard of good and ill , of success and falsehood .
i find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day and the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they treat the related topics .
i think that our popular theology has gained in decorum , and not in principle , over the superstitions it has displaced .
but men are better than their theology .
their daily life gives it the lie .
every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experience , and all men feel sometimes the falsehood which they can not demonstrate .
for men are wiser than they know .
that which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought , if said in conversation would probably be questioned in silence .
if a man <unk> in a mixed company on providence and the divine laws , he is answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer , but his incapacity to make his own statement .
i shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts that indicate the path of the law of compensation ; happy beyond my expectation if i shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle .
polarity , or action and reaction , we meet in every part of nature ; in darkness and light ; in heat and cold ; in the ebb and flow of waters ; in male and female ; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and animals ; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the animal body ; in the <unk> and <unk> of the heart ; in the undulations of fluids , and of sound ; in the centrifugal and centripetal gravity ; in electricity , <unk> , and chemical affinity .
<unk> magnetism at one end of a needle , the opposite magnetism takes place at the other end .
if the south attracts , the north <unk> .
to empty here , you must condense there .
an inevitable <unk> <unk> nature , so that each thing is a half , and suggests another thing to make it whole ; as , spirit , matter ; man , woman ; odd , even ; <unk> , objective ; in , out ; upper , under ; motion , rest ; yea , nay .
whilst the world is thus <unk> , so is every one of its parts .
the entire system of things gets represented in every particle .
there is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea , day and night , man and woman , in a single needle of the pine , in a kernel of corn , in each individual of every animal tribe .
the reaction , so grand in the elements , is repeated within these small boundaries .
for example , in the animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures are favorites , but a certain compensation balances every gift and every defect .
a <unk> given to one part is paid out of a reduction from another part of the same creature .
if the head and neck are enlarged , the trunk and extremities are cut short .
the theory of the mechanic forces is another example .
what we gain in power is lost in time , and the converse .
the <unk> or compensating errors of the planets is another instance .
the influences of climate and soil in political history are another .
the cold climate <unk> .
the barren soil does not breed fevers , crocodiles , tigers or scorpions .
the same <unk> <unk> the nature and condition of man .
every excess causes a defect ; every defect an excess .
every sweet hath its sour ; every evil its good .
every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse .
it is to answer for its moderation with its life .
for every grain of wit there is a grain of folly .
for every thing you have missed , you have gained something else ; and for every thing you gain , you lose something .
if riches increase , they are increased that use them .
if the <unk> gathers too much , nature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest ; swells the estate , but kills the owner .
nature hates <unk> and exceptions .
the waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing than the varieties of condition tend to <unk> themselves .
there is always some <unk> circumstance that puts down the overbearing , the strong , the <name> , the fortunate , substantially on the same ground with all others .
is a man too strong and fierce for society and by temper and position a bad citizen ,  a morose ruffian , with a dash of the pirate in him ?  nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters who are getting along in the dame 's classes at the village school , and love and fear for them <unk> his grim scowl to courtesy .
thus she <unk> to <unk> the granite and <unk> , takes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps her balance true .
the farmer imagines power and place are fine things .
but the president has paid dear for his white house .
it has commonly cost him all his peace , and the best of his manly attributes .
to preserve for a short time so conspicuous an appearance before the world , he is content to eat dust before the real masters who stand erect behind the throne .
or , do men <name> the more substantial and permanent grandeur of genius ?
neither has this an immunity .
he who by force of <name> or of thought is great and overlooks thousands , has the charges of that eminence .
with every influx of light comes new danger .
has he light ?
he must bear witness to the light , and always outrun that sympathy which gives him such keen satisfaction , by his fidelity to new revelations of the incessant soul .
he must hate father and mother , wife and child .
has he all that the world loves and admires and <unk> ?  he must cast behind him their admiration , and afflict them by faithfulness to his truth , and become a <unk> and a hissing .
this law writes the laws of cities and nations .
it is in vain to build or plot or combine against it .
things refuse to be <unk> long .
res <unk> <unk> male <unk> .
though no checks to a new evil appear , the checks exist , and <name> appear .
if the government is cruel , the governor 's life is not safe .
if you tax too high , the revenue <name> yield nothing .
if you make the criminal code sanguinary , <unk> <name> not convict .
if the law is too mild , private vengeance comes in .
if the government is a terrific democracy , the pressure is resisted by an <unk> of energy in the citizen , and life glows with a fiercer flame .
the true life and <unk> of man seem to elude the utmost <unk> or <unk> of condition and to establish themselves with great <unk> under all varieties of circumstances .
under all governments the influence of character remains the same ,  in turkey and in new england about alike .
under the primeval despots of egypt , history honestly confesses that man must have been as free as culture could make him .
these appearances indicate the fact that the universe is represented in every one of its particles .
every thing in nature contains all the powers of nature .
every thing is made of one hidden stuff ; as the naturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis , and regards a horse as a running man , a fish as a swimming man , a bird as a flying man , a tree as a rooted man .
each new form repeats not only the main character of the type , but part for part all the details , all the aims , <unk> , <unk> , energies and whole system of every other .
every occupation , trade , <name> , transaction , is a <unk> of the world and a <unk> of every other .
each one is an entire emblem of human life ; of its good and ill , its trials , its enemies , its course and its end .
and each one must somehow accommodate the whole man and recite all his <name> .
the world globes itself in a drop of dew .
the microscope can not find the <unk> which is less perfect for being little .
eyes , ears , taste , smell , motion , resistance , appetite , and organs of reproduction that take hold on eternity ,  all find room to consist in the small creature .
so do we put our life into every act .
the true doctrine of omnipresence is that god reappears with all his parts in every moss and cobweb .
the value of the universe <unk> to throw itself into every point .
if the good is there , so is the evil ; if the affinity , so the repulsion ; if the force , so the limitation .
thus is the universe alive .
all things are moral .
that soul which within us is a sentiment , outside of us is a law .
we feel its inspiration ; out there in history we can see its fatal strength .
" it is in the world , and the world was made by it . "
justice is not postponed .
a perfect <unk> <unk> its balance in all parts of life .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,  the dice of god are always loaded .
the world looks like a <unk> , or a mathematical equation , which , turn it how you <name> , balances itself .
take what figure you <name> , its exact value , nor more nor less , still returns to you .
every secret is told , every crime is punished , every virtue rewarded , every wrong <unk> , in silence and certainty .
what we call retribution is the universal necessity by which the whole appears wherever a part appears .
if you see smoke , there must be fire .
if you see a hand or a limb , you know that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind .
every act rewards itself , or , in other words <unk> itself , in a twofold manner ; first in the thing , or in real nature ; and secondly in the circumstance , or in apparent nature .
men call the circumstance the retribution .
the <unk> retribution is in the thing and is seen by the soul .
the retribution in the circumstance is seen by the understanding ; it is inseparable from the thing , but is often spread over a long time and so does not become distinct until after many years .
the specific stripes may follow late after the offence , but they follow because they accompany it .
crime and punishment grow out of one stem .
punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which concealed it .
cause and effect , means and ends , seed and fruit , can not be severed ; for the effect already blooms in the cause , the end <unk> in the means , the fruit in the seed .
whilst thus the world <name> be whole and refuses to be <unk> , we seek to act partially , to <unk> , to appropriate ; for example ,  to gratify the senses we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs of the character .
the ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the solution of one problem ,  how to detach the sensual sweet , the sensual strong , the sensual bright , etc. , from the moral sweet , the moral deep , the moral fair ; that is , again , to contrive to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as to leave it bottomless ; to get a one end , without an other end .
the soul says , <unk> ; ' the body would feast .
the soul says , 'the man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul ; ' the body would join the flesh only .
the soul says , 'have dominion over all things to the ends of virtue ; ' the body would have the power over things to its own ends .
the soul strives <unk> to live and work through all things .
it would be the only fact .
all things shall be added unto it ,  power , pleasure , knowledge , beauty .
the particular man aims to be somebody ; to set up for himself ; to truck and <unk> for a private good ; and , in particulars , to ride that he may ride ; to dress that he may be dressed ; to eat that he may eat ; and to govern , that he may be seen .
men seek to be great ; they would have offices , wealth , power , and fame .
they think that to be great is to possess one side of nature ,  the sweet , without the other side , the bitter .
this dividing and <unk> is steadily counteracted .
up to this day it must be owned no <unk> has had the smallest success .
the parted water <unk> behind our hand .
pleasure is taken out of pleasant things , profit out of profitable things , power out of strong things , as soon as we seek to separate them from the whole .
we can no more <unk> things and get the sensual good , by itself , than we can get an inside that shall have no outside , or a light without a shadow .
" drive out nature with a fork , she comes running back . "
life <unk> itself with inevitable conditions , which the unwise seek to dodge , which one and another <unk> that he does not know , that they do not touch him ;  but the brag is on his lips , the conditions are in his soul .
if he escapes them in one part they attack him in another more vital part .
if he has escaped them in form and in the appearance , it is because he has resisted his life and fled from himself , and the retribution is so much death .
so signal is the failure of all attempts to make this separation of the good from the tax , that the experiment would not be tried ,  since to try it is to be mad ,  but for the circumstance , that when the disease began in the <name> , of rebellion and separation , the intellect is at once infected , so that the man ceases to see god whole in each object , but is able to see the sensual <unk> of an object and not see the sensual hurt ; he sees the mermaid 's head but not the dragon 's tail , and thinks he can cut off that which he would have from that which he would not have .
" how secret <name> thou who <unk> in the highest heavens in silence , o thou only great god , sprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal <unk> upon such as have unbridled desires ! "
{ 1 } 1 st. <name> , confessions , b. i .
the human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable , of history , of law , of proverbs , of conversation .
it finds a tongue in literature unawares .
thus the greeks called jupiter , supreme mind ; but having <unk> ascribed to him many base actions , they involuntarily made amends to reason by tying up the hands of so bad a god .
he is made as helpless as a king of england .
prometheus knows one secret which jove must bargain for ; <name> , another .
he can not get his own thunders ; <name> keeps the key of them :  " of all the gods , i only know the keys that <unk> the solid doors within whose vaults his thunders sleep . "
a plain confession of the <unk> of the all and of its moral aim .
the indian mythology ends in the same ethics ; and it would seem impossible for any fable to be invented and get any currency which was not moral .
<name> forgot to ask youth for her lover , and though <unk> is immortal , he is old .
achilles is not quite invulnerable ; the sacred waters did not wash the heel by which <unk> held him .
<unk> , in the <unk> , is not quite immortal , for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was bathing in the dragon 's blood , and that spot which it covered is mortal .
and so it must be .
there is a crack in every thing god has made .
it would seem there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares even into the wild <unk> in which the human fancy attempted to make bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old laws ,  this <unk> , this kick of the gun , <unk> that the law is fatal ; that in nature nothing can be given , all things are sold .
this is that ancient doctrine of <unk> , who keeps watch in the universe and lets no offence go <unk> .
the furies they said are attendants on justice , and if the sun in heaven should <unk> his path they would punish him .
the poets related that stone walls and iron swords and leathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of their owners ; that the belt which ajax gave <name> dragged the trojan hero over the field at the wheels of the car of achilles , and the sword which <name> gave ajax was that on whose point ajax fell .
they recorded that when the <unk> erected a statue to <unk> , a <name> in the games , one of his rivals went to it by night and endeavored to throw it down by repeated blows , until at last he moved it from its pedestal and was crushed to death beneath its fall .
this voice of fable has in it somewhat divine .
it came from thought above the <name> of the writer .
that is the best part of each writer which has nothing private in it ; that which he does not know ; that which flowed out of his constitution and not from his too active invention ; that which in the study of a single artist you might not easily find , but in the study of many you would abstract as the spirit of them all .
phidias it is not , but the work of man in that early <unk> world that i would know .
the name and circumstance of phidias , however convenient for history , embarrass when we come to the highest criticism .
we are to see that which man was tending to do in a given period , and was hindered , or , if you <name> , modified in doing , by the interfering <unk> of phidias , of <name> , of shakspeare , the organ whereby man at the moment wrought .
still more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs of all nations , which are always the literature of reason , or the statements of an absolute truth without qualification .
proverbs , like the sacred books of each nation , are the sanctuary of the intuitions .
that which the droning world , chained to appearances , <name> not allow the <unk> to say in his own words , it <name> suffer him to say in proverbs without contradiction .
and this law of laws , which the pulpit , the senate and the college deny , is hourly preached in all markets and workshops by flights of proverbs , whose teaching is as true and as <unk> as that of birds and flies .
all things are double , one against <unk>  <unk> for tat ; an eye for an eye ; a tooth for a tooth ; blood for blood ; measure for measure ; love for <unk>  give and it shall be given <unk>  he that <unk> shall be watered <unk>  what <name> you have ?
quoth god ; pay for it and take it.  nothing venture , nothing <unk>  thou shalt be paid exactly for what thou hast done , no more , no <unk>  who doth not work shall not <unk>  harm watch , harm <unk>  curses always recoil on the head of him who <unk> them.  if you put a chain around the neck of a slave , the other end <unk> itself around your <unk>  bad counsel <unk> the <unk>  the devil is an ass .
it is thus written , because it is thus in life .
our action is <unk> and characterized above our <name> by the law of nature .
we aim at a petty end quite aside from the public good , but our act arranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of the world .
a man can not speak but he judges himself .
with his <name> or against his <name> he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every word .
every opinion reacts on him who utters it .
it is a <unk> thrown at a <name> , but the other end remains in the <unk> 's bag .
or rather it is a harpoon hurled at the whale , <unk> , as it flies , a coil of cord in the boat , and , if the harpoon is not good , or not well thrown , it <name> go nigh to cut the steersman in twain or to sink the boat .
you can not do wrong without suffering wrong .
" no man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him , " said burke .
the exclusive in fashionable life does not see that he <unk> himself from enjoyment , in the attempt to appropriate it .
the <unk> in religion does not see that he shuts the door of heaven on himself , in striving to shut out others .
treat men as <unk> and <unk> and you shall suffer as well as they .
if you leave out their heart , you shall lose your own .
the senses would make things of all persons ; of women , of children , of the poor .
the vulgar proverb , " i <name> get it from his purse or get it from his skin , " is sound philosophy .
all <unk> of love and <unk> in our social relations are speedily punished .
they are punished by fear .
whilst i stand in simple relations to my <unk> , i have no displeasure in meeting him .
we meet as water meets water , or as two currents of air mix , with perfect diffusion and <unk> of nature .
but as soon as there is any departure from simplicity , and attempt at <unk> , or good for me that is not good for him , my neighbor feels the wrong ; he shrinks from me as far as i have shrunk from him ; his eyes no longer seek mine ; there is war between us ; there is hate in him and fear in me .
all the old abuses in society , universal and particular , all unjust accumulations of property and power , are avenged in the same manner .
fear is an instructor of great sagacity and the herald of all revolutions .
one thing he teaches , that there is <unk> where he appears .
he is a carrion crow , and though you see not well what he hovers for , there is death somewhere .
our property is timid , our laws are timid , our cultivated classes are timid .
fear for ages has <unk> and <unk> and <unk> over government and property .
that obscene bird is not there for nothing .
he indicates great wrongs which must be revised .
of the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly follows the suspension of our voluntary activity .
the terror of cloudless noon , the <name> of polycrates , the awe of prosperity , the instinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of a <name> <unk> and <unk> virtue , are the <unk> of the balance of justice through the heart and mind of man .
experienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay <name> and lot as they go along , and that a man often pays dear for a small <unk> .
the <unk> runs in his own debt .
has a man gained any thing who has received a hundred favors and rendered none ?
has he gained by borrowing , through indolence or cunning , his neighbor 's wares , or horses , or money ?
there arises on the deed the instant acknowledgment of benefit on the one part and of debt on the other ; that is , of superiority and inferiority .
the transaction remains in the memory of himself and his neighbor ; and every new transaction alters according to its nature their relation to each other .
he may soon come to see that he had better have broken his own bones than to have ridden in his neighbor 's coach , and that " the highest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it . "
a wise man <name> extend this lesson to all parts of life , and know that it is the part of <name> to face every claimant and pay every just demand on your time , your talents , or your heart .
always pay ; for first or last you must pay your entire debt .
persons and events may stand for a time between you and justice , but it is only a postponement .
you must pay at last your own debt .
if you are wise you <name> dread a prosperity which only loads you with more .
benefit is the end of nature .
but for every benefit which you receive , a tax is levied .
he is great who <unk> the most benefits .
he is base ,  and that is the one base thing in the universe ,  to receive favors and render none .
in the order of nature we can not render benefits to those from whom we receive them , or only seldom .
but the benefit we receive must be rendered again , line for line , deed for deed , cent for cent , to somebody .
beware of too much good staying in your hand .
it <name> fast corrupt and worm worms .
pay it away quickly in some sort .
labor is watched over by the same pitiless laws .
cheapest , say the prudent , is the dearest labor .
what we buy in a broom , a mat , a wagon , a knife , is some application of good sense to a common want .
it is best to pay in your land a skilful gardener , or to buy good sense applied to gardening ; in your sailor , good sense applied to navigation ; in the house , good sense applied to cooking , sewing , serving ; in your agent , good sense applied to accounts and affairs .
so do you multiply your presence , or spread yourself throughout your estate .
but because of the <unk> constitution of things , in labor as in life there can be no cheating .
the thief steals from himself .
the swindler <unk> himself .
for the real price of labor is knowledge and virtue , whereof wealth and credit are signs .
these signs , like paper money , may be <unk> or stolen , but that which they represent , namely , knowledge and virtue , can not be <unk> or stolen .
these ends of labor can not be answered but by real exertions of the mind , and in obedience to pure motives .
the cheat , the defaulter , the gambler , can not extort the knowledge of material and moral nature which his honest care and pains yield to the <unk> .
the law of nature is , do the thing , and you shall have the power ; but they who do not the thing have not the power .
human labor , through all its forms , from the sharpening of a stake to the construction of a city or an epic , is one immense illustration of the perfect compensation of the universe .
the absolute balance of give and take , the doctrine that every thing has its price ,  and if that price is not paid , not that thing but something else is obtained , and that it is impossible to get any thing without its price ,  is not less sublime in the columns of a <unk> than in the <unk> of states , in the laws of light and darkness , in all the action and reaction of nature .
i can not doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those processes with which he is conversant , the stern ethics which <name> on his <unk> , which are measured out by his plumb and <unk> , which stand as manifest in the footing of the <unk> as in the history of a state ,  do recommend to him his trade , and though seldom named , exalt his business to his imagination .
the league between virtue and nature engages all things to assume a hostile front to vice .
the beautiful laws and substances of the world persecute and whip the traitor .
he finds that things are arranged for truth and benefit , but there is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue .
commit a crime , and the earth is made of glass .
commit a crime , and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground , such as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and mole .
you can not recall the spoken word , you can not wipe out the <unk> , you can not draw up the ladder , so as to leave no inlet or clew .
some damning circumstance always <unk> .
the laws and substances of nature ,  water , snow , wind , gravitation ,  become penalties to the thief .
on the other hand the law holds with equal <unk> for all right action .
love , and you shall be loved .
all love is mathematically just , as much as the two sides of an <unk> equation .
the good man has absolute good , which like fire turns every thing to its own nature , so that you can not do him any harm ; but as the <name> armies sent against <name> , when he approached cast down their colors and from enemies became friends , so disasters of all kinds , as sickness , offence , poverty , prove benefactors :  " winds blow and waters roll strength to the brave , and power and deity , yet in themselves are nothing . "
the good are befriended even by weakness and defect .
as no man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him , so no man had ever a defect that was not somewhere made useful to him .
the stag in the fable admired his horns and blamed his feet , but when the <name> came , his feet saved him , and afterwards , caught in the thicket , his horns destroyed him .
every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults .
as no man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it , so no man has a thorough acquaintance with the <unk> or talents of men until he has suffered from the one and seen the triumph of the other over his own want of the same .
has he a defect of temper that <unk> him to live in society ?
thereby he is driven to entertain himself alone and acquire habits of <unk> ; and thus , like the wounded oyster , he <unk> his shell with <name> .
our strength grows out of our weakness .
the indignation which arms itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed .
a great man is always willing to be little .
whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages , he goes to sleep .
when he is pushed , tormented , defeated , he has a chance to learn something ; he has been put on his wits , on his manhood ; he has gained facts ; learns his ignorance ; is cured of the insanity of conceit ; has got moderation and real skill .
the wise man throws himself on the side of his assailants .
it is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point .
the wound <unk> and falls off from him like a dead skin and when they would triumph , lo !
he has passed on invulnerable .
blame is safer than praise .
i hate to be defended in a newspaper .
as long as all that is said is said against me , i feel a certain assurance of success .
but as soon as <unk> words of praise are spoken for me i feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies .
in general , every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor .
as the sandwich <unk> believes that the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself , so we gain the strength of the temptation we resist .
the same guards which protect us from disaster , defect , and enmity , defend us , if we <name> , from selfishness and fraud .
bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions , nor is shrewdness in trade a <name> of wisdom .
men suffer all their life long under the foolish superstition that they can be cheated .
but it is as impossible for a man to be cheated by any one but himself , as for a thing to be and not to be at the same time .
there is a third silent party to all our bargains .
the nature and soul of things takes on itself the <unk> of the fulfilment of every contract , so that honest service can not come to loss .
if you serve an ungrateful master , serve him the more .
put god in your debt .
every stroke shall be repaid .
the longer the payment is <unk> , the better for you ; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this <unk> .
the history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature , to make water run up hill , to twist a rope of sand .
it makes no difference whether the actors be many or one , a tyrant or a mob .
a mob is a society of bodies voluntarily <unk> themselves of reason and traversing its work .
the mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast .
its fit hour of activity is night .
its actions are insane like its whole constitution .
it <unk> a principle ; it would whip a right ; it would tar and feather justice , by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these .
it resembles the prank of boys , who run with <unk> to put out the ruddy <name> streaming to the stars .
the <unk> spirit turns their spite against the <unk> .
the martyr can not be <unk> .
every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame ; every prison , a more illustrious abode ; every burned book or house <unk> the world ; every suppressed or <unk> word <unk> through the earth from side to side .
hours of sanity and consideration are always arriving to communities , as to individuals , when the truth is seen and the martyrs are justified .
thus do all things preach the <unk> of circumstances .
the man is all .
every thing has two sides , a good and an evil .
every advantage has its tax .
i learn to be content .
but the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of <unk> .
the thoughtless say , on hearing these representations ,  what boots it to do well ?
there is one event to good and evil ; if i gain any good i must pay for it ; if i lose any good i gain some other ; all actions are indifferent .
there is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation , to wit , its own nature .
the soul is not a compensation , but a life .
the soul is .
under all this running sea of circumstance , whose waters ebb and flow with perfect balance , lies the aboriginal abyss of real being .
essence , or god , is not a relation or a part , but the whole .
being is the vast affirmative , excluding negation , <unk> , and swallowing up all relations , parts and times within itself .
nature , truth , virtue , are the influx from thence .
vice is the absence or departure of the same .
nothing , falsehood , may indeed stand as the great night or shade on which as a background the living universe paints itself forth , but no fact is <unk> by it ; it can not work , for it is not .
it can not work any good ; it can not work any harm .
it is harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be .
we feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts , because the criminal adheres to his vice and <unk> and does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature .
there is no stunning <unk> of his nonsense before men and angels .
has he therefore outwitted the law ?
inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie with him he so far <unk> from nature .
in some manner there <name> be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also ; but , should we not see it , this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account .
neither can it be said , on the other hand , that the gain of <unk> must be bought by any loss .
there is no penalty to virtue ; no penalty to wisdom ; they are proper additions of being .
in a virtuous action i properly am ; in a virtuous act i add to the world ; i plant into deserts conquered from chaos and nothing and see the darkness receding on the limits of the horizon .
there can be no excess to love , none to knowledge , none to beauty , when these attributes are considered in the purest sense .
the soul refuses limits , and always affirms an optimism , never a <unk> .
his life is a progress , and not a station .
his instinct is trust .
our instinct uses " more " and " less " in application to man , of the presence of the soul , and not of its absence , the brave man is greater than the coward ; the true , the benevolent , the wise , is more a man and not less , than the fool and knave .
there is no tax on the good of virtue , for that is the incoming of god himself , or absolute existence , without any comparative .
material good has its tax , and if it came without desert or sweat , has no root in me , and the next wind <name> blow it away .
but all the good of nature is the soul 's , and may be had if paid for in <unk> lawful coin , that is , by labor which the heart and the head allow .
i no longer wish to meet a good i do not earn , for example to find a pot of buried gold , knowing that it brings with it new burdens .
i do not wish more external goods ,  neither possessions , nor honors , nor powers , nor persons .
the gain is apparent ; the tax is certain .
but there is no tax on the knowledge that the compensation exists and that it is not desirable to dig up treasure .
herein i rejoice with a serene eternal peace .
i contract the boundaries of possible mischief .
i learn the wisdom of st. <name> ,  " nothing can work me damage except myself ; the harm that i sustain i <name> about with me , and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault . "
in the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of condition .
the radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of more and less .
how can less not feel the pain ; how not feel indignation or <unk> towards more ?
look at those who have less faculty , and one feels sad and knows not well what to make of it .
he almost shuns their eye ; he fears they <name> upbraid god .
what should they do ?
it seems a great injustice .
but see the facts nearly and these mountainous inequalities vanish .
love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in the sea .
the heart and soul of all men being one , this bitterness of his and mine ceases .
his is mine .
i am my brother and my brother is me .
if i feel overshadowed and outdone by great neighbors , i can yet love ; i can still receive ; and he that <unk> maketh his own the grandeur he loves .
thereby i make the discovery that my brother is my guardian , acting for me with the <unk> designs , and the estate i so admired and envied is my own .
it is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things .
<name> and shakspeare are fragments of the soul , and by love i conquer and <unk> them in my own conscious domain .
his virtue ,  is not that mine ?
his wit ,  if it can not be made mine , it is not wit .
such also is the natural history of calamity .
the changes which break up at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements of a nature whose law is growth .
every soul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting its whole system of things , its friends and home and laws and <name> , as the <unk> crawls out of its beautiful but stony case , because it no longer admits of its growth , and slowly forms a new house .
in proportion to the vigor of the individual these revolutions are frequent , until in some happier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations <name> very loosely about him , becoming as it were a transparent fluid membrane through which the living form is seen , and not , as in most men , an indurated heterogeneous fabric of many dates and of no settled character , in which the man is imprisoned .
then there can be enlargement , and the man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday .
and such should be the outward biography of man in time , a putting off of dead circumstances day by day , as he <unk> his raiment day by day .
but to us , in our lapsed estate , resting , not advancing , resisting , not <unk> with the divine expansion , this growth comes by shocks .
we can not part with our friends .
we can not let our angels go .
we do not see that they only go out that archangels may come in .
we are <unk> of the old .
we do not believe in the riches of the soul , in its proper eternity and omnipresence .
we do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or <unk> that beautiful yesterday .
we linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs , nor believe that the spirit can feed , cover , and nerve us again .
we can not again find aught so dear , so sweet , so graceful .
but we sit and weep in vain .
the voice of the almighty saith , 'up and onward for evermore ! '
we can not stay amid the ruins .
neither <name> we rely on the new ; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes , like those monsters who look backwards .
and yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also , after long intervals of time .
a fever , a mutilation , a cruel disappointment , a loss of wealth , a loss of friends , seems at the moment unpaid loss , and <unk> .
but the sure years reveal the deep <unk> force that <unk> all facts .
the death of a dear friend , wife , brother , lover , which seemed nothing but privation , somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius ; for it commonly <unk> revolutions in our way of life , terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed , breaks up a wonted occupation , or a household , or style of living , and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character .
it permits or <unk> the formation of new acquaintances and the reception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the next years ; and the man or woman who would have remained a <name> <unk> , with no room for its roots and too much <name> for its head , by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is made the <unk> of the forest , yielding shade and fruit to wide <unk> of men .
***** spiritual laws .
the living heaven thy prayers respect , house at once and architect , <unk> man 's rejected hours , builds therewith eternal towers ; sole and <unk> works , fears not undermining days , grows by <unk> , and , by the famous might that <unk> in reaction and recoil , makes flame to freeze , and ice to boil ; forging , through <unk> arms of offence , the silver seat of innocence .
iv .
spiritual laws .
when the act of reflection takes place in the mind , when we look at ourselves in the light of thought , we discover that our life is <unk> in beauty .
behind us , as we go , all things assume pleasing forms , as clouds do far off .
not only things familiar and stale , but even the tragic and terrible are comely as they take their place in the pictures of memory .
the river-bank , the weed at the water-side , the old house , the foolish person , however neglected in the passing , have a <name> in the past .
even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has added a solemn ornament to the house .
the soul <name> not know either deformity or pain .
if in the hours of clear reason we should speak the severest truth , we should say that we had never made a sacrifice .
in these hours the mind seems so great that nothing can be taken from us that seems much .
all loss , all pain , is particular ; the universe remains to the heart unhurt .
neither vexations nor calamities abate our trust .
no man ever stated his griefs as lightly as he might .
allow for exaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack that ever was driven .
for it is only the finite that has wrought and suffered ; the infinite lies stretched in smiling repose .
the intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if man <name> live the life of nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his .
no man need be perplexed in his speculations .
let him do and say what strictly belongs to him , and though very ignorant of books , his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts .
our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin , origin of evil , <unk> and the like .
these never presented a practical difficulty to any man ,  never darkened across any man 's road who did not go out of his way to seek them .
these are the soul 's mumps and measles and <unk> , and those who have not caught them can not describe their health or <unk> the cure .
a simple mind <name> not know these enemies .
it is quite another thing that he should be able to give account of his <name> and <unk> to another the theory of his <unk> and freedom .
this requires rare gifts .
yet without this <unk> there may be a sylvan strength and integrity in that which he is .
" a few strong instincts and a few plain rules " suffice us .
my <name> never gave the images in my mind the rank they now take .
the regular course of studies , the years of <unk> and professional education have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under the bench at the latin school .
what we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so .
we form no guess , at the time of receiving a thought , of its comparative value .
and education often wastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism , which is sure to select what belongs to it .
in like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any interference of our <name> .
people represent virtue as a struggle , and take to themselves great airs upon their attainments , and the question is everywhere vexed when a <name> nature is commended , whether the man is not better who strives with temptation .
but there is no merit in the matter .
either god is there or he is not there .
we love characters in proportion as they are impulsive and spontaneous .
the less a man thinks or knows about his virtues the better we like him .
<unk> 's victories are the best victories , which ran and flowed like <name> 's verses , plutarch said .
when we see a soul whose acts are all regal , graceful and pleasant as roses , we must thank god that such things can be and are , and not turn sourly on the <name> and say <unk> is a better man with his grunting resistance to all his native devils . '
not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over <name> in all practical life .
there is less intention in history than we <unk> to it .
we <unk> <unk> <unk> plans to caesar and <name> ; but the best of their power was in nature , not in them .
men of an extraordinary success , in their honest moments , have always <name> , 'not unto us , not unto us . '
according to the <name> of their times they have built altars to fortune , or to <name> , or to st. <name> .
their success lay in their parallelism to the course of thought , which found in them an unobstructed channel ; and the wonders of which they were the visible conductors seemed to the eye their deed .
did the wires generate the <unk> ?
it is even true that there was less in them on which they could reflect than in another ; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth and hollow .
that which externally seemed <name> and <unk> was willingness and <unk> .
could shakspeare give a theory of shakspeare ?
could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey to others any insight into his methods ?
if he could communicate that secret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value , blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go .
the lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it ; that the world might be a happier place than it is ; that there is no need of struggles , convulsions , and <unk> , of the wringing of the hands and the <unk> of the teeth ; that we <unk> our own evils .
we interfere with the optimism of nature ; for whenever we get this <unk> of the past , or of a wiser mind in the present , we are able to discern that we are <unk> with laws which execute themselves .
the face of external nature teaches the same lesson .
nature <name> not have us fret and fume .
she does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds and wars .
when we come out of the caucus , or the bank , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> club into the fields and woods , she says to us , 'so hot ?
my little sir . '
we are full of mechanical actions .
we must needs <unk> and have things in our own way , until the sacrifices and virtues of society are odious .
love should make <name> ; but our benevolence is unhappy .
our <unk> and churches and <unk> are <unk> to the neck .
we pain ourselves to please nobody .
there are natural ways of arriving at the same ends at which these aim , but do not arrive .
why should all virtue work in one and the same way ?
why should all give dollars ?
it is very inconvenient to us country folk , and we do not think any good <name> come of it .
we have not dollars ; merchants have ; let them give them .
farmers <name> give corn ; poets <name> sing ; women <name> sew ; laborers <name> lend a hand ; the children <name> bring flowers .
and why drag this dead weight of a sunday-school over the whole christendom ?
it is natural and beautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach ; but it is time enough to answer questions when they are asked .
do not shut up the young people against their <name> in a pew and force the children to ask them questions for an hour against their <name> .
if we look wider , things are all alike ; laws and letters and creeds and modes of living seem a <unk> of truth .
our society is encumbered by ponderous machinery , which resembles the endless <unk> which the romans built over hill and <name> and which are superseded by the discovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source .
it is a chinese wall which any nimble tartar can leap over .
it is a standing army , not so good as a peace .
it is a graduated , titled , richly appointed empire , quite superfluous when <unk> are found to answer just as well .
let us draw a lesson from nature , which always works by short ways .
when the fruit is ripe , it falls .
when the fruit is despatched , the leaf falls .
the circuit of the waters is mere falling .
the walking of man and all animals is a falling forward .
all our <name> labor and works of strength , as prying , splitting , digging , rowing and so forth , are done by dint of continual falling , and the globe , earth , moon , comet , sun , <name> , fall for ever and ever .
the simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of a machine .
he who sees moral nature out and out and thoroughly knows how knowledge is acquired and character formed , is a <unk> .
the simplicity of nature is not that which may easily be read , but is inexhaustible .
the last analysis can no wise be made .
we judge of a man 's wisdom by his <name> , knowing that the perception of the <unk> of nature is an immortal youth .
the wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing our rigid names and reputations with our fluid consciousness .
we pass in the world for sects and schools , for erudition and piety , and we are all the time <unk> babes .
one sees very well how <unk> grew up .
every man sees that he is that middle point whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason .
he is old , he is young , he is very wise , he is altogether ignorant .
he hears and feels what you say of the <unk> , and of the <unk> .
there is no permanent wise man except in the <unk> of the <unk> .
we side with the hero , as we read or paint , against the coward and the robber ; but we have been ourselves that coward and robber , and shall be again ,  not in the low circumstance , but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul .
a little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our <name> <unk> events ; that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless ; that only in our easy , simple , spontaneous action are we strong , and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine .
belief and love ,  a believing love <name> relieve us of a vast load of care .
o my brothers , god exists .
there is a soul at the centre of nature and over the <name> of every man , so that none of us can wrong the universe .
it has so infused its strong enchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice , and when we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our sides , or they beat our own breasts .
the whole course of things goes to teach us <name> .
we need only obey .
there is guidance for each of us , and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word .
why need you choose so painfully your place and occupation and associates and modes of action and of entertainment ?
certainly there is a possible right for you that <unk> the need of balance and wilful election .
for you there is a reality , a fit place and congenial duties .
place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which <unk> all whom it floats , and you are without effort impelled to truth , to right and a perfect contentment .
then you put all <unk> in the wrong .
then you are the world , the measure of right , of truth , of beauty .
if we <name> not be <unk> with our miserable <unk> , the work , the society , letters , arts , science , religion of men would go on far better than now , and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world , and still predicted from the bottom of the heart , would organize itself , as do now the rose and the air and the sun .
i say , do not choose ; but that is a figure of speech by which i would distinguish what is commonly called choice among men , and which is a partial act , the choice of the hands , of the eyes , of the appetites , and not a whole act of the man .
but that which i call right or goodness , is the choice of my constitution ; and that which i call heaven , and inwardly aspire after , is the state or circumstance desirable to my constitution ; and the action which i in all my years tend to do , is the work for my faculties .
we must hold a man amenable to reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession .
it is not an excuse any longer for his deeds that they are the custom of his trade .
what business has he with an evil trade ?
has he not a calling in his character ?
each man has his own vocation .
the talent is the call .
there is one direction in which all space is open to him .
he has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion .
he is like a ship in a river ; he runs against obstructions on every side but one , on that side all obstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea .
this talent and this call depend on his organization , or the mode in which the general soul <unk> itself in him .
he inclines to do something which is easy to him and good when it is done , but which no other man can do .
he has no rival .
for the more truly he <unk> his own powers , the more difference <name> his work exhibit from the work of any other .
his ambition is exactly proportioned to his powers .
the height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base .
every man has this call of the power to do somewhat unique , and no man has any other call .
the pretence that he has another call , a summons by name and personal election and outward " signs that <name> him extraordinary , and not in the roll of common men , " is fanaticism , and betrays <unk> to perceive that there is one mind in all the individuals , and no respect of persons therein .
by doing his work he makes the need felt which he can supply , and creates the taste by which he is enjoyed .
by doing his own work he <unk> himself .
it is the vice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment .
somewhere , not only every orator but every man should let out all the length of all the reins ; should find or make a <name> and hearty expression of what force and meaning is in him .
the common experience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to the customary details of that work or trade he falls into , and tends it as a dog turns a spit .
then is he a part of the machine he moves ; the man is lost .
until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full stature and proportion , he does not yet find his vocation .
he must find in that an outlet for his character , so that he may justify his work to their eyes .
if the labor is mean , let him by his thinking and character make it liberal .
whatever he knows and thinks , whatever in his apprehension is worth doing , that let him communicate , or men <name> never know and honor him aright .
foolish , whenever you take the meanness and formality of that thing you do , instead of converting it into the obedient <unk> of your character and aims .
we like only such actions as have already long had the praise of men , and do not perceive that any thing man can do may be divinely done .
we think greatness <unk> or organized in some places or duties , in certain offices or occasions , and do not see that <unk> can extract rapture from a <unk> , and <unk> from a <unk> , and a <unk> lad out of shreds of paper with his scissors , and <unk> out of swine , and the hero out of the pitiful habitation and company in which he was hidden .
what we call obscure condition or vulgar society is that condition and society whose poetry is not yet written , but which you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as any .
in our estimates let us take a lesson from kings .
the parts of hospitality , the connection of families , the impressiveness of death , and a thousand other things , royalty makes its own estimate of , and a <name> mind <name> .
to make habitually a new estimate ,  that is elevation .
what a man does , that he has .
what has he to do with <name> or fear ?
in himself is his might .
let him regard no good as solid but that which is in his nature and which must grow out of him as long as he exists .
the goods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves ; let him scatter them on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite productiveness .
he may have his own .
a man 's genius , the quality that differences him from every other , the susceptibility to one class of influences , the selection of what is fit for him , the rejection of what is unfit , determines for him the character of the universe .
a man is a method , a progressive arrangement ; a selecting principle , gathering his like to him wherever he goes .
he takes only his own out of the multiplicity that sweeps and circles round him .
he is like one of those booms which are set out from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood , or like the <unk> amongst splinters of steel .
those facts , words , persons , which dwell in his memory without his being able to say why , remain because they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet <unk> .
they are symbols of value to him as they can interpret parts of his consciousness which he would vainly seek words for in the conventional images of books and other minds .
what attracts my attention shall have it , as i <name> go to the man who knocks at my door , whilst a thousand persons as worthy go by it , to whom i give no regard .
it is enough that these particulars speak to me .
a few anecdotes , a few traits of character , manners , face , a few incidents , have an emphasis in your memory out of all proportion to their apparent significance if you measure them by the ordinary standards .
they relate to your gift .
let them have their weight , and do not reject them and cast about for illustration and facts more usual in literature .
what your heart thinks great is great .
the soul 's emphasis is always right .
over all things that are agreeable to his nature and genius the man has the highest right .
everywhere he may take what belongs to his spiritual estate , nor can he take any thing else though all doors were open , nor can all the force of men hinder him from taking so much .
it is vain to attempt to keep a secret from one who has a right to know it .
it <name> tell itself .
that mood into which a friend can bring us is his dominion over us .
to the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right .
all the secrets of that state of mind he can compel .
this is a law which statesmen use in practice .
all the terrors of the french republic , which held austria in awe , were unable to command her diplomacy .
but <name> sent to vienna m. de <unk> , one of the old <unk> , with the morals , manners and name of that interest , saying that it was indispensable to send to the old aristocracy of europe men of the same connection , which , in fact , constitutes a sort of <unk> .
m. de <unk> in less than a fortnight penetrated all the secrets of the imperial cabinet .
nothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood .
yet a man may come to find that the strongest of defences and of ties ,  that he has been understood ; and he who has received an opinion may come to find it the most inconvenient of bonds .
if a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal , his pupils <name> become as fully <unk> into that as into any which he <unk> .
if you pour water into a vessel twisted into coils and angles , it is vain to say , i <name> pour it only into this or that ;  it <name> find its level in all .
men feel and act the consequences of your doctrine without being able to show how they follow .
show us an arc of the curve , and a good mathematician <name> find out the whole figure .
we are always reasoning from the seen to the unseen .
hence the perfect intelligence that subsists between wise men of remote ages .
a man can not bury his meanings so deep in his book but time and <unk> men <name> find them .
plato had a secret doctrine , had he ?
what secret can he conceal from the eyes of bacon ?
of montaigne ?
of kant ?
therefore , aristotle said of his works , " they are published and not published . "
no man can learn what he has not preparation for learning , however near to his eyes is the object .
a chemist may tell his most precious secrets to a carpenter , and he shall be never the wiser ,  the secrets he would not utter to a chemist for an estate .
god screens us evermore from premature ideas .
our eyes are holden that we can not see things that stare us in the face , until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened ; then we behold them , and the time when we saw them not is like a dream .
not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees .
the world is very empty , and is indebted to this gilding , exalting soul for all its pride .
" earth fills her lap with splendors " not her own .
the vale of <unk> , <unk> and rome are earth and water , rocks and sky .
there are as good earth and water in a thousand places , yet how <unk> !
people are not the better for the sun and moon , the horizon and the trees ; as it is not observed that the keepers of <name> galleries or the <unk> of painters have any elevation of thought , or that <unk> are wiser men than others .
there are graces in the demeanor of a polished and <name> person which are lost upon the eye of a <unk> .
these are like the stars whose light has not yet reached us .
he may see what he maketh .
our dreams are the sequel of our waking knowledge .
the visions of the night bear some proportion to the visions of the day .
hideous dreams are exaggerations of the sins of the day .
we see our evil affections embodied in bad <unk> .
on the alps the traveller sometimes beholds his own shadow magnified to a giant , so that every gesture of his hand is terrific .
" my children , " said an old man to his boys scared by a figure in the dark entry , " my children , you <name> never see any thing worse than yourselves . "
as in dreams , so in the scarcely less fluid events of the world every man sees himself in colossal , without knowing that it is himself .
the good , compared to the evil which he sees , is as his own good to his own evil .
every quality of his mind is magnified in some one acquaintance , and every emotion of his heart in some one .
he is like a <unk> of trees , which counts five ,  east , west , north , or south ; or an initial , medial , and terminal <unk> .
and why not ?
he <unk> to one person and <unk> another , according to their likeness or <unk> to himself , truly seeking himself in his associates and moreover in his trade and habits and gestures and meats and drinks , and comes at last to be faithfully represented by every view you take of his circumstances .
he may read what he writes .
what can we see or acquire but what we are ?
you have observed a skilful man reading <name> .
well , that author is a thousand books to a thousand persons .
take the book into your two hands and read your eyes out , you <name> never find what i find .
if any ingenious reader would have a monopoly of the wisdom or delight he gets , he is as secure now the book is <unk> , as if it were imprisoned in the <unk> ' tongue .
it is with a good book as it is with good company .
introduce a base person among gentlemen , it is all to no purpose ; he is not their fellow .
every society protects itself .
the company is perfectly safe , and he is not one of them , though his body is in the room .
what avails it to fight with the eternal laws of mind , which adjust the relation of all persons to each other by the mathematical measure of their <unk> and beings ?
<name> is <unk> of <name> ; how high , how aristocratic , how <name> his mien and manners !
to live with him were life indeed , and no purchase is too great ; and heaven and earth are moved to that end .
well , <name> has <name> ; but what now avails how high , how aristocratic , how <name> his mien and manners , if his heart and aims are in the senate , in the theatre and in the billiard-room , and she has no aims , no conversation that can <unk> her graceful lord ?
he shall have his own society .
we can love nothing but nature .
the most wonderful talents , the most <unk> exertions really avail very little with us ; but nearness or likeness of nature ,  how beautiful is the ease of its victory !
persons approach us , famous for their beauty , for their accomplishments , worthy of all wonder for their charms and gifts ; they dedicate their whole skill to the hour and the company ,  with very imperfect result .
to be sure it would be ungrateful in us not to praise them loudly .
then , when all is done , a person of related mind , a brother or sister by nature , comes to us so softly and easily , so nearly and intimately , as if it were the blood in our proper veins , that we feel as if some one was gone , instead of another having come ; we are utterly relieved and refreshed ; it is a sort of joyful solitude .
we foolishly think in our days of sin that we must court friends by compliance to the customs of society , to its dress , its breeding , and its estimates .
but only that soul can be my friend which i encounter on the line of my own march , that soul to which i do not decline and which does not decline to me , but , native of the same celestial latitude , repeats in its own all my experience .
the scholar forgets himself and apes the customs and costumes of the man of the world to deserve the smile of beauty , and follows some giddy girl , not yet taught by religious passion to know the <name> woman with all that is serene , <unk> and beautiful in her soul .
let him be great , and love shall follow him .
nothing is more deeply punished than the neglect of the affinities by which alone society should be formed , and the insane levity of choosing associates by others ' eyes .
he may set his own rate .
it is a maxim worthy of all <unk> that a man may have that allowance he takes .
take the place and attitude which belong to you , and all men acquiesce .
the world must be just .
it leaves every man , with profound unconcern , to set his own rate .
hero or <unk> , it <unk> not in the matter .
it <name> certainly accept your own measure of your doing and being , whether you sneak about and deny your own name , or whether you see your work produced to the concave sphere of the heavens , one with the revolution of the stars .
the same reality pervades all teaching .
the man may teach by doing , and not otherwise .
if he can communicate himself he can teach , but not by words .
he teaches who gives , and he learns who receives .
there is no teaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in which you are ; a <unk> takes place ; he is you and you are he ; then is a teaching , and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he ever quite lose the benefit .
but your propositions run out of one ear as they ran in at the other .
we see it advertised that mr. grand <name> deliver an oration on the fourth of july , and mr. hand before the <unk> association , and we do not go thither , because we know that these gentlemen <name> not communicate their own character and experience to the company .
if we had reason to expect such a confidence we should go through all inconvenience and opposition .
the sick would be carried in <unk> .
but a public oration is an <unk> , a non-committal , an apology , a gag , and not a communication , not a speech , not a man .
a like <unk> <unk> over all intellectual works .
we have yet to learn that the thing uttered in words is not therefore affirmed .
it must affirm itself , or no forms of logic or of oath can give it evidence .
the sentence must also contain its own apology for being spoken .
the effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically <unk> by its depth of thought .
how much water does it draw ?
if it awaken you to think , if it lift you from your feet with the great voice of eloquence , then the effect is to be wide , slow , permanent , over the minds of men ; if the pages instruct you not , they <name> die like flies in the hour .
the way to speak and write what shall not go out of fashion is to speak and write sincerely .
the argument which has not power to reach my own practice , i may well doubt <name> fail to reach yours .
but take <name> 's maxim :  " look in thy heart , and write . "
he that writes to himself writes to an eternal public .
that statement only is fit to be made public which you have come at in attempting to satisfy your own curiosity .
the writer who takes his subject from his ear and not from his heart , should know that he has lost as much as he seems to have gained , and when the empty book has gathered all its praise , and half the people say , 'what poetry !
what genius ! '
it still needs fuel to make fire .
that only profits which is profitable .
life alone can impart life ; and though we should burst we can only be valued as we make ourselves valuable .
there is no luck in literary reputation .
they who make up the final verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy readers of the hour when it appears , but a court as of angels , a public not to be bribed , not to be entreated and not to be overawed , decides upon every man 's title to fame .
only those books come down which deserve to last .
gilt edges , <unk> and morocco , and <unk> to all the libraries <name> not preserve a book in circulation beyond its intrinsic date .
it must go with all walpole 's <name> and <name> authors to its fate .
<unk> , kotzebue , or <unk> may endure for a night , but <name> and <name> stand for ever .
there are not in the world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read and understand plato ,  never enough to pay for an edition of his works ; yet to every generation these come duly down , for the sake of those few persons , as if god brought them in his hand .
" no book , " said bentley , " was ever written down by any but itself . "
the permanence of all books is fixed by no effort , friendly or hostile , but by their own specific gravity , or the intrinsic importance of their contents to the constant mind of man .
" do not trouble yourself too much about the light on your statue , " said <name> <name> to the young sculptor ; " the light of the public square <name> test its value . "
in like manner the effect of every action is measured by the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds .
the great man knew not that he was great .
it took a century or two for that fact to appear .
what he did , he did because he must ; it was the most natural thing in the world , and grew out of the circumstances of the moment .
but now , every thing he did , even to the lifting of his finger or the eating of bread , looks large , <unk> , and is called an institution .
these are the demonstrations in a few particulars of the genius of nature ; they show the direction of the stream .
but the stream is blood ; every drop is alive .
truth has not single victories ; all things are its organs ,  not only dust and stones , but errors and lies .
the laws of disease , physicians say , are as beautiful as the laws of health .
our philosophy is affirmative and readily accepts the testimony of negative facts , as every shadow points to the sun .
by a divine necessity every fact in nature is constrained to offer its testimony .
human character evermore <unk> itself .
the most fugitive deed and word , the mere air of doing a thing , the intimated purpose , expresses character .
if you act you show character ; if you sit still , if you sleep , you show it .
you think because you have spoken nothing when others spoke , and have given no opinion on the times , on the church , on slavery , on marriage , on socialism , on secret societies , on the college , on parties and persons , that your verdict is still expected with curiosity as a reserved wisdom .
far otherwise ; your silence answers very loud .
you have no oracle to utter , and your fellow-men have learned that you can not help them ; for oracles speak .
doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice ?
dreadful limits are set in nature to the powers of <unk> .
truth <unk> over the unwilling members of the body .
faces never lie , it is said .
no man need be deceived who <name> study the changes of expression .
when a man speaks the truth in the spirit of truth , his eye is as clear as the heavens .
when he has base ends and speaks falsely , the eye is muddy and sometimes <unk> .
i have heard an experienced counsellor say that he never feared the effect upon a jury of a lawyer who does not believe in his heart that his client ought to have a verdict .
if he does not believe it his unbelief <name> appear to the jury , despite all his protestations , and <name> become their unbelief .
this is that law whereby a work of <name> , of whatever kind , sets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist was when he made it .
that which we do not believe we can not adequately say , though we may repeat the words never so often .
it was this conviction which swedenborg expressed when he described a group of persons in the spiritual world endeavoring in vain to articulate a proposition which they did not believe ; but they could not , though they twisted and folded their lips even to indignation .
a man passes for that he is worth .
very idle is all curiosity concerning other people 's estimate of us , and all fear of remaining unknown is not less so .
if a man know that he can do any thing ,  that he can do it better than any one else ,  he has a pledge of the acknowledgment of that fact by all persons .
the world is full of <unk> , and into every assembly that a man enters , in every action he attempts , he is <unk> and stamped .
in every troop of boys that whoop and run in each yard and square , a new-comer is as well and accurately weighed in the course of a few days and stamped with his right number , as if he had undergone a formal trial of his strength , speed and temper .
a stranger comes from a distant school , with better dress , with trinkets in his pockets , with airs and pretensions ; an older boy says to himself , 'it 's of no use ; we shall find him out to-morrow . '
'what has he done ? '
is the divine question which searches men and <unk> every false reputation .
a <unk> may sit in any chair of the world nor be distinguished for his hour from <name> and washington ; but there need never be any doubt concerning the respective ability of human beings .
pretension may sit still , but can not act .
pretension never feigned an act of real greatness .
pretension never wrote an iliad , nor drove back xerxes , nor <unk> the world , nor abolished slavery .
as much virtue as there is , so much appears ; as much goodness as there is , so much reverence it commands .
all the devils respect virtue .
the high , the generous , the <unk> sect <name> always instruct and command mankind .
never was a sincere word utterly lost .
never a magnanimity fell to the ground , but there is some heart to greet and accept it unexpectedly .
a man passes for that he is worth .
what he is <unk> itself on his face , on his form , on his fortunes , in letters of light .
concealment avails him nothing , boasting nothing .
there is confession in the glances of our eyes , in our smiles , in salutations , and the grasp of hands .
his sin <unk> him , mars all his good impression .
men know not why they do not trust him , but they do not trust him .
his vice glasses his eye , cuts lines of mean expression in his cheek , <unk> the nose , sets the <name> of the beast on the back of the head , and writes o fool !
fool !
on the forehead of a king .
if you would not be known to do any thing , never do it .
a man may play the fool in the drifts of a desert , but every grain of sand shall seem to see .
he may be a solitary eater , but he can not keep his foolish counsel .
a broken complexion , a <unk> look , ungenerous acts and the want of due knowledge ,  all <unk> .
can a cook , a <unk> , an <unk> be mistaken for <unk> or <name> ?
<unk> exclaimed ,  " how can a man be concealed ?
how can a man be concealed ? "
on the other hand , the hero fears not that if he withhold the <unk> of a just and brave act it <name> go <unk> and <unk> .
one knows it ,  himself ,  and is pledged by it to sweetness of peace and to nobleness of aim which <name> prove in the end a better proclamation of it than the relating of the incident .
virtue is the <unk> in action to the nature of things , and the nature of things makes it prevalent .
it consists in a perpetual <unk> of being for seeming , and with sublime propriety god is described as saying , i am .
the lesson which these observations convey is , be , and not seem .
let us acquiesce .
let us take our bloated nothingness out of the path of the divine <unk> .
let us <unk> our wisdom of the world .
let us lie low in the lord 's power and learn that truth alone makes <name> and great .
if you visit your friend , why need you apologize for not having visited him , and waste his time and <unk> your own act ?
visit him now .
let him feel that the highest love has come to see him , in thee its lowest organ .
or why need you torment yourself and friend by secret <unk> that you have not assisted him or complimented him with gifts and salutations heretofore ?
be a gift and a benediction .
shine with real light and not with the borrowed reflection of gifts .
common men are apologies for men ; they bow the head , excuse themselves with <unk> reasons , and accumulate appearances because the substance is not .
we are full of these superstitions of sense , the worship of magnitude .
we call the poet inactive , because he is not a president , a merchant , or a <name> .
we adore an institution , and do not see that it is founded on a thought which we have .
but real action is in silent moments .
the epochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a calling , our marriage , our acquisition of an office , and the like , but in a silent thought by the <unk> as we walk ; in a thought which <unk> our entire manner of life and says ,  'thus hast thou done , but it were better thus . '
and all our after years , like <unk> , serve and wait on this , and according to their ability execute its <name> .
this <unk> or correction is a constant force , which , as a tendency , reaches through our lifetime .
the object of the man , the aim of these moments , is to make daylight shine through him , to suffer the law to traverse his whole being without obstruction , so that on what point <unk> of his doing your eye falls it shall report truly of his character , whether it be his diet , his house , his religious forms , his society , his mirth , his vote , his opposition .
now he is not homogeneous , but heterogeneous , and the <name> does not traverse ; there are no thorough lights , but the eye of the beholder is puzzled , detecting many unlike tendencies and a life not yet at one .
why should we make it a point with our false modesty to <unk> that man we are and that form of being assigned to us ?
a good man is contented .
i love and honor <unk> , but i do not wish to be <unk> .
i hold it more just to love the world of this hour than the world of his hour .
nor can you , if i am true , excite me to the least uneasiness by saying , 'he acted and thou <unk> still . '
i see action to be good , when the need is , and sitting still to be also good .
<unk> , if he was the man i take him for , would have sat still with <name> and peace , if his lot had been mine .
heaven is large , and affords space for all modes of love and fortitude .
why should we be <unk> and <unk> ?
action and inaction are alike to the true .
one piece of the tree is cut for a <unk> and one for the sleeper of a bridge ; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both .
i <name> not to disgrace the soul .
the fact that i am here certainly shows me that the soul had need of an organ here .
shall i not assume the post ?
shall i <unk> and dodge and duck with my <unk> apologies and vain modesty and imagine my being here impertinent ?
less pertinent than <unk> or <name> being there ?
and that the soul did not know its own needs ?
besides , without any reasoning on the matter , i have no discontent .
the good soul <unk> me and <unk> new magazines of power and enjoyment to me every day .
i <name> not meanly decline the immensity of good , because i have heard that it has come to others in another shape .
besides , why should we be cowed by the name of action ?
't is a trick of the senses ,  no more .
we know that the ancestor of every action is a thought .
the poor mind does not seem to itself to be any thing unless it have an outside badge ,  some <unk> diet , or quaker coat , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> society , or a great <unk> , or a high office , or , any how , some wild <unk> action to testify that it is somewhat .
the <name> mind lies in the sun and sleeps , and is nature .
to think is to act .
let us , if we must have great actions , make our own so .
all action is of an infinite elasticity , and the least admits of being inflated with the celestial air until it <unk> the sun and moon .
let us seek one peace by fidelity .
let me heed my duties .
why need i go <unk> into the scenes and philosophy of greek and italian history before i have justified myself to my benefactors ?
how dare i read <unk> campaigns when i have not answered the letters of my own correspondents ?
is not that a just objection to much of our reading ?
it is a <unk> desertion of our work to gaze after our neighbors .
it is peeping .
<name> says of <name> bunting ,  " he knew not what to say , and so he swore . "
i may say it of our preposterous use of books ,  he knew not what to do , and so he read .
i can think of nothing to fill my time with , and i find the life of <name> .
it is a very extravagant compliment to pay to <name> , or to general schuyler , or to general washington .
my time should be as good as their time ,  my facts , my net of relations , as good as theirs , or either of theirs .
rather let me do my work so well that other idlers if they choose may compare my texture with the texture of these and find it identical with the best .
this <unk> of the possibilities of <name> and pericles , this <unk> of our own , comes from a neglect of the fact of an identical nature .
bonaparte knew but one merit , and rewarded in one and the same way the good soldier , the good astronomer , the good poet , the good player .
the poet uses the names of caesar , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> ; the painter uses the conventional story of the virgin <name> , of <name> , of <name> .
he does not therefore defer to the nature of these accidental men , of these stock heroes .
if the poet write a true drama , then he is caesar , and not the player of caesar ; then the selfsame strain of thought , emotion as pure , wit as subtle , motions as swift , mounting , extravagant , and a heart as great , <unk> , dauntless , which on the waves of its love and <name> can uplift all that is reckoned solid and precious in the world ,  palaces , gardens , money , navies , kingdoms ,  marking its own incomparable worth by the slight it casts on these <unk> of men ;  these all are his , and by the power of these he <unk> the nations .
let a man believe in god , and not in names and places and persons .
let the great soul <unk> in some woman's form , poor and sad and single , in some <name> or <name> , go out to service , and sweep chambers and scour floors , and its <unk> <unk> can not be muffled or hid , but to sweep and scour <name> instantly appear supreme and beautiful actions , the top and radiance of human life , and all people <name> get <unk> and <unk> ; until , lo !
suddenly the great soul has <unk> itself in some other form and done some other deed , and that is now the flower and head of all living nature .
we are the <unk> , we the irritable <unk> and tinfoil that measure the accumulations of the subtle element .
we know the authentic effects of the true fire through every one of its million disguises .
***** love .
" i was as a gem concealed ; me my burning <name> revealed . "
koran .
v. love .
every promise of the soul has innumerable <unk> ; each of its joys ripens into a new want .
nature , <unk> , flowing , <unk> , in the first sentiment of kindness <unk> already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light .
the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one , which is the enchantment of human life ; which , like a certain divine rage and enthusiasm , seizes on man at one period and works a revolution in his mind and body ; unites him to his race , <unk> him to the domestic and civic relations , carries him with new sympathy into nature , <unk> the power of the senses , opens the imagination , adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes , establishes marriage , and gives permanence to human society .
the natural association of the sentiment of love with the <unk> of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints , which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience , one must not be too old .
the delicious fancies of youth reject the least <unk> of a mature philosophy , as chilling with age and <unk> their purple bloom .
and therefore i know i incur the <unk> of unnecessary hardness and <unk> from those who compose the court and parliament of love .
but from these formidable <unk> i shall appeal to my seniors .
for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak , though it begin with the young , yet <unk> not the old , or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old , but makes the aged <unk> of it not less than the tender maiden , though in a different and nobler sort .
for it is a fire that kindling its first embers in the narrow nook of a private bosom , caught from a wandering spark out of another private heart , glows and enlarges until it <unk> and beams upon multitudes of men and women , upon the universal heart of all , and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames .
it matters not therefore whether we attempt to describe the passion at twenty , at thirty , or at eighty years .
he who paints it at the first period <name> lose some of its later , he who paints it at the last , some of its earlier traits .
only it is to be hoped that by <name> and the muses ' aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful , so central that it shall commend itself to the eye , at whatever <name> beholden .
and the first condition is , that we must leave a too close and lingering <unk> to facts , and study the sentiment as it appeared in <name> and not in history .
for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured , as the life of man is not , to his imagination .
each man sees over his own experience a certain stain of error , whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal .
let any man go back to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life , which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment , he <name> shrink and moan .
alas !
i know not why , but infinite <unk> <unk> in mature life the remembrances of budding <name> and cover every beloved name .
every thing is beautiful seen from the point of the intellect , or as truth .
but all is sour , if seen as experience .
details are melancholy ; the plan is seemly and <name> .
in the actual world  the painful kingdom of time and place  dwell care , and <unk> , and fear .
with thought , with the ideal , is immortal hilarity , the rose of <name> .
round it all the muses sing .
but grief <unk> to names , and persons , and the partial interests of to-day and yesterday .
the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations <unk> in the conversation of society .
what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much , as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment ?
what books in the circulating libraries circulate ?
how we glow over these novels of passion , when the story is told with any spark of truth and nature !
and what <unk> attention , in the intercourse of life , like any passage betraying affection between two parties ?
perhaps we never saw them before , and never shall meet them again .
but we see them exchange a glance , or betray a deep emotion , and we are no longer strangers .
we understand them , and take the warmest interest in the development of the romance .
all mankind love a lover .
the earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are <unk> most winning pictures .
it is the <name> of civility and <name> in the coarse and rustic .
the rude village boy <unk> the girls about the school-house door ;  but to-day he comes running into the entry , and meets one fair child disposing her satchel ; he holds her books to help her , and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely , and was a sacred <unk> .
among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough , but one alone distances him ; and these two little neighbors , that were so close just now , have learned to respect each other 's personality .
or who can avert his eyes from the engaging , <unk> , <unk> ways of <unk> who go into the country shops to buy a <unk> of silk or a sheet of paper , and talk half an hour about nothing with the <unk> , good-natured <unk> .
in the village they are on a perfect equality , which love delights in , and without any <unk> the happy , affectionate nature of woman flows out in this pretty gossip .
the girls may have little beauty , yet plainly do they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable , confiding relations , what with their fun and their <name> , about <name> and <name> and <unk> , and who was invited to the party , and who danced at the <unk> , and when the <unk> would begin , and other <unk> concerning which the parties cooed .
by and by that boy wants a wife , and very truly and heartily <name> he know where to find a sincere and sweet mate , without any risk such as <name> <unk> as incident to scholars and great men .
i have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations .
but now i almost shrink at the remembrance of such <unk> words .
for persons are love 's world , and the coldest philosopher can not recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love , without being tempted to <unk> , as treasonable to nature , aught <unk> to the social instincts .
for though the celestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those of tender age , and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison and putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see after thirty years , yet the remembrance of these visions <unk> all other remembrances , and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows .
but here is a strange fact ; it may seem to many men , in <unk> their experience , that they have no fairer <name> in their life 's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft , surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth , to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances .
in looking backward they may find that several things which were not the charm have more reality to this groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed them .
but be our experience in particulars what it may , no man ever forgot the <unk> of that power to his heart and <name> , which created all things anew ; which was the <name> in him of music , poetry , and <name> ; which made the face of nature radiant with purple light , the morning and the night varied enchantments ; when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound , and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the <name> of memory ; when he became all eye when one was present , and all memory when one was gone ; when the youth becomes a watcher of windows and studious of a glove , a veil , a ribbon , or the wheels of a carriage ; when no place is too solitary and none too silent , for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends , though best and purest , can give him ; for the figures , the motions , the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water , but , as plutarch said , " enamelled in fire , " and make the study of midnight :  " thou <name> not gone being gone , <unk> thou <name> , thou <unk> in him thy watchful eyes , in him thy loving heart . "
in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough , but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear ; for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love ,  " all other pleasures are not worth its pains : " and when the day was not long enough , but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections ; when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on ; when the moonlight was a pleasing fever and the stars were letters and the flowers <unk> and the air was coined into song ; when all business seemed an impertinence , and all the men and women running to and fro in the streets , mere pictures .
the passion <unk> the world for the youth .
it makes all things alive and significant .
nature grows conscious .
every bird on the boughs of the tree sings now to his heart and soul .
the notes are almost articulate .
the clouds have faces as he looks on them .
the trees of the forest , the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent ; and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite .
yet nature soothes and <unk> .
in the green solitude he finds a dearer home than with men :  " <unk> and <unk> groves , places which pale passion loves , moonlight walks , when all the fowls are safely housed , save bats and owls , a midnight <name> , a passing groan ,  these are the sounds we feed upon . "
behold there in the wood the fine madman !
he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights ; he <unk> ; he is twice a man ; he walks with arms <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> the grass and the trees ; he feels the blood of the <name> , the clover and the <name> in his veins ; and he talks with the <name> that <unk> his foot .
the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse .
it is a fact often observed , that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion , who can not write well under any other circumstances .
the like force has the passion over all his nature .
it expands the sentiment ; it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart .
into the most pitiful and abject it <name> <unk> a heart and courage to defy the world , so only it have the countenance of the beloved object .
in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself .
he is a new man , with new perceptions , new and keener purposes , and a religious solemnity of character and aims .
he does not longer <unk> to his family and society ; he is somewhat ; he is a person ; he is a soul .
and here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence which is thus potent over the human youth .
beauty , whose revelation to man we now celebrate , welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine , which pleases everybody with it and with themselves , seems sufficient to itself .
the lover can not paint his maiden to his fancy poor and solitary .
like a tree in flower , so much soft , budding , informing loveliness is society for itself ; and she teaches his eye why beauty was pictured with loves and graces attending her steps .
her existence makes the world <name> .
though she <unk> all other persons from his attention as cheap and unworthy , she <unk> him by carrying out her own being into somewhat impersonal , large , mundane , so that the maiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and virtues .
for that reason the lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to her kindred or to others .
his friends find in her a likeness to her mother , or her sisters , or to persons not of her blood .
the lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and <name> mornings , to rainbows and the song of birds .
the ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue .
who can analyze the nameless charm which glances from one and another face and form ?
we are touched with emotions of tenderness and complacency , but we can not find whereat this dainty emotion , this wandering gleam , points .
it is destroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to organization .
nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love known and described in society , but , as it seems to me , to a quite other and unattainable sphere , to relations of transcendent delicacy and sweetness , to what roses and violets hint and <unk> .
we can not approach beauty .
its nature is like <unk> <unk> <unk> , hovering and evanescent .
herein it resembles the most excellent things , which all have this rainbow character , defying all attempts at appropriation and use .
what else did <name> <name> richter signify , when he said to music , " away !
away !
thou <unk> to me of things which in all my endless life i have not found , and shall not find . "
the same fluency may be observed in every work of the plastic arts .
the statue is then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible , when it is passing out of criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and <unk> , but demands an active imagination to go with it and to say what it is in the act of doing .
the god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition from that which is <unk> to the senses , to that which is not .
then first it ceases to be a stone .
the same remark holds of painting .
and of poetry the success is not attained when it <unk> and satisfies , but when it <unk> and fires us with new endeavors after the unattainable .
concerning it <unk> <unk> " whether it is not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and existence . "
in like manner , personal beauty is then first charming and itself when it <unk> us with any end ; when it becomes a story without an end ; when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly <unk> ; when it makes the beholder feel his <unk> ; when he can not feel his right to it , though he were caesar ; he can not feel more right to it than to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset .
hence arose the saying , " if i love you , what is that to you ? "
we say so because we feel that what we love is not in your <name> , but above it .
it is not you , but your radiance .
it is that which you know not in yourself and can never know .
this agrees well with that high philosophy of beauty which the ancient writers delighted in ; for they said that the soul of man , embodied here on earth , went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its own out of which it came into this , but was soon stupefied by the light of the natural sun , and unable to see any other objects than those of this world , which are but shadows of real things .
therefore the deity sends the <name> of youth before the soul , that it may avail itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and fair ; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her and finds the highest <name> in contemplating the form , movement , and intelligence of this person , because it suggests to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty , and the cause of the beauty .
if however , from too much conversing with material objects , the soul was gross , and misplaced its satisfaction in the body , it <unk> nothing but sorrow ; body being unable to fulfil the promise which beauty holds out ; but if , accepting the hint of these visions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind , the soul passes through the body and falls to admire strokes of character , and the lovers contemplate one another in their discourses and their actions , then they pass to the true palace of beauty , more and more <unk> their love of it , and by this love extinguishing the base affection , as the sun puts out the fire by shining on the hearth , they become pure and hallowed .
by conversation with that which is in itself excellent , magnanimous , lowly , and just , the lover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities , and a quicker apprehension of them .
then he passes from loving them in one to loving them in all , and so is the one beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true and pure souls .
in the particular society of his mate he attains a clearer sight of any spot , any taint which her beauty has contracted from this world , and is able to point it out , and this with mutual <name> that they are now able , without offence , to indicate <unk> and <unk> in each other , and give to each all help and comfort in curing the same .
and beholding in many souls the traits of the divine beauty , and separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint which it has contracted in the world , the lover ascends to the highest beauty , to the love and knowledge of the divinity , by steps on this ladder of created souls .
somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages .
the doctrine is not old , nor is it new .
if plato , plutarch and <unk> taught it , so have <unk> , <name> and <name> .
it awaits a truer unfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subterranean <name> which <unk> at marriages with words that take hold of the upper world , whilst one eye is prowling in the cellar ; so that its gravest discourse has a <unk> of hams and <unk> .
worst , when this <unk> <unk> into the education of young women , and withers the <name> and affection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife 's thrift , and that woman 's life has no other aim .
but this dream of love , though beautiful , is only one scene in our play .
in the procession of the soul from within outward , it enlarges its circles ever , like the pebble thrown into the pond , or the light proceeding from an orb .
the rays of the soul alight first on things nearest , on every <unk> and toy , on nurses and domestics , on the house and yard and passengers , on the circle of household acquaintance , on politics and geography and history .
but things are ever grouping themselves according to higher or more interior laws .
neighborhood , size , <name> , habits , persons , lose by degrees their power over us .
cause and effect , real affinities , the longing for <name> between the soul and the circumstance , the progressive , <unk> instinct , <unk> later , and the step backward from the higher to the lower relations is impossible .
thus even love , which is the <unk> of persons , must become more impersonal every day .
of this at first it gives no hint .
little think the youth and maiden who are glancing at each other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual intelligence , of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this new , quite external stimulus .
the work of vegetation begins first in the irritability of the bark and <unk> .
from exchanging glances , they advance to acts of courtesy , of gallantry , then to fiery passion , to <unk> troth and marriage .
passion beholds its object as a perfect unit .
the soul is wholly embodied , and the body is wholly <unk> :  " her pure and eloquent blood spoke in her cheeks , and so distinctly wrought , that one might almost say her body thought . "
<name> , if dead , should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens fine .
life , with this pair , has no other aim , asks no more , than <name> ,  than <name> .
night , day , studies , talents , kingdoms , religion , are all contained in this form full of soul , in this soul which is all form .
the lovers delight in endearments , in <unk> of love , in comparisons of their regards .
when alone , they solace themselves with the remembered image of the other .
does that other see the same <name> , the same melting cloud , read the same book , feel the same emotion , that now delight me ?
they try and weigh their affection , and adding up costly advantages , friends , opportunities , properties , <unk> in discovering that willingly , joyfully , they would give all as a ransom for the beautiful , the beloved head , not one hair of which shall be harmed .
but the lot of humanity is on these children .
danger , sorrow , and pain arrive to them , as to all .
love prays .
it makes <unk> with eternal power in behalf of this dear mate .
the union which is thus effected and which adds a new value to every atom in nature  for it <unk> every thread throughout the whole web of relation into a golden <name> , and <unk> the soul in a new and sweeter element  is yet a temporary state .
not always can flowers , pearls , poetry , protestations , nor even home in another heart , content the awful soul that dwells in <name> .
it <unk> itself at last from these endearments , as toys , and puts on the harness and <unk> to vast and universal aims .
the soul which is in the soul of each , craving a perfect <unk> , detects incongruities , defects and disproportion in the behavior of the other .
hence arise surprise , expostulation and pain .
yet that which <name> them to each other was signs of loveliness , signs of virtue ; and these virtues are there , however <unk> .
they appear and reappear and continue to attract ; but the regard changes , quits the sign and attaches to the substance .
this repairs the wounded affection .
meantime , as life wears on , it proves a game of <unk> and combination of all possible positions of the parties , to employ all the resources of each and acquaint each with the strength and weakness of the other .
for it is the nature and end of this relation , that they should represent the human race to each other .
all that is in the world , which is or ought to be known , is cunningly wrought into the texture of man , of woman :  " the person love does to us fit , like manna , has the taste of all in it . "
the world rolls ; the circumstances vary every hour .
the angels that inhabit this <name> of the body appear at the windows , and the <unk> and vices also .
by all the virtues they are united .
if there be virtue , all the vices are known as such ; they confess and flee .
their once flaming regard is sobered by time in either breast , and losing in violence what it gains in extent , it becomes a thorough good understanding .
they resign each other without complaint to the good offices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in time , and exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its object , for a cheerful , disengaged furtherance , whether present or absent , of each other 's designs .
at last they discover that all which at first <name> them together ,  those once sacred features , that magical play of charms ,  was <unk> , had a prospective end , like the scaffolding by which the house was built ; and the purification of the intellect and the heart from year to year is the real marriage , foreseen and prepared from the first , and wholly above their consciousness .
looking at these aims with which two persons , a man and a woman , so variously and <unk> gifted , are shut up in one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years , i do not wonder at the emphasis with which the heart <unk> this crisis from early infancy , at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower , and nature and intellect and <name> <unk> each other in the gifts and the <name> they bring to the <unk> .
thus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex , nor person , nor partiality , but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere , to the end of increasing virtue and wisdom .
we are by nature observers , and thereby <unk> .
that is our permanent state .
but we are often made to feel that our affections are but tents of a night .
though slowly and with pain , the objects of the affections change , as the objects of thought do .
there are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons .
but in health the mind is presently seen again ,  its <unk> vault , bright with <unk> of immutable lights , and the warm loves and fears that swept over us as clouds must lose their finite character and blend with god , to attain their own perfection .
but we need not fear that we can lose any thing by the progress of the soul .
the soul may be trusted to the end .
that which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations , must be succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful , and so on for ever .
***** friendship .
a ruddy drop of manly blood the surging sea <unk> ; the world uncertain comes and goes , the lover rooted stays .
i fancied he was fled , and , after many a year , glowed <unk> kindliness like daily sunrise there .
my careful heart was free again ,  o friend , my bosom said , through thee alone the sky is arched , through thee the rose is red , all things through thee take nobler form and look beyond the earth , the <unk> of our fate appears a <unk> in thy worth .
me too thy nobleness has taught to master my despair ; the fountains of my hidden life are through thy friendship fair .
<name> .
friendship .
we have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken .
<unk> all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world , the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether .
how many persons we meet in houses , whom we scarcely speak to , whom yet we honor , and who honor us !
how many we see in the street , or sit with in church , whom , though silently , we warmly rejoice to be with !
read the language of these wandering <unk> .
the heart knoweth .
the effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration .
in poetry and in common speech , the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened to the material effects of fire ; so swift , or much more swift , more active , more cheering , are these fine inward <unk> .
from the highest degree of passionate love to the lowest degree of good-will , they make the sweetness of life .
our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection .
the scholar sits down to write , and all his years of meditation do not furnish him with one good thought or happy expression ; but it is necessary to write a letter to a friend ,  and forthwith troops of gentle thoughts invest themselves , on every hand , with chosen words .
see , in any house where virtue and self-respect abide , the <unk> which the approach of a stranger causes .
a commended stranger is expected and announced , and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain <unk> all the hearts of a household .
his arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him .
the house is dusted , all things fly into their places , the old coat is exchanged for the new , and they must get up a dinner if they can .
of a commended stranger , only the good report is told by others , only the good and new is heard by us .
he stands to us for humanity .
he is what we wish .
having imagined and invested him , we ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a man , and are uneasy with fear .
the same idea <unk> conversation with him .
we talk better than we are wont .
we have the <unk> fancy , a richer memory , and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time .
for long hours we can continue a series of sincere , graceful , <name> communications , drawn from the oldest , <unk> experience , so that they who sit by , of our own <unk> and acquaintance , shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers .
but as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his <unk> , his definitions , his defects , into the conversation , it is all over .
he has heard the first , the last and best he <name> ever hear from us .
he is no stranger now .
vulgarity , ignorance , <unk> are old acquaintances .
now , when he comes , he may get the order , the dress and the dinner ,  but the throbbing of the heart and the communications of the soul , no more .
what is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world for me again ?
what so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two , in a thought , in a feeling ?
how beautiful , on their approach to this beating heart , the steps and forms of the gifted and the true !
the moment we indulge our affections , the earth is metamorphosed ; there is no <name> and no night ; all tragedies , all <unk> vanish ,  all duties even ; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of beloved persons .
let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend , and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years .
i awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends , the old and the new .
shall i not call god the beautiful , who daily <unk> himself so to me in his gifts ?
i chide society , i embrace solitude , and yet i am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise , the lovely and the <unk> , as from time to time they pass my gate .
who hears me , who understands me , becomes mine ,  a possession for all time .
nor is nature so poor but she gives me this <name> several times , and thus we weave social threads of our own , a new web of relations ; and , as many thoughts in succession <unk> themselves , we shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation , and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a <unk> globe .
my friends have come to me unsought .
the great god gave them to me .
by oldest right , by the divine affinity of virtue with itself , i find them , or rather not i but the deity in me and in them <unk> and <unk> the thick walls of individual character , relation , age , sex , circumstance , at which he usually <unk> , and now makes many one .
high thanks i owe you , excellent lovers , who <name> out the world for me to new and <name> depths , and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts .
these are new poetry of the first bard ,  poetry without stop ,  hymn , ode and epic , poetry still flowing , apollo and the muses chanting still .
<name> these too separate themselves from me again , or some of them ?
i know not , but i fear it not ; for my relation to them is so pure , that we hold by simple affinity , and the genius of my life being thus social , the same affinity <name> exert its energy on <unk> is as <name> as these men and women , wherever i may be .
i confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point .
it is almost dangerous to me to " crush the sweet poison of <unk> wine " of the affections .
a new person is to me a great event and <unk> me from sleep .
i have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours ; but the <name> ends in the day ; it yields no fruit .
thought is not born of it ; my action is very little modified .
i must feel pride in my friend 's accomplishments as if they were mine , and a property in his virtues .
i feel as warmly when he is praised , as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden .
we <unk> the conscience of our friend .
his goodness seems better than our goodness , his nature finer , his temptations less .
every thing that is his ,  his name , his form , his dress , books and instruments ,  fancy <unk> .
our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth .
yet the <unk> and <unk> of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love .
friendship , like the immortality of the soul , is too good to be believed .
the lover , beholding his maiden , half knows that she is not verily that which he worships ; and in the golden hour of friendship we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief .
we doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines , and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine <unk> .
in strictness , the soul does not respect men as it respects itself .
in strict science all persons <unk> the same condition of an infinite remoteness .
shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this elysian <name> ?
shall i not be as real as the things i see ?
if i am , i shall not fear to know them for what they are .
their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance , though it needs finer organs for its apprehension .
the root of the plant is not unsightly to science , though for <unk> and <unk> we cut the stem short .
and i must hazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries , though it should prove an egyptian skull at our banquet .
a man who stands united with his thought <unk> magnificently of himself .
he is conscious of a universal success , even though bought by uniform particular failures .
no advantages , no powers , no gold or force , can be any match for him .
i can not choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth .
i can not make your consciousness <unk> to mine .
only the <name> <unk> ; the planet has a faint , <unk> <name> .
i hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise , but i see well that for all his purple cloaks i shall not like him , unless he is at last a poor greek like me .
i can not deny it , o friend , that the vast shadow of the <unk> includes thee also in its pied and painted immensity ,  thee also , compared with whom all else is shadow .
thou <name> not being , as truth is , as justice is ,  thou <name> not my soul , but a picture and effigy of that .
thou hast come to me lately , and already thou <name> seizing thy hat and cloak .
is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts forth leaves , and presently , by the germination of new buds , <unk> the old leaf ?
the law of nature is alternation for evermore .
each electrical state <unk> the opposite .
the soul environs itself with friends that it may enter into a grander <unk> or solitude ; and it goes alone for a season , that it may exalt its conversation or society .
this method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations .
the instinct of affection <unk> the <name> of union with our mates , and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the <name> .
thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship , and if he should record his true sentiment , he might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love :  dear friend , if i was sure of thee , sure of thy capacity , sure to match my mood with thine , i should never think again of trifles in relation to thy <unk> and goings .
i am not very wise ; my moods are quite attainable , and i respect thy genius ; it is to me as yet <unk> ; yet dare i not presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me , and so thou <name> to me a delicious torment .
thine ever , or never .
yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and not for life .
they are not to be indulged .
this is to weave cobweb , and not cloth .
our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions , because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams , instead of the tough fibre of the human heart .
the laws of friendship are austere and eternal , of one web with the laws of nature and of morals .
but we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit , to suck a sudden sweetness .
we snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of god , which many summers and many winters must ripen .
we seek our friend not <unk> , but with an <unk> passion which would appropriate him to ourselves .
in vain .
we are armed all over with subtle <unk> , which , as soon as we meet , begin to play , and translate all poetry into stale prose .
almost all people descend to meet .
all association must be a compromise , and , what is worst , the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other .
what a perpetual disappointment is actual society , even of the virtuous and gifted !
after interviews have been compassed with long foresight we must be tormented presently by baffled blows , by sudden , <unk> <unk> , by <unk> of wit and of animal spirits , in the <unk> of friendship and thought .
our faculties do not play us true , and both parties are relieved by solitude .
i ought to be equal to every relation .
it makes no difference how many friends i have and what content i can find in conversing with each , if there be one to whom i am not equal .
if i have shrunk unequal from one contest , the <name> i find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly .
i should hate myself , if then i made my other friends my asylum :  " the valiant warrior <unk> for fight , after a hundred victories , once <unk> , is from the book of honor <unk> quite , and all the rest forgot for which he toiled . "
our impatience is thus sharply rebuked .
<unk> and apathy are a tough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening .
it would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it .
respect the <unk> which <unk> the <name> in a million years , and works in duration in which alps and andes come and go as rainbows .
the good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness .
love , which is the essence of god , is not for levity , but for the total worth of man .
let us not have this childish luxury in our regards , but the <unk> worth ; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in the truth of his heart , in the breadth , impossible to be overturned , of his foundations .
the attractions of this subject are not to be resisted , and i leave , for the time , all account of subordinate social benefit , to speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute , and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common , so much is this purer , and nothing is so much divine .
i do not wish to treat friendships daintily , but with roughest courage .
when they are real , they are not glass threads or <unk> , but the <unk> thing we know .
for now , after so many ages of experience , what do we know of nature or of ourselves ?
not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his <name> .
in one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men .
but the sweet sincerity of <name> and peace which i draw from this alliance with my brother 's soul is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell .
happy is the house that shelters a friend !
it might well be built , like a <unk> bower or arch , to entertain him a single day .
happier , if he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its law !
he who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up , like an <unk> , to the great games where the first-born of the world are the competitors .
he proposes himself for contests where time , want , danger , are in the lists , and he alone is <name> who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these .
the gifts of fortune may be present or absent , but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the contempt of trifles .
there are two elements that go to the composition of friendship , each so sovereign that i can detect no superiority in either , no reason why either should be first named .
one is truth .
a friend is a person with whom i may be sincere .
before him i may think aloud .
i am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that i may drop even those <unk> garments of <unk> , courtesy , and second thought , which men never put off , and may deal with him with the simplicity and <unk> with which one chemical atom meets another .
sincerity is the luxury allowed , like <unk> and authority , only to the highest rank ; that being permitted to speak truth , as having none above it to court or conform unto .
every man alone is sincere .
at the entrance of a second person , hypocrisy begins .
we parry and fend the approach of our <unk> by compliments , by gossip , by amusements , by affairs .
we cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds .
i knew a man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery , and omitting all compliment and commonplace , spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered , and that with great insight and beauty .
at first he was resisted , and all men agreed he was mad .
but <unk>  as indeed he could not help doing  for some time in this course , he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him .
no man would think of speaking falsely with him , or of putting him off with any chat of markets or <unk> .
but every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like <unk> , and what love of nature , what poetry , what symbol of truth he had , he did certainly show him .
but to most of us society shows not its face and eye , but its side and its back .
to stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity , is it not ?
we can seldom go erect .
almost every man we meet requires some civility ,  requires to be <unk> ; he has some fame , some talent , some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned , and which spoils all conversation with him .
but a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity , but me .
my friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part .
a friend therefore is a sort of paradox in nature .
i who alone am , i who see nothing in nature whose existence i can affirm with equal evidence to my own , behold now the semblance of my being , in all its height , variety , and curiosity , reiterated in a foreign form ; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature .
the other element of friendship is tenderness .
we are holden to men by every sort of tie , by blood , by pride , by fear , by <name> , by <unk> , by lust , by hate , by admiration , by every circumstance and badge and trifle ,  but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by love .
can another be so blessed and we so pure that we can offer him tenderness ?
when a man becomes dear to me i have touched the goal of fortune .
i find very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books .
and yet i have one text which i can not choose but remember .
my author says ,  " i offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose i effectually am , and tender myself least to him to whom i am the most devoted . "
i wish that friendship should have feet , as well as eyes and eloquence .
it must plant itself on the ground , before it vaults over the moon .
i wish it to be a little of a citizen , before it is quite a cherub .
we chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity .
it is an exchange of gifts , of useful loans ; it is good neighborhood ; it watches with the sick ; it holds the pall at the funeral ; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation .
but though we can not find the god under this disguise of a <unk> , yet on the other hand we can not forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine and does not <unk> his romance by the municipal virtues of justice , punctuality , fidelity and pity .
i hate the <unk> of the name of friendship to signify <unk> and worldly alliances .
i much prefer the company of <unk> and <unk> to the silken and perfumed amity which <unk> its days of encounter by a frivolous display , by rides in a <unk> and dinners at the best taverns .
the end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined ; more strict than any of which we have experience .
it is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death .
it is fit for serene days and graceful gifts and country rambles , but also for rough roads and hard fare , shipwreck , poverty , and persecution .
it keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the <unk> of religion .
we are to <unk> to each other the daily needs and offices of man 's life , and embellish it by courage , wisdom and unity .
it should never fall into something usual and settled , but should be alert and inventive and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery .
friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly , each so well tempered and so happily adapted , and withal so circumstanced ( for even in that particular , a poet says , love demands that the parties be altogether paired ) , that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured .
it can not subsist in its perfection , say some of those who are learned in this warm <name> of the heart , betwixt more than two .
i am not quite so strict in my terms , perhaps because i have never known so high a fellowship as others .
i please my imagination more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence .
but i find this law of one to one peremptory for conversation , which is the practice and consummation of friendship .
do not mix waters too much .
the best mix as ill as good and bad .
you shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two several men , but let all three of you come together and you shall not have one new and hearty word .
two may talk and one may hear , but three can not take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort .
in good company there is never such discourse between two , across the table , as takes place when you leave them alone .
in good company the individuals <unk> their egotism into a social soul exactly <unk> with the several <unk> there present .
no <unk> of friend to friend , no <unk> of brother to sister , of wife to husband , are there pertinent , but quite otherwise .
only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party , and not poorly limited to his own .
now this convention , which good sense demands , destroys the high freedom of great conversation , which requires an absolute running of two souls into one .
no two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler relations .
yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse .
unrelated men give little <name> to each other , <name> never suspect the latent powers of each .
we talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation , as if it were a permanent property in some individuals .
conversation is an evanescent relation ,  no more .
a man is reputed to have thought and eloquence ; he can not , for all that , say a word to his cousin or his uncle .
they accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade .
in the sun it <name> <name> the hour .
among those who enjoy his thought he <name> regain his tongue .
friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and <unk> that <unk> each with the presence of power and of consent in the other party .
let me be alone to the end of the world , rather than that my friend should <unk> , by a word or a look , his real sympathy .
i am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance .
let him not cease an instant to be himself .
the only <name> i have in his being mine , is that the not mine is mine .
i hate , where i looked for a manly furtherance , or at least a manly resistance , to find a mush of concession .
better be a <unk> in the side of your friend than his <name> .
the condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it .
that high office requires great and sublime parts .
there must be very two , before there can be very one .
let it be an alliance of two large , formidable natures , mutually beheld , mutually feared , before yet they recognize the deep identity which , beneath these <unk> , unites them .
he only is fit for this society who is magnanimous ; who is sure that greatness and goodness are always economy ; who is not swift to <unk> with his fortunes .
let him not <unk> with this .
leave to the <name> its ages to grow , nor expect to <unk> the births of the eternal .
friendship demands a religious treatment .
we talk of choosing our friends , but friends are <unk> .
reverence is a great part of it .
treat your friend as a spectacle .
of course he has merits that are not yours , and that you can not honor if you must needs hold him close to your person .
stand aside ; give those merits room ; let them mount and expand .
are you the friend of your friend 's buttons , or of his thought ?
to a great heart he <name> still be a stranger in a thousand particulars , that he may come near in the <unk> ground .
leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property , and to suck a short and <unk> pleasure , instead of the noblest benefit .
let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation .
why should we <unk> <name> and beautiful souls by intruding on them ?
why insist on rash personal relations with your friend ?
why go to his house , or know his mother and brother and sisters ?
why be visited by him at your own ?
are these things material to our covenant ?
leave this touching and clawing .
let him be to me a spirit .
a message , a thought , a sincerity , a glance from him , i want , but not news , nor <unk> .
i can get politics and chat and <unk> conveniences from cheaper companions .
should not the society of my friend be to me poetic , pure , universal and great as nature itself ?
ought i to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon , or that clump of waving grass that divides the <name> ?
let us not <unk> , but raise it to that standard .
that great defying eye , that scornful beauty of his mien and action , do not pique yourself on reducing , but rather fortify and enhance .
worship his <unk> ; wish him not less by a thought , but hoard and tell them all .
guard him as thy counterpart .
let him be to thee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy , <unk> , devoutly revered , and not a trivial <unk> to be soon <unk> and cast aside .
the hues of the <name> , the light of the <name> , are not to be seen if the eye is too near .
to my friend i write a letter and from him i receive a letter .
that seems to you a little .
it suffices me .
it is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give and of me to receive .
it <unk> nobody .
in these warm lines the heart <name> trust itself , as it <name> not to the tongue , and pour out the prophecy of a <unk> existence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good .
respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience for its opening .
we must be our own before we can be another 's .
there is at least this satisfaction in crime , according to the latin proverb ;  you can speak to your accomplice on even terms .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
to those whom we admire and love , at first we can not .
yet the least defect of self-possession <unk> , in my judgment , the entire relation .
there can never be deep peace between two spirits , never mutual respect , until in their dialogue each stands for the whole world .
what is so great as friendship , let us <name> with what grandeur of spirit we can .
let us be silent ,  so we may hear the whisper of the gods .
let us not interfere .
who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls , or how to say any thing to such ?
no matter how ingenious , no matter how graceful and bland .
there are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom , and for you to say aught is to be frivolous .
wait , and thy heart shall speak .
wait until the necessary and everlasting <unk> you , until day and night avail themselves of your lips .
the only reward of virtue is virtue ; the only way to have a friend is to be one .
you shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house .
if unlike , his soul only <unk> the faster from you , and you shall never catch a true glance of his eye .
we see the <name> afar off and they repel us ; why should we intrude ?
late ,  very late ,  we perceive that no arrangements , no introductions , no <unk> or habits of society would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we <name> ,  but solely the <unk> of nature in us to the same degree it is in them ; then shall we meet as water with water ; and if we should not meet them then , we shall not want them , for we are already they .
in the last analysis , love is only the reflection of a man 's own <unk> from other men .
men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends , as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul .
the higher the style we demand of friendship , of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and blood .
we walk alone in the world .
friends such as we <name> are dreams and fables .
but a sublime <name> cheers ever the faithful heart , that elsewhere , in other regions of the universal power , souls are now acting , enduring , and daring , which can love us and which we can love .
we may congratulate ourselves that the period of <unk> , of follies , of blunders and of shame , is passed in solitude , and when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands .
only be admonished by what you already see , not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons , where no friendship can be .
our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god attends .
by <unk> in your path , though you forfeit the little you gain the great .
you demonstrate yourself , so as to put yourself out of the reach of false relations , and you draw to you the first-born of the world ,  those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at once , and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres and shadows merely .
it is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual , as if so we could lose any genuine love .
whatever correction of our popular views we make from insight , nature <name> be sure to bear us out in , and though it seem to <name> us of some <name> , <name> repay us with a greater .
let us feel if we <name> the absolute insulation of man .
we are sure that we have all in us .
we go to europe , or we pursue persons , or we read books , in the instinctive <name> that these <name> call it out and reveal us to ourselves .
beggars all .
the persons are such as we ; the europe , an old faded garment of dead persons ; the books , their ghosts .
let us drop this idolatry .
let us give over this <unk> .
let us even bid our dearest friends farewell , and defy them , saying , 'who are you ?
<unk> me : i <name> be dependent no more . '
ah !
seest thou not , o brother , that thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform , and only be more each other's because we are more our own ?
a friend is <unk> ; he looks to the past and the future .
he is the child of all my foregoing hours , the prophet of those to come , and the <unk> of a greater friend .
i do then with my friends as i do with my books .
i would have them where i can find them , but i seldom use them .
we must have society on our own terms , and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause .
i can not afford to speak much with my friend .
if he is great he makes me so great that i can not descend to converse .
in the great days , <unk> hover before me in the firmament .
i ought then to dedicate myself to them .
i go in that i may seize them , i go out that i may seize them .
i fear only that i may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light .
then , though i prize my friends , i can not afford to talk with them and study their visions , lest i lose my own .
it would indeed give me a certain household <name> to quit this lofty seeking , this spiritual astronomy or search of stars , and come down to warm sympathies with you ; but then i know well i shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods .
it is true , next week i shall have languid moods , when i can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects ; then i shall regret the lost literature of your mind , and wish you were by my side again .
but if you come , perhaps you <name> fill my mind only with new visions ; not with yourself but with your <unk> , and i shall not be able any more than now to converse with you .
so i <name> owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse .
i <name> receive from them not what they have but what they are .
they shall give me that which properly they can not give , but which <unk> from them .
but they shall not hold me by any relations less <unk> and pure .
we <name> meet as though we met not , and part as though we parted not .
it has seemed to me lately more possible than i knew , to <name> a friendship greatly , on one side , without due correspondence on the other .
why should i <unk> myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious ?
it never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space , and only a small part on the reflecting planet .
let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion .
if he is unequal he <name> presently pass away ; but thou <name> enlarged by thy own shining , and no longer a mate for frogs and worms , dost soar and burn with the gods of the <unk> .
it is thought a disgrace to love <unk> .
but the great <name> see that true love can not be <unk> .
true love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and broods on the eternal , and when the poor interposed mask <unk> , it is not sad , but feels rid of so much earth and feels its <unk> the surer .
yet these things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation .
the essence of friendship is <unk> , a total magnanimity and trust .
it must not surmise or provide for infirmity .
it treats its object as a god , that it may <unk> both .
***** <name> .
theme no poet gladly <name> , fair to old and foul to young ; scorn not thou the love of parts , and the articles of arts .
grandeur of the perfect sphere thanks the atoms that cohere .
vii .
<name> .
what right have i to write on <name> , whereof i have little , and that of the negative sort ?
my <name> consists in avoiding and going without , not in the inventing of means and methods , not in adroit steering , not in gentle repairing .
i have no skill to make money spend well , no genius in my economy , and whoever sees my garden discovers that i must have some other garden .
yet i love facts , and hate <unk> and people without perception .
then i have the same title to write on <name> that i have to write on poetry or holiness .
we write from aspiration and antagonism , as well as from experience .
we paint those qualities which we do not possess .
the poet admires the man of energy and tactics ; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar ; and where a man is not vain and <unk> you shall find what he has not by his praise .
moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words of love and friendship with words of coarser sound , and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant , not to own it in passing .
<name> is the virtue of the senses .
it is the science of appearances .
it is the <unk> action of the inward life .
it is god taking thought for oxen .
it moves matter after the laws of matter .
it is content to seek health of body by complying with physical conditions , and health of mind by the laws of the intellect .
the world of the senses is a world of shows ; it does not exist for itself , but has a symbolic character ; and a true <name> or law of shows recognizes the <unk> of other laws and knows that its own office is subaltern ; knows that it is surface and not centre where it works .
<name> is false when detached .
it is legitimate when it is the natural history of the soul incarnate , when it <unk> the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the senses .
there are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world .
it is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate three .
one class live to the utility of the symbol , <unk> health and wealth a final good .
another class live above this <name> to the beauty of the symbol , as the poet and artist and the naturalist and man of science .
a third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified ; these are wise men .
the first class have common sense ; the second , taste ; and the third , spiritual perception .
once in a long time , a man traverses the whole scale , and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly , then also has a clear eye for its beauty , and lastly , whilst he <unk> his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature , does not offer to build houses and barns thereon ,  <unk> the splendor of the god which he sees bursting through each chink and <unk> .
the world is filled with the proverbs and acts and <unk> of a base <name> , which is a devotion to matter , as if we possessed no other faculties than the palate , the nose , the touch , the eye and ear ; a <name> which <unk> the rule of three , which never <unk> , which never gives , which seldom lends , and asks but one question of any project ,  <name> it bake bread ?
this is a disease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed .
but culture , revealing the high origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the man as the end , <unk> every thing else , as health and bodily life , into means .
it sees <name> not to be a several faculty , but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants .
cultivated men always feel and speak so , as if a great fortune , the achievement of a civil or social measure , great personal influence , a graceful and commanding address , had their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit .
if a man lose his balance and <unk> himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake , he may be a good wheel or pin , but he is not a cultivated man .
the <unk> <name> , making the senses final , is the god of <unk> and cowards , and is the subject of all comedy .
it is nature 's joke , and therefore literature 's .
the true <name> limits this <unk> by admitting the knowledge of an internal and real world .
this recognition once made , the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and times , being studied with the <unk> of their subordinate place , <name> reward any degree of attention .
for our existence , thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods which they <name> ,  so susceptible to climate and to country , so alive to social good and evil , so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and debt ,  reads all its primary lessons out of these books .
<name> does not go behind nature and ask whence it is .
it takes the laws of the world whereby man 's being is <unk> , as they are , and keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good .
it respects space and time , climate , want , sleep , the law of polarity , growth and death .
there revolve , to give bound and period to his being on all sides , the sun and moon , the great <unk> in the sky : here lies stubborn matter , and <name> not swerve from its chemical routine .
here is a planted globe , pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed externally with civil partitions and properties which impose new restraints on the young inhabitant .
we eat of the bread which grows in the field .
we live by the air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot , too dry or too wet .
time , which shows so vacant , <unk> and divine in its coming , is slit and <unk> into trifles and tatters .
a door is to be painted , a lock to be repaired .
i want wood or oil , or meal or salt ; the house smokes , or i have a headache ; then the tax , and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains , and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word ,  these eat up the hours .
do what we can , summer <name> have its flies ; if we walk in the woods we must feed <unk> ; if we go a-fishing we must expect a wet coat .
then climate is a great impediment to idle persons ; we often resolve to give up the care of the weather , but still we regard the clouds and the rain .
we are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years .
the hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and <unk> than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics .
the <unk> may ramble all day at <name> .
at night he may sleep on a mat under the moon , and wherever a wild <unk> grows , nature has , without a prayer even , spread a table for his morning meal .
the <unk> is perforce a <unk> .
he must brew , bake , salt and preserve his food , and pile wood and coal .
but as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new acquaintance with nature , and as nature is <unk> significant , the inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force .
such is the value of these matters that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these .
let him have accurate perceptions .
let him , if he have hands , handle ; if eyes , measure and discriminate ; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry , natural history and economics ; the more he has , the less is he willing to spare any one .
time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value .
some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action .
the domestic man , who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth , has <unk> which others never dream of .
the application of means to ends <unk> victory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war .
the good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of <unk> in a shed or in the <unk> of fruits in the cellar , as in <unk> campaigns or the files of the department of state .
in the rainy day he builds a <unk> , or gets his <unk> set in the corner of the <unk> , and stored with nails , <unk> , pincers , <unk> and chisel .
herein he tastes an old <name> of youth and childhood , the <unk> love of <unk> , presses and <unk> , and of the conveniences of long housekeeping .
his garden or his <unk> tells him many pleasant anecdotes .
one might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this <unk> element of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world .
let a man keep the law ,  any law ,  and his way <name> be <unk> with <unk> .
there is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount .
on the other hand , nature <unk> any neglect of <name> .
if you think the senses final , obey their law .
if you believe in the soul , do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect .
it is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception .
dr. <name> is reported to have said ,  " if the child says he looked out of this window , when he looked out of that ,  whip him . "
our american character is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception , which is shown by the currency of the <unk> , " no mistake . "
but the discomfort of <unk> , of confusion of thought about facts , of <unk> to the wants of to-morrow , is of no nation .
the beautiful laws of time and space , once dislocated by our <unk> , are holes and dens .
if the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands , instead of <name> it <name> yield us bees .
our words and actions to be fair must be timely .
a <name> and pleasant sound is the <unk> of the scythe in the mornings of <name> , yet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a <unk> or <unk> 's rifle when it is too late in the season to make hay ?
<unk> and " afternoon " men spoil much more than their own affair in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them .
i have seen a criticism on some paintings , of which i am reminded when i see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses .
the last grand duke of <unk> , a man of superior understanding , said ,  " i have sometimes remarked in the presence of great works of <name> , and just now especially in dresden , how much a certain property <unk> to the effect which gives life to the figures , and to the life an irresistible truth .
this property is the hitting , in all the figures we draw , the right centre of gravity .
i mean the placing the figures firm upon their feet , making the hands grasp , and fastening the eyes on the spot where they should look .
even lifeless figures , as vessels and stools  let them be drawn ever so correctly  lose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their centre of gravity , and have a certain swimming and <unk> appearance .
the <name> in the dresden gallery ( the only greatly affecting picture which i have seen ) is the <unk> and most passionless piece you can imagine ; a couple of saints who worship the virgin and child .
nevertheless , it awakens a deeper impression than the <unk> of ten crucified martyrs .
for beside all the resistless beauty of form , it possesses in the highest degree the property of the <unk> of all the figures . "
this <unk> we demand of all the figures in this picture of life .
let them stand on their feet , and not float and swing .
let us know where to find them .
let them discriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed , call a spade a spade , give us facts , and honor their own senses with trust .
but what man shall dare tax another with <unk> ?
who is prudent ?
the men we call greatest are least in this kingdom .
there is a certain fatal dislocation in our relation to nature , <unk> our modes of living and making every law our enemy , which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of reform .
we must call the highest <name> to counsel , and ask why health and beauty and genius should now be the exception rather than the rule of human nature ?
we do not know the properties of plants and animals and the laws of nature , through our sympathy with the same ; but this remains the dream of poets .
poetry and <name> should be coincident .
poets should be <unk> ; that is , the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult , but should announce and lead the civil code and the day's work .
but now the two things seem <unk> parted .
we have violated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins , and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena , we are surprised .
beauty should be the dowry of every man and woman , as invariably as sensation ; but it is rare .
health or sound organization should be universal .
genius should be the child of genius and every child should be inspired ; but now it is not to be predicted of any child , and nowhere is it pure .
we call partial <unk> , by courtesy , genius ; talent which converts itself to money ; talent which <unk> to-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow ; and society is officered by men of parts , as they are properly called , and not by divine men .
these use their gifts to <unk> luxury , not to abolish it .
genius is always <unk> , and piety , and love .
appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease , and they find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it .
we have found out fine names to cover our <unk> withal , but no gifts can raise intemperance .
the man of talent affects to call his <unk> of the laws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing considered with his devotion to his <name> .
his <name> never taught him <unk> , nor the love of wine , nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed .
his <name> is less for every deduction from his holiness , and less for every defect of common sense .
on him who scorned the world as he said , the scorned world <unk> its revenge .
he that <unk> small things <name> perish by little and little .
goethe 's tasso is very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait , and that is true tragedy .
it does not seem to me so genuine grief when some <unk> <name> the third <unk> and <unk> a score of innocent persons , as when <name> and tasso , both apparently right , wrong each other .
one living after the maxims of this world and consistent and true to them , the other fired with all divine sentiments , yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense , without submitting to their law .
that is a grief we all feel , a knot we can not untie .
tasso 's is no infrequent case in modern biography .
a man of genius , of an ardent temperament , reckless of physical laws , <unk> , becomes presently unfortunate , <unk> , a " <unk> cousin , " a thorn to himself and to others .
the scholar shames us by his <unk> life .
whilst something higher than <name> is active , he is admirable ; when common sense is wanted , he is an <unk> .
yesterday , caesar was not so great ; to-day , the <unk> at the gallows ' foot is not more miserable .
yesterday , radiant with the light of an ideal world in which he lives , the first of men ; and now oppressed by wants and by sickness , for which he must thank himself .
he resembles the pitiful <unk> whom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of constantinople , who <unk> about all day , yellow , emaciated , ragged , sneaking ; and at evening , when the bazaars are open , slink to the <unk> , swallow their morsel and become tranquil and glorified seers .
and who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties , at last sinking , chilled , exhausted and fruitless , like a giant slaughtered by pins ?
is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and <unk> of this sort , which nature is not slack in sending him , as hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial ?
health , bread , climate , social position , have their importance , and he <name> give them their due .
let him esteem nature a perpetual counsellor , and her <unk> the exact measure of our deviations .
let him make the night night , and the day day .
let him control the habit of expense .
let him see that as much wisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire , and as much wisdom may be drawn from it .
the laws of the world are written out for him on every piece of money in his hand .
there is nothing he <name> not be the better for knowing , were it only the wisdom of poor <name> , or the <unk> <name> of buying by the acre to sell by the foot ; or the thrift of the agriculturist , to stick a tree between whiles , because it <name> grow whilst he sleeps ; or the <name> which consists in <unk> little strokes of the tool , little portions of time , particles of stock and small gains .
the eye of <name> may never shut .
iron , if kept at the <unk> 's , <name> rust ; beer , if not brewed in the right state of the atmosphere , <name> sour ; timber of ships <name> rot at sea , or if laid up high and dry , <name> strain , warp and <unk> ; money , if kept by us , yields no rent and is liable to loss ; if invested , is liable to <unk> of the particular kind of stock .
strike , says the smith , the iron is white ; keep the rake , says the <unk> , as nigh the scythe as you can , and the cart as nigh the rake .
our yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the extreme of this <name> .
it takes <unk> , good , bad , clean , ragged , and saves itself by the speed with which it passes them off .
iron can not rust , nor beer sour , nor timber rot , nor <unk> go out of fashion , nor money stocks <unk> , in the few swift moments in which the yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his possession .
in skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed .
let him learn a <name> of a higher strain .
let him learn that every thing in nature , even <unk> and feathers , go by law and not by luck , and that what he sows he <unk> .
by diligence and self-command let him put the bread he eats at his own disposal , that he may not stand in bitter and false relations to other men ; for the best good of wealth is freedom .
let him practise the minor virtues .
how much of human life is lost in waiting !
let him not make his fellow-creatures wait .
how many words and promises are promises of conversation !
let his be words of fate .
when he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written , amidst a swarming population , let him likewise feel the admonition to <unk> his being across all these <unk> forces , and keep a slender human word among the storms , distances and accidents that drive us hither and thither , and , by persistency , make the paltry force of one man reappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant climates .
we must not try to write the laws of any one virtue , looking at that only .
human nature loves no contradictions , but is symmetrical .
the <name> which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one set of men , whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another , but they are <unk> .
<name> concerns the present time , persons , property and existing forms .
but as every fact hath its roots in the soul , and if the soul were changed , would cease to be , or would become some other thing ,  the proper administration of outward things <name> always rest on a just apprehension of their cause and origin ; that is , the good man <name> be the wise man , and the <unk> the politic man .
every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar , but is a stab at the health of human society .
on the most profitable lie the course of events presently lays a destructive tax ; whilst frankness invites frankness , puts the parties on a convenient footing and makes their business a friendship .
trust men and they <name> be true to you ; treat them greatly and they <name> show themselves great , though they make an exception in your favor to all their rules of trade .
so , in regard to disagreeable and formidable things , <name> does not consist in evasion or in flight , but in courage .
he who wishes to walk in the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself up to resolution .
let him front the object of his worst apprehension , and his <unk> <name> commonly make his fear groundless .
the latin proverb says , " in battles the eye is first overcome . "
entire self-possession may make a battle very little more dangerous to life than a match at <unk> or at football .
examples are cited by soldiers of men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given to it , and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball .
the terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin .
the <unk> , the sailor , <unk> it all day , and his health <unk> itself at as vigorous a pulse under the sleet as under the sun of <name> .
in the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors , fear comes readily to heart and <unk> the consequence of the other party ; but it is a bad counsellor .
every man is actually weak and apparently strong .
to himself he seems weak ; to others , formidable .
you are afraid of grim ; but grim also is afraid of you .
you are solicitous of the good-will of the meanest person , uneasy at his ill-will .
but the <unk> offender of your peace and of the neighborhood , if you rip up his claims , is as thin and timid as any , and the peace of society is often kept , because , as children say , one is afraid , and the other dares not .
far off , men swell , bully and threaten ; bring them hand to hand , and they are a feeble folk .
it is a proverb that <unk> costs nothing ' ; but calculation might come to value love for its profit .
love is fabled to be blind , but kindness is necessary to perception ; love is not a hood , but an <unk> .
if you meet a <unk> or a hostile partisan , never recognize the dividing lines , but meet on what common ground remains ,  if only that the sun shines and the rain rains for both ; the area <name> widen very fast , and ere you know it , the boundary mountains on which the eye had fastened have melted into air .
if they set out to contend , saint <name> <name> lie and saint <name> <name> hate .
what low , poor , paltry , hypocritical people an argument on religion <name> make of the pure and chosen souls !
they <name> shuffle and crow , crook and hide , feign to confess here , only that they may brag and conquer there , and not a thought has enriched either party , and not an emotion of bravery , modesty , or <name> .
so neither should you put yourself in a false position with your contemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and bitterness .
though your views are in straight antagonism to theirs , assume an identity of sentiment , assume that you are saying precisely that which all think , and in the flow of wit and love roll out your <unk> in solid column , with not the infirmity of a doubt .
so at least shall you get an adequate deliverance .
the natural motions of the soul are so much better than the voluntary ones that you <name> never do yourself justice in dispute .
the thought is not then taken hold of by the right handle , does not show itself proportioned and in its true bearings , but bears extorted , hoarse , and half witness .
but assume a consent and it shall presently be granted , since really and underneath their external diversities , all men are of one heart and mind .
wisdom <name> never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly footing .
we refuse sympathy and intimacy with people , as if we waited for some better sympathy and intimacy to come .
but whence and when ?
to-morrow <name> be like to-day .
life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live .
our friends and <unk> die off from us .
scarcely can we say we see new men , new women , approaching us .
we are too old to regard fashion , too old to expect patronage of any greater or more powerful .
let us suck the sweetness of those affections and <unk> that grow near us .
these old shoes are easy to the feet .
undoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company , can easily whisper names prouder , and that tickle the fancy more .
every man 's imagination hath its friends ; and life would be dearer with such companions .
but if you can not have them on good mutual terms , you can not have them .
if not the deity but our ambition <unk> and shapes the new relations , their virtue escapes , as strawberries lose their flavor in <unk> .
thus truth , frankness , courage , love , humility and all the virtues range themselves on the side of <name> , or the <name> of securing a present well-being .
i do not know if all matter <name> be found to be made of one element , as oxygen or hydrogen , at last , but the world of manners and actions is wrought of one stuff , and begin where we <name> we are pretty sure in a short space to be mumbling our ten commandments .

" paradise is under the shadow of swords . "
mahomet .
<name> wine is drunk by knaves , sugar spends to <unk> slaves , rose and <unk> deck <unk> ; <unk> are jove 's <unk> , drooping oft in wreaths of dread <unk> round his head ; the hero is not fed on sweets , daily his own heart he eats ; chambers of the great are jails , and <unk> right for <name> sails .

heroism .
in the elder english <unk> , and mainly in the plays of beaumont and <name> , there is a constant recognition of <unk> , as if a <name> behavior were as easily marked in the society of their age as color is in our american population .
when any <name> , <name> or <unk> enters , though he be a stranger , the duke or governor exclaims , 'this is a gentleman ,  and <unk> <unk> without end ; but all the rest are slag and refuse .
in <name> with this delight in personal advantages there is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character and dialogue ,  as in <unk> , sophocles , the mad lover , the double marriage ,  wherein the speaker is so <name> and cordial and on such deep grounds of character , that the dialogue , on the slightest additional incident in the plot , rises naturally into poetry .
among many texts take the following .
the <name> martius has conquered athens ,  all but the invincible spirits of sophocles , the duke of athens , and <unk> , his wife .
the beauty of the latter <unk> martius , and he seeks to save her husband ; but sophocles <name> not ask his life , although assured that a word <name> save him , and the execution of both proceeds :  <unk> .
bid thy wife farewell .
<unk> .
no , i <name> take no leave .
my <unk> , yonder , above , 'bout <unk> 's crown , my spirit shall hover for thee .
prithee , haste .
<unk> .
stay , sophocles ,  with this tie up my sight ; let not soft nature so transformed be , and lose her gentler <unk> humanity , to make me see my lord bleed .
so , 't is well ; never one object underneath the sun <name> i behold before my sophocles : farewell ; now teach the romans how to die .
mar .
dost know what 't is to die ?
<unk> .
thou dost not , martius , and , therefore , not what 't is to live ; to die is to begin to live .
it is to end an old , stale , weary work , and to commence a newer and a better .
't is to leave deceitful knaves for the society of gods and goodness .
thou thyself must part at last from all thy garlands , pleasures , triumphs , and prove thy fortitude what then 't <name> do .
<name> .
but <name> not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus ?
<unk> .
why should i grieve or vex for being sent to them i ever loved best ?
now i 'll kneel , but with my back toward thee ; 't is the last duty this trunk can do the gods .
mar .
strike , strike , <unk> , or martius ' heart <name> leap out at his mouth .
this is a man , a woman .
kiss thy lord , and live with all the freedom you were wont .
o love !
thou doubly hast afflicted me with virtue and with beauty .
treacherous heart , my hand shall cast thee quick into my urn , ere thou <unk> this knot of piety .
<name> .
what ails my brother ?
<unk> .
martius , o martius , thou now hast found a way to conquer me .
<unk> .
o <name> of rome !
what gratitude can speak fit words to follow such a deed as this ?
mar .
this admirable duke , <unk> , with his disdain of fortune and of death , <unk> himself , has captivated me , and though my arm hath <unk> his body here , his soul hath <unk> martius ' soul .
by romulus , he is all soul , i think ; he hath no flesh , and spirit can not be <unk> ; then we have vanquished nothing ; he is free , and martius walks now in captivity .
i do not readily remember any poem , play , sermon , novel , or oration that our press vents in the last few years , which goes to the same tune .
we have a great many <unk> and <unk> , but not often the sound of any fife .
yet , wordsworth 's " <unk> , " and the ode of " <name> , " and some <unk> , have a certain <name> music ; and <name> <name> sometimes draw a stroke like the portrait of lord <unk> given by <unk> of burley .
<name> carlyle , with his natural taste for what is manly and daring in character , has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical and historical pictures .
earlier , <name> burns has given us a song or two .
in the <unk> <unk> there is an account of the battle of <unk> which deserves to be read .
and <name> <unk> history of the saracens <unk> the prodigies of individual valor , with admiration all the more evident on the part of the <unk> that he seems to think that his place in <name> oxford requires of him some proper protestations of abhorrence .
but if we explore the literature of heroism we shall quickly come to plutarch , who is its doctor and historian .
to him we owe the <unk> , the <name> , the <unk> , the scipio of old , and i must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the ancient writers .
each of his " lives " is a refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and political <unk> .
a wild courage , a <unk> not of the schools but of the blood , shines in every anecdote , and has given that book its immense fame .
we need books of this <unk> <unk> virtue more than books of political science or of private economy .
life is a festival only to the wise .
seen from the nook and <unk> of <name> , it wears a ragged and dangerous front .
the <unk> of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also .
the disease and deformity around us certify the <unk> of natural , intellectual , and moral laws , and often violation on violation to breed such compound misery .
a <unk> that bends a man 's head back to his heels ; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes ; insanity that makes him eat grass ; war , plague , cholera , famine , indicate a certain ferocity in nature , which , as it had its inlet by human crime , must have its outlet by human suffering .
unhappily no man exists who has not in his own person become to some amount a <unk> in the sin , and so made himself liable to a share in the <unk> .
our culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man .
let him hear in season that he is born into the state of war , and that the commonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go dancing in the weeds of peace , but warned , <unk> and neither defying nor dreading the thunder , let him take both reputation and life in his hand , and , with perfect <unk> dare the <unk> and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech and the <unk> of his behavior .
towards all this external evil the man within the breast assumes a warlike attitude , and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with the infinite army of enemies .
to this military attitude of the soul we give the name of heroism .
its rudest form is the contempt for safety and ease , which makes the attractiveness of war .
it is a self-trust which <unk> the restraints of <name> , in the <unk> of its energy and power to repair the harms it may suffer .
the hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his <name> , but pleasantly and as it were merrily he advances to his own music , alike in frightful alarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal <unk> .
there is somewhat not philosophical in heroism ; there is somewhat not holy in it ; it seems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it ; it has pride ; it is the extreme of individual nature .
nevertheless we must profoundly revere it .
there is somewhat in great actions which does not allow us to go behind them .
heroism feels and never reasons , and therefore is always right ; and although a different breeding , different religion and greater intellectual activity would have modified or even reversed the particular action , yet for the hero that thing he does is the highest deed , and is not open to the censure of philosophers or <unk> .
it is the <unk> of the <unk> man that he finds a quality in him that is negligent of expense , of health , of life , of danger , of hatred , of reproach , and knows that his <name> is higher and more excellent than all actual and all possible antagonists .
heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in contradiction , for a time , to the voice of the great and good .
heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual 's character .
now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him , for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than any one else .
therefore just and wise men take <unk> at his act , until after some little time be past : then they see it to be in unison with their acts .
all prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity ; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good .
but it finds its own success at last , and then the prudent also <unk> .
self-trust is the essence of heroism .
it is the state of the soul at war , and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and wrong , and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents .
it speaks the truth and it is just , generous , hospitable , temperate , scornful of petty calculations and scornful of being scorned .
it <unk> ; it is of an undaunted boldness and of a fortitude not to be wearied out .
its jest is the littleness of common life .
that false <name> which <unk> on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of heroism .
heroism , like <unk> , is almost ashamed of its body .
what shall it say then to the <unk> and <unk> , to the toilet , compliments , quarrels , cards and <unk> , which rack the wit of all society ?
what joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures !
there seems to be no interval between greatness and meanness .
when the spirit is not master of the world , then it is its dupe .
yet the little man takes the great hoax so innocently , works in it so headlong and believing , is born red , and dies gray , arranging his toilet , attending on his own health , laying traps for sweet food and strong wine , setting his heart on a horse or a rifle , made happy with a little gossip or a little praise , that the great soul can not choose but laugh at such <name> nonsense .
" indeed , these humble considerations make me out of love with greatness .
what a disgrace is it to me to take note how many pairs of silk stockings thou hast , namely , these and those that were the <unk> ones ; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts , as one for <unk> , and one other for use ! "
citizens , thinking after the laws of arithmetic , consider the inconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside , reckon narrowly the loss of time and the unusual display ; the soul of a better quality thrusts back the <unk> economy into the vaults of life , and says , i <name> obey the god , and the sacrifice and the fire he <name> provide .
<unk> <unk> , the arabian <unk> , describes a heroic extreme in the hospitality of <unk> , in <unk> .
" when i was in <unk> i saw a great building , like a palace , the gates of which were open and fixed back to the wall with large nails .
i asked the reason , and was told that the house had not been shut , night or day , for a hundred years .
strangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number ; the master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals , and is never happier than when they tarry for some time .
nothing of the kind have i seen in any other country . "
the magnanimous know very well that they who give time , or money , or shelter , to the stranger ,  so it be done for love and not for ostentation ,  do , as it were , put god under obligation to them , so perfect are the compensations of the universe .
in some way the time they seem to lose is redeemed and the pains they seem to take <unk> themselves .
these men fan the flame of human love and raise the standard of civil virtue among mankind .
but hospitality must be for service and not for show , or it pulls down the host .
the brave soul rates itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies .
it gives what it hath , and all it hath , but its own majesty can lend a better <name> to <unk> and fair water than belong to city feasts .
the temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor to the <unk> he has .
but he loves it for its <unk> , not for its <unk> .
it seems not worth his while to be solemn and denounce with bitterness <unk> or <unk> , the use of tobacco , or opium , or tea , or silk , or gold .
a great man scarcely knows how he <unk> , how he dresses ; but without railing or precision his living is natural and poetic .
<name> eliot , the indian apostle , drank water , and said of wine ,  " it is a <name> , generous liquor and we should be humbly thankful for it , but , as i remember , water was made before it . "
better still is the temperance of king <name> , who poured out on the ground unto the lord the water which three of his warriors had brought him to drink , at the peril of their lives .
it is told of brutus , that when he fell on his sword after the battle of philippi , he quoted a line of <unk> ,  " o virtue !
i have followed thee through life , and i find thee at last but a shade . "
i doubt not the hero is <unk> by this report .
the heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness .
it does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm .
the essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough .
poverty is its ornament .
it does not need plenty , and can very well abide its loss .
but that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class , is the <unk> and hilarity they exhibit .
it is a height to which common duty can very well attain , to suffer and to dare with solemnity .
but these rare souls set opinion , success , and life at so cheap a rate that they <name> not soothe their enemies by petitions , or the show of sorrow , but wear their own habitual greatness .
scipio , charged with <unk> , refuses to do himself so great a disgrace as to wait for justification , though he had the scroll of his accounts in his hands , but tears it to pieces before the <unk> .
socrates 's condemnation of himself to be maintained in all honor in the <unk> , during his life , and sir <name> more 's <unk> at the scaffold , are of the same strain .
in beaumont and <name> 's " sea voyage , " <unk> tells the stout captain and his company ,  <unk> .
why , slaves , 't is in our power to <name> ye .
master .
very likely , 't is in our powers , then , to be hanged , and scorn ye .
these replies are sound and whole .
sport is the bloom and glow of a perfect health .
the great <name> not condescend to take any thing seriously ; all must be as <name> as the song of a canary , though it were the building of cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches and nations which have <unk> the earth long thousands of years .
simple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind them , and play their own game in innocent defiance of the <unk> of the world ; and such would appear , could we see the human race assembled in vision , like little children frolicking together , though to the eyes of mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and influences .
the interest these fine stories have for us , the power of a romance over the boy who <unk> the forbidden book under his bench at school , our delight in the hero , is the main fact to our purpose .
all these great and transcendent properties are ours .
if we <unk> in beholding the greek energy , the <name> pride , it is that we are already <unk> the same sentiment .
let us find room for this great guest in our small houses .
the first step of <unk> <name> be to <unk> us of our superstitious associations with places and times , with number and size .
why should these words , athenian , <name> , <name> and england , so tingle in the ear ?
where the heart is , there the muses , there the gods sojourn , and not in any geography of fame .
massachusetts , connecticut river and boston bay you think paltry places , and the ear loves names of foreign and classic <unk> .
but here we are ; and , if we <name> tarry a little , we may come to learn that here is best .
see to it only that thyself is here , and <name> and nature , <name> and fate , friends , angels and the supreme being shall not be absent from the chamber where thou <unk> .
<unk> , brave and affectionate , does not seem to us to need olympus to die upon , nor the syrian <name> .
he lies very well where he is .
the <unk> were handsome ground enough for washington to tread , and london streets for the feet of <name> .
a great man makes his climate genial in the imagination of men , and its air the beloved element of all delicate spirits .
that country is the fairest which is inhabited by the noblest minds .
the pictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions of pericles , xenophon , <name> , bayard , <name> , hampden , teach us how <unk> mean our life is ; that we , by the depth of our living , should deck it with more than regal or national splendor , and act on principles that should interest man and nature in the length of our days .
we have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men who never ripened , or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary .
when we see their air and mien , when we hear them speak of society , of books , of religion , we admire their superiority ; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state ; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions .
but they enter an active profession and the forming colossus shrinks to the common size of man .
the magic they used was the ideal tendencies , which always make the actual ridiculous ; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they put their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow .
they found no example and no companion , and their heart fainted .
what then ?
the lesson they gave in their first aspirations is yet true ; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief .
or why should a woman <unk> herself to any historical woman , and think , because <unk> , or <unk> , or de <unk> , or the <unk> souls who have had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the serene <unk> , none can ,  certainly not she ?
why not ?
she has a new and <unk> problem to solve , perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed .
let the maiden , with erect soul , walk serenely on her way , accept the hint of each new experience , search in turn all the objects that solicit her eye , that she may learn the power and the charm of her new-born being , which is the kindling of a new <name> in the recesses of space .
the fair girl who <unk> interference by a decided and proud choice of influences , so careless of pleasing , so wilful and lofty , inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness .
the silent heart encourages her ; o friend , never strike sail to a fear !
come into port greatly , or sail with god the seas .
not in vain you live , for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision .
the characteristic of heroism is its persistency .
all men have wandering impulses , fits and starts of generosity .
but when you have chosen your part , abide by it , and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world .
the heroic can not be the common , nor the common the heroic .
yet we have the weakness to expect the sympathy of people in those actions whose excellence is that they outrun sympathy and appeal to a tardy justice .
if you would serve your brother , because it is fit for you to serve him , do not take back your words when you find that prudent people do not commend you .
adhere to your own act , and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age .
it was a high counsel that i once heard given to a young person ,  " always do what you are afraid to do . "
a simple manly character need never make an apology , but should regard its past action with the calmness of <unk> , when he admitted that the event of the battle was happy , yet did not regret his <unk> from the battle .
there is no weakness or exposure for which we can not find consolation in the thought  this is a part of my constitution , part of my relation and office to my fellow-creature .
has nature <unk> with me that i should never appear to disadvantage , never make a ridiculous figure ?
let us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money .
greatness once and for ever has done with opinion .
we tell our charities , not because we wish to be praised for them , not because we think they have great merit , but for our justification .
it is a capital blunder ; as you discover when another man <unk> his charities .
to speak the truth , even with some <unk> , to live with some <unk> of temperance , or some extremes of generosity , seems to be an <unk> which common <unk> would appoint to those who are at ease and in plenty , in sign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude of suffering men .
and not only need we breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties of <unk> , of debt , of solitude , of <unk> ,  but it <unk> the wise man to look with a bold eye into those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men , and to <unk> himself with disgusting forms of disease , with sounds of <unk> , and the vision of violent death .
times of heroism are generally times of terror , but the day never shines in which this element may not work .
the circumstances of man , we say , are historically somewhat better in this country and at this hour than perhaps ever before .
more freedom exists for culture .
it <name> not now run against an axe at the first step out of the beaten track of opinion .
but whoso is heroic <name> always find crises to try his edge .
human virtue demands her champions and martyrs , and the trial of persecution always proceeds .
it is but the other day that the brave lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob , for the rights of free speech and opinion , and died when it was better not to live .
i see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk , but after the counsel of his own bosom .
let him quit too much association , let him go home much , and <unk> himself in those courses he <unk> .
the <unk> retention of simple and high sentiments in obscure duties is <unk> the character to that temper which <name> work with honor , if need be in the tumult , or on the scaffold .
whatever outrages have happened to men may befall a man again ; and very easily in a republic , if there appear any signs of a decay of religion .
coarse slander , fire , tar and feathers and the <unk> , the youth may freely bring home to his mind and with what sweetness of temper he can , and inquire how fast he can fix his sense of duty , <unk> such penalties , whenever it may please the next newspaper and a sufficient number of his neighbors to pronounce his opinions incendiary .
it may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most susceptible heart to see how quick a bound nature has set to the utmost infliction of malice .
we rapidly approach a brink over which no enemy can follow us :  " let them rave : thou <name> quiet in thy grave . "
in the gloom of our ignorance of what shall be , in the hour when we are deaf to the higher voices , who does not envy those who have seen safely to an end their <unk> endeavor ?
who that sees the meanness of our politics but <unk> <unk> washington that he is long already wrapped in his shroud , and for ever safe ; that he was laid sweet in his grave , the <name> of humanity not yet <unk> in him ?
who does not sometimes envy the good and brave who are no more to suffer from the <unk> of the natural world , and await with curious complacency the speedy term of his own conversation with finite nature ?
and yet the love that <name> be annihilated sooner than treacherous has already made death impossible , and affirms itself no mortal but a native of the deeps of absolute and <unk> being .
***** the <unk> .
" but souls that of his own good life partake , he loves as his own self ; dear as his eye they are to him : he 'll never them forsake : when they shall die , then god himself shall die : they live , they live in blest eternity . "
<name> more .
space is ample , east and west , but two can not go abreast , can not travel in it two : yonder masterful cuckoo crowds every egg out of the nest , quick or dead , except its own ; a spell is laid on sod and stone , night and day 've been tampered with , every quality and pith <unk> and sultry with a power that works its <name> on age and hour .
ix .
the <unk> .
there is a difference between one and another hour of life in their authority and subsequent effect .
our <name> comes in moments ; our vice is habitual .
yet there is a depth in those brief moments which <unk> us to <unk> more reality to them than to all other experiences .
for this reason the argument which is always forthcoming to silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes of man , namely the appeal to experience , is for ever invalid and vain .
we give up the past to the <unk> , and yet we <name> .
he must explain this <name> .
we <name> that human life is mean , but how did we find out that it was mean ?
what is the ground of this uneasiness of ours ; of this old discontent ?
what is the universal sense of want and ignorance , but the fine <unk> by which the soul makes its enormous claim ?
why do men feel that the natural history of man has never been written , but he is always leaving behind what you have said of him , and it becomes old , and books of metaphysics worthless ?
the philosophy of six thousand years has not searched the chambers and magazines of the soul .
in its experiments there has always remained , in the last analysis , a <unk> it could not resolve .
man is a stream whose source is hidden .
our being is descending into us from we know not whence .
the most exact <unk> has no <unk> that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next moment .
i am constrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin for events than the <name> i call mine .
as with events , so is it with thoughts .
when i watch that flowing river , which , out of regions i see not , pours for a season its streams into me , i see that i am a <unk> ; not a cause , but a surprised spectator of this ethereal water ; that i <name> and look up and put myself in the attitude of reception , but from some alien energy the visions come .
the supreme critic on the errors of the past and the present , and the only prophet of that which must be , is that great nature in which we rest as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere ; that unity , that <unk> , within which every man 's particular being is contained and made one with all other ; that common heart of which all sincere conversation is the worship , to which all right action is submission ; that overpowering reality which <unk> our tricks and talents , and <unk> every one to pass for what he is , and to speak from his character and not from his tongue , and which evermore tends to pass into our thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power and beauty .
we live in succession , in division , in parts , in particles .
meantime within man is the soul of the whole ; the wise silence ; the universal beauty , to which every part and particle is equally related ; the eternal one .
and this deep power in which we exist and whose <unk> is all accessible to us , is not only <unk> and perfect in every hour , but the act of seeing and the thing seen , the seer and the spectacle , the subject and the object , are one .
we see the world piece by piece , as the sun , the moon , the animal , the tree ; but the whole , of which these are the shining parts , is the soul .
only by the vision of that wisdom can the horoscope of the ages be read , and by falling back on our better thoughts , by yielding to the spirit of prophecy which is innate in every man , we can know what it saith .
every man 's words who speaks from that life must sound vain to those who do not dwell in the same thought on their own part .
i dare not speak for it .
my words do not <name> its <name> sense ; they fall short and cold .
only itself can inspire whom it <name> , and behold !
their speech shall be <unk> , and sweet , and universal as the rising of the wind .
yet i <name> , even by profane words , if i may not use sacred , to indicate the heaven of this deity and to report what hints i have collected of the transcendent simplicity and energy of the highest law .
if we consider what happens in conversation , in reveries , in remorse , in times of passion , in surprises , in the instructions of dreams , wherein often we see ourselves in masquerade ,  the droll disguises only <unk> and <unk> a real element and forcing it on our distinct notice ,  we shall catch many hints that <name> <unk> and lighten into knowledge of the secret of nature .
all goes to show that the soul in man is not an organ , but <unk> and exercises all the organs ; is not a function , like the power of memory , of calculation , of comparison , but uses these as hands and feet ; is not a faculty , but a light ; is not the intellect or the <name> , but the master of the intellect and the <name> ; is the background of our being , in which they lie ,  an immensity not possessed and that can not be possessed .
from within or from behind , a light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are nothing , but the light is all .
a man is the facade of a <name> wherein all wisdom and all good abide .
what we commonly call man , the eating , drinking , planting , counting man , does not , as we know him , represent himself , but <unk> himself .
him we do not respect , but the soul , whose organ he is , would he let it appear through his action , would make our knees bend .
when it breathes through his intellect , it is genius ; when it breathes through his <name> , it is virtue ; when it flows through his affection , it is love .
and the blindness of the intellect begins when it would be something of itself .
the weakness of the <name> begins when the individual would be something of himself .
all reform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through us ; in other words , to engage us to obey .
of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible .
language can not paint it with his colors .
it is too <unk> .
it is <unk> , <unk> ; but we know that it pervades and contains us .
we know that all spiritual being is in man .
a wise old proverb says , " god comes to see us without <name> ; " that is , as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens , so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man , the effect , ceases , and god , the cause , begins .
the walls are taken away .
we lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature , to the attributes of god .
justice we see and know , love , freedom , power .
these natures no man ever got above , but they tower over us , and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them .
the sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its <unk> of those limitations which <unk> us on every hand .
the soul <unk> all things .
as i have said , it <unk> all experience .
in like manner it <unk> time and space .
the influence of the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that degree that the walls of time and space have come to look real and insurmountable ; and to speak with levity of these limits is , in the world , the sign of insanity .
yet time and space are but inverse measures of the force of the soul .
the spirit sports with time ,  " can crowd eternity into an hour , or stretch an hour to eternity . "
we are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that which is measured from the year of our natural birth .
some thoughts always find us young , and keep us so .
such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal beauty .
every man parts from that contemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life .
the least activity of the intellectual powers <unk> us in a degree from the conditions of time .
in sickness , in <unk> , give us a strain of poetry or a profound sentence , and we are refreshed ; or produce a volume of plato or shakspeare , or remind us of their names , and instantly we come into a feeling of longevity .
see how the deep divine thought reduces centuries and <unk> and makes itself present through all ages .
is the teaching of christ less effective now than it was when first his mouth was opened ?
the emphasis of facts and persons in my thought has nothing to do with time .
and so always the soul 's scale is one , the scale of the senses and the understanding is another .
before the revelations of the soul , time , space and nature shrink away .
in common speech we refer all things to time , as we habitually refer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere .
and so we say that the judgment is distant or near , that the <unk> approaches , that a day of certain political , moral , social reforms is at hand , and the like , when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we contemplate is external and fugitive , and the other is permanent and <unk> with the soul .
the things we now esteem fixed shall , one by one , detach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience , and fall .
the wind shall blow them none knows whither .
the landscape , the figures , boston , london , are facts as fugitive as any institution past , or any whiff of mist or smoke , and so is society , and so is the world .
the soul <unk> steadily forwards , creating a world before her , leaving worlds behind her .
she has no dates , nor rites , nor persons , nor <unk> nor men .
the soul knows only the soul ; the web of events is the flowing robe in which she is clothed .
after its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of its progress to be <unk> .
the soul 's advances are not made by gradation , such as can be represented by motion in a straight line , but rather by ascension of state , such as can be represented by metamorphosis ,  from the egg to the worm , from the worm to the fly .
the growths of genius are of a certain total character , that does not advance the elect individual first over <name> , then <name> , then <name> , and give to each the pain of discovered inferiority ,  but by every <unk> of growth the man expands there where he works , passing , at each <unk> , classes , populations , of men .
with each divine impulse the mind <unk> the thin <unk> of the visible and finite , and comes out into eternity , and inspires and <unk> its air .
it <unk> with truths that have always been spoken in the world , and becomes conscious of a closer sympathy with <unk> and <unk> than with persons in the house .
this is the law of moral and of mental gain .
the simple rise as by specific levity not into a particular virtue , but into the region of all the virtues .
they are in the spirit which contains them all .
the soul requires purity , but purity is not it ; requires justice , but justice is not that ; requires <unk> , but is somewhat better ; so that there is a kind of descent and accommodation felt when we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue which it <unk> .
to the well-born child all the virtues are natural , and not painfully acquired .
speak to his heart , and the man becomes suddenly virtuous .
within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth , which obeys the same law .
those who are capable of humility , of justice , of love , of aspiration , stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts , speech and poetry , action and <name> .
for whoso dwells in this moral <unk> already <unk> those special powers which men prize so highly .
the lover has no talent , no skill , which passes for quite nothing with his <unk> maiden , however little she may possess of related faculty ; and the heart which <unk> itself to the supreme mind finds itself related to all its works , and <name> travel a <name> road to particular <unk> and powers .
in ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station on the circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world , where , as in the closet of god , we see causes , and anticipate the universe , which is but a slow effect .
one mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the spirit in a form ,  in forms , like my own .
i live in society , with persons who answer to thoughts in my own mind , or express a certain obedience to the great instincts to which i live .
i see its presence to them .
i am certified of a common nature ; and these other souls , these separated selves , draw me as nothing else can .
they stir in me the new emotions we call passion ; of love , hatred , fear , admiration , pity ; thence come conversation , competition , persuasion , cities and war .
persons are supplementary to the primary teaching of the soul .
in youth we are mad for persons .
childhood and youth see all the world in them .
but the larger experience of man discovers the identical nature appearing through them all .
persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal .
in all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made , as to a third party , to a common nature .
that third party or common nature is not social ; it is impersonal ; is god .
and so in groups where debate is <name> , and especially on high questions , the company become aware that the thought rises to an equal level in all bosoms , that all have a spiritual property in what was said , as well as the <unk> .
they all become wiser than they were .
it arches over them like a <name> , this unity of thought in which every heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty , and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity .
all are conscious of attaining to a higher self-possession .
it shines for all .
there is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest , and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and <unk> .
the mind is one , and the best minds , who love truth for its own sake , think much less of property in truth .
they accept it <unk> everywhere , and do not label or stamp it with any man 's name , for it is theirs long beforehand , and from eternity .
the learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom .
their violence of direction in some degree <unk> them to think truly .
we owe many valuable observations to people who are not very acute or profound , and who say the thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in vain .
the action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left <unk> than in that which is said in any conversation .
it broods over every society , and they unconsciously seek for it in each other .
we know better than we do .
we do not yet possess ourselves , and we know at the same time that we are much more .
i feel the same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbors , that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this <unk> , and jove nods to jove from behind each of us .
men descend to meet .
in their habitual and mean service to the world , for which they forsake their native nobleness , they resemble those arabian <unk> who dwell in mean houses and affect an external poverty , to escape the <unk> of the <unk> , and reserve all their display of wealth for their interior and guarded <unk> .
as it is present in all persons , so it is in every period of life .
it is adult already in the infant man .
in my dealing with my child , my latin and greek , my accomplishments and my money stead me nothing ; but as much soul as i have avails .
if i am wilful , he sets his <name> against mine , one for one , and leaves me , if i please , the degradation of beating him by my superiority of strength .
but if i renounce my <name> and act for the soul , setting that up as umpire between us two , out of his young eyes looks the same soul ; he <unk> and loves with me .
the soul is the <unk> and <unk> of truth .
we know truth when we see it , let <unk> and <unk> say what they choose .
foolish people ask you , when you have spoken what they do not wish to hear , 'how do you know it is truth , and not an error of your own ? '
we know truth when we see it , from opinion , as we know when we are awake that we are awake .
it was a grand sentence of <name> swedenborg , which would alone indicate the greatness of that man 's perception ,  " it is no proof of a man's understanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases ; but to be able to discern that what is true is true , and that what is false is false ,  this is the <name> and character of intelligence . "
in the book i read , the good thought returns to me , as every truth <name> , the image of the whole soul .
to the bad thought which i find in it , the same soul becomes a discerning , separating sword , and <unk> it away .
we are wiser than we know .
if we <name> not interfere with our thought , but <name> act entirely , or see how the thing stands in god , we know the particular thing , and every thing , and every man .
for the maker of all things and all persons stands behind us and casts his dread <unk> through us over things .
but beyond this recognition of its own in particular passages of the individual 's experience , it also reveals truth .
and here we should seek to <unk> ourselves by its very presence , and to speak with a worthier , loftier strain of that advent .
for the soul 's communication of truth is the highest event in nature , since it then does not give somewhat from itself , but it gives itself , or passes into and becomes that man whom it <unk> ; or , in proportion to that truth he receives , it takes him to itself .
we distinguish the <unk> of the soul , its manifestations of its own nature , by the term revelation .
these are always attended by the emotion of the sublime .
for this communication is an influx of the divine mind into our mind .
it is an ebb of the individual rivulet before the flowing surges of the sea of life .
every distinct apprehension of this central commandment <unk> men with awe and delight .
a thrill passes through all men at the reception of new truth , or at the performance of a great action , which comes out of the heart of nature .
in these communications the power to see is not separated from the <name> to do , but the insight proceeds from obedience , and the obedience proceeds from a joyful perception .
every moment when the individual feels himself invaded by it is memorable .
by the necessity of our constitution a certain enthusiasm attends the individual 's consciousness of that divine presence .
the character and duration of this enthusiasm varies with the state of the individual , from an ecstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration ,  which is its rarer appearance ,  to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion , in which form it <unk> , like our household fires , all the families and associations of men , and makes society possible .
a certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening of the religious sense in men , as if they had been " blasted with excess of light . "
the <unk> of socrates , the " union " of <unk> , the vision of porphyry , the conversion of <name> , the <name> of <unk> , the convulsions of <name> fox and his <unk> , the illumination of swedenborg , are of this kind .
what was in the case of these remarkable persons a <unk> , has , in innumerable instances in common life , been exhibited in less striking manner .
everywhere the history of religion betrays a tendency to enthusiasm .
the rapture of the <unk> and <unk> ; the opening of the internal sense of the word , in the language of the new jerusalem church ; the revival of the <unk> churches ; the experiences of the methodists , are varying forms of that shudder of awe and delight with which the individual soul always <unk> with the universal soul .
the nature of these revelations is the same ; they are perceptions of the absolute law .
they are solutions of the soul 's own questions .
they do not answer the questions which the understanding asks .
the soul answers never by words , but by the thing itself that is inquired after .
revelation is the disclosure of the soul .
the popular notion of a revelation is that it is a telling of fortunes .
in past oracles of the soul the understanding seeks to find answers to sensual questions , and undertakes to tell from god how long men shall exist , what their hands shall do and who shall be their company , adding names and dates and places .
but we must pick no locks .
we must check this low curiosity .
an answer in words is <unk> ; it is really no answer to the questions you ask .
do not require a description of the countries towards which you sail .
the description does not describe them to you , and to-morrow you arrive there and know them by inhabiting them .
men ask concerning the immortality of the soul , the employments of heaven , the state of the sinner , and so forth .
they even dream that <name> has left replies to precisely these <unk> .
never a moment did that sublime spirit speak in their <unk> .
to truth , justice , love , the attributes of the soul , the idea of <unk> is essentially associated .
<name> , living in these moral sentiments , heedless of sensual fortunes , heeding only the manifestations of these , never made the separation of the idea of duration from the essence of these attributes , nor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul .
it was left to his disciples to sever duration from the moral elements , and to teach the immortality of the soul as a doctrine , and maintain it by evidences .
the moment the doctrine of the immortality is separately taught , man is already fallen .
in the flowing of love , in the adoration of humility , there is no question of continuance .
no inspired man ever asks this question or <unk> to these evidences .
for the soul is true to itself , and the man in whom it is shed abroad can not wander from the present , which is infinite , to a future which would be finite .
these questions which we lust to ask about the future are a confession of sin .
god has no answer for them .
no answer in words can reply to a question of things .
it is not in an arbitrary " decree of god , " but in the nature of man , that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow ; for the soul <name> not have us read any other cipher than that of cause and effect .
by this veil which curtains events it <unk> the children of men to live in to-day .
the only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions of the senses is to forego all low curiosity , and , accepting the tide of being which floats us into the secret of nature , work and live , work and live , and all unawares the advancing soul has built and forged for itself a new condition , and the question and the answer are one .
by the same fire , vital , <unk> , celestial , which burns until it shall dissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of light , we see and know each other , and what spirit each is of .
who can tell the grounds of his knowledge of the character of the several individuals in his circle of friends ?
no man .
yet their acts and words do not disappoint him .
in that man , though he knew no ill of him , he put no trust .
in that other , though they had seldom met , authentic signs had yet passed , to signify that he might be trusted as one who had an interest in his own character .
we know each other very well ,  which of us has been just to himself and whether that which we teach or behold is only an aspiration or is our honest effort also .
we are all <unk> of spirits .
that diagnosis lies aloft in our life or unconscious power .
the intercourse of society , its trade , its religion , its friendships , its quarrels , is one wide , judicial investigation of character .
in full court , or in small committee , or confronted face to face , accuser and accused , men offer themselves to be judged .
against their <name> they exhibit those decisive trifles by which character is read .
but who judges ?
and what ?
not our understanding .
we do not read them by learning or craft .
no ; the wisdom of the wise man consists herein , that he does not judge them ; he lets them judge themselves and merely reads and records their own verdict .
by virtue of this inevitable nature , private <name> is overpowered , and , <unk> our efforts or our <unk> , your genius <name> speak from you , and mine from me .
that which we are , we shall teach , not voluntarily but involuntarily .
thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open , and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened .
character teaches over our head .
the infallible index of true progress is found in the tone the man takes .
neither his age , nor his breeding , nor company , nor books , nor actions , nor talents , nor all together can hinder him from being deferential to a higher spirit than his own .
if he have not found his home in god , his manners , his forms of speech , the turn of his sentences , the build , shall i say , of all his opinions <name> involuntarily confess it , let him brave it out how he <name> .
if he have found his centre , the deity <name> shine through him , through all the disguises of ignorance , of <unk> temperament , of unfavorable circumstance .
the tone of seeking is one , and the tone of having is another .
the great distinction between teachers sacred or literary ,  between poets like <name> , and poets like pope ,  between philosophers like <unk> , kant and coleridge , and philosophers like locke , <unk> , mackintosh and <name> ,  between men of the world who are reckoned accomplished talkers , and here and there a fervent mystic , <unk> half insane under the infinitude of his thought ,  is that one class speak from within , or from experience , as parties and possessors of the fact ; and the other class from without , as spectators merely , or perhaps as acquainted with the fact on the evidence of third persons .
it is of no use to preach to me from without .
i can do that too easily myself .
<name> speaks always from within , and in a degree that transcends all others .
in that is the miracle .
i believe beforehand that it ought so to be .
all men stand continually in the expectation of the appearance of such a teacher .
but if a man do not speak from within the veil , where the word is one with that it tells of , let him lowly confess it .
the same <unk> flows into the intellect , and makes what we call genius .
much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom , and the most illuminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame , and are not writers .
among the multitude of scholars and authors , we feel no <unk> presence ; we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than of inspiration ; they have a light and know not whence it comes and call it their own ; their talent is some exaggerated faculty , some overgrown member , so that their strength is a disease .
in these instances the intellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue , but almost of vice ; and we feel that a man 's talents stand in the way of his advancement in truth .
but genius is religious .
it is a larger <unk> of the common heart .
it is not anomalous , but more like and not less like other men .
there is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which is superior to any talents they exercise .
the author , the wit , the partisan , the fine gentleman , does not take place of the man .
humanity shines in <name> , in chaucer , in <unk> , in shakspeare , in <name> .
they are content with truth .
they use the positive degree .
they seem frigid and <unk> to those who have been <unk> with the frantic passion and violent coloring of inferior but popular writers .
for they are poets by the free course which they allow to the informing soul , which through their eyes beholds again and <unk> the things which it hath made .
the soul is superior to its knowledge , wiser than any of its works .
the great poet makes us feel our own wealth , and then we think less of his compositions .
his best communication to our mind is to teach us to despise all he has done .
shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain of intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which beggars his own ; and we then feel that the splendid works which he has created , and which in other hours we <unk> as a sort of <unk> poetry , take no stronger hold of real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on the rock .
the inspiration which uttered itself in hamlet and lear could utter things as good from day to day for ever .
why then should i make account of hamlet and lear , as if we had not the soul from which they fell as syllables from the tongue ?
this energy does not descend into individual life on any other condition than entire possession .
it comes to the lowly and simple ; it comes to <unk> <name> put off what is foreign and proud ; it comes as insight ; it comes as serenity and grandeur .
when we see those whom it inhabits , we are <unk> of new degrees of greatness .
from that inspiration the man comes back with a changed tone .
he does not talk with men with an eye to their opinion .
he tries them .
it requires of us to be plain and true .
the vain traveller attempts to embellish his life by quoting my lord and the <name> and the countess , who thus said or did to him .
the ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and <unk> and rings , and preserve their cards and compliments .
the more cultivated , in their account of their own experience , <unk> out the pleasing , poetic circumstance ,  the visit to rome , the man of genius they saw , the brilliant friend they know ; still further on perhaps the gorgeous landscape , the mountain lights , the mountain thoughts they enjoyed yesterday ,  and so seek to throw a romantic color over their life .
but the soul that ascends to worship the great god is plain and true ; has no <unk> , no fine friends , no chivalry , no adventures ; does not want admiration ; dwells in the hour that now is , in the <name> experience of the common day ,  by reason of the present moment and the mere trifle having become porous to thought and <unk> of the sea of light .
converse with a mind that is grandly simple , and literature looks like <unk> .
the simplest utterances are <unk> to be written , yet are they so cheap and so things of course , that in the infinite riches of the soul it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground , or <unk> a little air in a phial , when the whole earth and the whole atmosphere are ours .
nothing can pass there , or make you one of the circle , but the casting aside your trappings , and dealing man to man in naked truth , plain confession , and <unk> affirmation .
souls such as these treat you as gods would , walk as gods in the earth , accepting without any admiration your wit , your bounty , your virtue even ,  say rather your act of duty , for your virtue they own as their proper blood , <name> as themselves , and <unk> , and the father of the gods .
but what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery with which authors solace each other and wound themselves !
these flatter not .
i do not wonder that these men go to see cromwell and <name> and <name> the second and <name> the first and the grand turk .
for they are , in their own elevation , the fellows of kings , and must feel the servile tone of conversation in the world .
they must always be a <unk> to princes , for they confront them , a king to a king , without ducking or concession , and give a high nature the refreshment and satisfaction of resistance , of plain humanity , of even companionship and of new ideas .
they leave them wiser and superior men .
souls like these make us feel that sincerity is more excellent than flattery .
deal so plainly with man and woman as to <unk> the utmost sincerity and destroy all <name> of trifling with you .
it is the highest compliment you can pay .
their " highest praising , " said <name> , " is not flattery , and their plainest advice is a kind of praising . "
ineffable is the union of man and god in every act of the soul .
the simplest person who in his integrity worships god , becomes god ; yet for ever and ever the influx of this better and universal self is new and <unk> .
it inspires awe and astonishment .
how dear , how soothing to man , arises the idea of god , <unk> the lonely place , <unk> the scars of our mistakes and disappointments !
when we have broken our god of tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric , then may god fire the heart with his presence .
it is the doubling of the heart itself , nay , the infinite enlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a new infinity on every side .
it inspires in man an infallible trust .
he has not the conviction , but the sight , that the best is the true , and may in that thought easily dismiss all particular <unk> and fears , and adjourn to the sure revelation of time the solution of his private riddles .
he is sure that his welfare is dear to the heart of being .
in the presence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a reliance so universal that it sweeps away all cherished hopes and the most stable projects of mortal condition in its flood .
he believes that he can not escape from his good .
the things that are really for thee <unk> to thee .
you are running to seek your friend .
let your feet run , but your mind need not .
if you do not find him , <name> you not acquiesce that it is best you should not find him ?
for there is a power , which , as it is in you , is in him also , and could therefore very well bring you together , if it were for the best .
you are preparing with eagerness to go and render a service to which your talent and your taste invite you , the love of men and the <name> of fame .
has it not occurred to you that you have no right to go , unless you are equally willing to be prevented from going ?
o , believe , as thou <unk> , that every sound that is spoken over the round world , which thou <unk> to hear , <name> vibrate on thine ear !
every proverb , every book , every <unk> that belongs to thee for aid or comfort , shall surely come home through open or winding passages .
every friend whom not thy fantastic <name> but the great and tender heart in thee <unk> , shall lock thee in his embrace .
and this because the heart in thee is the heart of all ; not a valve , not a wall , not an intersection is there anywhere in nature , but one blood rolls uninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men , as the water of the globe is all one sea , and , truly seen , its tide is one .
let man then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his heart ; this , namely ; that the highest dwells with him ; that the sources of nature are in his own mind , if the sentiment of duty is there .
but if he would know what the great god <unk> , he must 'go into his closet and shut the door , ' as <name> said .
god <name> not make himself manifest to cowards .
he must greatly listen to himself , withdrawing himself from all the accents of other men 's devotion .
even their prayers are <unk> to him , until he have made his own .
our religion <unk> stands on <name> of believers .
whenever the appeal is made ,  no matter how indirectly ,  to <name> , proclamation is then and there made that religion is not .
he that finds god a sweet enveloping thought to him never counts his company .
when i sit in that presence , who shall dare to come in ?
when i rest in perfect humility , when i burn with pure love , what can <name> or swedenborg say ?
it makes no difference whether the appeal is to <name> or to one .
the <name> that stands on authority is not <name> .
the reliance on authority measures the decline of religion , the withdrawal of the soul .
the position men have given to <name> , now for many centuries of history , is a position of authority .
it <unk> themselves .
it can not alter the eternal facts .
great is the soul , and plain .
it is no <unk> , it is no follower ; it never appeals from itself .
it believes in itself .
before the immense possibilities of man all mere experience , all past biography , however spotless and sainted , shrinks away .
before that heaven which our <unk> <unk> us , we can not easily praise any form of life we have seen or read of .
we not only affirm that we have few great men , but , absolutely speaking , that we have none ; that we have no history , no record of any character or mode of living that entirely contents us .
the saints and <unk> whom history worships we are constrained to accept with a grain of allowance .
though in our lonely hours we draw a new strength out of their memory , yet , pressed on our attention , as they are by the thoughtless and customary , they fatigue and invade .
the soul gives itself , alone , original and pure , to the lonely , original and pure , who , on that condition , gladly inhabits , leads and speaks through it .
then is it glad , young and nimble .
it is not wise , but it sees through all things .
it is not called religious , but it is innocent .
it calls the light its own , and feels that the grass grows and the stone falls by a law inferior to , and dependent on , its nature .
behold , it saith , i am born into the great , the universal mind .
i , the imperfect , adore my own perfect .
i am somehow receptive of the great soul , and thereby i do overlook the sun and the stars and feel them to be the fair accidents and effects which change and pass .
more and more the surges of everlasting nature enter into me , and i become public and human in my regards and actions .
so come i to live in thoughts and act with energies which are immortal .
thus <unk> the soul , and learning , as the ancient said , that " its beauty is immense , " man <name> come to see that the world is the perennial miracle which the soul <unk> , and be less astonished at particular wonders ; he <name> learn that there is no profane history ; that all history is sacred ; that the universe is represented in an atom , in a moment of time .
he <name> weave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches , but he <name> live with a divine unity .
he <name> cease from what is base and frivolous in his life and be content with all places and with any service he can render .
he <name> calmly front the morrow in the <unk> of that trust which carries god with it and so hath already the whole future in the bottom of the heart .
***** circles .
nature centres into balls , and her proud <unk> , fast to surface and outside , scan the profile of the sphere ; knew they what that signified , a new <name> were here .
x .
circles .
the eye is the first circle ; the horizon which it forms is the second ; and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end .
it is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world .
st. <name> described the nature of god as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its circumference nowhere .
we are all our lifetime reading the copious sense of this first of forms .
one moral we have already deduced , in considering the circular or <unk> character of every human action .
another analogy we shall now trace , that every action admits of being outdone .
our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn ; that there is no end in nature , but every end is a beginning ; that there is always another <name> risen on <unk> , and under every deep a lower deep opens .
this fact , as far as it <unk> the moral fact of the unattainable , the flying perfect , around which the hands of man can never meet , at once the <unk> and the <unk> of every success , may conveniently serve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every department .
there are no fixtures in nature .
the universe is fluid and volatile .
permanence is but a word of degrees .
our globe seen by god is a transparent law , not a mass of facts .
the law dissolves the fact and holds it fluid .
our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws after it this train of cities and institutions .
let us rise into another idea : they <name> disappear .
the greek sculpture is all melted away , as if it had been statues of ice ; here and there a solitary figure or fragment remaining , as we see <unk> and scraps of snow left in cold <unk> and mountain <unk> in <name> and july .
for the genius that created it creates now somewhat else .
the greek letters last a little longer , but are already passing under the same sentence and tumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old .
the new continents are built out of the ruins of an old planet ; the new races fed out of the decomposition of the foregoing .
new arts destroy the old .
see the investment of capital in <unk> made useless by <unk> ; fortifications , by gunpowder ; roads and canals , by railways ; sails , by steam ; steam by electricity .
you admire this tower of granite , <unk> the hurts of so many ages .
yet a little waving hand built this huge wall , and that which builds is better than that which is built .
the hand that built can <unk> it down much faster .
better than the hand and <unk> was the invisible thought which wrought through it ; and thus ever , behind the coarse effect , is a fine cause , which , being narrowly seen , is itself the effect of a finer cause .
every thing looks permanent until its secret is known .
a <name> estate appears to women a firm and lasting fact ; to a merchant , one easily created out of any materials , and easily lost .
an orchard , good tillage , good grounds , seem a fixture , like a gold mine , or a river , to a citizen ; but to a large farmer , not much more fixed than the state of the crop .
nature looks <unk> stable and secular , but it has a cause like all the rest ; and when once i comprehend that , <name> these fields stretch so <unk> wide , these leaves <name> so individually considerable ?
permanence is a word of degrees .
every thing is medial .
moons are no more bounds to spiritual power than <unk> .
the key to every man is his thought .
sturdy and defying though he look , he has a helm which he obeys , which is the idea after which all his facts are classified .
he can only be reformed by showing him a new idea which commands his own .
the life of man is a <unk> circle , which , from a ring imperceptibly small , rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles , and that without end .
the extent to which this generation of circles , wheel without wheel , <name> go , depends on the force or truth of the individual soul .
for it is the inert effort of each thought , having formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance ,  as for instance an empire , rules of an <name> , a local usage , a religious rite ,  to heap itself on that ridge and to <unk> and hem in the life .
but if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep , which also runs up into a high wave , with attempt again to stop and to bind .
but the heart refuses to be imprisoned ; in its first and narrowest pulses , it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and innumerable <unk> .
every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series .
every general law only a particular fact of some more general law presently to disclose itself .
there is no outside , no <unk> wall , no circumference to us .
the man finishes his story ,  how good !
how final !
how it puts a new face on all things !
he fills the sky .
lo !
on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere .
then already is our first speaker not man , but only a first speaker .
his only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist .
and so men do by themselves .
the result of to-day , which haunts the mind and can not be escaped , <name> presently be <unk> into a word , and the principle that seemed to explain nature <name> itself be included as one example of a bolder generalization .
in the thought of to-morrow there is a power to <unk> all thy creed , all the creeds , all the <unk> of the nations , and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted .
every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of that he should be .
men walk as prophecies of the next age .
step by step we scale this mysterious ladder : the steps are actions ; the new prospect is power .
every several result is threatened and judged by that which follows .
every one seems to be contradicted by the new ; it is only limited by the new .
the new statement is always hated by the old , and , to those dwelling in the old , comes like an abyss of <unk> .
but the eye soon gets wonted to it , for the eye and it are effects of one cause ; then its <unk> and benefit appear , and presently , all its energy spent , it <unk> and <unk> before the revelation of the new hour .
fear not the new generalization .
does the fact look <unk> and material , threatening to degrade thy theory of spirit ?
resist it not ; it goes to <unk> and raise thy theory of matter just as much .
there are no fixtures to men , if we appeal to consciousness .
every man supposes himself not to be fully understood ; and if there is any truth in him , if he rests at last on the divine soul , i see not how it can be otherwise .
the last chamber , the last closet , he must feel was never opened ; there is always a <unk> unknown , <unk> .
that is , every man believes that he has a greater possibility .
our moods do not believe in each other .
to-day i am full of thoughts and can write what i please .
i see no reason why i should not have the same thought , the same power of expression , to-morrow .
what i write , whilst i write it , seems the most natural thing in the world ; but yesterday i saw a dreary <unk> in this direction in which now i see so much ; and a month hence , i doubt not , i shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages .
alas for this infirm <name> , this <name> not strenuous , this vast ebb of a vast flow !
i am god in nature ; i am a weed by the wall .
the continual effort to raise himself above himself , to work a pitch above his last height , betrays itself in a man 's relations .
we thirst for approbation , yet can not forgive the <unk> .
the sweet of nature is love ; yet , if i have a friend i am tormented by my <unk> .
the love of me <unk> the other party .
if he were high enough to slight me , then could i love him , and rise by my affection to new heights .
a man's growth is seen in the successive <unk> of his friends .
for every friend whom he loses for truth , he gains a better .
i thought as i walked in the woods and mused on my friends , why should i play with them this game of idolatry ?
i know and see too well , when not voluntarily blind , the speedy limits of persons called high and worthy .
<name> , <name> and great they are by the liberality of our speech , but truth is sad .
o blessed spirit , whom i forsake for these , they are not thou !
every personal consideration that we allow costs us heavenly state .
we sell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent pleasure .
how often must we learn this lesson ?
men cease to interest us when we find their limitations .
the only sin is limitation .
as soon as you once come up with a man 's limitations , it is all over with him .
has he talents ?
has he enterprise ?
has he knowledge ?
it boots not .
infinitely alluring and attractive was he to you yesterday , a great <name> , a sea to swim in ; now , you have found his shores , found it a pond , and you care not if you never see it again .
each new step we take in thought <unk> twenty seemingly discordant facts , as expressions of one law .
aristotle and plato are reckoned the respective heads of two schools .
a wise man <name> see that aristotle <unk> .
by going one step farther back in thought , discordant opinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one principle , and we can never go so far back as to <unk> a still higher vision .
beware when the great god lets loose a thinker on this planet .
then all things are at risk .
it is as when a conflagration has broken out in a great city , and no man knows what is safe , or where it <name> end .
there is not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow ; there is not any literary reputation , not the so-called eternal names of fame , that may not be revised and condemned .
the very hopes of man , the thoughts of his heart , the religion of nations , the manners and morals of mankind are all at the <name> of a new generalization .
generalization is always a new influx of the divinity into the mind .
hence the thrill that attends it .
valor consists in the power of <unk> , so that a man can not have his flank turned , can not be <unk> , but put him where you <name> , he stands .
this can only be by his preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth , and his alert acceptance of it from whatever quarter ; the intrepid conviction that his laws , his relations to society , his christianity , his world , may at any time be superseded and decease .
there are degrees in idealism .
we learn first to play with it <unk> , as the magnet was once a toy .
then we see in the <unk> of youth and poetry that it may be true , that it is true in gleams and fragments .
then its countenance <unk> stern and grand , and we see that it must be true .
it now shows itself ethical and practical .
we learn that god is ; that he is in me ; and that all things are shadows of him .
the idealism of berkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of <name> , and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature is the rapid <unk> of goodness executing and organizing itself .
much more obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time directly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in the minds of men .
the things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon , and which cause the present order of things , as a tree bears its apples .
a new degree of culture would instantly <unk> the entire system of human pursuits .
conversation is a game of circles .
in conversation we pluck up the <unk> which bound the common of silence on every side .
the parties are not to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this <unk> .
to-morrow they <name> have receded from this high-water <name> .
to-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old <unk> .
yet let us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls .
when each new speaker strikes a new light , <unk> us from the oppression of the last speaker , to oppress us with the greatness and <unk> of his own thought , then yields us to another <unk> , we seem to recover our rights , to become men .
o , what truths profound and <unk> only in ages and orbs , are supposed in the announcement of every truth !
in common hours , society sits cold and <unk> .
we all stand waiting , empty ,  knowing , possibly , that we can be full , surrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us , but prose and trivial toys .
then cometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men , and by a flash of his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things , and the meaning of the very furniture , of cup and saucer , of chair and clock and <unk> , is manifest .
the facts which loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday ,  property , climate , breeding , personal beauty and the like , have strangely changed their proportions .
all that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles ; and <unk> , cities , climates , religions , leave their foundations and dance before our eyes .
and yet here again see the swift <unk> !
good as is discourse , silence is better , and shames it .
the length of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer .
if they were at a perfect understanding in any part , no words would be necessary thereon .
if at one in all parts , no words would be suffered .
literature is a point outside of our <unk> circle through which a new one may be described .
the use of literature is to afford us a platform whence we may command a view of our present life , a purchase by which we may move it .
we fill ourselves with ancient learning , <unk> ourselves the best we can in greek , in punic , in <name> houses , only that we may <unk> see french , english and american houses and modes of living .
in like manner we see literature best from the midst of wild nature , or from the din of affairs , or from a high religion .
the field can not be well seen from within the field .
the astronomer must have his diameter of the earth 's orbit as a base to find the <unk> of any <name> .
therefore we value the poet .
all the argument and all the wisdom is not in the encyclopaedia , or the treatise on metaphysics , or the body of divinity , but in the sonnet or the play .
in my daily work i incline to repeat my old steps , and do not believe in <unk> force , in the power of change and reform .
but some <unk> or <unk> , filled with the new wine of his imagination , writes me an ode or a brisk romance , full of daring thought and action .
he <unk> and <unk> me with his shrill tones , breaks up my whole chain of habits , and i open my eye on my own possibilities .
he <unk> wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world , and i am capable once more of choosing a straight path in theory and practice .
we have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world .
we can never see christianity from the catechism :  from the pastures , from a boat in the pond , from amidst the songs of <unk> we possibly may .
cleansed by the elemental light and wind , steeped in the sea of beautiful forms which the field offers us , we may chance to cast a right glance back upon biography .
christianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind ; yet was there never a young philosopher whose breeding had fallen into the <name> church by whom that brave text of <name> 's was not specially prized :  " then shall also the son be subject unto him who put all things under him , that god may be all in all . "
let the claims and virtues of persons be never so great and welcome , the instinct of man presses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable , and gladly arms itself against the <unk> of <unk> with this generous word out of the book itself .
the natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric circles , and we now and then detect in nature slight dislocations which <unk> us that this surface on which we now stand is not fixed , but sliding .
these manifold tenacious qualities , this chemistry and vegetation , these metals and animals , which seem to stand there for their own sake , are means and methods only ,  are words of god , and as fugitive as other words .
has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft , who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective affinities , who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement , namely that like draws to like , and that the goods which belong to you <unk> to you and need not be pursued with pains and cost ?
yet is that statement approximate also , and not final .
omnipresence is a higher fact .
not through subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart , but , rightly considered , these things proceed from the eternal generation of the soul .
cause and effect are two sides of one fact .
the same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues , and <unk> each in the light of a better .
the great man <name> not be prudent in the popular sense ; all his <name> <name> be so much deduction from his grandeur .
but it <unk> each to see , when he sacrifices <name> , to what god he <unk> it ; if to ease and pleasure , he had better be prudent still ; if to a great trust , he can well spare his mule and <unk> who has a winged chariot instead .
<name> draws on his boots to go through the woods , that his feet may be safer from the bite of snakes ; <name> never thinks of such a peril .
in many years neither is harmed by such an accident .
yet it seems to me that with every precaution you take against such an evil you put yourself into the power of the evil .
i suppose that the highest <name> is the lowest <name> .
is this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge of our orbit ?
think how many times we shall fall back into pitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the great sentiment , or make the verge of to-day the new centre .
besides , your bravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men .
the poor and the low have their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you .
" blessed be nothing " and " the worse things are , the better they are " are proverbs which express the <unk> of common life .
one man 's justice is another 's injustice ; one man 's beauty <unk> ugliness ; one man 's wisdom another 's folly ; as one beholds the same objects from a higher point .
one man thinks justice consists in paying debts , and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very <unk> in this duty and makes the <unk> wait tediously .
but that second man has his own way of looking at things ; asks himself which debt must i pay first , the debt to the <name> , or the debt to the poor ?
the debt of money , or the debt of thought to mankind , of genius to nature ?
for you , o broker , there is no other principle but arithmetic .
for me , commerce is of trivial import ; love , <name> , truth of character , the aspiration of man , these are sacred ; nor can i detach one duty , like you , from all other duties , and concentrate my forces mechanically on the payment of moneys .
let me live onward ; you shall find that , though slower , the progress of my character <name> <unk> all these debts without injustice to higher claims .
if a man should dedicate himself to the payment of notes , would not this be injustice ?
does he owe no debt but money ?
and are all claims on him to be postponed to a landlord 's or a banker 's ?
there is no virtue which is final ; all are initial .
the virtues of society are vices of the saint .
the terror of reform is the discovery that we must cast away our virtues , or what we have always esteemed such , into the same pit that has consumed our <unk> vices :  " forgive his crimes , forgive his virtues too , those smaller faults , half converts to the right . "
it is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our <unk> also .
i accuse myself of sloth and <unk> day by day ; but when these waves of god flow into me i no longer reckon lost time .
i no longer poorly <unk> my possible achievement by what remains to me of the month or the year ; for these moments confer a sort of omnipresence and <unk> which asks nothing of duration , but sees that the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done , without time .
and thus , o circular philosopher , i hear some reader exclaim , you have arrived at a fine <unk> , at an <unk> and <unk> of all actions , and would fain teach us that if we are true , forsooth , our crimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the <name> of the true god !
i am not careful to justify myself .
i own i am <unk> by seeing the predominance of the <unk> principle throughout vegetable nature , and not less by beholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of the principle of good into every chink and hole that selfishness has left open , yea into selfishness and sin itself ; so that no evil is pure , nor hell itself without its extreme <unk> .
but lest i should mislead any when i have my own head and obey my whims , let me remind the reader that i am only an <unk> .
do not set the least value on what i do , or the least discredit on what i do not , as if i pretended to settle any thing as true or false .
i <unk> all things .
no facts are to me sacred ; none are profane ; i simply experiment , an endless seeker with no past at my back .
yet this incessant movement and progression which all things partake could never become sensible to us but by contrast to some principle of fixture or stability in the soul .
whilst the eternal generation of circles proceeds , the eternal <unk> abides .
that central life is somewhat superior to creation , superior to knowledge and thought , and contains all its circles .
for ever it labors to create a life and thought as large and excellent as itself , but in vain , for that which is made <unk> how to make a better .
thus there is no sleep , no pause , no preservation , but all things renew , germinate and spring .
why should we import rags and relics into the new hour ?
nature <unk> the old , and old age seems the only disease ; all others run into this one .
we call it by many names ,  fever , intemperance , insanity , stupidity and crime ; they are all forms of old age ; they are rest , <unk> , appropriation , <unk> ; not newness , not the way onward .
we <unk> every day .
i see no need of it .
whilst we converse with what is above us , we do not grow old , but grow young .
infancy , youth , receptive , aspiring , with religious eye looking upward , counts itself nothing and <unk> itself to the instruction flowing from all sides .
but the man and woman of seventy assume to know all , they have <unk> their <name> , they renounce aspiration , accept the actual for the necessary and talk down to the young .
let them , then , become organs of the holy ghost ; let them be lovers ; let them behold truth ; and their eyes are uplifted , their wrinkles smoothed , they are perfumed again with <name> and power .
this old age ought not to creep on a human mind .
in nature every moment is new ; the past is always swallowed and forgotten ; the coming only is sacred .
nothing is secure but life , transition , the <unk> spirit .
no love can be bound by oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love .
no truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts .
people wish to be settled ; only as far as they are unsettled is there any <name> for them .
life is a series of surprises .
we do not guess to-day the mood , the pleasure , the power of to-morrow , when we are building up our being .
of lower states , of acts of routine and sense , we can tell somewhat ; but the <unk> of god , the total growths and universal movements of the soul , he <unk> ; they are incalculable .
i can know that truth is divine and helpful ; but how it shall help me i can have no guess , for so to be is the sole inlet of so to know .
the new position of the advancing man has all the powers of the old , yet has them all new .
it carries in its bosom all the energies of the past , yet is itself an <unk> of the morning .
i cast away in this new moment all my once <unk> knowledge , as vacant and vain .
now , for the first time seem i to know any thing rightly .
the simplest words ,  we do not know what they mean except when we love and aspire .
the difference between talents and character is adroitness to keep the old and trodden round , and power and courage to make a new road to new and better goals .
character makes an overpowering present ; a cheerful , determined hour , which <unk> all the company by making them see that much is possible and excellent that was not thought of .
character <unk> the impression of particular events .
when we see the conqueror we do not think much of any one battle or success .
we see that we had exaggerated the difficulty .
it was easy to him .
the great man is not <unk> or <unk> ; events pass over him without much impression .
people say sometimes , 'see what i have overcome ; see how cheerful i am ; see how completely i have triumphed over these black events . '
not if they still remind me of the black event .
true conquest is the causing the calamity to fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant result in a history so large and advancing .
the one thing which we seek with insatiable <name> is to forget ourselves , to be surprised out of our propriety , to lose our <unk> memory and to do something without knowing how or why ; in short to draw a new circle .
nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm .
the way of life is wonderful ; it is by abandonment .
the great moments of history are the facilities of performance through the strength of ideas , as the works of genius and religion .
" a man , " said <name> cromwell , " never rises so high as when he knows not whither he is going . "
dreams and drunkenness , the use of opium and alcohol are the semblance and counterfeit of this <unk> genius , and hence their dangerous attraction for men .
for the like reason they ask the aid of wild passions , as in gaming and war , to ape in some manner these flames and <unk> of the heart .
***** intellect .
go , speed the stars of thought on to their shining goals ;  the <unk> <unk> broad his seed , the wheat thou <unk> be souls .
xi .
intellect .
every substance is negatively electric to that which stands above it in the chemical tables , positively to that which stands below it .
water dissolves wood and iron and salt ; air dissolves water ; electric fire dissolves air , but the intellect dissolves fire , gravity , laws , method , and the <unk> unnamed relations of nature in its resistless <unk> .
intellect lies behind genius , which is intellect constructive .
intellect is the simple power anterior to all action or construction .
gladly would i unfold in calm degrees a natural history of the intellect , but what man has yet been able to <name> the steps and boundaries of that transparent essence ?
the first questions are always to be asked , and the wisest doctor is gravelled by the <unk> of a child .
how can we speak of the action of the mind under any divisions , as of its knowledge , of its ethics , of its works , and so forth , since it melts <name> into perception , knowledge into act ?
each becomes the other .
itself alone is .
its vision is not like the vision of the eye , but is union with the things known .
intellect and <unk> signify to the common ear consideration of abstract truth .
the considerations of time and place , of you and me , of profit and hurt <unk> over most men 's minds .
intellect separates the fact considered , from you , from all local and personal reference , and <unk> it as if it existed for its own sake .
<unk> looked upon the affections as dense and colored mists .
in the fog of good and evil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line .
intellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the light of science , cool and disengaged .
the intellect goes out of the individual , floats over its own personality , and regards it as a fact , and not as i and mine .
he who is immersed in what concerns person or place can not see the problem of existence .
this the intellect always <unk> .
nature shows all things formed and bound .
the intellect <unk> the form , <unk> the wall , detects intrinsic likeness between remote things and reduces all things into a few principles .
the making a fact the subject of thought raises it .
all that mass of mental and moral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary thought , come within the power of fortune ; they constitute the circumstance of daily life ; they are subject to change , to fear , and <name> .
every man beholds his human condition with a degree of melancholy .
as a ship aground is battered by the waves , so man , imprisoned in mortal life , lies open to the <name> of coming events .
but a truth , separated by the intellect , is no longer a subject of <name> .
we behold it as a god upraised above care and fear .
and so any fact in our life , or any record of our fancies or reflections , <unk> from the web of our unconsciousness , becomes an object impersonal and immortal .
it is the past restored , but embalmed .
a better <name> than that of egypt has taken fear and corruption out of it .
it is <unk> of care .
it is offered for science .
what is addressed to us for contemplation does not threaten us but makes us intellectual beings .
the growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every expansion .
the mind that grows could not predict the times , the means , the mode of that spontaneity .
god enters by a private door into every individual .
long prior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the mind .
out of darkness it came insensibly into the marvellous light of to-day .
in the period of infancy it accepted and disposed of all impressions from the surrounding creation after its own way .
whatever any mind doth or saith is after a law ; and this native law remains over it after it has come to reflection or conscious thought .
in the most worn , <unk> , <unk> <unk> 's life , the greatest part is incalculable by him , unforeseen , unimaginable , and must be , until he can take himself up by his own ears .
what am i ?
what has my <name> done to make me that i am ?
nothing .
i have been floated into this thought , this hour , this connection of events , by secret currents of might and mind , and my ingenuity and <unk> have not thwarted , have not aided to an appreciable degree .
our spontaneous action is always the best .
you can not with your best deliberation and heed come so close to any question as your spontaneous glance shall bring you , whilst you rise from your bed , or walk abroad in the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous night .
our thinking is a pious reception .
our truth of thought is therefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our <name> , as by too great negligence .
we do not determine what we <name> think .
we only open our senses , clear away as we can all obstruction from the fact , and suffer the intellect to see .
we have little control over our thoughts .
we are the prisoners of ideas .
they catch us up for moments into their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for the morrow , gaze like children , without an effort to make them our own .
by and by we fall out of that rapture , <unk> us where we have been , what we have seen , and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld .
as far as we can recall these ecstasies we <name> away in the <unk> memory the result , and all men and all the ages confirm it .
it is called truth .
but the moment we cease to report and attempt to correct and contrive , it is not truth .
if we consider what persons have stimulated and profited us , we shall perceive the superiority of the spontaneous or <unk> principle over the arithmetical or logical .
the first contains the second , but <unk> and latent .
we want in every man a long logic ; we can not pardon the absence of it , but it must not be spoken .
logic is the procession or proportionate unfolding of the intuition ; but its virtue is as silent method ; the moment it would appear as propositions and have a separate value it is worthless .
in every man 's mind , some images , words and facts remain , without effort on his part to <unk> them , which others forget , and afterwards these illustrate to him important laws .
all our progress is an unfolding , like the vegetable <name> .
you have first an instinct , then an opinion , then a knowledge , as the plant has root , <name> and fruit .
trust the instinct to the end , though you can render no reason .
it is vain to hurry it .
by trusting it to the end , it shall ripen into truth and you shall know why you believe .
each mind has its own method .
a true man never acquires after college rules .
what you have aggregated in a natural manner surprises and delights when it is produced .
for we can not oversee each other's secret .
and hence the differences between men in natural endowment are insignificant in comparison with their common wealth .
do you think the <name> and the cook have no anecdotes , no experiences , no wonders for you ?
every body knows as much as the <unk> .
the walls of rude minds are scrawled all over with facts , with thoughts .
they shall one day bring a lantern and read the inscriptions .
every man , in the degree in which he has wit and culture , finds his curiosity inflamed concerning the modes of living and thinking of other men , and especially of those classes whose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school education .
this instinctive action never ceases in a healthy mind , but becomes richer and more frequent in its <unk> through all states of culture .
at last comes the <name> of reflection , when we not only observe , but take pains to observe ; when we of set purpose sit down to consider an abstract truth ; when we keep the mind 's eye open whilst we converse , whilst we read , whilst we act , intent to learn the secret law of some class of facts .
what is the hardest task in the world ?
to think .
i would put myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth , and i can not .
i <unk> and withdraw on this side and on that .
i seem to know what he meant who said , no man can see god face to face and live .
for example , a man <unk> the basis of civil government .
let him intend his mind without respite , without rest , in one direction .
his best heed long time avails him nothing .
yet thoughts are flitting before him .
we all but apprehend , we dimly <unk> the truth .
we say i <name> walk abroad , and the truth <name> take form and clearness to me .
we go forth , but can not find it .
it seems as if we needed only the stillness and composed attitude of the library to seize the thought .
but we come in , and are as far from it as at first .
then , in a moment , and <unk> , the truth appears .
a certain wandering light appears , and is the distinction , the principle , we wanted .
but the oracle comes because we had previously laid siege to the shrine .
it seems as if the law of the intellect resembled that law of nature by which we now inspire , now expire the breath ; by which the heart now draws in , then <unk> out the blood ,  the law of <unk> .
so now you must labor with your brains , and now you must forbear your activity and see what the great soul <unk> .
the immortality of man is as legitimately preached from the <unk> as from the moral <unk> .
every <unk> is mainly prospective .
its present value is its least .
inspect what delights you in plutarch , in shakspeare , in <unk> .
each truth that a writer acquires is a lantern , which he turns full on what facts and thoughts lay already in his mind , and behold , all the mats and rubbish which had littered his <name> become precious .
every trivial fact in his private biography becomes an illustration of this new principle , <unk> the day , and delights all men by its <unk> and new charm .
men say , where did he get this ?
and think there was something divine in his life .
but no ; they have myriads of facts just as good , would they only get a lamp to ransack their <unk> withal .
we are all wise .
the difference between persons is not in wisdom but in <name> .
i knew , in an <unk> club , a person who always deferred to me ; who , seeing my whim for writing , fancied that my experiences had somewhat superior ; whilst i saw that his experiences were as good as mine .
give them to me and i would make the same use of them .
he held the old ; he holds the new ; i had the habit of <unk> together the old and the new which he did not use to exercise .
this may hold in the great examples .
perhaps if we should meet shakspeare we should not be conscious of any steep inferiority ; no , but of a great equality ,  only that he possessed a strange skill of using , of classifying , his facts , which we lacked .
for notwithstanding our utter incapacity to produce anything like hamlet and <unk> , see the perfect reception this wit and immense knowledge of life and liquid eloquence find in us all .
if you gather apples in the <name> , or make hay , or hoe corn , and then retire within doors and shut your eyes and press them with your hand , you shall still see apples hanging in the bright light with boughs and leaves thereto , or the <unk> grass , or the <unk> , and this for five or six hours afterwards .
there lie the impressions on the <unk> organ , though you knew it not .
so lies the whole series of natural images with which your life has made you acquainted , in your memory , though you know it not ; and a thrill of passion flashes light on their dark chamber , and the active power seizes instantly the fit image , as the word of its momentary thought .
it is long ere we discover how <name> we are .
our history , we are sure , is quite tame : we have nothing to write , nothing to infer .
but our wiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood , and always we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond ; until by and by we begin to suspect that the biography of the one foolish person we know is , in reality , nothing less than the miniature <unk> of the hundred volumes of the universal history .
in the intellect constructive , which we <unk> designate by the word genius , we observe the same balance of two elements as in intellect receptive .
the constructive intellect produces thoughts , sentences , poems , plans , designs , systems .
it is the generation of the mind , the marriage of thought with nature .
to genius must always go two gifts , the thought and the publication .
the first is revelation , always a miracle , which no frequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever <unk> , but which must always leave the inquirer stupid with wonder .
it is the advent of truth into the world , a form of thought now for the first time bursting into the universe , a child of the old eternal soul , a piece of genuine and immeasurable greatness .
it seems , for the time , to inherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to the unborn .
it affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every institution .
but to make it available it needs a vehicle or <name> by which it is conveyed to men .
to be <unk> it must become picture or sensible object .
we must learn the language of facts .
the most wonderful inspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to paint them to the senses .
the <name> of light passes invisible through space and only when it falls on an object is it seen .
when the spiritual energy is directed on something outward , then it is a thought .
the relation between it and you first makes you , the value of you , apparent to me .
the <name> inventive genius of the painter must be smothered and lost for want of the power of drawing , and in our happy hours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we could break through the silence into adequate rhyme .
as all men have some access to primary truth , so all have some <name> or power of communication in their head , but only in the artist does it descend into the hand .
there is an inequality , whose laws we do not yet know , between two men and between two moments of the same man , in respect to this faculty .
in common hours we have the same facts as in the uncommon or inspired , but they do not sit for their portraits ; they are not detached , but lie in a web .
the thought of genius is spontaneous ; but the power of picture or expression , in the most enriched and flowing nature , implies a mixture of <name> , a certain control over the spontaneous states , without which no production is possible .
it is a conversion of all nature into the rhetoric of thought , under the eye of judgment , with a strenuous exercise of choice .
and yet the imaginative vocabulary seems to be spontaneous also .
it does not flow from experience only or mainly , but from a richer source .
not by any conscious imitation of particular forms are the grand strokes of the painter executed , but by repairing to the <unk> of all forms in his mind .
who is the first <unk> ?
without instruction we know very well the ideal of the human form .
a child knows if an arm or a leg be distorted in a picture ; if the attitude be natural or grand or mean ; though he has never received any instruction in drawing or heard any conversation on the subject , nor can himself draw with correctness a single feature .
a good form strikes all eyes pleasantly , long before they have any science on the subject , and a beautiful face sets twenty hearts in <unk> , prior to all consideration of the mechanical proportions of the features and head .
we may owe to dreams some light on the fountain of this skill ; for as soon as we let our <name> go and let the unconscious states ensue , see what cunning <unk> we are !
we entertain ourselves with wonderful forms of men , of women , of animals , of gardens , of woods and of monsters , and the mystic pencil wherewith we then draw has no awkwardness or inexperience , no <unk> or poverty ; it can design well and group well ; its composition is full of <name> , its colors are well laid on and the whole canvas which it paints is <unk> and apt to touch us with terror , with tenderness , with <name> and with grief .
neither are the artist 's copies from experience ever mere copies , but always touched and softened by tints from this ideal domain .
the conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be so often combined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and memorable for a long time .
yet when we write with ease and come out into the free air of thought , we seem to be assured that nothing is easier than to continue this communication at pleasure .
up , down , around , the kingdom of thought has no <unk> , but the muse makes us free of her city .
well , the world has a million writers .
one would think then that good thought would be as familiar as air and water , and the gifts of each new hour would exclude the last .
yet we can count all our good books ; nay , i remember any beautiful verse for twenty years .
it is true that the discerning intellect of the world is always much in advance of the creative , so that there are many competent judges of the best book , and few writers of the best books .
but some of the conditions of intellectual construction are of rare occurrence .
the intellect is a whole and demands integrity in every work .
this is resisted equally by a man 's devotion to a single thought and by his ambition to combine too many .
truth is our element of life , yet if a man fasten his attention on a single aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time , the truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood ; herein resembling the air , which is our natural element , and the breath of our nostrils , but if a stream of the same be directed on the body for a time , it causes cold , fever , and even death .
how wearisome the <unk> , the <unk> , the political or religious fanatic , or indeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration of a single topic .
it is incipient insanity .
every thought is a prison also .
i can not see what you see , because i am caught up by a strong wind and blown so far in one direction that i am out of the hoop of your horizon .
is it any better if the student , to avoid this offence , and to <unk> himself , aims to make a mechanical whole of history , or science , or philosophy , by a numerical addition of all the facts that fall within his vision ?
the world refuses to be analyzed by addition and <unk> .
when we are young we spend much time and pains in filling our <unk> with all definitions of religion , love , poetry , politics , <name> , in the <name> that in the course of a few years we shall have condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories at which the world has yet arrived .
but year after year our tables get no completeness , and at last we discover that our curve is a <unk> , whose <unk> <name> never meet .
neither by detachment neither by aggregation is the integrity of the intellect transmitted to its works , but by a vigilance which brings the intellect in its greatness and best state to operate every moment .
it must have the same <unk> which nature has .
although no diligence can rebuild the universe in a model by the best accumulation or disposition of details , yet does the world reappear in miniature in every event , so that all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest fact .
the intellect must have the like perfection in its apprehension and in its works .
for this reason , an index or mercury of intellectual proficiency is the perception of identity .
we talk with accomplished persons who appear to be strangers in nature .
the cloud , the tree , the turf , the bird are not theirs , have nothing of them ; the world is only their lodging and table .
but the poet , whose verses are to be <unk> and complete , is one whom nature can not deceive , whatsoever face of strangeness she may put on .
he feels a strict <unk> , and detects more likeness than variety in all her changes .
we are stung by the <name> for new thought ; but when we receive a new thought it is only the old thought with a new face , and though we make it our own we instantly crave another ; we are not really enriched .
for the truth was in us before it was reflected to us from natural objects ; and the profound genius <name> cast the likeness of all creatures into every product of his wit .
but if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to be poets , yet every man is a receiver of this descending holy ghost , and may well study the laws of its influx .
exactly parallel is the whole rule of intellectual duty to the rule of moral duty .
a self-denial no less austere than the saint 's is demanded of the scholar .
he must worship truth , and forego all things for that , and choose defeat and pain , so that his treasure in thought is thereby augmented .
god offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose .
take which you please ,  you can never have both .
between these , as a pendulum , man <unk> .
he in whom the love of repose <unk> <name> accept the first creed , the first philosophy , the first political party he meets ,  most likely his father 's .
he gets rest , commodity , and reputation ; but he shuts the door of truth .
he in whom the love of truth <unk> <name> keep himself aloof from all moorings , and afloat .
he <name> abstain from <unk> , and recognize all the opposite <unk> between which , as walls , his being is swung .
he <unk> to the inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion , but he is a candidate for truth , as the other is not , and respects the highest law of his being .
the circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the man who can yield him truth .
he shall then know that there is somewhat more blessed and great in hearing than in speaking .
happy is the hearing man ; unhappy the speaking man .
as long as i hear truth i am bathed by a beautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my nature .
the suggestions are <unk> that i hear and see .
the waters of the great deep have ingress and egress to the soul .
but if i speak , i define , i confine and am less .
when socrates speaks , <unk> and <unk> are afflicted by no shame that they do not speak .
they also are good .
he likewise <unk> to them , loves them , whilst he speaks .
because a true and natural man contains and is the same truth which an eloquent man <unk> ; but in the eloquent man , because he can articulate it , it seems something the less to reside , and he turns to these silent beautiful with the more inclination and respect .
the ancient sentence said , let us be silent , for so are the gods .
silence is a <unk> that destroys personality , and gives us leave to be great and universal .
every man 's progress is through a succession of teachers , each of whom seems at the time to have a <unk> influence , but it at last gives place to a new .
frankly let him accept it all .
<name> says , leave father , mother , house and lands , and follow me .
who leaves all , receives more .
this is as true intellectually as morally .
each new mind we approach seems to require an <unk> of all our past and present possessions .
a new doctrine seems at first a <unk> of all our opinions , tastes , and manner of living .
such has swedenborg , such has kant , such has coleridge , such has <unk> or his interpreter cousin seemed to many young men in this country .
take <unk> and heartily all they can give .
exhaust them , wrestle with them , let them not go until their blessing be won , and after a short season the dismay <name> be <unk> , the excess of influence withdrawn , and they <name> be no longer an alarming meteor , but one more bright <name> shining serenely in your heaven and blending its light with all your day .
but whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that which draws him , because that is his own , he is to refuse himself to that which draws him not , whatsoever fame and authority may attend it , because it is not his own .
entire self-reliance belongs to the intellect .
one soul is a <unk> of all souls , as a capillary column of water is a balance for the sea .
it must treat things and books and sovereign genius as itself also a sovereign .
if <unk> be that man he is taken for , he has not yet done his office when he has educated the learned of europe for a thousand years .
he is now to approve himself a master of delight to me also .
if he can not do that , all his fame shall avail him nothing with me .
i were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand <unk> to my intellectual integrity .
especially take the same ground in regard to abstract truth , the science of the mind .
the bacon , the <unk> , the hume , <unk> , kant , or whosoever <unk> to you a philosophy of the mind , is only a more or less awkward translator of things in your consciousness which you have also your way of seeing , perhaps of <unk> .
say then , instead of too timidly poring into his obscure sense , that he has not succeeded in rendering back to you your consciousness .
he has not succeeded ; now let another try .
if plato can not , perhaps <unk> <name> .
if <unk> can not , then perhaps kant .
anyhow , when at last it is done , you <name> find it is no recondite , but a simple , natural , common state which the writer <unk> to you .
but let us end these <unk> .
i <name> not , though the subject might provoke it , speak to the open question between truth and love .
i shall not presume to interfere in the old politics of the skies ;  " the <unk> know most ; the <unk> love most . "
the gods shall settle their own quarrels .
but i can not recite , even thus rudely , laws of the intellect , without remembering that lofty and <unk> class of men who have been its prophets and oracles , the <unk> of the pure reason , the <unk> , the <unk> of the principles of thought from age to age .
when at long intervals we turn over their abstruse pages , wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these few , these great spiritual lords who have walked in the world ,  these of the old religion ,  dwelling in a worship which makes the <unk> of christianity look <unk> and popular ; for " persuasion is in soul , but necessity is in intellect . "
this band of grandees , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , plato , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the rest , have somewhat so vast in their logic , so primary in their thinking , that it seems <unk> to all the ordinary distinctions of rhetoric and literature , and to be at once poetry and music and dancing and astronomy and mathematics .
i am present at the sowing of the seed of the world .
with a geometry of <unk> the soul lays the foundations of nature .
the truth and grandeur of their thought is proved by its scope and <unk> , for it commands the entire schedule and inventory of things for its illustration .
but what marks its elevation and has even a comic look to us , is the innocent serenity with which these <unk> <unk> sit in their clouds , and from age to age <unk> to each other and to no contemporary .
well assured that their speech is intelligible and the most natural thing in the world , they add <unk> to <unk> , without a moment 's heed of the universal astonishment of the human race below , who do not comprehend their plainest argument ; nor do they ever <unk> so much as to insert a popular or explaining sentence , nor testify the least displeasure or <unk> at the dulness of their amazed auditory .
the angels are so <unk> of the language that is spoken in heaven that they <name> not <unk> their lips with the hissing and <unk> dialects of men , but speak their own , whether there be any who understand it or not .
***** <name> .
give to barrows trays and pans <name> and glimmer of romance , bring the moonlight into noon hid in gleaming piles of stone ; on the city 's paved street plant gardens lined with lilac sweet , let spouting fountains cool the air , singing in the <unk> square .
let statue , picture , park and hall , ballad , flag and festival , the past restore , the day adorn and make each morrow a new morn so shall the <unk> in <name> frock spy behind the city clock <unk> of airy kings , skirts of angels , starry wings , his fathers shining in bright fables , his children fed at heavenly tables .
't is the privilege of <name> thus to play its cheerful part , man in earth to <unk> and bend the exile to his fate , and , moulded of one element with the days and firmament , teach him on these as stairs to climb and live on even terms with time ; whilst upper life the slender rill of human sense doth <unk> .
xii .
<name> .
because the soul is progressive , it never quite repeats itself , but in every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole .
this appears in works both of the useful and the fine arts , if we employ the popular distinction of works according to their aim either at use or beauty .
thus in our fine arts , not imitation but creation is the aim .
in landscapes the painter should give the suggestion of a fairer creation than we know .
the details , the prose of nature he should omit and give us only the spirit and splendor .
he should know that the landscape has beauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which is to him good ; and this because the same power which sees through his eyes is seen in that spectacle ; and he <name> come to value the expression of nature and not nature itself , and so exalt in his copy the features that please him .
he <name> give the gloom of gloom and the <name> of <name> .
in a portrait he must <unk> the character and not the features , and must esteem the man who sits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or likeness of the aspiring original within .
what is that <unk> and selection we observe in all spiritual activity , but itself the creative impulse ?
for it is the inlet of that higher illumination which teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler symbols .
what is a man but nature 's finer success in <unk> ?
what is a man but a finer and <unk> landscape than the horizon figures ,  nature 's <unk> ?
and what is his speech , his love of painting , love of nature , but a still finer success ,  all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left out , and the spirit or moral of it contracted into a musical word , or the most cunning stroke of the pencil ?
but the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation to convey his enlarged sense to his fellow-men .
thus the new in <name> is always formed out of the old .
the genius of the hour sets his <unk> seal on the work and gives it an inexpressible charm for the imagination .
as far as the spiritual character of the period <unk> the artist and finds expression in his work , so far it <name> retain a certain grandeur , and <name> represent to future beholders the unknown , the inevitable , the divine .
no man can quite exclude this element of necessity from his labor .
no man can quite <unk> himself from his age and country , or produce a model in which the education , the religion , the politics , usages and arts of his times shall have no share .
though he were never so original , never so wilful and fantastic , he can not wipe out of his work every trace of the thoughts amidst which it grew .
the very avoidance betrays the usage he <unk> .
above his <name> and out of his sight he is necessitated by the air he breathes and the idea on which he and his contemporaries live and toil , to share the manner of his times , without knowing what that manner is .
now that which is inevitable in the work has a higher charm than individual talent can ever give , inasmuch as the artist 's pen or chisel seems to have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to <unk> a line in the history of the human race .
this circumstance gives a value to the egyptian hieroglyphics , to the indian , chinese and mexican idols , however gross and shapeless .
they denote the height of the human soul in that hour , and were not fantastic , but sprung from a necessity as deep as the world .
shall i now add that the whole extant product of the plastic arts has herein its highest value , as history ; as a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate , perfect and beautiful , according to whose <unk> all beings advance to their <unk> ?
thus , historically viewed , it has been the office of <name> to educate the perception of beauty .
we are immersed in beauty , but our eyes have no clear vision .
it needs , by the exhibition of single traits , to assist and lead the dormant taste .
we carve and paint , or we behold what is carved and painted , as students of the mystery of form .
the virtue of <name> lies in detachment , in <unk> one object from the embarrassing variety .
until one thing comes out from the connection of things , there can be enjoyment , contemplation , but no thought .
our happiness and unhappiness are unproductive .
the infant lies in a pleasing trance , but his individual character and his practical power depend on his daily progress in the separation of things , and dealing with one at a time .
love and all the passions concentrate all existence around a single form .
it is the habit of certain minds to give an <unk> fulness to the object , the thought , the word , they alight upon , and to make that for the time the deputy of the world .
these are the artists , the orators , the leaders of society .
the power to detach and to magnify by <unk> is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and the poet .
this rhetoric , or power to fix the momentary <unk> of an object ,  so remarkable in burke , in <name> , in carlyle ,  the painter and sculptor exhibit in color and in stone .
the power depends on the depth of the artist 's insight of that object he <unk> .
for every object has its roots in central nature , and may of course be so exhibited to us as to represent the world .
therefore each work of genius is the tyrant of the hour and <unk> attention on itself .
for the time , it is the only thing worth naming to do that ,  be it a sonnet , an opera , a landscape , a statue , an oration , the plan of a <name> , of a campaign , or of a voyage of discovery .
presently we pass to some other object , which rounds itself into a whole as did the first ; for example a <unk> garden ; and nothing seems worth doing but the laying out of gardens .
i should think fire the best thing in the world , if i were not acquainted with air , and water , and earth .
for it is the right and property of all natural objects , of all genuine talents , of all native properties whatsoever , to be for their moment the top of the world .
a squirrel leaping from bough to bough and making the wood but one wide tree for his pleasure , fills the eye not less than a lion ,  is beautiful , <unk> , and stands then and there for nature .
a good ballad draws my ear and heart whilst i listen , as much as an epic has done before .
a dog , drawn by a master , or a litter of pigs , satisfies and is a reality not less than the frescoes of <name> .
from this succession of excellent objects we learn at last the immensity of the world , the opulence of human nature , which can run out to infinitude in any direction .
but i also learn that what astonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished me in the second work also ; that excellence of all things is one .
the office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial .
the best pictures can easily tell us their last secret .
the best pictures are rude draughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and <unk> which make up the <unk> " landscape with figures " amidst which we dwell .
painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs .
when that has educated the frame to self-possession , to <unk> , to <name> , the steps of the <unk> are better forgotten ; so painting teaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form , and as i see many pictures and higher genius in the <name> , i see the boundless opulence of the pencil , the <unk> in which the artist stands free to choose out of the possible forms .
if he can draw every thing , why draw any thing ?
and then is my eye opened to the eternal picture which nature paints in the street , with moving men and children , beggars and fine ladies , draped in red and green and blue and gray ; long-haired , grizzled , <unk> , <unk> , wrinkled , giant , dwarf , expanded , <unk> ,  capped and based by heaven , earth and sea .
a gallery of sculpture teaches more <unk> the same lesson .
as picture teaches the coloring , so sculpture the anatomy of form .
when i have seen fine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly , i understand well what he meant who said , " when i have been reading <name> , all men look like giants . "
i too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics of the eye , its training to the <unk> and curiosities of its function .
there is no statue like this living man , with his infinite advantage over all ideal sculpture , of perpetual variety .
what a gallery of <name> have i here !
no <unk> made these varied groups and diverse original single figures .
here is the artist himself <unk> , grim and glad , at his block .
now one thought strikes him , now another , and with each moment he alters the whole air , attitude and expression of his <name> .
away with your nonsense of oil and <unk> , of marble and <unk> ; except to open your eyes to the <unk> of eternal <name> , they are hypocritical rubbish .
the reference of all production at last to an aboriginal power explains the traits common to all works of the highest <name> ,  that they are universally intelligible ; that they restore to us the simplest states of mind , and are religious .
since what skill is therein shown is the reappearance of the original soul , a jet of pure light , it should produce a similar impression to that made by natural objects .
in happy hours , nature appears to us one with <name> ; <name> perfected ,  the work of genius .
and the individual , in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to all the great human influences <unk> the accidents of a local and special culture , is the best critic of <name> .
though we travel the world over to find the beautiful , we must <name> it with us , or we find it not .
the best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces , in outlines , or rules of <name> can ever teach , namely a radiation from the work of <name> of human character ,  a wonderful expression through stone , or canvas , or musical sound , of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature , and therefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these attributes .
in the sculptures of the greeks , in the masonry of the romans , and in the pictures of the <unk> and venetian masters , the highest charm is the universal language they speak .
a confession of moral nature , of purity , love , and <name> , breathes from them all .
that which we <name> to them , the same we bring back more fairly illustrated in the memory .
the traveller who visits the vatican , and passes from chamber to chamber through galleries of statues , vases , <unk> and <unk> , through all forms of beauty cut in the richest materials , is in danger of forgetting the simplicity of the principles out of which they all sprung , and that they had their origin from thoughts and laws in his own breast .
he studies the technical rules on these wonderful remains , but forgets that these works were not always thus <unk> ; that they are the contributions of many ages and many countries ; that each came out of the solitary <unk> of one artist , who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the existence of other sculpture , created his work without other model save life , household life , and the sweet and smart of personal relations , of beating hearts , and meeting eyes ; of poverty and necessity and <name> and fear .
these were his inspirations , and these are the effects he carries home to your heart and mind .
in proportion to his force , the artist <name> find in his work an outlet for his proper character .
he must not be in any manner pinched or hindered by his material , but through his necessity of <unk> himself the <unk> <name> be wax in his hands , and <name> allow an adequate communication of himself , in his full stature and proportion .
he need not <unk> himself with a conventional nature and culture , nor ask what is the mode in rome or in <name> , but that house and weather and manner of living which poverty and the fate of birth have made at once so odious and so dear , in the gray unpainted wood cabin , on the corner of a new hampshire farm , or in the <unk> of the backwoods , or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the <unk> and seeming of a city poverty , <name> serve as well as any other condition as the symbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently through all .
i remember when in my younger days i had heard of the wonders of italian painting , i fancied the great pictures would be great strangers ; some surprising combination of color and form ; a foreign wonder , barbaric <name> and gold , like the <unk> and standards of the militia , which play such pranks in the eyes and imaginations of <unk> .
i was to see and acquire i knew not what .
when i came at last to rome and saw with eyes the pictures , i found that genius left to <unk> the <name> and fantastic and ostentatious , and itself pierced directly to the simple and true ; that it was familiar and sincere ; that it was the old , eternal fact i had met already in so many forms ,  unto which i lived ; that it was the plain you and me i knew so well ,  had left at home in so many conversations .
i had the same experience already in a church at naples .
there i saw that nothing was changed with me but the place , and said to myself  'thou foolish child , hast thou come out hither , over four thousand miles of salt water , to find that which was perfect to thee there at home ? '
that fact i saw again in the <unk> at naples , in the chambers of sculpture , and yet again when i came to rome and to the paintings of <name> , <name> , <unk> , titian , and <name> da <unk> .
" what , old mole !
<unk> thou in the earth so fast ? "
it had travelled by my side ; that which i fancied i had left in boston was here in the vatican , and again at <name> and at <name> , and made all travelling ridiculous as a <unk> .
i now require this of all pictures , that they <unk> me , not that they dazzle me .
pictures must not be too picturesque .
nothing <unk> men so much as common-sense and plain dealing .
all great actions have been simple , and all great pictures are .
the <unk> , by <name> , is an eminent example of this peculiar merit .
a calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture , and goes directly to the heart .
it seems almost to call you by name .
the sweet and sublime face of <name> is beyond praise , yet how it <unk> all <unk> expectations !
this familiar , simple , <unk> countenance is as if one should meet a friend .
the knowledge of <unk> has its value , but listen not to their criticism when your heart is touched by genius .
it was not painted for them , it was painted for you ; for such as had eyes capable of being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions .
yet when we have said all our fine things about the arts , we must end with a <name> confession , that the arts , as we know them , are but initial .
our best praise is given to what they aimed and promised , not to the actual result .
he has conceived meanly of the resources of man , who believes that the best age of production is past .
the real value of the iliad or the <unk> is as signs of power ; billows or ripples they are of the stream of tendency ; tokens of the everlasting effort to produce , which even in its worst estate the soul betrays .
<name> has not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with the most potent influences of the world , if it is not practical and moral , if it do not stand in connection with the conscience , if it do not make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice of lofty cheer .
there is higher work for <name> than the arts .
they are abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated instinct .
<name> is the need to create ; but in its essence , immense and universal , it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands , and of making cripples and monsters , such as all pictures and statues are .
nothing less than the creation of man and nature is its end .
a man should find in it an outlet for his whole energy .
he may paint and carve only as long as he can do that .
<name> should <unk> , and throw down the walls of circumstance on every side , awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist , and its highest effect is to make new artists .
already history is old enough to witness the old age and disappearance of particular arts .
the <name> of sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect .
it was originally a useful <name> , a mode of writing , a savage 's record of gratitude or devotion , and among a people possessed of a wonderful perception of form this childish carving was refined to the utmost splendor of effect .
but it is the game of a rude and youthful people , and not the manly labor of a wise and spiritual nation .
under an <unk> loaded with leaves and nuts , under a sky full of eternal eyes , i stand in a thoroughfare ; but in the works of our plastic arts and especially of sculpture , creation is driven into a corner .
i can not hide from myself that there is a certain appearance of <unk> , as of toys and the trumpery of a theatre , in sculpture .
nature transcends all our moods of thought , and its secret we do not yet find .
but the gallery stands at the <name> of our moods , and there is a moment when it becomes frivolous .
i do not wonder that <name> , with an attention habitually engaged on the paths of planets and suns , should have wondered what the <name> of pembroke found to admire in " stone dolls . "
sculpture may serve to teach the pupil how deep is the secret of form , how purely the spirit can translate its meanings into that eloquent dialect .
but the statue <name> look cold and false before that new activity which needs to roll through all things , and is impatient of <unk> and things not alive .
picture and sculpture are the celebrations and festivities of form .
but true <name> is never fixed , but always flowing .
the sweetest music is not in the <unk> , but in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of tenderness , truth , or courage .
the <unk> has already lost its relation to the morning , to the sun , and the earth , but that persuading voice is in tune with these .
all works of <name> should not be detached , but <unk> performances .
a great man is a new statue in every attitude and action .
a beautiful woman is a picture which drives all beholders nobly mad .
life may be lyric or epic , as well as a poem or a romance .
a true announcement of the law of creation , if a man were found worthy to declare it , would <name> <name> up into the kingdom of nature , and destroy its separate and contrasted existence .
the fountains of invention and beauty in modern society are all but dried up .
a popular novel , a theatre , or a ball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers in the <unk> of this world , without dignity , without skill or industry .
<name> is as poor and low .
the old tragic necessity , which <unk> on the brows even of the <unk> and the <unk> of the antique , and furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous figures into nature ,  namely , that they were inevitable ; that the artist was drunk with a passion for form which he could not resist , and which <unk> itself in these fine <unk> ,  no longer <unk> the chisel or the pencil .
but the artist and the <unk> now seek in <name> the exhibition of their talent , or an asylum from the evils of life .
men are not well pleased with the figure they make in their own imaginations , and they flee to <name> , and convey their better sense in an <unk> , a statue , or a picture .
<name> makes the same effort which a sensual prosperity makes ; namely to detach the beautiful from the useful , to do up the work as unavoidable , and , hating it , pass on to enjoyment .
these <unk> and compensations , this division of beauty from use , the laws of nature do not permit .
as soon as beauty is sought , not from religion and love but for pleasure , it <unk> the seeker .
high beauty is no longer attainable by him in canvas or in stone , in sound , or in <unk> construction ; an <unk> , prudent , sickly beauty , which is not beauty , is all that can be formed ; for the hand can never execute any thing higher than the character can inspire .
the <name> that thus separates is itself first separated .
<name> must not be a superficial talent , but must begin farther back in man .
now men do not see nature to be beautiful , and they go to make a statue which shall be .
they abhor men as <unk> , dull , and <unk> , and console themselves with <unk> and blocks of marble .
they reject life as <unk> , and create a death which they call poetic .
they despatch the day 's weary <unk> , and fly to voluptuous reveries .
they eat and drink , that they may afterwards execute the ideal .
thus is <name> <unk> ; the name conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses ; it stands in the imagination as somewhat contrary to nature , and struck with death from the first .
would it not be better to begin higher up ,  to serve the ideal before they eat and drink ; to serve the ideal in eating and drinking , in drawing the breath , and in the functions of life ?
beauty must come back to the useful arts , and the distinction between the fine and the useful arts be forgotten .
if history were truly told , if life were nobly spent , it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from the other .
in nature , all is useful , all is beautiful .
it is therefore beautiful because it is alive , moving , reproductive ; it is therefore useful because it is symmetrical and fair .
beauty <name> not come at the call of a legislature , nor <name> it repeat in england or <name> its history in greece .
it <name> come , as always , <unk> , and spring up between the feet of brave and <name> men .
it is in vain that we look for genius to <unk> its miracles in the old arts ; it is its instinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary facts , in the field and road-side , in the shop and mill .
proceeding from a religious heart it <name> raise to a divine use the railroad , the insurance office , the <unk> company ; our law , our primary assemblies , our commerce , the galvanic battery , the electric jar , the prism , and the <unk> retort ; in which we seek now only an economical use .
is not the selfish and even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works , to mills , railways , and machinery , the effect of the mercenary impulses which these works obey ?
when its errands are <name> and adequate , a steamboat <unk> the atlantic between old and new england and arriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet , is a step of man into <name> with nature .
the boat at st. petersburg , which <unk> along the <name> by magnetism , needs little to make it sublime .
when science is learned in love , and its powers are wielded by love , they <name> appear the <unk> and <unk> of the material creation .
essays , second series by <name> <name> <name> the poet .
a moody child and wildly wise pursued the game with joyful eyes , which chose , like <unk> , their way , and <unk> the dark with private <name> : they <unk> the horizon 's edge , searched with apollo 's privilege ; through man , and woman , and sea , and <name> saw the dance of nature forward far ; through worlds , and races , and terms , and times saw musical order , and pairing rhymes .
<unk> bards who <name> divine ideas below , which always find us young , and always keep us so .
i .
the poet .
those who are esteemed umpires of taste are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures , and have an inclination for whatever is elegant ; but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls , and whether their own acts are like fair pictures , you learn that they are selfish and sensual .
their cultivation is local , as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire , all the rest remaining cold .
their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars , or some limited judgment of color or form , which is exercised for amusement or for show .
it is a proof of the <unk> of the doctrine of beauty as it lies in the minds of our amateurs , that men seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form upon soul .
there is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy .
we were put into our bodies , as fire is put into a pan to be carried about ; but there is no accurate adjustment between the spirit and the organ , much less is the latter the germination of the former .
so in regard to other forms , the intellectual men do not believe in any essential dependence of the material world on thought and volition .
<unk> think it a pretty <unk> to talk of the spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud , of a city or a contract , but they prefer to come again to the solid ground of historical evidence ; and even the poets are contented with a civil and <unk> manner of living , and to write poems from the fancy , at a safe distance from their own experience .
but the highest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the double meaning , or shall i say the quadruple or the <unk> or much more manifold meaning , of every <unk> fact ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , plato , plutarch , <name> , swedenborg , and the masters of sculpture , picture , and poetry .
for we are not pans and barrows , nor even porters of the fire and <unk> , but children of the fire , made of it , and only the same divinity <unk> and at two or three removes , when we know least about it .
and this hidden truth , that the fountains whence all this river of time and its creatures <unk> are <unk> ideal and beautiful , draws us to the consideration of the nature and functions of the poet , or the man of beauty ; to the means and materials he uses , and to the general aspect of the <name> in the present time .
the breadth of the problem is great , for the poet is representative .
he stands among partial men for the complete man , and <unk> us not of his wealth , but of the common wealth .
the young man <unk> men of genius , because , to speak truly , they are more himself than he is .
they receive of the soul as he also receives , but they more .
nature <unk> her beauty , to the eye of loving men , from their belief that the poet is beholding her shows at the same time .
he is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and by his <name> , but with this consolation in his pursuits , that they <name> draw all men sooner or later .
for all men live by truth and stand in need of expression .
in love , in <name> , in avarice , in politics , in labor , in games , we study to utter our painful secret .
the man is only half himself , the other half is his expression .
notwithstanding this necessity to be published , adequate expression is rare .
i know not how it is that we need an interpreter , but the great majority of men seem to be <unk> , who have not yet come into possession of their own , or <unk> , who can not report the conversation they have had with nature .
there is no man who does not anticipate a <unk> utility in the sun and stars , earth and water .
these stand and wait to render him a peculiar service .
but there is some obstruction or some excess of <unk> in our constitution , which does not suffer them to yield the due effect .
too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists .
every touch should thrill .
every man should be so much an artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him .
yet , in our experience , the rays or <unk> have sufficient force to arrive at the senses , but not enough to reach the quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in speech .
the poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance , the man without impediment , who sees and handles that which others dream of , traverses the whole scale of experience , and is representative of man , in virtue of being the largest power to receive and to impart .
for the universe has three children , born at one time , which reappear under different names in every system of thought , whether they be called cause , operation , and effect ; or , more <unk> , jove , <unk> , neptune ; or , <unk> , the father , the spirit , and the son ; but which we <name> call here the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> .
these stand respectively for the love of truth , for the love of good , and for the love of beauty .
these three are equal .
each is that which he is essentially , so that he can not be surmounted or analyzed , and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him , and his own , patent .
the poet is the <unk> , the <unk> , and represents beauty .
he is a sovereign , and stands on the centre .
for the world is not painted or adorned , but is from the beginning beautiful ; and god has not made some beautiful things , but beauty is the creator of the universe .
therefore the poet is not any <unk> potentate , but is emperor in his own right .
criticism is infested with a cant of <unk> , which assumes that <name> skill and activity is the first merit of all men , and <unk> such as say and do not , overlooking the fact that some men , namely poets , are natural <unk> , sent into the world to the end of expression , and <unk> them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the <unk> .
but <name> 's words are as costly and admirable to <name> as <unk> 's victories are to <unk> .
the poet does not wait for the hero or the sage , but , as they act and think primarily , so he writes primarily what <name> and must be spoken , reckoning the others , though primaries also , yet , in respect to him , <unk> and servants ; as <unk> or models in the studio of a painter , or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect .
for poetry was all written before time was , and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music , we hear those primal <unk> and attempt to write them down , but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own , and thus <unk> the poem .
the men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully , and these <unk> , though imperfect , become the songs of the nations .
for nature is as truly beautiful as it is good , or as it is reasonable , and must as much appear as it must be done , or be known .
words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy .
words are also actions , and actions are a kind of words .
the sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold .
he is the true and only doctor ; he knows and tells ; he is the only teller of news , for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes .
he is a beholder of ideas and an <unk> of the necessary and <unk> .
for we do not speak now of men of poetical talents , or of industry and skill in metre , but of the true poet .
i took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of <unk> , a man of subtle mind , whose head appeared to be a <unk> of delicate tunes and <unk> , and whose skill and command of language , we could not sufficiently praise .
but when the question arose whether he was not only a <unk> but a poet , we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary , not an eternal man .
he does not stand out of our low limitations , like a <unk> under the line , running up from the torrid base through all the climates of the globe , with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides ; but this genius is the <unk> of a modern house , adorned with fountains and statues , with well-bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces .
we hear , through all the varied music , the <unk> of conventional life .
our poets are men of talents who sing , and not the children of music .
the argument is secondary , the finish of the verses is primary .
for it is not metres , but a <unk> argument that makes a poem ,  a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own , and <unk> nature with a new thing .
the thought and the form are equal in the order of time , but in the order of <name> the thought is prior to the form .
the poet has a new thought ; he has a whole new experience to unfold ; he <name> tell us how it was with him , and all men <name> be the richer in his fortune .
for the experience of each new age requires a new confession , and the world seems always waiting for its poet .
i remember when i was young how much i was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table .
he had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither , and had written hundreds of lines , but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told ; he could tell nothing but that all was changed ,  man , beast , heaven , earth and sea .
how gladly we listened !
how <unk> !
society seemed to be compromised .
we sat in the <name> of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars .
boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before , or was much farther than that .
rome ,  what was rome ?
plutarch and shakspeare were in the yellow leaf , and <name> no more should be heard of .
it is much to know that poetry has been written this very day , under this very roof , by your side .
what !
that wonderful spirit has not expired !
these stony moments are still sparkling and animated !
i had fancied that the oracles were all silent , and nature had spent her fires ; and behold !
all night , from every pore , these fine <unk> have been streaming .
every one has some interest in the advent of the poet , and no one knows how much it may concern him .
we know that the secret of the world is profound , but who or what shall be our interpreter , we know not .
a mountain ramble , a new style of face , a new person , may put the key into our hands .
of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report .
talent may frolic and <unk> ; genius realizes and adds .
mankind in good <name> have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work , that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news .
it is the truest word ever spoken , and the phrase <name> be the fittest , most musical , and the unerring voice of the world for that time .
all that we call sacred history <unk> that the birth of a poet is the principal event in <unk> .
man , never so often deceived , still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth until he has made it his own .
with what <name> i begin to read a poem which i confide in as an inspiration !
and now my chains are to be broken ; i shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which i live ,  opaque , though they seem transparent ,  and from the heaven of truth i shall see and comprehend my relations .
that <name> reconcile me to life and <unk> nature , to see trifles animated by a tendency , and to know what i am doing .
life <name> no more be a noise ; now i shall see men and women , and know the signs by which they may be discerned from fools and <unk> .
this day shall be better than my birthday : then i became an animal ; now i am invited into the science of the real .
such is the <name> , but the <unk> is postponed .
oftener it falls that this winged man , who <name> <name> me into the heaven , whirls me into mists , then leaps and <unk> about with me as it were from cloud to cloud , still <unk> that he is bound heavenward ; and i , being myself a novice , am slow in perceiving that he does not know the way into the heavens , and is merely bent that i should admire his skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish , a little way from the ground or the water ; but the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> air of heaven that man shall never inhabit .
i tumble down again soon into my old nooks , and lead the life of exaggerations as before , and have lost my <name> in the possibility of any guide who can lead me thither where i would be .
but , leaving these victims of vanity , let us , with new <name> , observe how nature , by worthier impulses , has ensured the poet 's fidelity to his office of announcement and <unk> , namely by the beauty of things , which becomes a new and higher beauty when expressed .
nature offers all her creatures to him as a <unk> .
being used as a type , a second wonderful value appears in the object , far better than its old value ; as the carpenter 's stretched cord , if you hold your ear close enough , is musical in the breeze .
" things more excellent than every image , " says <unk> , " are expressed through images . "
things admit of being used as symbols because nature is a symbol , in the whole , and in every part .
every line we can draw in the sand has expression ; and there is no body without its spirit or genius .
all form is an effect of character ; all condition , of the quality of the life ; all <name> , of health ; and for this reason a perception of beauty should be sympathetic , or proper only to the good .
the beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary .
the soul makes the body , as the wise <unk> teaches :  " so every spirit , as it is most pure , and hath in it the more of heavenly light , so it the fairer body doth procure to habit in , and it more fairly <unk> , with cheerful <name> and amiable sight .
for , of the soul , the body form doth take , for soul is form , and doth the body make . "
here we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical speculation but in a holy place , and should go very warily and reverently .
we stand before the secret of the world , there where being passes into appearance and unity into variety .
the universe is the <unk> of the soul .
wherever the life is , that bursts into appearance around it .
our science is sensual , and therefore superficial .
the earth and the heavenly bodies , physics , and chemistry , we <unk> treat , as if they were <unk> ; but these are the retinue of that being we have .
" the mighty heaven , " said <unk> , " exhibits , in its <unk> , clear images of the splendor of intellectual perceptions ; being moved in conjunction with the <unk> periods of intellectual natures . "
therefore science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man , keeping step with religion and metaphysics ; or the state of science is an index of our <unk> .
since everything in nature answers to a moral power , if any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that the corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active .
no wonder then , if these waters be so deep , that we hover over them with a religious regard .
the beauty of the fable proves the importance of the sense ; to the poet , and to all others ; or , if you please , every man is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these enchantments of nature ; for all men have the thoughts whereof the universe is the celebration .
i find that the fascination resides in the symbol .
who loves nature ?
who does not ?
is it only poets , and men of leisure and cultivation , who live with her ?
no ; but also hunters , farmers , grooms , and butchers , though they express their affection in their choice of life and not in their choice of words .
the writer wonders what the coachman or the <name> values in riding , in horses and dogs .
it is not superficial qualities .
when you talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as you .
his worship is sympathetic ; he has no definitions , but he is commanded in nature , by the living power which he feels to be there present .
no imitation or playing of these things would content him ; he loves the <name> of the north wind , of rain , of stone , and wood , and iron .
a beauty not explicable is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the end of .
it is nature the symbol , nature <unk> the supernatural , body overflowed by life which he worships with coarse but sincere rites .
the <unk> and mystery of this attachment drives men of every class to the use of emblems .
the schools of poets and philosophers are not more intoxicated with their symbols than the populace with theirs .
in our political parties , <unk> the power of badges and emblems .
see the great ball which they roll from baltimore to bunker hill !
in the political processions , <name> goes in a loom , and <name> in a shoe , and salem in a ship .
witness the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all the <unk> of party .
see the power of national emblems .
some stars , lilies , <unk> , a crescent , a lion , an eagle , or other figure which came into credit god knows how , on an old rag of bunting , blowing in the wind on a fort at the ends of the earth , shall make the blood tingle under the rudest or the most conventional exterior .
the people fancy they hate poetry , and they are all poets and <unk> !
beyond this universality of the symbolic language , we are <unk> of the <unk> of this superior use of things , whereby the world is a <name> whose walls are covered with emblems , pictures , and commandments of the deity ,  in this , that there is no fact in nature which does not <name> the whole sense of nature ; and the distinctions which we make in events and in affairs , of low and high , honest and base , disappear when nature is used as a symbol .
thought makes everything fit for use .
the vocabulary of an <unk> man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation .
what would be base , or even obscene , to the obscene , becomes illustrious , spoken in a new connexion of thought .
the piety of the hebrew prophets <unk> their <unk> .
the <unk> is an example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive .
small and mean things serve as well as great symbols .
the meaner the type by which a law is expressed , the more pungent it is , and the more lasting in the memories of men : just as we choose the smallest box or case in which any needful <unk> can be carried .
bare lists of words are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind ; as it is related of lord chatham that he was accustomed to read in <name> 's dictionary when he was preparing to speak in parliament .
the poorest experience is <name> enough for all the purposes of expressing thought .
why <unk> a knowledge of new facts ?
day and night , house and garden , a few books , a few actions , serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles .
we are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use .
we can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity .
it does not need that a poem should be long .
every word was once a poem .
every new relation is a new word .
also we use defects and deformities to a sacred purpose , so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such only to the evil eye .
in the old mythology , <unk> observe , defects are ascribed to divine natures , as <unk> to <unk> , blindness to cupid , and the like ,  to signify <unk> .
for as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of god that makes things ugly , the poet , who <unk> things to nature and the whole ,  <unk> even artificial things and <unk> of nature , to nature , by a deeper insight ,  disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts .
readers of poetry see the <unk> and the railway , and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by these ; for these works of <name> are not yet consecrated in their reading ; but the poet sees them fall within the great order not less than the <unk> or the spider 's geometrical web .
nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles , and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own .
besides , in a centred mind , it signifies nothing how many mechanical inventions you exhibit .
though you add millions , and never so surprising , the fact of mechanics has not gained a grain 's weight .
the spiritual fact remains unalterable , by many or by few particulars ; as no mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere .
a shrewd <unk> goes to the city for the first time , and the complacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder .
it is not that he does not see all the fine houses and know that he never saw such before , but he disposes of them as easily as the poet finds place for the railway .
the chief value of the new fact is to enhance the great and constant fact of life , which can dwarf any and every circumstance , and to which the belt of <unk> and the commerce of <name> are alike .
the world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun , the poet is he who can articulate it .
for though life is great , and <unk> , and absorbs ; and though all men are intelligent of the symbols through which it is named ; yet they can not originally use them .
we are symbols and inhabit symbols ; workmen , work , and tools , words and things , birth and death , all are emblems ; but we sympathize with the symbols , and being infatuated with the economical uses of things , we do not know that they are thoughts .
the poet , by an ulterior intellectual perception , gives them a power which makes their old use forgotten , and puts eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate object .
he perceives the independence of the thought on the symbol , the stability of the thought , the <unk> and <unk> of the symbol .
as the eyes of <unk> were said to see through the earth , so the poet turns the world to glass , and shows us all things in their right series and procession .
for through that better perception he stands one step nearer to things , and sees the flowing or metamorphosis ; perceives that thought is multiform ; that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form ; and following with his eyes the life , uses the forms which express that life , and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature .
all the facts of the animal economy , sex , nutriment , gestation , birth , growth , are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man , to suffer there a change and reappear a new and higher fact .
he uses forms according to the life , and not according to the form .
this is true science .
the poet alone knows astronomy , chemistry , vegetation and animation , for he does not stop at these facts , but employs them as signs .
he knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars ; why the great deep is adorned with animals , with men , and gods ; for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought .
by virtue of this science the poet is the <unk> or <unk> , naming things sometimes after their appearance , sometimes after their essence , and giving to every one its own name and not another 's , thereby rejoicing the intellect , which delights in detachment or boundary .
the poets made all the words , and therefore language is the archives of history , and , if we must say it , a sort of tomb of the muses .
for though the origin of most of our words is forgotten , each word was at first a stroke of genius , and obtained currency because for the moment it <unk> the world to the first speaker and to the hearer .
the <unk> finds the <unk> word to have been once a brilliant picture .
language is fossil poetry .
as the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of <unk> , so language is made up of images or <unk> , which now , in their secondary use , have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin .
but the poet names the thing because he sees it , or comes one step nearer to it than any other .
this expression or naming is not <name> , but a second nature , grown out of the first , as a leaf out of a tree .
what we call nature is a certain <unk> motion or change ; and nature does all things by her own hands , and does not leave another to <unk> her but <unk> herself ; and this through the metamorphosis again .
i remember that a certain poet described it to me thus : genius is the activity which repairs the <unk> of things , whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind .
nature , through all her kingdoms , <unk> herself .
nobody cares for planting the poor fungus ; so she shakes down from the gills of one <unk> countless <unk> , any one of which , being preserved , transmits new billions of <unk> to-morrow or next day .
the new <unk> of this hour has a chance which the old one had not .
this atom of seed is thrown into a new place , not subject to the accidents which destroyed its parent two rods off .
she makes a man ; and having brought him to ripe age , she <name> no longer run the risk of losing this wonder at a blow , but she <unk> from him a new self , that the kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed .
so when the soul of the poet has come to <unk> of thought , she <unk> and sends away from it its poems or songs ,  a fearless , sleepless , deathless progeny , which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time ; a fearless , vivacious offspring , clad with wings ( such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came ) which <name> them fast and far , and <unk> them <unk> into the hearts of men .
these wings are the beauty of the poet 's soul .
the songs , thus flying immortal from their mortal parent , are pursued by clamorous flights of <unk> , which swarm in far greater <name> and threaten to devour them ; but these last are not winged .
at the end of a very short leap they fall plump down and rot , having received from the souls out of which they came no beautiful wings .
but the melodies of the poet ascend and leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time .
so far the bard taught me , using his freer speech .
but nature has a higher end , in the production of new individuals , than security , namely ascension , or the passage of the soul into higher forms .
i knew in my younger days the sculptor who made the statue of the youth which stands in the public garden .
he was , as i remember , unable to tell directly , what made him happy or unhappy , but by wonderful <unk> he could tell .
he rose one day , according to his habit , before the <name> , and saw the morning break , grand as the eternity out of which it came , and for many days after , he strove to express this tranquillity , and lo !
his chisel had fashioned out of marble the form of a beautiful youth , phosphorus , whose aspect is such that it is said all persons who look on it become silent .
the poet also <unk> himself to his mood , and that thought which agitated him is expressed , but alter <unk> , in a manner totally new .
the expression is organic , or the new type which things themselves take when liberated .
as , in the sun , objects paint their images on the retina of the eye , so they , sharing the aspiration of the whole universe , tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence in his mind .
like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms is their change into melodies .
over everything stands its <unk> or soul , and , as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye , so the soul of the thing is reflected by a <name> .
the sea , the <unk> , niagara , and every <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , in <unk> , which sail like odors in the air , and when any man goes by with an ear sufficiently fine , he <unk> them and endeavors to write down the notes without <unk> or <unk> them .
and herein is the <unk> of criticism , in the mind 's <name> that the poems are a corrupt version of some text in nature with which they ought to be made to tally .
a rhyme in one of our <unk> should not be less pleasing than the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , or the resembling difference of a group of flowers .
the pairing of the birds is an <unk> , not tedious as our <unk> are ; a tempest is a rough ode , without falsehood or <unk> ; a summer , with its harvest sown , <unk> , and stored , is an epic song , <unk> how many admirably executed parts .
why should not the symmetry and truth that <unk> these , glide into our spirits , and we participate the invention of nature ?
this insight , which expresses itself by what is called imagination , is a very high sort of seeing , which does not come by study , but by the intellect being where and what it sees ; by sharing the path or circuit of things through forms , and so making them <unk> to others .
the path of things is silent .
<name> they suffer a speaker to go with them ?
a spy they <name> not suffer ; a lover , a poet , is the <unk> of their own nature ,  him they <name> suffer .
the condition of true naming , on the poet 's part , is his <unk> himself to the divine <name> which breathes through forms , and accompanying that .
it is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns , that , beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect he is capable of a new energy ( as of an intellect doubled on itself ) , by abandonment to the nature of things ; that beside his privacy of power as an individual man , there is a great public power on which he can draw , by <unk> , at all risks , his human doors , and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him ; then he is caught up into the life of the universe , his speech is thunder , his thought is law , and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals .
the poet knows that he speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly , or , " with the flower of the mind ; " not with the intellect used as an organ , but with the intellect released from all service and suffered to take its direction from its celestial life ; or as the ancients were wont to express themselves , not with intellect alone but with the intellect <unk> by nectar .
as the traveller who has lost his way throws his reins on his horse 's neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road , so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world .
for if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct , new passages are opened for us into nature ; the mind flows into and through things hardest and highest , and the metamorphosis is possible .
this is the reason why bards love wine , <unk> , <unk> , coffee , tea , opium , the fumes of <unk> and tobacco , or whatever other <unk> of animal exhilaration .
all men avail themselves of such means as they can , to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers ; and to this end they prize conversation , music , pictures , sculpture , dancing , theatres , travelling , war , mobs , fires , gaming , politics , or love , or science , or animal intoxication ,  which are several coarser or finer <unk> substitutes for the true nectar , which is the <unk> of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact .
these are auxiliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man , to his passage out into free space , and they help him to escape the custody of that body in which he is pent up , and of that <unk> of individual relations in which he is enclosed .
hence a great number of such as were <unk> <unk> of beauty , as painters , poets , musicians , and actors , have been more than others wont to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence ; all but the few who received the true nectar ; and , as it was a <unk> mode of attaining freedom , as it was an emancipation not into the heavens but into the freedom of baser places , they were punished for that advantage they won , by a dissipation and deterioration .
but never can any advantage be taken of nature by a trick .
the spirit of the world , the great calm presence of the creator , comes not forth to the <unk> of opium or of wine .
the sublime vision comes to the pure and simple soul in a clean and chaste body .
that is not an inspiration , which we owe to <unk> , but some counterfeit excitement and fury .
<name> says that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously , but the epic poet , he who shall sing of the gods and their descent unto men , must drink water out of a wooden bowl .
for poetry is not <unk> 's wine , ' but god 's wine .
it is with this as it is with toys .
we fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls , drums , and horses ; withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and <unk> objects of nature , the sun , and moon , the animals , the water , and stones , which should be their toys .
so the poet 's habit of living should be set on a key so low that the common influences should delight him .
his cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight ; the air should suffice for his inspiration , and he should be tipsy with water .
that spirit which suffices quiet hearts , which seems to come forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass , from every <unk> and <unk> stone on which the dull march sun shines , comes forth to the poor and hungry , and such as are of simple taste .
if thou fill thy <name> with boston and new york , with fashion and <unk> , and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with wine and french coffee , thou shalt find no radiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the <unk> .
if the imagination <unk> the poet , it is not inactive in other men .
the metamorphosis excites in the beholder an emotion of <name> .
the use of symbols has a certain power of emancipation and exhilaration for all men .
we seem to be touched by a wand which makes us dance and run about happily , like children .
we are like persons who come out of a cave or cellar into the open air .
this is the effect on us of <unk> , fables , oracles , and all poetic forms .
poets are thus <unk> gods .
men have really got a new sense , and found within their world another world , or nest of worlds ; for , the metamorphosis once seen , we divine that it does not stop .
i <name> not now consider how much this makes the charm of algebra and the mathematics , which also have their <unk> , but it is felt in every definition ; as when aristotle <unk> space to be an immovable vessel in which things are contained ;  or when plato <unk> a line to be a flowing point ; or figure to be a bound of solid ; and many the like .
what a joyful sense of freedom we have when <unk> announces the old opinion of artists that no architect can build any house well who does not know something of anatomy .
when socrates , in <unk> , tells us that the soul is cured of its maladies by certain incantations , and that these incantations are beautiful reasons , from which temperance is generated in souls ; when plato calls the world an animal ; and <unk> affirms that the plants also are animals ; or affirms a man to be a heavenly tree , growing with his root , which is his head , upward ; and , as <name> chapman , following him , writes ,  " so in our tree of man , whose <unk> root springs in his top ; "  when <unk> speaks of <unk> as " that white flower which marks extreme old age ; " when <unk> calls the universe the statue of the intellect ; when chaucer , in his praise of <unk> , ' compares good blood in mean condition to fire , which , though carried to the darkest house betwixt this and the mount of <unk> , <name> yet hold its natural office and burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it behold ; when <name> saw , in the <unk> , the ruin of the world through evil , and the stars fall from heaven as the <unk> <unk> her untimely fruit ; when <unk> reports the whole catalogue of common daily relations through the masquerade of birds and beasts ;  we take the cheerful hint of the immortality of our essence and its versatile habit and escapes , as when the gypsies say " it is in vain to <name> them , they can not die . "
the poets are thus <unk> gods .
the ancient british bards had for the title of their order , " those who are free throughout the world . "
they are free , and they make free .
an imaginative book renders us much more service at first , by stimulating us through its <unk> , than afterward when we arrive at the precise sense of the author .
i think nothing is of any value in books excepting the <unk> and extraordinary .
if a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought , to that degree that he forgets the authors and the public and <unk> only this one dream which holds him like an insanity , let me read his paper , and you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism .
all the value which attaches to <unk> , <unk> , <name> <unk> , <unk> , kepler , swedenborg , <unk> , <unk> , or any other who introduces questionable facts into his <unk> , as angels , devils , magic , <unk> , <unk> , mesmerism , and so on , is the certificate we have of departure from routine , and that here is a new witness .
that also is the best success in conversation , the magic of <name> , which puts the world like a ball in our hands .
how cheap even the <name> then seems ; how mean to study , when an emotion communicates to the intellect the power to sap and <unk> nature ; how great the perspective !
nations , times , systems , enter and disappear like threads in tapestry of large figure and many colors ; dream delivers us to dream , and while the drunkenness lasts we <name> sell our bed , our philosophy , our religion , in our opulence .
there is good reason why we should prize this liberation .
the fate of the poor shepherd , who , blinded and lost in the snow-storm , <unk> in a drift within a few feet of his cottage door , is an emblem of the state of man .
on the brink of the waters of life and truth , we are miserably dying .
the <unk> of every thought but that we are in , is wonderful .
what if you come near to it ; you are as remote when you are nearest as when you are farthest .
every thought is also a prison ; every heaven is also a prison .
therefore we love the poet , the inventor , who in any form , whether in an ode or in an action or in looks and behavior has yielded us a new thought .
he <unk> our chains and admits us to a new scene .
this emancipation is dear to all men , and the power to impart it , as it must come from greater depth and scope of thought , is a measure of intellect .
therefore all books of the imagination endure , all which ascend to that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him , and uses it as his <unk> .
every verse or sentence possessing this virtue <name> take care of its own immortality .
the religions of the world are the ejaculations of a few imaginative men .
but the quality of the imagination is to flow , and not to freeze .
the poet did not stop at the color or the form , but read their meaning ; neither may he rest in this meaning , but he makes the same objects <unk> of his new thought .
here is the difference betwixt the poet and the mystic , that the last nails a symbol to one sense , which was a true sense for a moment , but soon becomes old and false .
for all symbols are <unk> ; all language is <unk> and <unk> , and is good , as <unk> and horses are , for conveyance , not as farms and houses are , for homestead .
<unk> consists in the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one .
the <unk> happens to be the favorite meteor to the eyes of <name> <unk> , and comes to stand to him for truth and <name> ; and , he believes , should stand for the same realities to every reader .
but the first reader prefers as naturally the symbol of a mother and child , or a gardener and his bulb , or a <unk> polishing a gem .
either of these , or of a myriad more , are equally good to the person to whom they are significant .
only they must be held lightly , and be very willingly translated into the equivalent terms which others use .
and the mystic must be steadily told ,  all that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it .
let us have a little algebra , instead of this <unk> rhetoric ,  universal signs , instead of these village symbols ,  and we shall both be <unk> .
the history of <unk> seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid , and was at last nothing but an excess of the organ of language .
swedenborg , of all men in the recent ages , stands eminently for the translator of nature into thought .
i do not know the man in history to whom things stood so uniformly for words .
before him the metamorphosis continually plays .
everything on which his eye rests , obeys the impulses of moral nature .
the figs become grapes whilst he eats them .
when some of his angels affirmed a truth , the <name> twig which they held blossomed in their hands .
the noise which at a distance appeared like <unk> and thumping , on coming nearer was found to be the voice of <unk> .
the men in one of his visions , seen in heavenly light , appeared like dragons , and seemed in darkness ; but to each other they appeared as men , and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin , they complained of the darkness , and were compelled to shut the window that they might see .
there was this perception in him which makes the poet or seer an object of awe and terror , namely that the same man or society of men may wear one aspect to themselves and their companions , and a different aspect to higher <unk> .
certain priests , whom he describes as conversing very <unk> together , appeared to the children who were at some distance , like dead horses ; and many the like <unk> .
and instantly the mind <unk> whether these fishes under the bridge , yonder oxen in the pasture , those dogs in the yard , are <unk> fishes , oxen , and dogs , or only so appear to me , and perchance to themselves appear upright men ; and whether i appear as a man to all eyes .
the <unk> and <unk> propounded the same question , and if any poet has witnessed the transformation he doubtless found it in <name> with various experiences .
we have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and caterpillars .
he is the poet and shall draw us with love and terror , who sees through the flowing vest the firm nature , and can declare it .
i look in vain for the poet whom i describe .
we do not with sufficient <unk> or sufficient <unk> address ourselves to life , nor dare we <unk> our own times and social circumstance .
if we filled the day with bravery , we should not shrink from celebrating it .
time and nature yield us many gifts , but not yet the timely man , the new religion , the <unk> , whom all things await .
<name> 's praise is that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher , or into universality .
we have yet had no genius in <name> , with <unk> eye , which knew the value of our incomparable materials , and saw , in the barbarism and <unk> of the times , another carnival of the same gods whose picture he so much admires in <name> ; then in the middle age ; then in <unk> .
banks and <unk> , the newspaper and caucus , <unk> and <unk> , are flat and dull to dull people , but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of <name> and the <name> of delphi , and are as swiftly passing away .
our <unk> , our stumps and their politics , our <unk> , our negroes and indians , our boats and our <unk> , the wrath of rogues and the <unk> of honest men , the northern trade , the southern planting , the western clearing , oregon and texas , are yet <unk> .
yet <name> is a poem in our eyes ; its ample geography <unk> the imagination , and it <name> not wait long for metres .
if i have not found that excellent combination of gifts in my countrymen which i seek , neither could i aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now and then in <unk> 's collection of five centuries of english poets .
these are wits more than poets , though there have been poets among them .
but when we adhere to the ideal of the poet , we have our difficulties even with <name> and <name> .
<name> is too literary , and <name> too literal and historical .
but i am not wise enough for a national criticism , and must use the old <unk> a little longer , to discharge my errand from the muse to the poet concerning his <name> .
<name> is the path of the creator to his work .
the paths or methods are ideal and eternal , though few men ever see them ; not the artist himself for years , or for a lifetime , unless he come into the conditions .
the painter , the sculptor , the <unk> , the epic <unk> , the orator , all partake one <name> , namely to express themselves symmetrically and abundantly , not <unk> and <unk> .
they found or put themselves in certain conditions , as , the painter and sculptor before some impressive human figures ; the orator , into the assembly of the people ; and the others in such scenes as each has found exciting to his intellect ; and each presently feels the new <name> .
he hears a voice , he sees a beckoning .
then he is <unk> , with wonder , what herds of <unk> hem him in .
he can no more rest ; he says , with the old painter , " by god , it is in me and must go forth of me . "
he pursues a beauty , half seen , which flies before him .
the poet pours out verses in every solitude .
most of the things he says are conventional , no doubt ; but by and by he says something which is original and beautiful .
that charms him .
he would say nothing else but such things .
in our way of talking we say 'that is yours , this is mine ; ' but the poet knows well that it is not his ; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you ; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length .
once having tasted this immortal <unk> , he can not have enough of it , and as an admirable creative power exists in these <unk> , it is of the last importance that these things get spoken .
what a little of all we know is said !
what drops of all the sea of our science are <unk> up !
and by what accident it is that these are exposed , when so many secrets sleep in nature !
hence the necessity of speech and song ; hence these <unk> and <unk> in the orator , at the door of the assembly , to the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as <unk> , or word .
doubt not , o poet , but persist .
say 'it is in me , and shall out . '
stand there , balked and dumb , <unk> and stammering , hissed and hooted , stand and strive , until at last rage draw out of thee that <unk> which every night shows thee is thine own ; a power <unk> all limit and privacy , and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity .
nothing walks , or creeps , or grows , or exists , which must not in turn arise and walk before him as <unk> of his meaning .
comes he to that power , his genius is no longer <unk> .
all the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into his mind as into a <name> 's ark , to come forth again to people a new world .
this is like the stock of air for our respiration or for the combustion of our fireplace ; not a measure of gallons , but the entire atmosphere if wanted .
and therefore the <name> poets , as <name> , chaucer , shakspeare , and <name> , have obviously no limits to their works except the limits of their lifetime , and resemble a mirror carried through the street , ready to render an image of every created thing .
o poet !
a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures , and not in castles or by the <unk> any longer .
the conditions are hard , but equal .
thou shalt leave the world , and know the muse only .
thou shalt not know any longer the times , customs , graces , politics , or opinions of men , but shalt take all from the muse .
for the time of towns is <unk> from the world by funereal <unk> , but in nature the universal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants , and by growth of <name> on <name> .
god wills also that thou <unk> a manifold and <unk> life , and that thou be content that others speak for thee .
others shall be thy gentlemen and shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee ; others shall do the great and resounding actions also .
thou shalt lie close hid with nature , and canst not be afforded to the capitol or the exchange .
the world is full of <unk> and <unk> , and this is thine : thou must pass for a fool and a <unk> for a long season .
this is the screen and sheath in which pan has protected his well-beloved flower , and thou shalt be known only to thine own , and they shall console thee with tenderest love .
and thou shalt not be able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse , for an old shame before the holy ideal .
and this is the reward ; that the ideal shall be real to thee , and the impressions of the actual world shall fall like summer rain , copious , but not troublesome , to thy invulnerable essence .
thou shalt have the whole land for thy park and manor , the sea for thy bath and navigation , without tax and without envy ; the woods and the rivers thou shalt own ; and thou shalt possess that wherein others are only tenants and boarders .
thou true <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
wherever snow falls or water flows or birds fly , wherever day and night meet in twilight , wherever the blue heaven is <name> by clouds or sown with stars , wherever are forms with transparent boundaries , wherever are <unk> into celestial space , wherever is danger , and awe , and love ,  there is beauty , <unk> as rain , shed for thee , and though thou <unk> walk the world over , thou shalt not be able to find a condition <unk> or ignoble .
***** experience .
the lords of life , the lords of life ,  i saw them pass , in their own guise , like and unlike , portly and grim , use and surprise , surface and dream , succession swift , and spectral wrong , temperament without a tongue , and the inventor of the game <unk> without name ;  some to see , some to be guessed , they marched from east to west : little man , least of all , among the legs of his guardians tall , walked about with puzzled look :  him by the hand dear nature took ; dearest nature , strong and kind , whispered , <unk> , never mind !
tomorrow they <name> wear another face , the founder thou !
these are thy race ! '
ii .
experience .
where do we find ourselves ?
in a series of which we do not know the extremes , and believe that it has none .
we wake and find ourselves on a stair ; there are stairs below us , which we seem to have ascended ; there are stairs above us , many a one , which go upward and out of sight .
but the genius which according to the old belief stands at the door by which we enter , and gives us the <unk> to drink , that we may tell no tales , mixed the cup too strongly , and we can not shake off the lethargy now at noonday .
sleep lingers all our lifetime about our eyes , as night hovers all day in the boughs of the <unk> .
all things swim and glitter .
our life is not so much threatened as our perception .
<unk> we glide through nature , and should not know our place again .
did our birth fall in some fit of <unk> and <unk> in nature , that she was so sparing of her fire and so liberal of her earth that it appears to us that we lack the affirmative principle , and though we have health and reason , yet we have no <unk> of spirit for new creation ?
we have enough to live and bring the year about , but not an ounce to impart or to invest .
ah that our genius were a little more of a genius !
we are like <unk> on the lower levels of a stream , when the factories above them have exhausted the water .
we too fancy that the upper people must have raised their <unk> .
if any of us knew what we were doing , or where we are going , then when we think we best know !
we do not know to-day whether we are busy or idle .
in times when we thought ourselves indolent , we have afterwards discovered that much was accomplished , and much was begun in us .
all our days are so unprofitable while they pass , that 't is wonderful where or when we ever got anything of this which we call wisdom , poetry , virtue .
we never got it on any dated calendar day .
some heavenly days must have been intercalated somewhere , like those that <unk> won with dice of the moon , that <unk> might be born .
it is said all <unk> looked mean when they were suffered .
every ship is a romantic object , except that we sail in .
embark , and the romance quits our vessel and hangs on every other sail in the horizon .
our life looks trivial , and we shun to record it .
men seem to have learned of the horizon the <name> of perpetual retreating and reference .
<unk> uplands are <name> pasturage , and my neighbor has fertile meadow , but my field , ' says the <unk> farmer , 'only holds the world together . '
i quote another man 's saying ; unluckily that other <unk> himself in the same way , and quotes me .
't is the trick of nature thus to degrade to-day ; a good deal of buzz , and somewhere a result slipped magically in .
every roof is agreeable to the eye until it is lifted ; then we find tragedy and moaning women and <unk> husbands and deluges of <unk> , and the men ask , 'what 's the news ? '
as if the old were so bad .
how many individuals can we count in society ?
how many actions ?
how many opinions ?
so much of our time is preparation , so much is routine , and so much retrospect , that the pith of each man 's genius contracts itself to a very few hours .
the history of literature  take the net result of <unk> , <unk> , or schlegel ,  is a sum of very few ideas and of very few original tales ; all the rest being variation of these .
so in this great society wide lying around us , a critical analysis would find very few spontaneous actions .
it is almost all custom and gross sense .
there are even few opinions , and these seem organic in the speakers , and do not disturb the universal necessity .
what opium is <unk> into all disaster !
it shows formidable as we approach it , but there is at last no rough rasping friction , but the most slippery sliding surfaces .
we fall soft on a thought ; ate <unk> is gentle ,  " over men 's heads walking aloft , with tender feet treading so soft . "
people grieve and <unk> themselves , but it is not half so bad with them as they say .
there are moods in which we court suffering , in the <name> that here at least we shall find reality , sharp peaks and edges of truth .
but it turns out to be <unk> and counterfeit .
the only thing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is .
that , like all the rest , plays about the surface , and never introduces me into the reality , for contact with which we would even pay the costly price of sons and lovers .
was it <unk> who found out that bodies never come in contact ?
well , souls never touch their objects .
an <unk> sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with .
grief too <name> make us <unk> .
in the death of my son , now more than two years ago , i seem to have lost a beautiful estate ,  no more .
i can not get it nearer to me .
if to-morrow i should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal <unk> , the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me , perhaps , for many years ; but it would leave me as it found me ,  neither better nor worse .
so is it with this calamity : it does not touch me ; something which i fancied was a part of me , which could not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged without enriching me , falls off from me and leaves no scar .
it was <unk> .
i grieve that grief can teach me nothing , nor <name> me one step into real nature .
the indian who was laid under a curse that the wind should not blow on him , nor water flow to him , nor fire burn him , is a type of us all .
the dearest events are <unk> , and we the <unk> coats that shed every drop .
nothing is left us now but death .
we look to that with a grim satisfaction , saying there at least is reality that <name> not dodge us .
i take this <unk> and <unk> of all objects , which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest , to be the most <unk> part of our condition .
nature does not like to be observed , and likes that we should be her fools and playmates .
we may have the sphere for our <unk> , but not a <name> for our philosophy .
direct strokes she never gave us power to make ; all our blows glance , all our hits are accidents .
our relations to each other are oblique and casual .
dream delivers us to dream , and there is no end to illusion .
life is a train of moods like a string of beads , and as we pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own <name> , and each shows only what lies in its focus .
from the mountain you see the mountain .
we animate what we can , and we see only what we animate .
nature and books belong to the eyes that see them .
it depends on the mood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem .
there are always sunsets , and there is always genius ; but only a few hours so serene that we can relish nature or criticism .
the more or less depends on structure or temperament .
temperament is the iron wire on which the beads are strung .
of what use is fortune or talent to a cold and defective nature ?
who cares what sensibility or discrimination a man has at some time shown , if he falls asleep in his chair ?
or if he laugh and giggle ?
or if he apologize ?
or is infected with egotism ?
or thinks of his dollar ?
or can not go by food ?
or has gotten a child in his boyhood ?
of what use is genius , if the organ is too convex or too concave and can not find a <unk> distance within the actual horizon of human life ?
of what use , if the <name> is too cold or too hot , and the man does not care enough for results to stimulate him to experiment , and hold him up in it ?
or if the web is too finely woven , too irritable by pleasure and pain , so that life <unk> from too much reception without due outlet ?
of what use to make heroic vows of amendment , if the same old <unk> is to keep them ?
what cheer can the religious sentiment yield , when that is suspected to be secretly dependent on the seasons of the year and the state of the blood ?
i knew a witty physician who found the creed in the <unk> <unk> , and used to affirm that if there was disease in the liver , the man became a <unk> , and if that organ was sound , he became a <unk> .
very <unk> is the reluctant experience that some unfriendly excess or imbecility <unk> the promise of genius .
we see young men who owe us a new world , so readily and lavishly they promise , but they never acquit the debt ; they die young and dodge the account ; or if they live they lose themselves in the crowd .
temperament also enters fully into the system of illusions and shuts us in a prison of glass which we can not see .
there is an optical illusion about every person we meet .
in truth they are all creatures of given temperament , which <name> appear in a given character , whose boundaries they <name> never pass : but we look at them , they seem alive , and we presume there is impulse in them .
in the moment it seems impulse ; in the year , in the lifetime , it turns out to be a certain uniform tune which the revolving barrel of the <unk> must play .
men resist the conclusion in the morning , but adopt it as the evening wears on , that temper prevails over everything of time , place , and condition , and is <unk> in the flames of religion .
some modifications the moral sentiment avails to impose , but the individual texture holds its dominion , if not to bias the moral judgments , yet to fix the measure of activity and of enjoyment .
i thus express the law as it is read from the platform of ordinary life , but must not leave it without noticing the capital exception .
for temperament is a power which no man willingly hears any one praise but himself .
on the platform of physics we can not resist the contracting influences of so-called science .
temperament puts all divinity to rout .
i know the mental <unk> of physicians .
i hear the chuckle of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , they esteem each man the victim of another , who winds him round his finger by knowing the law of his being ; and by such cheap <unk> as the color of his beard or the slope of his <unk> , reads the inventory of his fortunes and character .
the <unk> ignorance does not disgust like this impudent <unk> .
the physicians say they are not <unk> ; but they are :  spirit is matter reduced to an extreme thinness : o so thin !  but the definition of spiritual should be , that which is its own evidence .
what notions do they attach to love !
what to religion !
one would not willingly pronounce these words in their hearing , and give them the occasion to profane them .
i saw a gracious gentleman who <unk> his conversation to the form of the head of the man he talks with !
i had fancied that the value of life lay in its inscrutable possibilities ; in the fact that i never know , in addressing myself to a new individual , what may befall me .
i <name> the keys of my castle in my hand , ready to throw them at the feet of my lord , whenever and in what disguise <unk> he shall appear .
i know he is in the neighborhood hidden among vagabonds .
shall i <unk> my future by taking a high seat and kindly adapting my conversation to the shape of heads ?
when i come to that , the doctors shall buy me for a cent.  'but , sir , medical history ; the report to the institute ; the proven facts ! '
 i distrust the facts and the inferences .
temperament is the <unk> or <unk> in the constitution , very justly applied to restrain an opposite excess in the constitution , but absurdly offered as a bar to original <unk> .
when virtue is in presence , all subordinate powers sleep .
on its own level , or in view of nature , temperament is final .
i see not , if one be once caught in this trap of so-called sciences , any escape for the man from the links of the chain of physical necessity .
given such an embryo , such a history must follow .
on this platform one lives in a sty of <unk> , and would soon come to suicide .
but it is impossible that the creative power should exclude itself .
into every intelligence there is a door which is never closed , through which the creator passes .
the intellect , seeker of absolute truth , or the heart , lover of absolute good , <unk> for our succor , and at one whisper of these high powers we awake from ineffectual struggles with this nightmare .
we hurl it into its own hell , and can not again contract ourselves to so base a state .
the secret of the <unk> is in the necessity of a succession of moods or objects .
gladly we would anchor , but the anchorage is quicksand .
this onward trick of nature is too strong for us : <unk> si <unk> .
when at night i look at the moon and stars , i seem stationary , and they to hurry .
our love of the real draws us to permanence , but health of body consists in circulation , and sanity of mind in variety or facility of association .
we need change of objects .
dedication to one thought is quickly odious .
we house with the insane , and must humor them ; then conversation dies out .
once i took such delight in montaigne , that i thought i should not need any other book ; before that , in shakspeare ; then in plutarch ; then in <unk> ; at one time in bacon ; afterwards in goethe ; even in <unk> ; but now i turn the pages of either of them languidly , whilst i still <name> their genius .
so with pictures ; each <name> bear an emphasis of attention once , which it can not retain , though we fain would continue to be pleased in that manner .
how strongly i have felt of pictures that when you have seen one well , you must take your leave of it ; you shall never see it again .
i have had good lessons from pictures which i have since seen without emotion or remark .
a deduction must be made from the opinion which even the wise express of a new book or occurrence .
their opinion gives me tidings of their mood , and some vague guess at the new fact , but is nowise to be trusted as the lasting relation between that intellect and that thing .
the child asks , <unk> , why do n't i like the story as well as when you told it me yesterday ? '
alas !
child it is even so with the oldest <unk> of knowledge .
but <name> it answer thy question to say , because thou wert born to a whole and this story is a particular ?
the reason of the pain this discovery causes us ( and we make it late in respect to works of <name> and intellect ) , is the <unk> of tragedy which murmurs from it in regard to persons , to friendship and love .
that <unk> and absence of elasticity which we find in the arts , we find with more pain in the artist .
there is no power of expansion in men .
our friends early appear to us as representatives of certain ideas which they never pass or exceed .
they stand on the brink of the ocean of thought and power , but they never take the single step that would bring them there .
a man is like a bit of labrador spar , which has no lustre as you turn it in your hand until you come to a particular <name> ; then it shows deep and beautiful colors .
there is no adaptation or universal <unk> in men , but each has his special talent , and the mastery of successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when that turn shall be oftenest to be practised .
we do what we must , and call it by the best names we can , and would fain have the praise of having intended the result which ensues .
i can not recall any form of man who is not superfluous sometimes .
but is not this pitiful ?
life is not worth the taking , to do tricks in .
of course it needs the whole society to give the symmetry we seek .
the <unk> wheel must revolve very fast to appear white .
something is earned too by conversing with so much folly and defect .
in fine , whoever loses , we are always of the gaining party .
divinity is behind our failures and follies also .
the plays of children are nonsense , but very <unk> nonsense .
so it is with the largest and <unk> things , with commerce , government , church , marriage , and so with the history of every man 's bread , and the ways by which he is to come by it .
like a bird which alights nowhere , but hops perpetually from bough to bough , is the power which abides in no man and in no woman , but for a moment speaks from this one , and for another moment from that one .
but what help from these <unk> or <unk> ?
what help from thought ?
life is not <unk> .
we , i think , in these times , have had lessons enough of the futility of criticism .
our young people have thought and written much on labor and reform , and for all that they have written , neither the world nor themselves have got on a step .
intellectual tasting of life <name> not supersede muscular activity .
if a man should consider the nicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his throat , he would starve .
at <unk> , the noblest theory of life sat on the noblest figures of young men and maidens , quite powerless and melancholy .
it would not rake or pitch a ton of hay ; it would not rub down a horse ; and the men and maidens it left pale and hungry .
a political orator <unk> compared our party promises to western roads , which opened stately enough , with planted trees on either side to tempt the traveller , but soon became narrow and narrower and ended in a <unk> and ran up a tree .
so does culture with us ; it ends in headache .
unspeakably sad and barren does life look to those who a few months ago were dazzled with the splendor of the promise of the times .
" there is now no longer any right course of action nor any <unk> left among the <unk> . "
objections and criticism we have had our fill of .
there are objections to every course of life and action , and the practical wisdom infers an <unk> , from the omnipresence of objection .
the whole frame of things <unk> <unk> .
do not craze yourself with thinking , but go about your business anywhere .
life is not intellectual or critical , but sturdy .
its chief good is for <unk> people who can enjoy what they find , without question .
nature hates peeping , and our mothers speak her very sense when they say , " children , eat your victuals , and say no more of it . "
to fill the hour ,  that is happiness ; to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval .
we live amid surfaces , and the true <name> of life is to skate well on them .
under the oldest <unk> conventions a man of native force <unk> just as well as in the newest world , and that by skill of handling and treatment .
he can take hold anywhere .
life itself is a mixture of power and form , and <name> not bear the least excess of either .
to finish the moment , to find the journey 's end in every step of the road , to live the greatest number of good hours , is wisdom .
it is not the part of men , but of <unk> , or of mathematicians if you <name> , to say that the shortness of life considered , it is not worth caring whether for so short a duration we were sprawling in want or sitting high .
since our office is with moments , let us husband them .
five minutes of today are worth as much to me as five minutes in the next <unk> .
let us be poised , and wise , and our own , today .
let us treat the men and women well ; treat them as if they were real ; perhaps they are .
men live in their fancy , like <unk> whose hands are too soft and tremulous for successful labor .
it is a tempest of fancies , and the only ballast i know is a respect to the present hour .
without any shadow of doubt , amidst this <unk> of shows and politics , i settle myself ever the firmer in the creed that we should not postpone and refer and wish , but do broad justice where we are , by <unk> we deal with , accepting our actual companions and circumstances , however humble or odious as the mystic officials to whom the universe has delegated its whole pleasure for us .
if these are mean and malignant , their contentment , which is the last victory of justice , is a more satisfying <name> to the heart than the voice of poets and the casual sympathy of admirable persons .
i think that however a thoughtful man may suffer from the defects and absurdities of his company , he can not without affectation deny to any set of men and women a sensibility to extraordinary merit .
the coarse and frivolous have an instinct of superiority , if they have not a sympathy , and honor it in their blind capricious way with sincere homage .
the fine young people despise life , but in me , and in such as with me are free from <unk> , and to whom a day is a sound and solid good , it is a great excess of politeness to look scornful and to cry for company .
i am grown by sympathy a little eager and sentimental , but leave me alone and i should relish every hour and what it brought me , the <unk> of the day , as heartily as the oldest gossip in the bar-room .
i am thankful for small <unk> .
i compared notes with one of my friends who expects everything of the universe and is disappointed when anything is less than the best , and i found that i begin at the other extreme , expecting nothing , and am always full of thanks for moderate goods .
i accept the <unk> and <unk> of contrary tendencies .
i find my account in <unk> and bores also .
they give a reality to the <unk> picture which such a vanishing <unk> appearance can ill spare .
in the morning i awake and find the old world , wife , babes , and mother , concord and boston , the dear old spiritual world and even the dear old devil not far off .
if we <name> take the good we find , asking no questions , we shall have heaping measures .
the great gifts are not got by analysis .
everything good is on the highway .
the middle region of our being is the temperate zone .
we may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science , or sink into that of sensation .
between these extremes is the equator of life , of thought , of spirit , of poetry ,  a narrow belt .
moreover , in popular experience everything good is on the highway .
a collector <unk> into all the <unk> of europe for a landscape of <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> ; but the <unk> , the last judgment , the communion of st. <name> , and what are as transcendent as these , are on the walls of the vatican , the <unk> , or the louvre , where every footman may see them ; to say nothing of nature 's pictures in every street , of sunsets and <unk> every day , and the sculpture of the human body never absent .
a collector recently bought at public auction , in london , for one hundred and fifty-seven guineas , an autograph of shakspeare ; but for nothing a school-boy can read hamlet and can detect secrets of highest <unk> yet unpublished therein .
i think i <name> never read any but the commonest books ,  the bible , <name> , <name> , shakspeare , and <name> .
then we are impatient of so public a life and planet , and run hither and thither for nooks and secrets .
the imagination delights in the woodcraft of indians , trappers , and <unk> .
we fancy that we are strangers , and not so intimately domesticated in the planet as the wild man and the wild beast and bird .
but the exclusion reaches them also ; reaches the climbing , flying , gliding , feathered and <unk> man .
fox and woodchuck , hawk and snipe and <unk> , when nearly seen , have no more root in the deep world than man , and are just such superficial tenants of the globe .
then the new molecular philosophy shows astronomical interspaces betwixt atom and atom , shows that the world is all outside ; it has no inside .
the <unk> is best .
nature , as we know her , is no saint .
the lights of the church , the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , she does not distinguish by any favor .
she comes eating and drinking and <unk> .
her darlings , the great , the strong , the beautiful , are not children of our law ; do not come out of the <name> school , nor weigh their food , nor punctually keep the commandments .
if we <name> be strong with her strength we must not harbor such disconsolate consciences , borrowed too from the consciences of other nations .
we must set up the strong present tense against all the rumors of wrath , past or to come .
so many things are unsettled which it is of the first importance to settle ;  and , pending their settlement , we <name> do as we do .
whilst the debate goes forward on the <unk> of commerce , and <name> not be closed for a century or two , new and old england may keep shop .
law of copyright and international copyright is to be discussed , and in the <unk> we <name> sell our books for the most we can .
expediency of literature , reason of literature , <unk> of writing down a thought , is questioned ; much is to say on both sides , and , while the fight <unk> hot , thou , dearest scholar , stick to thy foolish task , add a line every hour , and between whiles add a line .
right to hold land , right of property , is disputed , and the conventions <unk> , and before the vote is taken , dig away in your garden , and spend your earnings as a waif or <unk> to all serene and beautiful purposes .
life itself is a bubble and a skepticism , and a sleep within a sleep .
<name> it , and as much more as they <name> ,  but thou , god 's darling !
heed thy private dream ; thou wilt not be missed in the <unk> and skepticism ; there are enough of them ; stay there in thy closet and toil until the rest are agreed what to do about it .
thy sickness , they say , and thy <unk> habit require that thou do this or avoid that , but know that thy life is a flitting state , a tent for a night , and do thou , sick or well , finish that stint .
thou <name> sick , but shalt not be worse , and the universe , which holds thee dear , shall be the better .
human life is made up of the two elements , power and form , and the proportion must be invariably kept if we would have it sweet and sound .
each of these elements in excess makes a mischief as <unk> as its defect .
everything runs to excess ; every good quality is <unk> if unmixed , and , to <name> the danger to the edge of ruin , nature causes each man 's peculiarity to <unk> .
here , among the farms , we <unk> the scholars as examples of this treachery .
they are nature 's victims of expression .
you who see the artist , the orator , the poet , too near , and find their life no more excellent than that of mechanics or farmers , and themselves victims of partiality , very hollow and haggard , and pronounce them failures , not heroes , but <unk> ,  conclude very reasonably that these arts are not for man , but are disease .
yet nature <name> not bear you out .
irresistible nature made men such , and makes legions more of such , every day .
you love the boy reading in a book , gazing at a drawing , or a cast ; yet what are these millions who read and behold , but incipient writers and <unk> ?
add a little more of that quality which now reads and sees , and they <name> seize the pen and chisel .
and if one remembers how innocently he began to be an artist , he perceives that nature joined with his enemy .
a man is a golden impossibility .
the line he must walk is a hair 's breadth .
the wise through excess of wisdom is made a fool .
how easily , if fate would suffer it , we might keep forever these beautiful limits , and adjust ourselves , once for all , to the perfect calculation of the kingdom of known cause and effect .
in the street and in the newspapers , life appears so plain a business that manly resolution and <unk> to the <unk> through all weathers <name> insure success .
but ah !
presently comes a day , or is it only a half-hour , with its <unk> ,  which <unk> the conclusions of nations and of years !
tomorrow again everything looks real and angular , the habitual standards are <unk> , common sense is as rare as genius ,  is the basis of genius , and experience is hands and feet to every enterprise ;  and yet , he who should do his business on this understanding would be quickly bankrupt .
power keeps quite another road than the <unk> of choice and <name> ; namely the subterranean and invisible tunnels and channels of life .
it is ridiculous that we are <unk> , and doctors , and considerate people : there are no <unk> like these .
life is a series of surprises , and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not .
god delights to <unk> us every day , and hide from us the past and the future .
we would look about us , but with grand politeness he draws down before us an impenetrable screen of purest sky , and another behind us of purest sky .
'you <name> not remember , ' he seems to say , <unk> you <name> not expect . '
all good conversation , manners , and action , come from a spontaneity which forgets usages and makes the moment great .
nature hates <unk> ; her methods are <unk> and impulsive .
man lives by pulses ; our organic movements are such ; and the chemical and ethereal agents are undulatory and alternate ; and the mind goes <unk> on , and never <unk> but by fits .
we thrive by casualties .
our chief experiences have been casual .
the most attractive class of people are those who are powerful obliquely and not by the direct stroke ; men of genius , but not yet <unk> ; one gets the cheer of their light without paying too great a tax .
theirs is the beauty of the bird or the morning light , and not of <name> .
in the thought of genius there is always a surprise ; and the moral sentiment is well called " the newness , " for it is never other ; as new to the oldest intelligence as to the young child ;  " the kingdom that cometh without observation . "
in like manner , for practical success , there must not be too much design .
a man <name> not be observed in doing that which he can do best .
there is a certain magic about his <unk> action which <unk> your powers of observation , so that though it is done before you , you <unk> not of it .
the <name> of life has a <unk> , and <name> not be exposed .
every man is an impossibility until he is born ; every thing impossible until we see a success .
the <unk> of piety agree at last with the coldest skepticism ,  that nothing is of us or our works ,  that all is of god .
nature <name> not spare us the smallest leaf of <name> .
all writing comes by the <name> of god , and all doing and having .
i would gladly be moral and keep due <unk> and bounds , which i dearly love , and allow the most to the <name> of man ; but i have set my heart on honesty in this chapter , and i can see nothing at last , in success or failure , than more or less of vital force supplied from the eternal .
the results of life are <unk> and <unk> .
the years teach much which the days never know .
the persons who compose our company , converse , and come and go , and design and execute many things , and somewhat comes of it all , but an unlooked-for result .
the individual is always mistaken .
he designed many things , and <name> in other persons as <unk> , quarrelled with some or all , blundered much , and something is done ; all are a little advanced , but the individual is always mistaken .
it turns out somewhat new and very unlike what he promised himself .
the ancients , struck with this <unk> of the elements of human life to calculation , exalted chance into a divinity ; but that is to stay too long at the spark , which <unk> truly at one point , but the universe is warm with the <unk> of the same fire .
the miracle of life which <name> not be expounded but <name> remain a miracle , introduces a new element .
in the growth of the embryo , sir <unk> home i think noticed that the evolution was not from one central point , but <unk> from three or more points .
life has no memory .
that which proceeds in succession might be remembered , but that which is <unk> , or ejaculated from a deeper cause , as yet far from being conscious , knows not its own tendency .
so is it with us , now <unk> or without unity , because immersed in forms and effects all seeming to be of equal yet hostile value , and now religious , whilst in the reception of spiritual law .
bear with these <unk> , with this <unk> growth of the parts ; they <name> one day be members , and obey one <name> .
on that one <name> , on that secret cause , they nail our attention and <name> .
life is hereby melted into an expectation or a religion .
underneath the <unk> and trivial particulars , is a musical perfection ; the ideal journeying always with us , the heaven without rent or seam .
do but observe the mode of our illumination .
when i converse with a profound mind , or if at any time being alone i have good thoughts , i do not at once arrive at <unk> , as when , being thirsty , i drink water ; or go to the fire , being cold ; no !
but i am at first <unk> of my vicinity to a new and excellent region of life .
by <unk> to read or to think , this region gives further sign of itself , as it were in flashes of light , in sudden discoveries of its profound beauty and repose , as if the clouds that covered it parted at intervals and showed the approaching traveller the inland mountains , with the tranquil eternal meadows spread at their base , whereon flocks graze and shepherds pipe and dance .
but every insight from this realm of thought is felt as initial , and promises a sequel .
i do not make it ; i arrive there , and behold what was there already .
i make !
o no !
i clap my hands in <unk> <name> and amazement before the first opening to me of this <name> magnificence , old with the love and homage of innumerable ages , young with the life of life , the <unk> mecca of the desert .
and what a future it opens !
i feel a new heart beating with the love of the new beauty .
i am ready to die out of nature and be born again into this new yet unapproachable <name> i have found in the west :  " since neither now nor yesterday began these thoughts , which have been ever , nor yet can a man be found who their first entrance knew . "
if i have described life as a flux of moods , i must now add that there is that in us which changes not and which ranks all sensations and states of mind .
the consciousness in each man is a sliding scale , which <unk> him now with the first cause , and now with the flesh of his body ; life above life , in infinite degrees .
the sentiment from which it sprung determines the dignity of any deed , and the question ever is , not what you have done or <unk> , but at whose command you have done or <unk> it .
fortune , <name> , muse , holy ghost ,  these are quaint names , too narrow to cover this unbounded substance .
the baffled intellect must still kneel before this cause , which refuses to be named ,  ineffable cause , which every fine genius has essayed to represent by some emphatic symbol , as , <unk> by water , <unk> by air , <unk> by ( nous ) thought , <unk> by fire , <name> and the <unk> by love ; and the metaphor of each has become a national religion .
the chinese <unk> has not been the least successful in his generalization .
" i fully understand language , " he said , " and nourish well my <unk> vigor . "
 " i beg to ask what you call <unk> vigor ? "
 said his companion .
" the explanation , " replied <unk> , " is difficult .
this vigor is supremely great , and in the highest degree unbending .
nourish it correctly and do it no injury , and it <name> fill up the vacancy between heaven and earth .
this vigor accords with and <unk> justice and reason , and leaves no hunger . "
 in our more correct writing we give to this generalization the name of being , and thereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can go .
suffice it for the <name> of the universe that we have not arrived at a wall , but at interminable oceans .
our life seems not present so much as prospective ; not for the affairs on which it is wasted , but as a hint of this <unk> vigor .
most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty ; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap ; that we are very great .
so , in particulars , our greatness is always in a tendency or direction , not in an action .
it is for us to believe in the rule , not in the exception .
the <name> are thus known from the ignoble .
so in accepting the leading of the sentiments , it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul or the like , but the universal impulse to believe , that is the material circumstance and is the principal fact in the history of the globe .
shall we describe this cause as that which works directly ?
the spirit is not helpless or needful of <unk> organs .
it has plentiful powers and direct effects .
i am explained without explaining , i am felt without acting , and where i am not .
therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise .
they refuse to explain themselves , and are content that new actions should do them that office .
they believe that we communicate without speech and above speech , and that no right action of ours is quite <unk> to our friends , at whatever distance ; for the influence of action is not to be measured by miles .
why should i fret myself because a circumstance has occurred which <unk> my presence where i was expected ?
if i am not at the meeting , my presence where i am should be as useful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom , as would be my presence in that place .
i exert the same quality of power in all places .
thus journeys the mighty ideal before us ; it never was known to fall into the rear .
no man ever came to an experience which was <unk> , but his good is tidings of a better .
onward and onward !
in liberated moments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible ; the elements already exist in many minds around you of a doctrine of life which shall <unk> any written record we have .
the new statement <name> <unk> the <unk> as well as the faiths of society , and out of <unk> a creed shall be formed .
for <unk> are not gratuitous or lawless , but are limitations of the affirmative statement , and the new philosophy must take them in and make <unk> outside of them , just as much as it must include the oldest beliefs .
it is very unhappy , but too late to be helped , the discovery we have made that we exist .
that discovery is called the fall of man .
ever afterwards we suspect our instruments .
we have learned that we do not see directly , but <unk> , and that we have no means of correcting these colored and <unk> lenses which we are , or of <unk> the amount of their errors .
perhaps these <unk> have a creative power ; perhaps there are no objects .
once we lived in what we saw ; now , the <unk> of this new power , which threatens to absorb all things , engages us .
nature , <name> , persons , letters , religions , objects , successively tumble in , and god is but one of its ideas .
nature and literature are <unk> phenomena ; every evil and every good thing is a shadow which we cast .
the street is full of humiliations to the proud .
as the <unk> contrived to dress his <unk> in his livery and make them wait on his guests at table , so the <unk> which the bad heart gives off as bubbles , at once take form as ladies and gentlemen in the street , <unk> or <unk> in hotels , and threaten or insult whatever is <unk> and <unk> in us .
't is the same with our <unk> .
people forget that it is the eye which makes the horizon , and the rounding mind 's eye which makes this or that man a type or representative of humanity , with the name of hero or saint .
<name> , the " providential man , " is a good man on whom many people are agreed that these optical laws shall take effect .
by love on one part and by forbearance to press objection on the other part , it is for a time settled , that we <name> look at him in the centre of the horizon , and <unk> to him the properties that <name> attach to any man so seen .
but the longest love or aversion has a speedy term .
the great and <unk> self , rooted in absolute nature , <unk> all relative existence and ruins the kingdom of mortal friendship and love .
marriage ( in what is called the spiritual world ) is impossible , because of the inequality between every subject and every object .
the subject is the receiver of <unk> , and at every comparison must feel his being enhanced by that cryptic might .
though not in energy , yet by presence , this magazine of substance can not be otherwise than felt ; nor can any force of intellect attribute to the object the proper deity which sleeps or wakes forever in every subject .
never can love make consciousness and <unk> equal in force .
there <name> be the same gulf between every me and thee as between the original and the picture .
the universe is the bride of the soul .
all private sympathy is partial .
two human beings are like globes , which can touch only in a point , and whilst they remain in contact , all other points of each of the spheres are inert ; their turn must also come , and the longer a particular union lasts the more energy of <unk> the parts not in union acquire .
life <name> be <unk> , but can not be divided nor doubled .
any invasion of its unity would be chaos .
the soul is not <unk> but the only <unk> , and though revealing itself as child in time , child in appearance , is of a fatal and universal power , admitting no <unk> .
every day , every act betrays the <unk> deity .
we believe in ourselves as we do not believe in others .
we permit all things to ourselves , and that which we call sin in others is experiment for us .
it is an instance of our <name> in ourselves that men never speak of crime as lightly as they think ; or every man thinks a latitude safe for himself which is nowise to be indulged to another .
the act looks very differently on the inside and on the outside ; in its quality and in its consequences .
murder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as poets and <unk> <name> have it ; it does not <unk> him or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles ; it is an act quite easy to be contemplated ; but in its sequel it turns out to be a horrible <unk> and <unk> of all relations .
especially the crimes that spring from love seem right and fair from the actor 's point of view , but when acted are found destructive of society .
no man at last believes that he can be lost , nor that the crime in him is as black as in the <unk> .
because the intellect <unk> in our own case the moral judgments .
for there is no crime to the intellect .
that is <unk> or <unk> , and judges law as well as fact .
" it is worse than a crime , it is a blunder , " said <name> , speaking the language of the intellect .
to it , the world is a problem in mathematics or the science of quantity , and it leaves out praise and blame and all weak emotions .
all stealing is comparative .
if you come to <unk> , pray who does not steal ?
saints are sad , because they behold sin ( even when they speculate ) , from the point of view of the conscience , and not of the intellect ; a confusion of thought .
sin , seen from the thought , is a diminution , or less : seen from the conscience or <name> , it is <unk> or bad .
the intellect names it shade , absence of light , and no essence .
the conscience must feel it as essence , essential evil .
this it is not ; it has an objective existence , but no <unk> .
thus inevitably does the universe wear our color , and every object fall successively into the subject itself .
the subject exists , the subject enlarges ; all things sooner or later fall into place .
as i am , so i see ; use what language we <name> , we can never say anything but what we are ; <unk> , cadmus , <name> , <name> , bonaparte , are the mind 's ministers .
instead of feeling a poverty when we encounter a great man , let us treat the new comer like a travelling geologist who passes through our estate and shows us good slate , or limestone , or <unk> , in our brush pasture .
the partial action of each strong mind in one direction is a telescope for the objects on which it is pointed .
but every other part of knowledge is to be pushed to the same extravagance , ere the soul attains her due <unk> .
do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail ?
if you could look with her eyes you might see her surrounded with hundreds of figures performing complex dramas , with tragic and comic issues , long conversations , many characters , many ups and downs of fate ,  and meantime it is only puss and her tail .
how long before our masquerade <name> end its noise of <unk> , laughter , and shouting , and we shall find it was a solitary performance ?
a subject and an object ,  it takes so much to make the galvanic circuit complete , but magnitude adds nothing .
what imports it whether it is kepler and the sphere , <name> and <name> , a reader and his book , or puss with her tail ?
it is true that all the muses and love and religion hate these developments , and <name> find a way to punish the chemist who <unk> in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory .
and we can not say too little of our constitutional necessity of seeing things under private aspects , or saturated with our <unk> .
and yet is the god the native of these bleak rocks .
that need makes in morals the capital virtue of self-trust .
we must hold hard to this poverty , however scandalous , and by more vigorous <unk> , after the sallies of action , possess our axis more firmly .
the life of truth is cold and so far mournful ; but it is not the slave of tears , <unk> and <unk> .
it does not attempt another 's work , nor adopt another 's facts .
it is a main lesson of wisdom to know your own from another 's .
i have learned that i can not dispose of other people 's facts ; but i possess such a key to my own as <unk> me , against all their <unk> , that they also have a key to theirs .
a sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a swimmer among drowning men , who all catch at him , and if he give so much as a leg or a finger they <name> drown him .
they wish to be saved from the <unk> of their vices , but not from their vices .
<name> would be wasted on this poor waiting on the symptoms .
a wise and hardy physician <name> say , come out of that , as the first condition of advice .
in this our talking <name> we are ruined by our good nature and listening on all sides .
this compliance takes away the power of being greatly useful .
a man should not be able to look other than directly and <unk> .
a preoccupied attention is the only answer to the importunate frivolity of other people ; an attention , and to an aim which makes their wants frivolous .
this is a divine answer , and leaves no appeal and no hard thoughts .
in <unk> 's drawing of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> apollo , whilst the furies sleep on the threshold .
the face of the god expresses a shade of regret and compassion , but is calm with the conviction of the <unk> of the two spheres .
he is born into other politics , into the eternal and beautiful .
the man at his feet asks for his interest in <unk> of the earth , into which his nature can not enter .
and the <unk> there lying express <unk> this <unk> .
the god is <unk> with his divine <name> .
illusion , temperament , succession , surface , surprise , reality , <unk> ,  these are threads on the loom of time , these are the lords of life .
i dare not assume to give their order , but i name them as i find them in my way .
i know better than to claim any completeness for my picture .
i am a fragment , and this is a fragment of me .
i can very confidently announce one or another law , which throws itself into relief and form , but i am too young yet by some ages to <unk> a code .
i gossip for my hour concerning the eternal politics .
i have seen many fair pictures not in vain .
a wonderful time i have lived in .
i am not the novice i was fourteen , nor yet seven years ago .
let who <name> ask where is the fruit ?
i find a private fruit sufficient .
this is a fruit ,  that i should not ask for a rash effect from meditations , counsels and the <unk> of truths .
i should feel it pitiful to demand a result on this town and county , an <unk> effect on the instant month and year .
the effect is deep and secular as the cause .
it works on periods in which mortal lifetime is lost .
all i know is reception ; i am and i have : but i do not get , and when i have fancied i had gotten anything , i found i did not .
i worship with wonder the great fortune .
my reception has been so large , that i am not annoyed by receiving this or that <unk> .
i say to the genius , if he <name> pardon the proverb , in for a mill , in for a million .
when i receive a new gift , i do not <unk> my body to make the account square , for if i should die i could not make the account square .
the benefit <unk> the merit the first day , and has overrun the merit ever since .
the merit itself , so-called , i reckon part of the receiving .
also that hankering after an <unk> or practical effect seems to me an <unk> .
in good <name> i am willing to spare this most unnecessary deal of doing .
life wears to me a visionary face .
hardest roughest action is visionary also .
it is but a choice between soft and turbulent dreams .
people <unk> knowing and the intellectual life , and urge doing .
i am very content with knowing , if only i could know .
that is an <name> entertainment , and would suffice me a great while .
to know a little would be worth the expense of this world .
i hear always the law of <unk> , " that every soul which had acquired any truth , should be safe from harm until another period . "
i know that the world i converse with in the city and in the farms , is not the world i think .
i observe that difference , and shall observe it .
one day i shall know the value and law of this <unk> .
but i have not found that much was gained by <unk> attempts to realize the world of thought .
many eager persons successively make an experiment in this way , and make themselves ridiculous .
they acquire democratic manners , they foam at the mouth , they hate and deny .
worse , i observe that in the history of mankind there is never a solitary example of success ,  taking their own tests of success .
i say this <unk> , or in reply to the inquiry , why not realize your world ?
but far be from me the despair which <unk> the law by a paltry <unk> ;  since there never was a right endeavor but it succeeded .
<name> and <name> , we shall win at the last .
we must be very suspicious of the <unk> of the element of time .
it takes a good deal of time to eat or to sleep , or to earn a hundred dollars , and a very little time to entertain a <name> and an insight which becomes the light of our life .
we dress our garden , eat our dinners , discuss the household with our wives , and these things make no impression , are forgotten next week ; but , in the solitude to which every man is always returning , he has a sanity and revelations which in his passage into new worlds he <name> <name> with him .
never mind the ridicule , never mind the defeat ; up again , old heart !  it seems to say ,  there is victory yet for all justice ; and the true romance which the world exists to realize <name> be the transformation of genius into practical power .
***** character .
the sun set ; but set not his <name> : stars rose ; his <name> was earlier up : fixed on the enormous galaxy , deeper and older seemed his eye : and matched his sufferance sublime the <unk> of time .
he spoke , and words more soft than rain brought the age of gold again : his action won such reverence sweet , as hid all measure of the feat .
work of his hand he nor <unk> nor grieves <unk> for itself the fact ; as <unk> nature leaves her every act .
iii .
character .
i have read that those who listened to lord chatham felt that there was something finer in the man than any thing which he said .
it has been complained of our brilliant english historian of the french revolution that when he has told all his facts about <unk> , they do not justify his estimate of his genius .
the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others of plutarch 's heroes , do not in the record of facts equal their own fame .
sir <name> <name> , the <name> of essex , sir <name> <name> , are men of great figure and of few deeds .
we can not find the smallest part of the personal weight of washington in the narrative of his exploits .
the authority of the name of <unk> is too great for his books .
this inequality of the reputation to the works or the anecdotes is not accounted for by saying that the <unk> is longer than the <unk> , but somewhat resided in these men which <unk> an expectation that <unk> all their performance .
the largest part of their power was latent .
this is that which we call character ,  a reserved force which acts directly by presence , and without means .
it is conceived of as a certain <unk> force , a familiar or genius , by whose impulses the man is guided but whose counsels he can not impart ; which is company for him , so that such men are often solitary , or if they chance to be social , do not need society but can entertain themselves very well alone .
the purest literary talent appears at one time great , at another time small , but character is of a <unk> and <unk> greatness .
what others effect by talent or by eloquence , this man <unk> by some magnetism .
" half his strength he put not forth . "
his victories are by demonstration of superiority , and not by crossing of bayonets .
he conquers because his arrival alters the face of affairs .
" o <unk> !
how did you know that hercules was a god ? "
" because , " answered <unk> , " i was content the moment my eyes fell on him .
when i beheld <unk> , i desired that i might see him offer battle , or at least guide his horses in the <unk> ; but hercules did not wait for a contest ; he conquered whether he stood , or walked , or sat , or whatever thing he did . "
man , ordinarily a pendant to events , only half attached , and that awkwardly , to the world he lives in , in these examples appears to share the life of things , and to be an expression of the same laws which control the tides and the sun , <name> and quantities .
but to use a more modest illustration and nearer home , i observe that in our political elections , where this element , if it appears at all , can only occur in its <unk> form , we sufficiently understand its incomparable rate .
the people know that they need in their representative much more than talent , namely the power to make his talent trusted .
they can not come at their ends by sending to congress a learned , acute , and fluent speaker , if he be not one who , before he was appointed by the people to represent them , was appointed by almighty god to stand for a fact ,  <unk> persuaded of that fact in himself ,  so that the most confident and the most violent persons learn that here is resistance on which both impudence and terror are wasted , namely <name> in a fact .
the men who <name> their points do not need to inquire of their constituents what they should say , but are themselves the country which they represent ; nowhere are its emotions or opinions so instant and true as in them ; nowhere so pure from a selfish infusion .
the <unk> at home <unk> to their words , watches the color of their cheek , and therein , as in a glass , dresses its own .
our public assemblies are pretty good tests of manly force .
our <name> countrymen of the west and south have a taste for character , and like to know whether the new <unk> is a substantial man , or whether the hand can pass through him .
the same motive force appears in trade .
there are geniuses in trade , as well as in war , or the state , or letters ; and the reason why this or that man is fortunate is not to be told .
it lies in the man ; that is all anybody can tell you about it .
see him and you <name> know as easily why he succeeds , as , if you see <name> , you would comprehend his fortune .
in the new objects we recognize the old game , the habit of fronting the fact , and not dealing with it at second hand , through the perceptions of somebody else .
nature seems to authorize trade , as soon as you see the natural merchant , who appears not so much a private agent as her factor and minister of commerce .
his natural probity combines with his insight into the fabric of society to put him above tricks , and he communicates to all his own <name> that contracts are of no private interpretation .
the habit of his mind is a reference to standards of natural <unk> and public advantage ; and he inspires respect and the wish to deal with him , both for the quiet spirit of honor which attends him , and for the intellectual pastime which the spectacle of so much ability affords .
this immensely stretched trade , which makes the capes of the southern ocean his wharves , and the atlantic sea his familiar port , centres in his <name> only ; and nobody in the universe can make his place good .
in his parlor i see very well that he has been at hard work this morning , with that knitted brow and that settled humor , which all his <name> to be courteous can not shake off .
i see plainly how many firm acts have been done ; how many valiant <unk> have this day been spoken , when others would have uttered ruinous <unk> .
i see , with the pride of <name> and skill of masterly arithmetic and power of remote combination , the consciousness of being an agent and <unk> of the original laws of the world .
he too believes that none can supply him , and that a man must be born to trade or he can not learn it .
this virtue draws the mind more when it appears in action to ends not so mixed .
it works with most energy in the smallest companies and in private relations .
in all cases it is an extraordinary and <unk> agent .
the excess of physical strength is paralyzed by it .
higher natures <unk> lower ones by affecting them with a certain sleep .
the faculties are locked up , and offer no resistance .
perhaps that is the universal law .
when the high can not bring up the low to itself , it <unk> it , as man charms down the resistance of the lower animals .
men exert on each other a similar occult power .
how often has the influence of a true master realized all the tales of magic !
a river of command seemed to run down from his eyes into all those who beheld him , a torrent of strong sad light , like an ohio or danube , which pervaded them with his thoughts and colored all events with the <name> of his mind .
" what means did you employ ? "
was the question asked of the wife of <unk> , in regard to her treatment of <name> of <unk> ; and the answer was , " only that influence which every strong mind has over a weak one . "
can not caesar in irons shuffle off the irons and transfer them to the person of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> ?
is an iron <unk> so immutable a bond ?
suppose a slaver on the coast of guinea should take on board a gang of negroes which should contain persons of the stamp of <unk> <unk> : or , let us fancy , under these swarthy masks he has a gang of <unk> in chains .
when they arrive at cuba , <name> the relative order of the ship 's company be the same ?
is there nothing but rope and iron ?
is there no love , no reverence ?
is there never a glimpse of right in a poor <unk> 's mind ; and can not these be supposed available to break or elude or in any manner <unk> the tension of an inch or two of iron ring ?
this is a natural power , like light and heat , and all nature <unk> with it .
the reason why we feel one man 's presence and do not feel another 's is as simple as gravity .
truth is the summit of being ; justice is the application of it to affairs .
all individual natures stand in a scale , according to the purity of this element in them .
the <name> of the pure runs down from them into other natures as water runs down from a higher into a lower vessel .
this natural force is no more to be withstood than any other natural force .
we can drive a stone upward for a moment into the air , but it is yet true that all stones <name> forever fall ; and whatever instances can be quoted of <unk> theft , or of a lie which somebody credited , justice must prevail , and it is the privilege of truth to make itself believed .
character is this moral order seen through the medium of an individual nature .
an individual is an <unk> .
time and space , <name> and necessity , truth and thought , are left at large no longer .
now , the universe is a close or pound .
all things exist in the man tinged with the manners of his soul .
with what quality is in him he <unk> all nature that he can reach ; nor does he tend to lose himself in vastness , but , at how long a curve <unk> , all his regards return into his own good at last .
he <unk> all he can , and he sees only what he <unk> .
he <unk> the world , as the patriot does his country , as a material basis for his character , and a theatre for action .
a healthy soul stands united with the just and the true , as the magnet arranges itself with the pole ; so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the sun , and whoso journeys towards the sun , journeys towards that person .
he is thus the medium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level .
thus , men of character are the conscience of the society to which they belong .
the natural measure of this power is the resistance of circumstances .
impure men consider life as it is reflected in opinions , events , and persons .
they can not see the action until it is done .
yet its moral element <unk> in the actor , and its quality as right or wrong it was easy to predict .
everything in nature is <unk> , or has a positive and negative pole .
there is a male and a female , a spirit and a fact , a north and a south .
spirit is the positive , the event is the negative .
<name> is the north , action the south pole .
character may be ranked as having its natural place in the north .
it shares the magnetic currents of the system .
the feeble souls are drawn to the south or negative pole .
they look at the profit or hurt of the action .
they never behold a principle until it is lodged in a person .
they do not wish to be lovely , but to be loved .
men of character like to hear of their faults ; the other class do not like to hear of faults ; they worship events ; secure to them a fact , a connection , a certain chain of circumstances , and they <name> ask no more .
the hero sees that the event is <unk> ; it must follow him .
a given order of events has no power to secure to him the satisfaction which the imagination attaches to it ; the soul of goodness escapes from any set of circumstances ; whilst prosperity belongs to a certain mind , and <name> introduce that power and victory which is its natural fruit , into any order of events .
no change of circumstances can repair a defect of character .
we boast our emancipation from many superstitions ; but if we have broken any idols it is through a transfer of the idolatry .
what have i gained , that i no longer <unk> a bull to jove or to neptune , or a mouse to <unk> ; that i do not tremble before the <unk> , or the catholic purgatory , or the <unk> <unk> ,  if i quake at opinion , the public opinion , as we call it ; or at the threat of assault , or <unk> , or bad neighbors , or poverty , or mutilation , or at the rumor of revolution , or of murder ?
if i quake , what matters it what i quake at ?
our proper vice takes form in one or another shape , according to the sex , age , or temperament of the person , and , if we are capable of fear , <name> readily find terrors .
the <unk> or the malignity which <unk> me when i <unk> it to society , is my own .
i am always <unk> by myself .
on the other part , <unk> is a perpetual victory , celebrated not by cries of <name> but by serenity , which is <name> fixed or habitual .
it is disgraceful to fly to events for confirmation of our truth and worth .
the capitalist does not run every hour to the broker to coin his advantages into current money of the realm ; he is satisfied to read in the quotations of the market that his stocks have risen .
the same transport which the occurrence of the best events in the best order would occasion me , i must learn to taste purer in the perception that my position is every hour <unk> , and does already command those events i <name> .
that exultation is only to be checked by the foresight of an order of things so excellent as to throw all our <unk> into the deepest shade .
the face which character wears to me is <unk> .
i revere the person who is riches ; so that i can not think of him as alone , or poor , or exiled , or unhappy , or a client , but as perpetual patron , benefactor , and <unk> man .
character is <unk> , the impossibility of being displaced or <unk> .
a man should give us a sense of mass .
society is frivolous , and shreds its day into scraps , its conversation into ceremonies and escapes .
but if i go to see an ingenious man i shall think myself poorly entertained if he give me nimble pieces of benevolence and etiquette ; rather he shall stand stoutly in his place and let me apprehend if it were only his resistance ; know that i have encountered a new and positive quality ;  great refreshment for both of us .
it is much that he does not accept the conventional opinions and practices .
that <unk> <name> remain a goad and <unk> , and every inquirer <name> have to dispose of him , in the first place .
there is nothing real or useful that is not a seat of war .
our houses ring with laughter and personal and critical gossip , but it helps little .
but the <unk> , <unk> man , who is a problem and a threat to society , whom it can not let pass in silence but must either worship or hate ,  and to whom all parties feel related , both the leaders of opinion and the obscure and eccentric ,  he helps ; he puts <name> and europe in the wrong , and destroys the skepticism which says , 'man is a doll , let us eat and drink , 't is the best we can do , ' by illuminating the untried and unknown .
acquiescence in the establishment and appeal to the public , indicate infirm <name> , heads which are not clear , and which must see a house built , before they can comprehend the plan of it .
the wise man not only leaves out of his thought the many , but leaves out the few .
fountains , the <unk> , the absorbed , the commander because he is commanded , the assured , the primary ,  they are good ; for these announce the instant presence of supreme power .
our action should rest mathematically on our substance .
in nature , there are no false <unk> .
a pound of water in the <unk> has no more gravity than in a midsummer pond .
all things work exactly according to their quality and according to their quantity ; attempt nothing they can not do , except man only .
he has pretension ; he wishes and attempts things beyond his force .
i read in a book of english memoirs , " mr. fox ( afterwards lord holland ) said , he must have the treasury ; he had served up to it , and would have it . "
xenophon and his ten thousand were quite equal to what they attempted , and did it ; so equal , that it was not suspected to be a grand and inimitable exploit .
yet there stands that fact <unk> , a high-water <name> in military history .
many have attempted it since , and not been equal to it .
it is only on reality that any power of action can be based .
no institution <name> be better than the <unk> .
i knew an amiable and accomplished person who undertook a practical reform , yet i was never able to find in him the enterprise of love he took in hand .
he adopted it by ear and by the understanding from the books he had been reading .
all his action was tentative , a piece of the city carried out into the fields , and was the city still , and no new fact , and could not inspire enthusiasm .
had there been something latent in the man , a terrible <unk> genius agitating and embarrassing his demeanor , we had watched for its advent .
it is not enough that the intellect should see the evils and their remedy .
we shall still postpone our existence , nor take the ground to which we are entitled , whilst it is only a thought and not a spirit that <unk> us .
we have not yet served up to it .
these are properties of life , and another trait is the notice of incessant growth .
men should be intelligent and <name> .
they must also make us feel that they have a controlling happy future opening before them , whose early <unk> already kindle in the passing hour .
the hero is <unk> and <unk> ; he can not therefore wait to unravel any man 's blunders ; he is again on his road , adding new powers and honors to his domain and new claims on your heart , which <name> bankrupt you if you have loitered about the old things and have not kept your relation to him by adding to your wealth .
new actions are the only apologies and explanations of old ones which the <name> can bear to offer or to receive .
if your friend has displeased you , you shall not sit down to consider it , for he has already lost all memory of the passage , and has doubled his power to serve you , and ere you can rise up again <name> burden you with blessings .
we have no pleasure in thinking of a benevolence that is only measured by its works .
love is inexhaustible , and if its estate is wasted , its granary emptied , still cheers and <unk> , and the man , though he sleep , seems to purify the air and his house to adorn the landscape and strengthen the laws .
people always recognize this difference .
we know who is benevolent , by quite other means than the amount of subscription to <unk> .
it is only low merits that can be enumerated .
fear , when your friends say to you what you have done well , and say it through ; but when they stand with uncertain timid looks of respect and <unk> , and must suspend their judgment for years to come , you may begin to <name> .
those who live to the future must always appear selfish to those who live to the present .
therefore it was droll in the good <unk> , who has written memoirs of goethe , to make out a list of his <unk> and good deeds , as , so many hundred <unk> given to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> ; a lucrative place found for professor <unk> , a post under the grand duke for <unk> , a pension for meyer , two professors recommended to foreign universities ; & c. , & c. the longest list of specifications of benefit would look very short .
a man is a poor creature if he is to be measured so .
for all these of course are exceptions , and the rule and <unk> life of a good man is <unk> .
the true <name> of goethe is to be inferred from the account he gave dr. <unk> of the way in which he had spent his fortune .
" each <unk> of mine has cost a purse of gold .
half a million of my own money , the fortune i inherited , my salary and the large income derived from my writings for fifty years back , have been expended to instruct me in what i now know .
i have besides seen , " & c. i own it is but poor chat and gossip to go to enumerate traits of this simple and rapid power , and we are painting the lightning with charcoal ; but in these long nights and vacations i like to console myself so .
nothing but itself can copy it .
a word warm from the heart <unk> me .
i surrender at discretion .
how <unk> is literary genius before this fire of life !
these are the touches that <unk> my heavy soul and give it eyes to pierce the dark of nature .
i find , where i thought myself poor , there was i most <name> .
thence comes a new intellectual exaltation , to be again rebuked by some new exhibition of character .
strange alternation of attraction and repulsion !
character <unk> intellect , yet excites it ; and character passes into thought , is published so , and then is ashamed before new flashes of moral worth .
character is nature in the highest form .
it is of no use to ape it or to contend with it .
somewhat is possible of resistance , and of persistence , and of creation , to this power , which <name> foil all emulation .
this masterpiece is best where no hands but nature 's have been laid on it .
care is taken that the <unk> shall slip up into life in the shade , with no <unk> athens to watch and <unk> every new thought , every blushing emotion of young genius .
two persons lately , very young children of the most high god , have given me occasion for thought .
when i explored the source of their sanctity and charm for the imagination , it seemed as if each answered , 'from my <unk> ; i never listened to your people 's law , or to what they call their gospel , and wasted my time .
i was content with the simple rural poverty of my own ; hence this sweetness ; my work never reminds you of that ;  is pure of that . '
and nature <unk> me in such persons that in democratic <name> she <name> not be <unk> .
how <unk> and <unk> <unk> from the market and from scandal !
it was only this morning that i sent away some wild flowers of these <unk> .
they are a relief from literature ,  these fresh draughts from the sources of thought and sentiment ; as we read , in an age of polish and criticism , the first lines of written prose and verse of a nation .
how <unk> is their devotion to their favorite books , whether <unk> , <name> , shakspeare , or <name> , as feeling that they have a stake in that book ; who touches that , touches them ;  and especially the total solitude of the critic , the <unk> of thought from which he writes , in unconsciousness of any eyes that shall ever read this writing .
could they dream on still , as angels , and not wake to comparisons , and to be flattered !
yet some natures are too good to be spoiled by praise , and wherever the vein of thought reaches down into the profound , there is no danger from vanity .
solemn friends <name> warn them of the danger of the head 's being turned by the flourish of trumpets , but they can afford to smile .
i remember the indignation of an eloquent methodist at the kind <unk> of a doctor of divinity ,  'my friend , a man can neither be praised nor insulted . '
but forgive the counsels ; they are very natural .
i remember the thought which occurred to me when some ingenious and spiritual foreigners came to <name> , was , have you been <unk> in being brought hither ?  or , prior to that , answer me this , 'are you <unk> ? '
as i have said , nature keeps these <unk> in her own hands , and however <unk> our sermons and <unk> would divide some share of credit , and teach that the laws fashion the citizen , she goes her own gait and puts the wisest in the wrong .
she makes very light of gospels and prophets , as one who has a great many more to produce and no excess of time to spare on any one .
there is a class of men , individuals of which appear at long intervals , so eminently endowed with insight and virtue that they have been unanimously saluted as divine , and who seem to be an accumulation of that power we consider .
divine persons are character born , or , to borrow a phrase from <name> , they are victory organized .
they are usually received with ill-will , because they are new and because they set a bound to the exaggeration that has been made of the personality of the last divine person .
nature never rhymes her children , nor makes two men alike .
when we see a great man we fancy a resemblance to some historical person , and predict the sequel of his character and fortune ; a result which he is sure to disappoint .
none <name> ever solve the problem of his character according to our prejudice , but only in his own high unprecedented way .
character wants room ; must not be crowded on by persons nor be judged from glimpses got in the press of affairs or on few occasions .
it needs perspective , as a great building .
it may not , probably does not , form relations rapidly ; and we should not require rash explanation , either on the popular ethics , or on our own , of its action .
i look on sculpture as history .
i do not think the apollo and the jove impossible in flesh and blood .
every trait which the artist recorded in stone he had seen in life , and better than his copy .
we have seen many <unk> , but we are born believers in great men .
how easily we read in old books , when men were few , of the smallest action of the patriarchs .
we require that a man should be so large and columnar in the landscape , that it should deserve to be recorded that he arose , and <unk> up his loins , and departed to such a place .
the most credible pictures are those of majestic men who prevailed at their entrance , and convinced the senses ; as happened to the eastern magian who was sent to test the merits of <unk> or <unk> .
when the <unk> sage arrived at balkh , the persians tell us , <unk> appointed a day on which the <unk> of every country should assemble , and a golden chair was placed for the <unk> sage .
then the beloved of <unk> , the prophet <unk> , advanced into the midst of the assembly .
the <unk> sage , on seeing that chief , said , " this form and this gait can not lie , and nothing but truth can proceed from them . "
plato said it was impossible not to believe in the children of the gods , " though they should speak without probable or necessary arguments . "
i should think myself very unhappy in my associates if i could not credit the best things in history .
" <name> bradshaw , " says <name> , " appears like a consul , from whom the <unk> are not to depart with the year ; so that not on the tribunal only , but throughout his life , you would regard him as sitting in judgment upon kings . "
i find it more credible , since it is anterior information , that one man should know heaven , as the chinese say , than that so many men should know the world .
" the virtuous <name> <unk> the gods , without any misgiving .
he waits a hundred ages till a sage comes , and does not doubt .
he who <unk> the gods , without any misgiving , knows heaven ; he who waits a hundred ages until a sage comes , without doubting , knows men .
hence the virtuous <name> moves , and for ages shows empire the way . "
but there is no need to seek remote examples .
he is a dull observer whose experience has not taught him the reality and force of magic , as well as of chemistry .
the coldest <unk> can not go abroad without encountering inexplicable influences .
one man <unk> an eye on him and the graves of the memory render up their dead ; the secrets that make him wretched either to keep or to betray must be yielded ;  another , and he can not speak , and the bones of his body seem to lose their <unk> ; the entrance of a friend adds <name> , boldness , and eloquence to him ; and there are persons he can not choose but remember , who gave a transcendent expansion to his thought , and kindled another life in his bosom .
what is so excellent as strict relations of amity , when they spring from this deep root ?
the sufficient reply to the <unk> who doubts the power and the furniture of man , is in that possibility of joyful intercourse with persons , which makes the <name> and practice of all reasonable men .
i know nothing which life has to offer so satisfying as the profound good understanding which can subsist after much exchange of good offices , between two virtuous men , each of whom is sure of himself and sure of his friend .
it is a happiness which <unk> all other <unk> , and makes politics , and commerce , and churches , cheap .
for when men shall meet as they ought , each a benefactor , a shower of stars , clothed with thoughts , with deeds , with accomplishments , it should be the festival of nature which all things announce .
of such friendship , love in the sexes is the first symbol , as all other things are symbols of love .
those relations to the best men , which , at one time , we reckoned the romances of youth , become , in the progress of the character , the most solid enjoyment .
if it were possible to live in right relations with men !  if we could abstain from asking anything of them , from asking their praise , or help , or pity , and content us with compelling them through the virtue of the eldest laws !
could we not deal with a few persons ,  with one person ,  after the unwritten statutes , and make an experiment of their efficacy ?
could we not pay our friend the compliment of truth , of silence , of forbearing ?
need we be so eager to seek him ?
if we are related , we shall meet .
it was a tradition of the ancient world that no metamorphosis could hide a god from a god ; and there is a greek verse which runs ,  " the gods are to each other not unknown . "
friends also follow the laws of divine necessity ; they <unk> to each other , and can not otherwise :  when each the other shall avoid , shall each by each be most enjoyed .
their relation is not made , but allowed .
the gods must seat themselves without <unk> in our olympus , and as they can <unk> themselves by <unk> divine .
society is spoiled if pains are taken , if the associates are brought a mile to meet .
and if it be not society , it is a mischievous , low , degrading <unk> , though made up of the best .
all the greatness of each is kept back and every <unk> in painful activity , as if the <unk> should meet to exchange <unk> .
life goes headlong .
we <name> some flying scheme , or we are hunted by some fear or command behind us .
but if suddenly we encounter a friend , we pause ; our heat and hurry look foolish enough ; now pause , now possession is required , and the power to swell the moment from the resources of the heart .
the moment is all , in all <name> relations .
a divine person is the prophecy of the mind ; a friend is the <name> of the heart .
our <unk> waits for the fulfilment of these two in one .
the ages are opening this moral force .
all force is the shadow or symbol of that .
poetry is joyful and strong as it draws its inspiration thence .
men write their names on the world as they are filled with this .
history has been mean ; our nations have been mobs ; we have never seen a man : that divine form we do not yet know , but only the dream and prophecy of such : we do not know the majestic manners which belong to him , which appease and exalt the beholder .
we shall one day see that the most private is the most public energy , that quality <unk> for quantity , and grandeur of character acts in the dark , and <unk> them who never saw it .
what greatness has yet appeared is beginnings and <unk> to us in this direction .
the history of those gods and saints which the world has written and then worshipped , are documents of character .
the ages have exulted in the manners of a youth who owed nothing to fortune , and who was hanged at the <unk> of his nation , who , by the pure quality of his nature , shed an epic splendor around the facts of his death which has transfigured every particular into an universal symbol for the eyes of mankind .
this great defeat is hitherto our highest fact .
but the mind requires a victory to the senses ; a force of character which <name> convert judge , jury , soldier , and king ; which <name> rule animal and mineral virtues , and blend with the courses of sap , of rivers , of winds , of stars , and of moral agents .
if we can not attain at a bound to these grandeurs , at least let us do them homage .
in society , high advantages are set down to the possessor as disadvantages .
it requires the more <unk> in our private estimates .
i do not forgive in my friends the failure to know a fine character and to entertain it with thankful hospitality .
when at last that which we have always longed for is arrived and shines on us with glad rays out of that far celestial land , then to be coarse , then to be critical and treat such a <unk> with the jabber and suspicion of the streets , argues a vulgarity that seems to shut the doors of heaven .
this is confusion , this the right insanity , when the soul no longer knows its own , nor where its allegiance , its religion , are due .
is there any religion but this , to know that wherever in the wide desert of being the holy sentiment we <name> has opened into a flower , it blooms for me ?
if none sees it , i see it ; i am aware , if i alone , of the greatness of the fact .
whilst it blooms , i <name> keep sabbath or holy time , and suspend my gloom and my folly and jokes .
nature is indulged by the presence of this guest .
there are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and household virtues ; there are many that can discern genius on his starry track , though the mob is incapable ; but when that love which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which has vowed to itself that it <name> be a wretch and also a fool in this world sooner than soil its white hands by any <unk> , comes into our streets and houses ,  only the pure and aspiring can know its face , and the only compliment they can pay it is to own it .
***** manners .
" how near to good is what is fair !
which we no sooner see , but with the lines and outward air our senses taken be .
again yourselves compose , and now put all the <unk> on of figure , that proportion or color can disclose ; that if those silent arts were lost , design and picture , they might boast from you a newer ground , instructed by the <unk> sense of dignity and reverence in their true motions found . "
<name> jonson iv .
manners .
half the world , it is said , knows not how the other half live .
our exploring expedition saw the <unk> islanders getting their dinner off human bones ; and they are said to eat their own wives and children .
the <unk> of the modern inhabitants of <unk> ( west of old thebes ) is philosophical to a fault .
to set up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots , a stone to grind meal , and a mat which is the bed .
the house , namely a tomb , is ready without rent or taxes .
no rain can pass through the roof , and there is no door , for there is no want of one , as there is nothing to lose .
if the house do not please them , they walk out and enter another , as there are several hundreds at their command .
" it is somewhat singular , " adds <unk> , to whom we owe this account , " to talk of happiness among people who live in <unk> , among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of . "
in the deserts of <unk> the <unk> still dwell in caves , like <unk> , and the language of these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the whistling of birds .
again , the <unk> have no proper names ; individuals are called after their height , thickness , or other accidental quality , and have nicknames merely .
but the salt , the dates , the <name> , and the gold , for which these horrible regions are visited , find their way into countries where the purchaser and <unk> can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and <unk> ; countries where man serves himself with metals , wood , stone , glass , gum , cotton , silk , and wool ; honors himself with architecture ; writes laws , and <unk> to execute his <name> through the hands of many nations ; and , especially , establishes a select society , running through all the countries of intelligent men , a <unk> aristocracy , or fraternity of the best , which , without written law or exact usage of any kind , <unk> itself , <unk> every <unk> island and adopts and makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears .
what fact more conspicuous in modern history than the creation of the gentleman ?
chivalry is that , and loyalty is that , and , in english literature , half the drama , and all the novels , from sir <name> <name> to sir <name> <name> , paint this figure .
the word gentleman , which , like the word <name> , must hereafter characterize the present and the few preceding centuries by the importance attached to it , is a homage to personal and <unk> properties .
frivolous and fantastic additions have got associated with the name , but the steady interest of mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable properties which it <unk> .
an element which unites all the most forcible persons of every country ; makes them intelligible and agreeable to each other , and is somewhat so precise that it is at once felt if an individual lack the <unk> sign ,  can not be any casual product , but must be an average result of the character and faculties universally found in men .
it seems a certain permanent average ; as the atmosphere is a permanent composition , whilst so many gases are combined only to be <unk> .
comme il <unk> , is the frenchman 's description of good society : as we must be .
it is a spontaneous fruit of talents and feelings of precisely that class who have most vigor , who take the lead in the world of this hour , and though far from pure , far from constituting the <unk> and highest tone of human feeling , is as good as the whole society permits it to be .
it is made of the spirit , more than of the talent of men , and is a compound result into which every great force enters as an <unk> , namely virtue , wit , beauty , wealth , and power .
there is something equivocal in all the words in use to express the excellence of manners and social cultivation , because the quantities are <unk> , and the last effect is assumed by the senses as the cause .
the word gentleman has not any <unk> abstract to express the quality .
<unk> is mean , and <unk> is obsolete .
but we must keep alive in the vernacular the distinction between fashion , a word of narrow and often sinister meaning , and the heroic character which the gentleman imports .
the usual words , however , must be respected ; they <name> be found to contain the root of the matter .
the point of distinction in all this class of names , as courtesy , chivalry , fashion , and the like , is that the flower and fruit , not the grain of the tree , are contemplated .
it is beauty which is the aim this time , and not worth .
the result is now in question , although our words intimate well enough the popular feeling that the appearance supposes a substance .
the gentleman is a man of truth , lord of his own actions , and expressing that lordship in his behavior , not in any manner dependent and servile , either on persons , or opinions , or possessions .
beyond this fact of truth and real force , the word denotes <unk> or benevolence : manhood first , and then gentleness .
the popular notion certainly adds a condition of ease and fortune ; but that is a natural result of personal force and love , that they should possess and dispense the goods of the world .
in times of violence , every eminent person must fall in with many opportunities to approve his <unk> and worth ; therefore every man's name that emerged at all from the mass in the feudal ages , rattles in our ear like a flourish of trumpets .
but personal force never goes out of fashion .
that is still paramount to-day , and in the moving crowd of good society the men of valor and reality are known and rise to their natural place .
the competition is transferred from war to politics and trade , but the personal force appears readily enough in these new <unk> .
power first , or no leading class .
in politics and in trade , <unk> and pirates are of better promise than talkers and clerks .
god knows that all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door ; but whenever used in strictness and with any emphasis , the name <name> be found to point at original energy .
it describes a man standing in his own right and working after untaught methods .
in a good lord there must first be a good animal , at least to the extent of yielding the incomparable advantage of animal spirits .
the ruling class must have more , but they must have these , giving in every company the sense of power , which makes things easy to be done which <unk> the wise .
the society of the energetic class , in their friendly and festive meetings , is full of courage and of attempts which intimidate the pale scholar .
the courage which girls exhibit is like a battle of lundy 's <name> , or a <unk> .
the intellect <unk> on memory to make some supplies to face these <unk> squadrons .
but memory is a base mendicant with basket and badge , in the presence of these sudden masters .
the rulers of society must be up to the work of the world , and equal to their versatile office : men of the right <unk> pattern , who have great range of affinity .
i am far from believing the timid maxim of lord falkland ( " that for ceremony there must go two to it ; since a bold fellow <name> go through the <unk> forms " ) , and am of opinion that the gentleman is the bold fellow whose forms are not to be broken through ; and only that <unk> nature is rightful master which is the complement of whatever person it <unk> with .
my gentleman gives the law where he is ; he <name> <unk> saints in chapel , <unk> veterans in the field , and <unk> all courtesy in the hall .
he is good company for pirates and good with <unk> ; so that it is useless to fortify yourself against him ; he has the private entrance to all minds , and i could as easily exclude myself , as him .
the famous gentlemen of <name> and europe have been of this strong type ; saladin , <unk> , the cid , <name> caesar , scipio , <name> , pericles , and the <unk> personages .
they sat very carelessly in their chairs , and were too excellent themselves , to value any condition at a high rate .
a plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary , in the popular judgment , to the completion of this man of the world ; and it is a material deputy which walks through the dance which the first has led .
money is not essential , but this wide affinity is , which transcends the habits of <unk> and caste and makes itself felt by men of all classes .
if the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles and not with <unk> , he <name> never be a leader in fashion ; and if the man of the people can not speak on equal terms with the gentleman , so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order , he is not to be feared .
<unk> , socrates , and <unk> , are gentlemen of the best blood who have chosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth was equally open to them .
i use these old names , but the men i speak of are my contemporaries .
fortune <name> not supply to every generation one of these <unk> knights , but every collection of men furnishes some example of the class ; and the politics of this country , and the trade of every town , are controlled by these hardy and irresponsible <unk> , who have invention to take the lead , and a broad sympathy which puts them in fellowship with crowds , and makes their action popular .
the manners of this class are observed and caught with devotion by men of taste .
the association of these masters with each other and with men intelligent of their merits , is mutually agreeable and stimulating .
the good forms , the happiest expressions of each , are repeated and adopted .
by swift consent everything superfluous is dropped , everything graceful is renewed .
fine manners show themselves formidable to the uncultivated man .
they are a <unk> science of defence to parry and intimidate ; but once matched by the skill of the other party , they drop the point of the sword ,  points and fences disappear , and the youth finds himself in a more transparent atmosphere , wherein life is a less troublesome game , and not a misunderstanding rises between the players .
manners aim to facilitate life , to get rid of <unk> and bring the man pure to <unk> .
they aid our dealing and conversation as a railway aids travelling , by getting rid of all <unk> obstructions of the road and leaving nothing to be conquered but pure space .
these forms very soon become fixed , and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with the more heed that it becomes a badge of social and civil distinctions .
thus grows up fashion , an equivocal semblance , the most <unk> , the most fantastic and frivolous , the most feared and followed , and which morals and violence assault in vain .
there exists a strict relation between the class of power and the exclusive and polished circles .
the last are always filled or filling from the first .
the strong men usually give some allowance even to the <unk> of fashion , for that affinity they find in it .
<name> , child of the revolution , destroyer of the old <unk> , never ceased to court the <unk> st. germain ; doubtless with the feeling that fashion is a homage to men of his stamp .
fashion , though in a strange way , represents all manly virtue .
it is virtue gone to seed : it is a kind of <unk> honor .
it does not often caress the great , but the children of the great : it is a hall of the past .
it usually sets its face against the great of this hour .
great men are not commonly in its halls ; they are absent in the field : they are working , not <unk> .
fashion is made up of their children ; of those who through the value and virtue of somebody , have acquired lustre to their name , marks of distinction , means of cultivation and generosity , and , in their physical organization a certain health and excellence which secures to them , if not the highest power to work , yet high power to enjoy .
the class of power , the working heroes , the <name> , the <name> , the <name> , see that this is the festivity and permanent celebration of such as they ; that fashion is <unk> talent ; is mexico , <unk> , and <unk> beaten out thin ; that the brilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy names as their own , fifty or sixty years ago .
they are the <unk> , their sons shall be the <unk> , and their sons , in the ordinary course of things , must yield the possession of the harvest to new competitors with keener eyes and stronger frames .
the city is recruited from the country .
in the year <unk> , it is said , every legitimate monarch in europe was imbecile .
the city would have died out , rotted , and exploded , long ago , but that it was reinforced from the fields .
it is only country which came to town day before yesterday that is city and court today .
aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable results .
these mutual selections are indestructible .
if they provoke anger in the least favored class , and the excluded majority revenge themselves on the excluding minority by the strong hand and kill them , at once a new class finds itself at the top , as certainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk : and if the people should destroy class after class , until two men only were left , one of these would be the leader and would be involuntarily served and copied by the other .
you may keep this minority out of sight and out of mind , but it is tenacious of life , and is one of the estates of the realm .
i am the more struck with this tenacity , when i see its work .
it respects the administration of such unimportant matters , that we should not look for any <unk> in its rule .
we sometimes meet men under some strong moral influence , as a patriotic , a literary , a religious movement , and feel that the moral sentiment rules man and nature .
we think all other distinctions and ties <name> be slight and fugitive , this of caste or fashion for example ; yet come from year to year and see how permanent that is , in this boston or new york life of man , where too it has not the least countenance from the law of the land .
not in egypt or in <name> a firmer or more impassable line .
here are associations whose ties go over and under and through it , a meeting of merchants , a military corps , a college class , a <unk> , a professional association , a political , a religious convention ;  the persons seem to draw <unk> near ; yet , that assembly once dispersed , its members <name> not in the year meet again .
each returns to his degree in the scale of good society , porcelain remains porcelain , and earthen earthen .
the objects of fashion may be frivolous , or fashion may be <unk> , but the nature of this union and selection can be neither frivolous nor accidental .
each man 's rank in that perfect graduation depends on some symmetry in his structure or some agreement in his structure to the symmetry of society .
its doors <unk> instantaneously to a natural claim of their own kind .
a natural gentleman finds his way in , and <name> keep the oldest patrician out who has lost his intrinsic rank .
fashion understands itself ; <unk> and personal superiority of whatever country readily <unk> with those of every other .
the chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished themselves in london and <name> , by the purity of their <unk> .
to say what good of fashion we can , it rests on reality , and hates nothing so much as <unk> ; to exclude and <unk> <unk> and send them into everlasting <unk> , ' is its delight .
we <unk> in turn every other gift of men of the world ; but the habit even in little and the least matters of not appealing to any but our own sense of propriety , constitutes the foundation of all chivalry .
there is almost no kind of self-reliance , so it be sane and proportioned , which fashion does not occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of its saloons .
a sainted soul is always elegant , and , if it <name> , passes unchallenged into the most guarded ring .
but so <name> jock the <unk> pass , in some crisis that brings him thither , and find favor , as long as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance , and the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and <unk> .
for there is nothing settled in manners , but the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual .
the maiden at her first ball , the <unk> at a city dinner , believes that there is a ritual according to which every act and compliment must be performed , or the failing party must be cast out of this presence .
later they learn that good sense and character make their own forms every moment , and speak or abstain , take wine or refuse it , stay or go , sit in a chair or <unk> with children on the floor , or stand on their head , or what else <unk> , in a new and aboriginal way ; and that strong <name> is always in fashion , let who <name> be <unk> .
all that fashion demands is composure and <unk> .
a circle of men perfectly well-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which every man's native manners and character appeared .
if the <unk> have not this quality , he is nothing .
we are such lovers of self-reliance that we excuse in a man many sins if he <name> show us a complete satisfaction in his position , which asks no leave to be , of mine , or any man 's good opinion .
but any deference to some eminent man or woman of the world , <unk> all privilege of nobility .
he is an <unk> : i have nothing to do with him ; i <name> speak with his master .
a man should not go where he can not <name> his whole sphere or society with him ,  not bodily , the whole circle of his friends , but <unk> .
he should preserve in a new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation which his daily associates draw him to , else he is shorn of his best beams , and <name> be an orphan in the <unk> club .
" if you could see <unk> <name> <unk> with his tail on !  " but <unk> <name> <unk> must always <name> his belongings in some fashion , if not added as honor , then severed as disgrace .
there <name> always be in society certain persons who are <unk> of its approbation , and whose glance <name> at any time determine for the curious their standing in the world .
these are the <unk> of the lesser gods .
accept their coldness as an omen of <name> with the loftier deities , and allow them all their privilege .
they are clear in their office , nor could they be thus formidable without their own merits .
but do not measure the importance of this class by their pretension , or imagine that a <unk> can be the <unk> of honor and shame .
they pass also at their just rate ; for how can they otherwise , in circles which exist as a sort of herald 's office for the sifting of character ?
as the first thing man requires of man is reality , so that appears in all the forms of society .
we pointedly , and by name , introduce the parties to each other .
know you before all heaven and earth , that this is <name> , and this is <name> ,  they look each other in the eye ; they grasp each other 's hand , to identify and <unk> each other .
it is a great satisfaction .
a gentleman never <unk> ; his eyes look straight forward , and he assures the other party , first of all , that he has been met .
for what is it that we seek , in so many visits and hospitalities ?
is it your draperies , pictures , and decorations ?
or do we not <unk> ask , was a man in the house ?
i may easily go into a great household where there is much substance , excellent provision for comfort , luxury , and taste , and yet not encounter there any <unk> who shall subordinate these appendages .
i may go into a cottage , and find a farmer who feels that he is the man i have come to see , and fronts me accordingly .
it was therefore a very natural point of old feudal etiquette that a gentleman who received a visit , though it were of his sovereign , should not leave his roof , but should wait his arrival at the door of his house .
no house , though it were the tuileries or the <unk> , is good for anything without a master .
and yet we are not often gratified by this hospitality .
every body we know surrounds himself with a fine house , fine books , conservatory , gardens , equipage and all manner of toys , as screens to interpose between himself and his guest .
does it not seem as if man was of a very sly , elusive nature , and dreaded nothing so much as a full <unk> front to front with his fellow ?
it were <unk> , i know , quite to abolish the use of these screens , which are of eminent convenience , whether the guest is too great or too little .
we call together many friends who keep each other in play , or by luxuries and ornaments we amuse the young people , and guard our retirement .
or if perchance a searching <unk> comes to our gate , before whose eye we have no care to stand , then again we run to our curtain , and hide ourselves as <name> at the voice of the lord god in the garden .
cardinal <unk> , the pope 's <unk> at <name> , defended himself from the glances of <name> by an immense pair of green spectacles .
<name> remarked them , and speedily managed to rally them off : and yet <name> , in his turn , was not great enough with eight hundred thousand troops at his back , to face a pair of <unk> eyes , but fenced himself with etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve ; and , as all the world knows from madame de <unk> , was wont , when he found himself observed , to discharge his face of all expression .
but emperors and <name> men are by no means the most skilful masters of good manners .
no <unk> nor <unk> can <unk> skulking and <unk> ; and the first point of courtesy must always be truth , as really all the forms of <unk> point that way .
i have just been reading , in mr. <unk> 's translation , <unk> account of his journey into italy , and am struck with nothing more <unk> than the self-respecting fashions of the time .
his arrival in each place , the arrival of a gentleman of <name> , is an event of some consequence .
wherever he goes he pays a visit to whatever <name> or gentleman of note resides upon his road , as a duty to himself and to civilization .
when he leaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks , he causes his arms to be painted and <name> up as a perpetual sign to the house , as was the custom of gentlemen .
the complement of this graceful self-respect , and that of all the points of good breeding i most require and insist upon , is deference .
i like that every chair should be a throne , and hold a king .
i prefer a tendency to <unk> to an excess of fellowship .
let the <unk> objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence .
let us not be too much acquainted .
i would have a man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures , that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and <unk> .
we should meet each morning as from foreign countries , and , spending the day together , should depart at night , as into foreign countries .
in all things i would have the island of a man <unk> .
let us sit apart as the gods , talking from peak to peak all round olympus .
no degree of affection need invade this religion .
this is <unk> and <name> to keep the other sweet .
lovers should guard their strangeness .
if they forgive too much , all slides into confusion and meanness .
it is easy to push this deference to a chinese etiquette ; but coolness and absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities .
a gentleman makes no noise ; a <name> is serene .
proportionate is our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious house with blast and running , to secure some paltry convenience .
not less i dislike a low sympathy of each with his neighbor 's needs .
must we have a good understanding with one <unk> <unk> ?
as foolish people who have lived long together know when each wants salt or sugar .
i pray my companion , if he wishes for bread , to ask me for bread , and if he wishes for <unk> or arsenic , to ask me for them , and not to hold out his plate as if i knew already .
every natural function can be dignified by deliberation and privacy .
let us leave hurry to slaves .
the compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should signify , however remotely , the recollection of the grandeur of our <name> .
the flower of courtesy does not very well bide handling , but if we dare to open another leaf and explore what parts go to its conformation , we shall find also an intellectual quality .
to the leaders of men , the <name> as well as the flesh and the heart must furnish a proportion .
defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions .
men are too coarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs .
it is not quite sufficient to <unk> , a union of kindness and independence .
we imperatively require a perception of , and a homage to beauty in our companions .
other virtues are in request in the field and <unk> , but a certain degree of taste is not to be spared in those we sit with .
i could better eat with one who did not respect the truth or the laws than with a <unk> and <unk> person .
moral qualities rule the world , but at short distances the senses are despotic .
the same discrimination of fit and fair runs out , if with less <unk> , into all parts of life .
the average spirit of the energetic class is good sense , acting under certain limitations and to certain ends .
it entertains every natural gift .
social in its nature , it respects everything which tends to unite men .
it delights in measure .
the love of beauty is mainly the love of measure or proportion .
the person who screams , or uses the <unk> degree , or <unk> with heat , puts whole drawing-rooms to flight .
if you wish to be loved , love measure .
you must have genius or a prodigious usefulness if you <name> hide the want of measure .
this perception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of the social instrument .
society <name> pardon much to genius and special gifts , but , being in its nature a convention , it loves what is conventional , or what belongs to coming together .
that makes the good and bad of manners , namely what helps or <unk> fellowship .
for fashion is not good sense absolute , but relative ; not good sense private , but good sense entertaining company .
it hates corners and sharp points of character , hates quarrelsome , <unk> , solitary , and gloomy people ; hates whatever can interfere with total blending of parties ; whilst it values all peculiarities as in the highest degree refreshing , which can consist with good fellowship .
and besides the general infusion of wit to heighten civility , the direct splendor of intellectual power is ever welcome in fine society as the <unk> addition to its rule and its credit .
the dry light must shine in to adorn our festival , but it must be tempered and shaded , or that <name> also offend .
accuracy is essential to beauty , and quick perceptions to politeness , but not too quick perceptions .
one may be too punctual and too precise .
he must leave the <unk> of business at the door , when he comes into the palace of beauty .
society loves creole natures , and sleepy languishing manners , so that they cover sense , <name> and good-will : the air of drowsy strength , which <unk> criticism ; perhaps because such a person seems to reserve himself for the best of the game , and not spend himself on surfaces ; an ignoring eye , which does not see the annoyances , shifts , and inconveniences that cloud the brow and smother the voice of the sensitive .
therefore besides personal force and so much perception as constitutes unerring taste , society demands in its patrician class another element already intimated , which it significantly terms <unk> ,  expressing all degrees of generosity , from the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige , up to the heights of magnanimity and love .
insight we must have , or we shall run against one another and miss the way to our food ; but intellect is selfish and barren .
the secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy .
a man who is not happy in the company can not find any word in his memory that <name> fit the occasion .
all his information is a little impertinent .
a man who is happy there , finds in every turn of the conversation equally lucky occasions for the introduction of that which he has to say .
the favorites of society , and what it calls whole souls , are able men and of more spirit than wit , who have no uncomfortable egotism , but who exactly fill the hour and the company ; contented and contenting , at a marriage or a funeral , a ball or a jury , a <unk> or a <unk> .
england , which is <name> in gentlemen , furnished , in the beginning of the present century , a good model of that genius which the world loves , in mr. fox , who added to his great abilities the most social disposition and real love of men .
parliamentary history has few better passages than the debate in which burke and fox separated in the house of commons ; when fox urged on his old friend the claims of old friendship with such tenderness that the house was moved to tears .
another anecdote is so close to my matter , that i must hazard the story .
a <unk> who had long <unk> him for a note of three hundred guineas , found him one day counting gold , and demanded payment :  " no , " said fox , " i owe this money to <name> ; it is a debt of honor ; if an accident should happen to me , he has nothing to show . "
" then , " said the <unk> , " i change my debt into a debt of honor , " and tore the note in pieces .
fox thanked the man for his confidence and paid him , saying , " his debt was of older standing , and <name> must wait . "
lover of <name> , friend of the hindoo , friend of the african slave , he possessed a great personal popularity ; and <name> said of him on the occasion of his visit to <name> , in <unk> , " mr. fox <name> always hold the first place in an assembly at the tuileries . "
we may easily seem ridiculous in our <unk> of courtesy , whenever we insist on benevolence as its foundation .
the painted <unk> fashion rises to cast a species of derision on what we say .
but i <name> neither be driven from some allowance to fashion as a symbolic institution , nor from the belief that love is the basis of courtesy .
we must obtain that , if we can ; but by all means we must affirm this .
life owes much of its spirit to these sharp contrasts .
fashion , which affects to be honor , is often , in all men 's experience , only a <unk> .
yet so long as it is the highest circle in the imagination of the best heads on the planet , there is something necessary and excellent in it ; for it is not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the <unk> of anything preposterous ; and the respect which these mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan characters , and the curiosity with which details of high life are read , betray the universality of the love of cultivated manners .
i know that a comic <unk> would be felt , if we should enter the acknowledged 'first circles ' and apply these terrific standards of justice , beauty , and benefit to the individuals actually found there .
monarchs and heroes , sages and lovers , these <unk> are not .
fashion has many classes and many rules of probation and admission , and not the best alone .
there is not only the right of conquest , which genius pretends ,  the individual demonstrating his natural aristocracy best of the best ;  but less claims <name> pass for the time ; for fashion loves lions , and points like <unk> to her horned company .
this gentleman is this afternoon arrived from denmark ; and that is my lord ride , who came yesterday from <unk> ; here is captain <unk> , from cape <unk> ; and captain <unk> , from the interior of the earth ; and monsieur <unk> , who came down this morning in a balloon ; mr. <unk> , the reformer ; and reverend <unk> bat , who has converted the whole torrid zone in his <name> school ; and signor <unk> <name> <unk> , who extinguished vesuvius by pouring into it the bay of naples ; <unk> , the persian ambassador ; and <unk> <unk> <name> , the exiled <unk> of <unk> , whose saddle is the new <unk>  but these are monsters of one day , and to-morrow <name> be dismissed to their holes and dens ; for in these rooms every chair is waited for .
the artist , the scholar , and , in general , the <unk> , wins their way up into these places and get represented here , somewhat on this footing of conquest .
another mode is to pass through all the degrees , spending a year and a day in st. <name> 's square , being steeped in cologne water , and perfumed , and dined , and introduced , and properly grounded in all the biography and politics and anecdotes of the <unk> .
yet these <unk> may have <name> and wit .
let there be grotesque sculpture about the gates and offices of temples .
let the creed and commandments even have the saucy homage of parody .
the forms of politeness universally express benevolence in <unk> degrees .
what if they are in the mouths of selfish men , and used as means of selfishness ?
what if the false gentleman almost bows the true out of the world ?
what if the false gentleman <unk> so to address his companion as civilly to exclude all others from his discourse , and also to make them feel excluded ?
real service <name> not lose its nobleness .
all generosity is not merely french and sentimental ; nor is it to be concealed that living blood and a passion of kindness does at last distinguish god 's gentleman from fashion 's .
the <unk> of sir <unk> <unk> is not wholly unintelligible to the present age : " here lies sir <unk> <unk> , who loved his friend and persuaded his enemy : what his mouth ate , his hand paid for : what his servants robbed , he restored : if a woman gave him pleasure , he supported her in pain : he never forgot his children ; and whoso touched his finger , <name> after it his whole body . "
even the line of heroes is not utterly extinct .
there is still ever some admirable person in plain clothes , standing on the wharf , who jumps in to rescue a drowning man ; there is still some absurd inventor of charities ; some guide and comforter of runaway slaves ; some friend of poland ; some <unk> ; some fanatic who plants <unk> for the second and third generation , and orchards when he is grown old ; some <unk> piety ; some just man happy in an ill fame ; some youth ashamed of the favors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other shoulders .
and these are the centres of society , on which it returns for fresh impulses .
these are the <unk> of fashion , which is an attempt to organize beauty of behavior .
the beautiful and the generous are , in the theory , the doctors and apostles of this church : scipio , and the cid , and sir <name> <name> , and washington , and every pure and valiant heart who worshipped beauty by word and by deed .
the persons who constitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the actual aristocracy , or only on its edge ; as the chemical energy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum .
yet that is the infirmity of the <unk> , who do not know their sovereign when he appears .
the theory of society supposes the existence and sovereignty of these .
it <unk> afar off their coming .
it says with the elder gods ,  " as heaven and earth are fairer far than chaos and blank darkness , though once chiefs ; and as we show beyond that heaven and earth , in form and shape compact and beautiful ; so , on our heels a fresh perfection <unk> ; a power , more strong in beauty , born of us , and fated to excel us , as we pass in <name> that old darkness :     for , 't is the eternal law , that first in beauty shall be first in might . "
therefore , within the <unk> circle of good society there is a narrower and higher circle , concentration of its light , and flower of courtesy , to which there is always a tacit appeal of pride and reference , as to its inner and imperial court ; the parliament of love and chivalry .
and this is constituted of those persons in whom heroic dispositions are native ; with the love of beauty , the delight in society , and the power to embellish the passing day .
if the individuals who compose the purest circles of aristocracy in europe , the guarded blood of centuries , should pass in review , in such manner as that we could at leisure and critically inspect their behavior , we might find no gentleman and no <name> ; for although excellent specimens of courtesy and <unk> would gratify us in the assemblage , in the particulars we should detect offence .
because elegance comes of no breeding , but of birth .
there must be romance of character , or the most fastidious exclusion of <unk> <name> not avail .
it must be genius which takes that direction : it must be not courteous , but courtesy .
high behavior is as rare in fiction as it is in fact .
<name> is praised for the fidelity with which he painted the demeanor and conversation of the superior classes .
certainly , kings and queens , nobles and great ladies , had some right to complain of the absurdity that had been put in their mouths before the days of <unk> ; but neither does <name> 's dialogue bear criticism .
his lords brave each other in smart <unk> speeches , but the dialogue is in costume , and does not please on the second reading : it is not warm with life .
in shakspeare alone the speakers do not strut and bridle , the dialogue is easily great , and he adds to so many titles that of being the <unk> man in england and in christendom .
once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of <name> manners , in the presence of a man or woman who have no bar in their nature , but whose character <unk> freely in their word and gesture .
a beautiful form is better than a beautiful face ; a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form : it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures ; it is the finest of the fine arts .
a man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature , yet , by the moral quality radiating from his countenance he may abolish all considerations of magnitude , and in his manners equal the majesty of the world .
i have seen an individual whose manners , though wholly within the conventions of elegant society , were never learned there , but were original and commanding and held out protection and prosperity ; one who did not need the aid of a <unk> , but carried the holiday in his eye ; who <unk> the fancy by flinging wide the doors of new modes of existence ; who shook off the captivity of etiquette , with happy , spirited bearing , good-natured and free as <name> hood ; yet with the port of an emperor , if need be ,  calm , serious , and fit to stand the gaze of millions .
the open air and the fields , the street and public chambers are the places where man <unk> his <name> ; let him yield or divide the sceptre at the door of the house .
woman , with her instinct of behavior , instantly detects in man a love of trifles , any coldness or imbecility , or , in short , any want of that large , flowing , and magnanimous deportment which is indispensable as an exterior in the hall .
our american institutions have been friendly to her , and at this moment i esteem it a chief felicity of this country , that it <unk> in women .
a certain awkward consciousness of inferiority in the men may give rise to the new chivalry in behalf of woman 's rights .
certainly let her be as much better placed in the laws and in social forms as the most zealous reformer can ask , but i confide so entirely in her inspiring and musical nature , that i believe only herself can show us how she shall be served .
the wonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at times into <unk> and godlike regions , and <unk> the pictures of <name> , <unk> , or <unk> ; and by the firmness with which she <unk> her upward path , she convinces the <unk> <unk> that another road exists than that which their feet know .
but besides those who make good in our imagination the place of muses and of <unk> <unk> , are there not women who fill our vase with wine and roses to the brim , so that the wine runs over and fills the house with perfume ; who inspire us with courtesy ; who <unk> our tongues and we speak ; who <unk> our eyes and we see ?
we say things we never thought to have said ; for once , our walls of habitual reserve vanished and left us at large ; we were children playing with children in a wide field of flowers .
steep us , we cried , in these influences , for days , for weeks , and we shall be <name> poets and <name> write out in many-colored words the romance that you are .
was it hafiz or <unk> that said of his persian <name> , she was an elemental force , and astonished me by her amount of life , when i saw her day after day radiating , every instant , <unk> <name> and <name> on all around her .
she was a <unk> powerful to reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one society : like air or water , an element of such a great range of affinities that it combines readily with a thousand substances .
where she is present all others <name> be more than they are wont .
she was a unit and whole , so that whatsoever she did , became her .
she had too much sympathy and <name> to please , than that you could say her manners were marked with dignity , yet no <name> could surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each occasion .
she did not study the persian grammar , nor the books of the seven poets , but all the poems of the seven seemed to be written upon her .
for though the bias of her nature was not to thought , but to sympathy , yet was she so perfect in her own nature as to meet intellectual persons by the fulness of her heart , warming them by her sentiments ; believing , as she did , that by dealing nobly with all , all would show themselves <name> .
i know that this <unk> pile of chivalry or fashion , which seems so fair and picturesque to those who look at the contemporary facts for science or for entertainment , is not equally pleasant to all spectators .
the constitution of our society makes it a giant 's castle to the ambitious youth who have not found their names enrolled in its golden book , and whom it has excluded from its coveted honors and privileges .
they have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur is shadowy and relative : it is great by their allowance ; its proudest gates <name> fly open at the approach of their courage and virtue .
for the present distress , however , of those who are <unk> to suffer from the <unk> of this <name> , there are easy remedies .
to remove your residence a couple of miles , or at most four , <name> commonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility .
for the advantages which fashion values are plants which thrive in very confined localities , in a few streets namely .
out of this <unk> they go for nothing ; are of no use in the farm , in the forest , in the market , in war , in the nuptial society , in the literary or scientific circle , at sea , in friendship , in the heaven of thought or virtue .
but we have lingered long enough in these painted courts .
the worth of the thing signified must vindicate our taste for the emblem .
everything that is called fashion and courtesy <unk> itself before the cause and fountain of honor , creator of titles and dignities , namely the heart of love .
this is the <name> blood , this the fire , which , in all countries and contingencies , <name> work after its kind and conquer and expand all that approaches it .
this gives new meanings to every fact .
this <unk> the <name> , suffering no grandeur but its own .
what is <name> ?
are you <name> enough to help anybody ?
to succor the <unk> and the eccentric ?
<name> enough to make the canadian in his wagon , the <unk> with his consul 's paper which <unk> him " to the charitable , " the swarthy italian with his few broken words of english , the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town to town , even the poor insane or <unk> wreck of man or woman , feel the <name> exception of your presence and your house from the general <unk> and <unk> ; to make such feel that they were greeted with a voice which made them both remember and <name> ?
what is vulgar but to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive reasons ?
what is gentle , but to allow it , and give their heart and yours one holiday from the national caution ?
without the <name> heart , wealth is an ugly beggar .
the king of <unk> could not afford to be so bountiful as the poor <unk> who dwelt at his gate .
<unk> had a humanity so broad and deep that although his speech was so bold and free with the koran as to disgust all the <unk> , yet was there never a poor outcast , eccentric , or insane man , some fool who had cut off his beard , or who had been mutilated under a vow , or had a pet madness in his <name> , but fled at once to him ; that great heart lay there so <name> and hospitable in the centre of the country , that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers <name> them to his side .
and the madness which he <unk> he did not share .
is not this to be <name> ?
this only to be rightly <name> ?
but i shall hear without pain that i play the courtier very ill , and talk of that which i do not well understand .
it is easy to see , that what is called by distinction society and fashion has good laws as well as bad , has much that is necessary , and much that is absurd .
too good for <unk> , and too bad for blessing , it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology , in any attempt to settle its character .
'i overheard jove , one day , ' said <unk> , <unk> of destroying the earth ; he said it had failed ; they were all rogues and <unk> , who went from bad to worse , as fast as the days succeeded each other .
<name> said she hoped not ; they were only ridiculous little creatures , with this odd circumstance , that they had a blur , or indeterminate aspect , seen far or seen near ; if you called them bad , they would appear so ; if you called them good , they would appear so ; and there was no one person or action among them , which would not puzzle her owl , much more all olympus , to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good . '
***** gifts .
gifts of one who loved me ,  't was high time they came ; when he ceased to love me , time they stopped for shame .
v. gifts .
it is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy ; that the world owes the world more than the world can pay , and ought to go into <unk> and be sold .
i do not think this general <unk> , which involves in some sort all the population , to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at christmas and new year and other times , in bestowing gifts ; since it is always so pleasant to be generous , though very vexatious to pay debts .
but the impediment lies in the choosing .
if at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody , i am puzzled what to give , until the opportunity is gone .
flowers and fruits are always fit presents ; flowers , because they are a proud assertion that a <name> of beauty <unk> all the <unk> of the world .
these <name> natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature : they are like music heard out of a <unk> .
nature does not <unk> us ; we are children , not pets ; she is not fond ; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor , after severe universal laws .
yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty .
men use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it , because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted .
something like that pleasure , the flowers give us : what am i to whom these sweet hints are addressed ?
fruits are acceptable gifts , because they are the flower of commodities , and admit of fantastic values being attached to them .
if a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of fine <unk> , i should think there was some proportion between the labor and the reward .
for common gifts , necessity makes <unk> and beauty every day , and one is glad when an imperative leaves him no <unk> ; since if the man at the door have no shoes , you have not to consider whether you could procure him a <unk> .
and as it is always pleasing to see a man eat bread , or drink water , in the house or out of doors , so it is always a great satisfaction to supply these first wants .
necessity does everything well .
in our condition of universal dependence it seems heroic to let the <unk> be the judge of his necessity , and to give all that is asked , though at great inconvenience .
if it be a fantastic <name> , it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him .
i can think of many parts i should prefer playing to that of the furies .
next to things of necessity , the rule for a gift , which one of my friends prescribed , is that we might convey to some person that which properly belonged to his character , and was easily associated with him in thought .
but our tokens of compliment and love are for the most part barbarous .
rings and other jewels are not gifts , but apologies for gifts .
the only gift is a portion of thyself .
thou must bleed for me .
therefore the poet brings his poem ; the shepherd , his lamb ; the farmer , corn ; the miner , a gem ; the sailor , <name> and shells ; the painter , his picture ; the girl , a handkerchief of her own sewing .
this is right and pleasing , for it <unk> society in so far to its primary basis , when a man 's biography is conveyed in his gift , and every man 's wealth is an index of his merit .
but it is a cold lifeless business when you go to the shops to buy me something which does not represent your life and talent , but a goldsmith 's .
this is fit for kings , and <name> men who represent kings , and a false state of property , to make presents of gold and silver stuffs , as a kind of symbolical <unk> , or payment of <unk> .
the law of benefits is a difficult channel , which requires careful sailing , or rude boats .
it is not the office of a man to receive gifts .
how dare you give them ?
we wish to be <unk> .
we do not quite forgive a giver .
the hand that feeds us is in some danger of being bitten .
we can receive anything from love , for that is a way of receiving it from ourselves ; but not from any one who assumes to bestow .
we sometimes hate the meat which we eat , because there seems something of degrading dependence in living by it :  " brother , if jove to thee a present make , take heed that from his hands thou nothing take . "
we ask the whole .
nothing less <name> content us .
we <unk> society if it do not give us , besides earth and fire and water , opportunity , love , reverence , and objects of veneration .
he is a good man who can receive a gift well .
we are either glad or sorry at a gift , and both emotions are unbecoming .
some violence i think is done , some degradation borne , when i rejoice or grieve at a gift .
i am sorry when my independence is invaded , or when a gift comes from such as do not know my spirit , and so the act is not supported ; and if the gift pleases me overmuch , then i should be ashamed that the <unk> should read my heart , and see that i love his commodity , and not him .
the gift , to be true , must be the flowing of the giver unto me , correspondent to my flowing unto him .
when the waters are at level , then my goods pass to him , and his to me .
all his are mine , all mine his .
i say to him , how can you give me this pot of oil or this <unk> of wine when all your oil and wine is mine , which belief of mine this gift seems to deny ?
hence the fitness of beautiful , not useful things , for gifts .
this giving is flat usurpation , and therefore when the <unk> is ungrateful , as all <unk> hate all <unk> , not at all considering the value of the gift but looking back to the greater store it was taken from ,  i rather sympathize with the <unk> than with the anger of my lord <unk> .
for the expectation of gratitude is mean , and is continually punished by the total insensibility of the obliged person .
it is a great happiness to get off without injury and <unk> from one who has had the ill-luck to be served by you .
it is a very <unk> business , this of being served , and the debtor naturally wishes to give you a slap .
a golden text for these gentlemen is that which i so admire in the buddhist , who never thanks , and who says , " do not flatter your benefactors . "
the reason of these <unk> i conceive to be that there is no <unk> between a man and any gift .
you can not give anything to a magnanimous person .
after you have served him he at once puts you in debt by his magnanimity .
the service a man renders his friend is trivial and selfish compared with the service he knows his friend stood in readiness to yield him , alike before he had begun to serve his friend , and now also .
compared with that good-will i bear my friend , the benefit it is in my power to render him seems small .
besides , our action on each other , good as well as evil , is so incidental and at random that we can seldom hear the <unk> of any person who would thank us for a benefit , without some shame and humiliation .
we can rarely strike a direct stroke , but must be content with an oblique one ; we seldom have the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit which is directly received .
but <unk> <unk> favors on every side without knowing it , and receives with wonder the thanks of all people .
i fear to breathe any treason against the majesty of love , which is the genius and god of gifts , and to whom we must not affect to <unk> .
let him give kingdoms or <unk> indifferently .
there are persons from whom we always expect <unk> ; let us not cease to expect them .
this is prerogative , and not to be limited by our municipal rules .
for the rest , i like to see that we can not be bought and sold .
the best of hospitality and of generosity is also not in the <name> , but in fate .
i find that i am not much to you ; you do not need me ; you do not feel me ; then am i thrust out of doors , though you <unk> me house and lands .
no services are of any value , but only likeness .
when i have attempted to join myself to others by services , it proved an intellectual trick ,  no more .
they eat your service like apples , and leave you out .
but love them , and they feel you and delight in you all the time .
***** nature .
the rounded world is fair to see , nine times folded in mystery : though baffled seers can not impart the secret of its laboring heart , throb thine with nature 's throbbing breast , and all is clear from east to west .
spirit that <unk> each form within <unk> to spirit of its kin ; <unk> every atom glows , and hints the future which it owes .
<name> .
nature .
there are days which occur in this climate , at almost any season of the year , wherein the world reaches its perfection ; when the air , the heavenly bodies and the earth , make a <name> , as if nature would indulge her offspring ; when , in these bleak upper sides of the planet , nothing is to <name> that we have heard of the happiest latitudes , and we <unk> in the shining hours of <name> and cuba ; when everything that has life gives sign of satisfaction , and the cattle that lie on the ground seem to have great and tranquil thoughts .
these <unk> may be looked for with a little more assurance in that pure october weather which we distinguish by the name of the indian summer .
the day , immeasurably long , sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields .
to have lived through all its <name> hours , seems longevity enough .
the solitary places do not seem quite lonely .
at the gates of the forest , the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small , wise and foolish .
the knapsack of custom falls off his back with the first step he makes into these precincts .
here is sanctity which shames our religions , and reality which <unk> our heroes .
here we find nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other circumstance , and judges like a god all men that come to her .
we have crept out of our close and crowded houses into the night and morning , and we see what majestic beauties daily wrap us in their bosom .
how willingly we would escape the barriers which render them comparatively impotent , escape the <unk> and second thought , and suffer nature to <unk> us .
the tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual morning , and is stimulating and heroic .
the anciently reported spells of these places creep on us .
the stems of pines , hemlocks , and oaks almost gleam like iron on the excited eye .
the <unk> trees begin to persuade us to live with them , and quit our life of solemn trifles .
here no history , or church , or state , is <unk> on the divine sky and the immortal year .
how easily we might walk onward into the opening landscape , absorbed by new pictures and by thoughts fast succeeding each other , until by degrees the recollection of home was crowded out of the mind , all memory obliterated by the tyranny of the present , and we were led in triumph by nature .
these enchantments are medicinal , they sober and heal us .
these are plain pleasures , kindly and native to us .
we come to our own , and make friends with matter , which the ambitious chatter of the schools would persuade us to despise .
we never can part with it ; the mind loves its old home : as water to our thirst , so is the rock , the ground , to our eyes and hands and feet .
it is firm water ; it is cold flame ; what health , what affinity !
ever an old friend , ever like a dear friend and brother when we chat <unk> with strangers , comes in this honest face , and takes a grave <name> with us , and shames us out of our nonsense .
cities give not the human senses room enough .
we go out daily and nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon , and require so much scope , just as we need water for our bath .
there are all degrees of natural influence , from these quarantine powers of nature , up to her dearest and gravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul .
there is the bucket of cold water from the spring , the <unk> to which the chilled traveller rushes for safety ,  and there is the sublime moral of autumn and of noon .
we nestle in nature , and draw our living as parasites from her roots and grains , and we receive glances from the heavenly bodies , which call us to solitude and foretell the remotest future .
the blue zenith is the point in which romance and reality meet .
i think if we should be rapt away into all that we dream of heaven , and should converse with <name> and <unk> , the upper sky would be all that would remain of our furniture .
it seems as if the day was not wholly profane in which we have given heed to some natural object .
the fall of <unk> in a still air , preserving to each <name> its perfect form ; the blowing of sleet over a wide sheet of water , and over plains ; the waving <unk> ; the mimic waving of acres of <unk> , whose innumerable florets <unk> and ripple before the eye ; the reflections of trees and flowers in glassy lakes ; the musical steaming odorous south wind , which converts all trees to <unk> ; the crackling and spurting of hemlock in the flames , or of pine logs , which yield <name> to the walls and faces in the <unk> ,  these are the music and pictures of the most ancient religion .
my house stands in low land , with limited outlook , and on the skirt of the village .
but i go with my friend to the shore of our little river , and with one stroke of the paddle i leave the village politics and personalities , yes , and the world of villages and personalities behind , and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight , too bright almost for spotted man to enter without <unk> and probation .
we penetrate bodily this incredible beauty ; we dip our hands in this painted element ; our eyes are bathed in these lights and forms .
a holiday , a <unk> , a <name> revel , the proudest , most <unk> festival that valor and beauty , power and taste , ever decked and enjoyed , establishes itself on the instant .
these sunset clouds , these delicately emerging stars , with their private and ineffable glances , signify it and <unk> it .
i am taught the poorness of our invention , the ugliness of towns and palaces .
<name> and luxury have early learned that they must work as <unk> and sequel to this original beauty .
i am <unk> for my return .
henceforth i shall be hard to please .
i can not go back to toys .
i am grown expensive and sophisticated .
i can no longer live without elegance , but a countryman shall be my master of revels .
he who knows the most ; he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground , the waters , the plants , the heavens , and how to come at these enchantments ,  is the <name> and <name> man .
only as far as the masters of the world have called in nature to their aid , can they reach the height of magnificence .
this is the meaning of their <unk> , villas , <unk> , islands , parks and preserves , to back their <unk> personality with these strong accessories .
i do not wonder that the landed interest should be invincible in the state with these dangerous auxiliaries .
these bribe and invite ; not kings , not palaces , not men , not women , but these tender and poetic stars , eloquent of secret promises .
we heard what the <name> man said , we knew of his villa , his grove , his wine and his company , but the provocation and point of the invitation came out of these beguiling stars .
in their soft glances i see what men strove to realize in some versailles , or <unk> , or <unk> .
indeed , it is the magical lights of the horizon and the blue sky for the background which save all our works of <name> , which were otherwise <unk> .
when the <name> tax the poor with servility and <unk> , they should consider the effect of men reputed to be the possessors of nature , on imaginative minds .
ah !
if the <name> were <name> as the poor fancy riches !
a boy hears a military band play on the field at night , and he has kings and queens and famous chivalry palpably before him .
he hears the echoes of a horn in a hill country , in the notch mountains , for example , which converts the mountains into an <unk> harp ,  and this supernatural <unk> <unk> to him the <name> mythology , apollo , <name> , and all divine hunters and <unk> .
can a musical note be so lofty , so haughtily beautiful !
to the poor young poet , thus fabulous is his picture of society ; he is loyal ; he respects the <name> ; they are <name> for the sake of his imagination ; how poor his fancy would be , if they were not <name> !
that they have some <unk> grove which they call a park ; that they live in larger and <unk> saloons than he has visited , and go in coaches , keeping only the society of the elegant , to <unk> and to distant cities ,  these make the <unk> from which he has delineated estates of romance , compared with which their actual possessions are <unk> and <unk> .
the muse herself betrays her son , and <unk> the gifts of wealth and well-born beauty by a radiation out of the air , and clouds , and forests that skirt the road ,  a certain haughty favor , as if from patrician genii to patricians , a kind of aristocracy in nature , a <name> of the power of the air .
the moral sensibility which makes <unk> and <unk> so easily , may not be always found , but the material landscape is never far off .
we can find these enchantments without visiting the como lake , or the madeira islands .
we exaggerate the praises of local scenery .
in every landscape the point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth , and that is seen from the first hillock as well as from the top of the <unk> .
the stars at night stoop down over the <unk> , <unk> common with all the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the campagna , or on the marble deserts of egypt .
the <unk> clouds and the colors of morning and evening <name> <unk> maples and alders .
the difference between landscape and landscape is small , but there is great difference in the beholders .
there is nothing so wonderful in any particular landscape as the necessity of being beautiful under which every landscape lies .
nature can not be surprised in undress .
beauty breaks in everywhere .
but it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic , which <unk> called natura <unk> , or nature passive .
one can hardly speak directly of it without excess .
it is as easy to <unk> in mixed companies what is called " the subject of religion . "
a susceptible person does not like to indulge his tastes in this kind without the apology of some trivial necessity : he goes to see a <unk> , or to look at the crops , or to fetch a plant or a mineral from a remote locality , or he carries a <unk> or a <unk> .
i suppose this shame must have a good reason .
a <unk> in nature is barren and unworthy .
the <unk> of fields is no better than his brother of broadway .
men are naturally hunters and inquisitive of <unk> , and i suppose that such a <unk> as <unk> and indians should furnish facts for , would take place in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the " wreaths " and " <name> 's <unk> " of the <unk> ; yet ordinarily , whether we are too clumsy for so subtle a topic , or from whatever cause , as soon as men begin to write on nature , they fall into <unk> .
frivolity is a most unfit tribute to pan , who ought to be represented in the mythology as the most continent of gods .
i would not be frivolous before the admirable reserve and <name> of time , yet i can not renounce the right of returning often to this old topic .
the multitude of false churches <unk> the true religion .
literature , poetry , science are the homage of man to this <unk> secret , concerning which no sane man can affect an indifference or <unk> .
nature is loved by what is best in us .
it is loved as the city of god , although , or rather because there is no citizen .
the sunset is unlike anything that is underneath it : it wants men .
and the beauty of nature must always seem unreal and mocking , until the landscape has human figures that are as good as itself .
if there were good men , there would never be this rapture in nature .
if the king is in the palace , nobody looks at the walls .
it is when he is gone , and the house is filled with grooms and <unk> , that we turn from the people to find relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the pictures and the architecture .
the critics who complain of the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from the thing to be done , must consider that our hunting of the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against false society .
man is fallen ; nature is erect , and serves as a <unk> thermometer , detecting the presence or absence of the divine sentiment in man .
by fault of our dulness and selfishness we are looking up to nature , but when we are convalescent , nature <name> look up to us .
we see the foaming <name> with <unk> : if our own life flowed with the right energy , we should shame the <name> .
the stream of zeal sparkles with real fire , and not with reflex rays of sun and moon .
nature may be as <unk> studied as trade .
astronomy to the selfish becomes <unk> ; psychology , mesmerism ( with intent to show where our spoons are gone ) ; and anatomy and physiology become <unk> and <unk> .
but taking timely warning , and leaving many things <unk> on this topic , let us not longer omit our homage to the efficient nature , natura <unk> , the quick cause before which all forms flee as the driven snows ; itself secret , its works driven before it in flocks and multitudes , ( as the ancient represented nature by proteus , a shepherd , ) and in <unk> variety .
it <unk> itself in creatures , reaching from particles and <unk> through transformation on transformation to the highest <unk> , arriving at consummate results without a shock or a leap .
a little heat , that is a little motion , is all that differences the bald , dazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical climates .
all changes pass without violence , by reason of the two cardinal conditions of boundless space and boundless time .
geology has initiated us into the <unk> of nature , and taught us to disuse our <unk> measures , and exchange our mosaic and <unk> schemes for her large style .
we knew nothing rightly , for want of perspective .
now we learn what patient periods must round themselves before the rock is formed ; then before the rock is broken , and the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate into soil , and opened the door for the remote <name> , fauna , ceres , and <unk> to come in .
how far off yet is the <unk> !
how far the quadruped !
how inconceivably remote is man !
all duly arrive , and then race after race of men .
it is a long way from granite to the oyster ; farther yet to plato and the preaching of the immortality of the soul .
yet all must come , as surely as the first atom has two sides .
motion or change and identity or rest are the first and second secrets of nature :  motion and rest .
the whole code of her laws may be written on the <unk> , or the <unk> of a ring .
the whirling bubble on the surface of a <name> admits us to the secret of the mechanics of the sky .
every shell on the beach is a key to it .
a little water made to <unk> in a cup explains the formation of the simpler shells ; the addition of matter from year to year , arrives at last at the most complex forms ; and yet so poor is nature with all her craft , that from the beginning to the end of the universe she has but one stuff ,  but one stuff with its two ends , to serve up all her <unk> variety .
compound it how she <name> , <name> , sand , fire , water , tree , man , it is still one stuff , and betrays the same properties .
nature is always consistent , though she <unk> to <unk> her own laws .
she keeps her laws , and seems to <unk> them .
she arms and <unk> an animal to find its place and living in the earth , and at the same time she arms and <unk> another animal to destroy it .
space exists to divide creatures ; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few feathers she gives him a petty omnipresence .
the direction is forever onward , but the artist still goes back for materials and begins again with the first elements on the most advanced stage : otherwise all goes to ruin .
if we look at her work , we seem to catch a glance of a system in transition .
plants are the young of the world , vessels of health and vigor ; but they grope ever upward towards consciousness ; the trees are imperfect men , and seem to <unk> their imprisonment , rooted in the ground .
the animal is the novice and <unk> of a more advanced order .
the men , though young , having tasted the first drop from the cup of thought , are already dissipated : the maples and ferns are still <unk> ; yet no doubt when they come to consciousness they too <name> curse and swear .
flowers so strictly belong to youth that we adult men soon come to feel that their beautiful generations concern not us : we have had our day ; now let the children have theirs .
the flowers <unk> us , and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness .
things are so strictly related , that according to the skill of the eye , from any one object the parts and properties of any other may be predicted .
if we had eyes to see it , a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist , as readily as the city .
that identity makes us all one , and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale .
we talk of deviations from natural life , as if artificial life were not also natural .
the <unk> curled courtier in the <unk> of a palace has an animal nature , rude and aboriginal as a white bear , omnipotent to its own ends , and is directly related , there amid <unk> and <unk> , to <unk> <unk> and the axis of the globe .
if we consider how much we are nature 's , we need not be superstitious about towns , as if that terrific or <unk> force did not find us there also , and fashion cities .
nature , who made the <name> , made the house .
we may easily hear too much of rural influences .
the cool disengaged air of natural objects makes them enviable to us , chafed and irritable creatures with red faces , and we think we shall be as grand as they if we camp out and eat roots ; but let us be men instead of <unk> and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us , though we sit in chairs of <name> on carpets of silk .
this guiding identity runs through all the surprises and contrasts of the piece , and <unk> every law .
man carries the world in his head , the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought .
because the history of nature is <unk> in his <name> , therefore is he the prophet and discoverer of her secrets .
every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody , before it was actually verified .
a man does not tie his shoe without recognizing laws which bind the farthest regions of nature : moon , plant , gas , <name> , are concrete geometry and <name> .
common sense knows its own , and recognizes the fact at first sight in chemical experiment .
the common sense of <name> , <name> , davy and black , is the same common sense which made the arrangements which now it discovers .
if the identity expresses organized rest , the counter action runs also into organization .
the astronomers said , 'give us matter and a little motion and we <name> construct the universe .
it is not enough that we should have matter , we must also have a single impulse , one shove to launch the mass and generate the <name> of the centrifugal and centripetal forces .
once heave the ball from the hand , and we can show how all this mighty order grew . '
 'a very unreasonable <unk> , ' said the <unk> , 'and a plain begging of the question .
could you not prevail to know the <name> of projection , as well as the continuation of it ? '
nature , meanwhile , had not waited for the discussion , but , right or wrong , bestowed the impulse , and the balls rolled .
it was no great affair , a mere push , but the astronomers were right in making much of it , for there is no end to the consequences of the act .
that famous aboriginal push <unk> itself through all the balls of the system , and through every atom of every ball ; through all the races of creatures , and through the history and performances of every individual .
exaggeration is in the course of things .
nature sends no creature , no man into the world without adding a small excess of his proper quality .
given the planet , it is still necessary to add the impulse ; so to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path , a shove to put it on its way ; in every instance a slight generosity , a drop too much .
without electricity the air would rot , and without this violence of direction which men and women have , without a spice of <unk> and fanatic , no excitement , no efficiency .
we aim above the <name> to hit the <name> .
every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it .
and when now and then comes along some sad , <unk> man , who sees how paltry a game is played , and refuses to play , but <unk> the secret ;  how then ?
is the bird flown ?
o no , the wary nature sends a new troop of fairer forms , of <unk> youths , with a little more excess of direction to hold them fast to their several aim ; makes them a little <unk> in that direction in which they are <unk> , and on goes the game again with new whirl , for a generation or two more .
the child with his sweet pranks , the fool of his senses , commanded by every sight and sound , without any power to compare and rank his sensations , abandoned to a whistle or a painted chip , to a lead <unk> or a <unk> , <unk> everything , <unk> nothing , delighted with every new thing , lies down at night overpowered by the fatigue which this day of continual pretty madness has incurred .
but nature has answered her purpose with the curly , dimpled lunatic .
she has <unk> every faculty , and has secured the symmetrical growth of the bodily frame by all these attitudes and exertions ,  an end of the first importance , which could not be trusted to any care less perfect than her own .
this glitter , this <unk> lustre plays round the top of every toy to his eye to insure his fidelity , and he is deceived to his good .
we are made alive and kept alive by the same arts .
let the <unk> say what they please , we do not eat for the good of living , but because the meat is <unk> and the appetite is keen .
the vegetable life does not content itself with casting from the flower or the tree a single seed , but it fills the air and earth with a <unk> of seeds , that , if thousands perish , thousands may plant themselves ; that hundreds may come up , that tens may live to maturity ; that at least one may replace the parent .
all things betray the same calculated profusion .
the excess of fear with which the animal frame is hedged round , shrinking from cold , starting at sight of a snake , or at a sudden noise , protects us , through a multitude of groundless alarms , from some one real danger at last .
the lover seeks in marriage his private felicity and perfection , with no prospective end ; and nature hides in his happiness her own end , namely , progeny , or the perpetuity of the race .
but the craft with which the world is made , runs also into the mind and character of men .
no man is quite sane ; each has a vein of folly in his composition , a slight determination of blood to the head , to make sure of holding him hard to some one point which nature had taken to heart .
great causes are never tried on their merits ; but the cause is reduced to particulars to suit the size of the partisans , and the contention is ever hottest on minor matters .
not less remarkable is the <unk> of each man in the importance of what he has to do or say .
the poet , the prophet , has a higher value for what he utters than any hearer , and therefore it gets spoken .
the strong , <unk> <name> declares with an emphasis not to be mistaken , that " god himself can not do without wise men . "
<name> <unk> and <name> fox betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their <unk> tracts , and <name> <unk> once suffered himself to be worshipped as the christ .
each prophet comes presently to identify himself with his thought , and to esteem his hat and shoes sacred .
however this may discredit such persons with the judicious , it helps them with the people , as it gives heat , <unk> , and publicity to their words .
a similar experience is not infrequent in private life .
each young and ardent person writes a diary , in which , when the hours of prayer and penitence arrive , he <unk> his soul .
the pages thus written are to him burning and fragrant ; he reads them on his knees by midnight and by the morning <name> ; he <unk> them with his tears ; they are sacred ; too good for the world , and hardly yet to be shown to the dearest friend .
this is the man-child that is born to the soul , and her life still circulates in the babe .
the <unk> cord has not yet been cut .
after some time has elapsed , he begins to wish to admit his friend to this hallowed experience , and with hesitation , yet with firmness , exposes the pages to his eye .
<name> they not burn his eyes ?
the friend coldly turns them over , and passes from the writing to conversation , with easy transition , which strikes the other party with astonishment and vexation .
he can not suspect the writing itself .
days and nights of <unk> life , of communion with angels of darkness and of light have engraved their shadowy characters on that <unk> book .
he suspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend .
is there then no friend ?
he can not yet credit that one may have impressive experience and yet may not know how to put his private fact into literature ; and perhaps the discovery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers than we , that though we should hold our peace the truth would not the less be spoken , might check injuriously the flames of our zeal .
a man can only speak so long as he does not feel his speech to be partial and inadequate .
it is partial , but he does not see it to be so whilst he utters it .
as soon as he is released from the instinctive and particular and sees its partiality , he shuts his mouth in disgust .
for no man can write anything who does not think that what he writes is for the time the history of the world ; or do anything well who does not esteem his work to be of importance .
my work may be of none , but i must not think it of none , or i shall not do it with impunity .
in like manner , there is throughout nature something mocking , something that leads us on and on , but arrives nowhere ; keeps no <name> with us .
all promise <unk> the performance .
we live in a system of <unk> .
every end is prospective of some other end , which is also temporary ; a round and final success nowhere .
we are encamped in nature , not domesticated .
hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink ; but bread and wine , mix and cook them how you <name> , leave us hungry and thirsty , after the stomach is full .
it is the same with all our arts and performances .
our music , our poetry , our language itself are not <unk> , but suggestions .
the hunger for wealth , which reduces the planet to a garden , fools the eager pursuer .
what is the end sought ?
plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty , from the intrusion of deformity or vulgarity of any kind .
but what an <unk> method !
what a train of means to secure a little conversation !
this palace of brick and stone , these servants , this kitchen , these stables , horses and equipage , this <unk> and file of mortgages ; trade to all the world , <unk> and cottage by the <unk> , all for a little conversation , high , clear , and spiritual !
could it not be had as well by beggars on the highway ?
no , all these things came from successive efforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life , and give opportunity .
conversation , character , were the avowed ends ; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings , cured the smoky chimney , silenced the creaking door , brought friends together in a warm and quiet room , and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment .
thought , virtue , beauty , were the ends ; but it was known that men of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache , or wet feet , or could lose good time whilst the room was getting warm in <name> days .
unluckily , in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences , the main attention has been diverted to this object ; the old aims have been lost sight of , and to remove friction has come to be the end .
that is the ridicule of <name> men , and boston , london , vienna , and now the governments generally of the world are cities and governments of the <name> ; and the masses are not men , but poor men , that is , men who would be <name> ; this is the ridicule of the class , that they arrive with pains and sweat and fury nowhere ; when all is done , it is for nothing .
they are like one who has interrupted the conversation of a company to make his speech , and now has forgotten what he went to say .
the appearance strikes the eye everywhere of an aimless society , of aimless nations .
were the ends of nature so great and <unk> as to exact this immense sacrifice of men ?
quite analogous to the <unk> in life , there is , as might be expected , a similar effect on the eye from the face of external nature .
there is in woods and waters a certain <unk> and flattery , together with a failure to yield a present satisfaction .
this disappointment is felt in every landscape .
i have seen the softness and beauty of the summer clouds floating feathery overhead , enjoying , as it seemed , their height and privilege of motion , whilst yet they appeared not so much the drapery of this place and hour , as <unk> to some pavilions and gardens of festivity beyond .
it is an odd jealousy , but the poet finds himself not near enough to his object .
the pine-tree , the river , the bank of flowers before him , does not seem to be nature .
nature is still elsewhere .
this or this is but <unk> and far-off reflection and <name> of the triumph that has passed by and is now at its glancing splendor and <unk> , perchance in the neighboring fields , or , if you stand in the field , then in the adjacent woods .
the present object shall give you this sense of stillness that follows a pageant which has just gone by .
what splendid distance , what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness in the sunset !
but who can go where they are , or lay his hand or plant his foot thereon ?
off they fall from the round world forever and ever .
it is the same among the men and women as among the silent trees ; always a referred existence , an absence , never a presence and satisfaction .
is it that beauty can never be grasped ?
in persons and in landscape is equally inaccessible ?
the accepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him .
she was heaven whilst he pursued her as a <name> : she can not be heaven if she stoops to such a one as he .
what shall we say of this <unk> appearance of that first <unk> impulse , of this flattery and <unk> of so many well-meaning creatures ?
must we not suppose somewhere in the universe a slight treachery and derision ?
are we not engaged to a serious resentment of this use that is made of us ?
are we tickled trout , and fools of nature ?
one look at the face of heaven and earth lays all <unk> at rest , and soothes us to wiser convictions .
to the intelligent , nature converts itself into a vast promise , and <name> not be rashly explained .
her secret is untold .
many and many an <unk> arrives ; he has the whole mystery teeming in his <name> .
alas !
the same sorcery has spoiled his skill ; no syllable can he shape on his lips .
her mighty orbit vaults like the fresh rainbow into the deep , but no archangel 's wing was yet strong enough to follow it and report of the return of the curve .
but it also appears that our actions are seconded and disposed to greater conclusions than we designed .
we are escorted on every hand through life by spiritual agents , and a beneficent purpose lies in wait for us .
we can not <unk> words with nature , or deal with her as we deal with persons .
if we measure our individual forces against hers we may easily feel as if we were the sport of an insuperable <name> .
but if , instead of identifying ourselves with the work , we feel that the soul of the workman streams through us , we shall find the peace of the morning dwelling first in our hearts , and the <unk> powers of gravity and chemistry , and , over them , of life , <unk> within us in their highest form .
the uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness in the chain of causes occasions us , results from looking too much at one condition of nature , namely , motion .
but the drag is never taken from the wheel .
wherever the impulse exceeds , the rest or identity <unk> its compensation .
all over the wide fields of earth grows the <unk> or <unk> .
after every foolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of its hours ; and though we are always engaged with particulars , and often <unk> to them , we bring with us to every experiment the innate universal laws .
these , while they exist in the mind as ideas , stand around us in nature forever embodied , a present sanity to expose and cure the insanity of men .
our <unk> to particulars betrays into a hundred foolish expectations .
we anticipate a new <name> from the invention of a locomotive , or a balloon ; the new engine brings with it the old checks .
they say that by <unk> your salad shall be grown from the seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner ; it is a symbol of our modern aims and endeavors , of our condensation and <unk> of objects ;  but nothing is gained ; nature can not be cheated ; man 's life is but seventy <unk> long , grow they swift or grow they slow .
in these checks and impossibilities however we find our advantage , not less than in the impulses .
let the victory fall where it <name> , we are on that side .
and the knowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being , from the centre to the poles of nature , and have some stake in every possibility , lends that sublime lustre to death , which philosophy and religion have too outwardly and literally striven to express in the popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul .
the reality is more excellent than the report .
here is no ruin , no <unk> , no spent ball .
the divine <unk> never rest nor linger .
nature is the incarnation of a thought , and turns to a thought again , as ice becomes water and gas .
the world is mind precipitated , and the volatile essence is forever escaping again into the state of free thought .
hence the virtue and <unk> of the influence on the mind of natural objects , whether inorganic or organized .
man imprisoned , man <unk> , man vegetative , speaks to man <unk> .
that power which does not respect quantity , which makes the whole and the particle its equal channel , delegates its smile to the morning , and <unk> its essence into every drop of rain .
every moment <unk> , and every object : for wisdom is infused into every form .
it has been poured into us as blood ; it convulsed us as pain ; it slid into us as pleasure ; it enveloped us in dull , melancholy days , or in days of cheerful labor ; we did not guess its essence until after a long time .
***** politics .
gold and iron are good to buy iron and gold ; all earth 's fleece and food for their like are sold .
<unk> <name> wise , proved <name> great ,  nor kind nor <unk> buys aught above its rate .
fear , craft , and avarice can not rear a state .
out of dust to build what is more than dust ,  walls <unk> piled <unk> <unk> must .
when the muses nine with the virtues meet , find to their design an atlantic seat , by green orchard boughs <unk> from the heat , where the statesman ploughs furrow for the wheat ; when the church is social worth , when the state-house is the hearth , then the perfect state is come , the republican at home .
vii .
politics .
in dealing with the state we ought to remember that its institution are not aboriginal , though they existed before we were born ; that they are not superior to the citizen ; that every one of them was once the act of a single man ; every law and usage was a man 's expedient to meet a particular case ; that they all are <unk> , all <unk> ; we may make as good , we may make better .
society is an illusion to the young citizen .
it lies before him in rigid repose , with certain names , men and institutions rooted like <unk> to the centre , round which all arrange themselves the best they can .
but the old statesman knows that society is fluid ; there are no such roots and centres , but any particle may suddenly become the centre of the movement and compel the system to <unk> round it ; as every man of strong <name> , like <unk> , or cromwell , does for a time , and every man of truth , like plato or <name> , does forever .
but politics rest on necessary foundations , and can not be treated with levity .
republics abound in young civilians , who believe that the laws make the city , that grave modifications of the policy and modes of living and employments of the population , that commerce , education , and religion , may be voted in or out ; and that any measure , though it were absurd , may be imposed on a people if only you can get sufficient voices to make it a law .
but the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand which <unk> in the twisting ; that the state must follow and not lead the character and progress of the citizen ; the strongest usurper is quickly got rid of ; and they only who build on ideas , build for eternity ; and that the form of government which prevails is the expression of what cultivation exists in the population which permits it .
the law is only a memorandum .
we are superstitious , and esteem the statute somewhat : so much life as it has in the character of living men is its force .
the statute stands there to say , yesterday we agreed so and so , but how feel ye this article to-day ?
our statute is a currency which we stamp with our own portrait : it soon becomes <unk> , and in process of time <name> return to the mint .
nature is not democratic , nor <unk> , but despotic , and <name> not be fooled or abated of any jot of her authority by the <unk> of her sons ; and as fast as the public mind is opened to more intelligence , the code is seen to be brute and stammering .
it speaks not <unk> , and must be made to .
meantime the education of the general mind never stops .
the reveries of the true and simple are prophetic .
what the tender poetic youth dreams , and prays , and paints to-day , but shuns the ridicule of saying aloud , shall presently be the resolutions of public bodies ; then shall be carried as grievance and <name> of rights through conflict and war , and then shall be triumphant law and establishment for a hundred years , until it gives place in turn to new prayers and pictures .
the history of the state sketches in coarse outline the progress of thought , and follows at a distance the delicacy of culture and of aspiration .
the theory of politics which has possessed the mind of men , and which they have expressed the best they could in their laws and in their revolutions , considers persons and property as the two objects for whose protection government exists .
of persons , all have equal rights , in virtue of being identical in nature .
this interest of course with its whole power demands a democracy .
whilst the rights of all as persons are equal , in virtue of their access to reason , their rights in property are very unequal .
one man owns his clothes , and another owns a county .
this accident , depending primarily on the skill and virtue of the parties , of which there is every degree , and secondarily on <unk> , falls unequally , and its rights of course are unequal .
personal rights , universally the same , demand a government framed on the ratio of the census ; property demands a government framed on the ratio of owners and of owning .
<unk> , who has flocks and herds , wishes them looked after by an officer on the frontiers , lest the <unk> shall drive them off ; and pays a tax to that end .
<name> has no flocks or herds and no fear of the <unk> , and pays no tax to the officer .
it seemed fit that <unk> and <name> should have equal rights to elect the officer who is to defend their persons , but that <unk> and not <name> should elect the officer who is to guard the sheep and cattle .
and if question arise whether additional officers or watch-towers should be provided , must not <unk> and <name> , and those who must sell part of their herds to buy protection for the rest , judge better of this , and with more right , than <name> , who , because he is a youth and a traveller , eats their bread and not his own ?
in the earliest society the proprietors made their own wealth , and so long as it comes to the owners in the direct way , no other opinion would arise in any <unk> community than that property should make the law for property , and persons the law for persons .
but property passes through <unk> or inheritance to those who do not create it .
gift , in one case , makes it as really the new owner 's , as labor made it the first owner 's : in the other case , of <unk> , the law makes an ownership which <name> be valid in each man 's view according to the estimate which he sets on the public tranquillity .
it was not however found easy to embody the readily admitted principle that property should make law for property , and persons for persons ; since persons and property mixed themselves in every transaction .
at last it seemed settled that the rightful distinction was that the proprietors should have more elective franchise than <unk> , on the spartan principle of " calling that which is just , equal ; not that which is equal , just . "
that principle no longer looks so self-evident as it appeared in former times , partly , because doubts have arisen whether too much weight had not been allowed in the laws to property , and such a structure given to our usages as allowed the <name> to encroach on the poor , and to keep them poor ; but mainly because there is an instinctive sense , however obscure and yet inarticulate , that the whole constitution of property , on its present <unk> , is injurious , and its influence on persons <unk> and degrading ; that truly the only interest for the consideration of the state is persons ; that property <name> always follow persons ; that the highest end of government is the culture of men ; and if men can be educated , the institutions <name> share their improvement and the moral sentiment <name> write the law of the land .
if it be not easy to settle the <unk> of this question , the peril is less when we take note of our natural defences .
we are kept by better guards than the vigilance of such magistrates as we commonly elect .
society always consists in greatest part of young and foolish persons .
the old , who have seen through the hypocrisy of courts and statesmen , die and leave no wisdom to their sons .
they believe their own newspaper , as their fathers did at their age .
with such an ignorant and <unk> majority , states would soon run to ruin , but that there are limitations beyond which the folly and ambition of governors can not go .
things have their laws , as well as men ; and things refuse to be trifled with .
property <name> be protected .
corn <name> not grow unless it is planted and manured ; but the farmer <name> not plant or hoe it unless the chances are a hundred to one that he <name> cut and harvest it .
under any forms , persons and property must and <name> have their just sway .
they exert their power , as steadily as matter its attraction .
cover up a pound of earth never so cunningly , divide and <unk> it ; melt it to liquid , convert it to gas ; it <name> always weigh a pound ; it <name> always attract and resist other matter by the full virtue of one pound weight :  and the attributes of a person , his wit and his moral energy , <name> exercise , under any law or extinguishing tyranny , their proper force ,  if not <unk> , then covertly ; if not for the law , then against it ; if not <unk> , then <unk> ; with right , or by might .
the boundaries of personal influence it is impossible to fix , as persons are organs of moral or supernatural force .
under the dominion of an idea which possesses the minds of multitudes , as civil freedom , or the religious sentiment , the powers of persons are no longer subjects of calculation .
a nation of men unanimously bent on freedom or conquest can easily confound the arithmetic of <unk> , and achieve extravagant actions , out of all proportion to their means ; as the greeks , the saracens , the swiss , the americans , and the french have done .
in like manner to every particle of property belongs its own attraction .
a cent is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity .
its value is in the necessities of the animal man .
it is so much warmth , so much bread , so much water , so much land .
the law may do what it <name> with the owner of property ; its just power <name> still attach to the cent .
the law may in a mad freak say that all shall have power except the owners of property ; they shall have no vote .
nevertheless , by a higher law , the property <name> , year after year , write every statute that respects property .
the <unk> <name> be the scribe of the proprietor .
what the owners wish to do , the whole power of property <name> do , either through the law or else in defiance of it .
of course i speak of all the property , not merely of the great estates .
when the <name> are <unk> , as frequently happens , it is the joint treasury of the poor which exceeds their accumulations .
every man owns something , if it is only a cow , or a <unk> , or his arms , and so has that property to dispose of .
the same necessity which secures the rights of person and property against the malignity or folly of the magistrate , determines the form and methods of governing , which are proper to each nation and to its habit of thought , and nowise transferable to other states of society .
in this country we are very vain of our political institutions , which are singular in this , that they sprung , within the memory of living men , from the character and condition of the people , which they still express with sufficient fidelity ,  and we ostentatiously prefer them to any other in history .
they are not better , but only <unk> for us .
we may be wise in asserting the advantage in modern times of the democratic form , but to other states of society , in which religion consecrated the monarchical , that and not this was expedient .
democracy is better for us , because the religious sentiment of the present time accords better with it .
born democrats , we are nowise qualified to judge of monarchy , which , to our fathers living in the monarchical idea , was also relatively right .
but our institutions , though in coincidence with the spirit of the age , have not any <unk> from the practical defects which have discredited other forms .
every actual state is corrupt .
good men must not obey the laws too well .
what satire on government can equal the severity of censure conveyed in the word politic , which now for ages has signified cunning , <unk> that the state is a trick ?
the same benign necessity and the same practical abuse appear in the parties , into which each state divides itself , of opponents and defenders of the administration of the government .
parties are also founded on instincts , and have better guides to their own humble aims than the sagacity of their leaders .
they have nothing perverse in their origin , but rudely <name> some real and lasting relation .
we might as wisely <unk> the east wind or the frost , as a political party , whose members , for the most part , could give no account of their position , but stand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves .
our quarrel with them begins when they quit this deep natural ground at the bidding of some leader , and obeying personal considerations , throw themselves into the maintenance and defence of points nowise belonging to their system .
a party is perpetually corrupted by personality .
whilst we <unk> the association from <unk> , we can not extend the same <name> to their leaders .
they reap the rewards of the <unk> and zeal of the masses which they direct .
ordinarily our parties are parties of circumstance , and not of principle ; as the planting interest in conflict with the commercial ; the party of capitalists and that of operatives ; parties which are identical in their moral character , and which can easily change ground with each other in the support of many of their measures .
parties of principle , as , religious sects , or the party of <unk> , of universal suffrage , of abolition of slavery , of abolition of capital punishment ,  degenerate into personalities , or would inspire enthusiasm .
the vice of our leading parties in this country ( which may be cited as a fair specimen of these societies of opinion ) is that they do not plant themselves on the deep and necessary grounds to which they are respectively entitled , but lash themselves to fury in the carrying of some local and momentary measure , nowise useful to the commonwealth .
of the two great parties which at this hour almost share the nation between them , i should say that one has the best cause , and the other contains the best men .
the philosopher , the poet , or the religious man <name> of course wish to cast his vote with the democrat , for <unk> , for wide suffrage , for the abolition of legal cruelties in the penal code , and for <unk> in every manner the access of the young and the poor to the sources of wealth and power .
but he can rarely accept the persons whom the so-called popular party propose to him as representatives of these <unk> .
they have not at heart the ends which give to the name of democracy what <name> and virtue are in it .
the spirit of our american <unk> is destructive and aimless : it is not loving ; it has no ulterior and divine ends , but is destructive only out of hatred and selfishness .
on the other side , the conservative party , composed of the most moderate , able , and cultivated part of the population , is timid , and merely defensive of property .
it <unk> no right , it <unk> to no real good , it brands no crime , it proposes no generous policy ; it does not build , nor write , nor <name> the arts , nor <name> religion , nor establish schools , nor encourage science , nor <unk> the slave , nor befriend the poor , or the indian , or the <unk> .
from neither party , when in power , has the world any benefit to expect in science , <name> , or humanity , at all commensurate with the resources of the nation .
i do not for these defects despair of our republic .
we are not at the <name> of any waves of chance .
in the strife of ferocious parties , human nature always finds itself cherished ; as the children of the convicts at botany bay are found to have as healthy a moral sentiment as other children .
citizens of feudal states are alarmed at our democratic institutions <unk> into anarchy , and the older and more cautious among ourselves are learning from europeans to look with some terror at our turbulent freedom .
it is said that in our license of <unk> the constitution , and in the despotism of public opinion , we have no anchor ; and one foreign observer thinks he has found the safeguard in the sanctity of marriage among us ; and another thinks he has found it in our <unk> .
fisher <unk> expressed the popular security more wisely , when he compared a monarchy and a republic , saying that a monarchy is a merchantman , which sails well , but <name> sometimes strike on a rock and go to the bottom ; whilst a republic is a raft , which would never sink , but then your feet are always in water .
no forms can have any dangerous importance whilst we are befriended by the laws of things .
it makes no difference how many tons weight of atmosphere presses on our heads , so long as the same pressure <unk> it within the lungs .
<unk> the mass a thousand fold , it can not begin to crush us , as long as reaction is equal to action .
the fact of two poles , of two forces , centripetal and centrifugal , is universal , and each force by its own activity develops the other .
wild <name> develops iron conscience .
want of <name> , by strengthening law and decorum , <unk> conscience .
<unk> prevails only where there is greater hardihood and <unk> in the leaders .
a mob can not be a permanency ; everybody 's interest requires that it should not exist , and only justice satisfies all .
we must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity which shines through all laws .
human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues , or songs , or railroads ; and an abstract of the codes of nations would be a <unk> of the common conscience .
governments have their origin in the moral identity of men .
reason for one is seen to be reason for another , and for every other .
there is a middle measure which satisfies all parties , be they never so many or so resolute for their own .
every man finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds in decisions of his own mind , which he calls truth and holiness .
in these decisions all the citizens find a perfect agreement , and only in these ; not in what is good to eat , good to wear , good use of time , or what amount of land or of public aid , each is entitled to claim .
this truth and justice men presently endeavor to make application of to the measuring of land , the <unk> of service , the protection of life and property .
their first endeavors , no doubt , are very awkward .
yet absolute right is the first governor ; or , every government is an impure <unk> .
the idea after which each community is aiming to make and mend its law , is the <name> of the wise man .
the wise man it can not find in nature , and it makes awkward but <name> efforts to secure his government by contrivance ; as by causing the entire people to give their voices on every measure ; or by a double choice to get the representation of the whole ; or , by a selection of the best citizens ; or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal peace by confiding the government to one , who may himself select his agents .
all forms of government <unk> an immortal government , common to all <unk> and independent of <name> , perfect where two men exist , perfect where there is only one man .
every man 's nature is a sufficient advertisement to him of the character of his fellows .
my right and my wrong is their right and their wrong .
whilst i do what is fit for me , and abstain from what is unfit , my neighbor and i shall often agree in our means , and work together for a time to one end .
but whenever i find my dominion over myself not sufficient for me , and undertake the direction of him also , i <unk> the truth , and come into false relations to him .
i may have so much more skill or strength than he that he can not express adequately his sense of wrong , but it is a lie , and hurts like a lie both him and me .
love and nature can not maintain the assumption ; it must be executed by a practical lie , namely by force .
this undertaking for another is the blunder which stands in colossal ugliness in the governments of the world .
it is the same thing in <name> , as in a pair , only not quite so intelligible .
i can see well enough a great difference between my setting myself down to a self-control , and my going to make somebody else act after my views ; but when a quarter of the human race assume to tell me what i must do , i may be too much disturbed by the circumstances to see so clearly the absurdity of their command .
therefore all public ends look vague and quixotic beside private ones .
for any laws but those which men make for themselves , are laughable .
if i put myself in the place of my child , and we stand in one thought and see that things are thus or thus , that perception is law for him and me .
we are both there , both act .
but if , without carrying him into the thought , i look over into his plot , and , guessing how it is with him , <unk> this or that , he <name> never obey me .
this is the history of governments ,  one man does something which is to bind another .
a man who can not be acquainted with me , taxes me ; looking from afar at me <unk> that a part of my labor shall go to this or that whimsical end ,  not as i , but as he happens to fancy .
behold the consequence .
of all debts men are least willing to pay the taxes .
what a satire is this on government !
everywhere they think they get their money 's worth , except for these .
hence the less government we have the better ,  the fewer laws , and the less confided power .
the <unk> to this abuse of formal government is the influence of private character , the growth of the individual ; the appearance of the principal to supersede the proxy ; the appearance of the wise man ; of whom the existing government is , it must be owned , but a shabby imitation .
that which all things tend to <unk> ; which freedom , cultivation , intercourse , revolutions , go to form and deliver , is character ; that is the end of nature , to reach unto this coronation of her king .
to educate the wise man the state exists , and with the appearance of the wise man the state <unk> .
the appearance of character makes the state unnecessary .
the wise man is the state .
he needs no army , fort , or navy ,  he loves men too well ; no bribe , or feast , or palace , to draw friends to him ; no vantage ground , no favorable circumstance .
he needs no library , for he has not done thinking ; no church , for he is a prophet ; no statute book , for he has the <unk> ; no money , for he is value ; no road , for he is at home where he is ; no experience , for the life of the creator shoots through him , and looks from his eyes .
he has no personal friends , for he who has the spell to draw the prayer and piety of all men unto him needs not husband and educate a few to share with him a select and poetic life .
his relation to men is <name> ; his memory is <unk> to them ; his presence , <unk> and flowers .
we think our civilization near its meridian , but we are yet only at the <unk> and the morning <name> .
in our barbarous society the influence of character is in its infancy .
as a political power , as the rightful lord who is to tumble all rulers from their chairs , its presence is hardly yet suspected .
malthus and <name> quite omit it ; the annual register is silent ; in the conversations ' <unk> it is not set down ; the president 's message , the <name> 's speech , have not mentioned it ; and yet it is never nothing .
every thought which genius and piety throw into the world , alters the world .
the gladiators in the lists of power feel , through all their frocks of force and <unk> , the presence of worth .
i think the very strife of trade and ambition are confession of this divinity ; and successes in those fields are the poor amends , the <unk> with which the shamed soul attempts to hide its nakedness .
i find the like unwilling homage in all quarters .
it is because we know how much is due from us that we are impatient to show some petty talent as a substitute for worth .
we are haunted by a conscience of this right to grandeur of character , and are false to it .
but each of us has some talent , can do somewhat useful , or graceful , or formidable , or amusing , or lucrative .
that we do , as an apology to others and to ourselves for not reaching the <name> of a good and equal life .
but it does not satisfy us , whilst we thrust it on the notice of our companions .
it may throw dust in their eyes , but does not smooth our own brow , or give us the tranquillity of the strong when we walk abroad .
we do penance as we go .
our talent is a sort of <unk> , and we are constrained to reflect on our splendid moment with a certain humiliation , as somewhat too fine , and not as one act of many acts , a fair expression of our permanent energy .
most persons of ability meet in society with a kind of tacit appeal .
each seems to say , 'i am not all here . '
senators and presidents have climbed so high with pain enough , not because they think the place specially agreeable , but as an apology for real worth , and to vindicate their manhood in our eyes .
this conspicuous chair is their compensation to themselves for being of a poor , cold , hard nature .
they must do what they can .
like one class of forest animals , they have nothing but a prehensile tail ; climb they must , or crawl .
if a man found himself so <unk> that he could enter into strict relations with the best persons and make life serene around him by the dignity and sweetness of his behavior , could he afford to circumvent the favor of the caucus and the press , and <unk> relations so hollow and pompous as those of a politician ?
surely nobody would be a <unk> who could afford to be sincere .
the tendencies of the times favor the idea of self-government , and leave the individual , for all code , to the rewards and penalties of his own constitution ; which work with more energy than we believe whilst we depend on artificial restraints .
the movement in this direction has been very marked in modern history .
much has been blind and discreditable , but the nature of the revolution is not affected by the vices of the <unk> ; for this is a purely moral force .
it was never adopted by any party in history , neither can be .
it separates the individual from all party , and unites him at the same time to the race .
it promises a recognition of higher rights than those of personal freedom , or the security of property .
a man has a right to be employed , to be trusted , to be loved , to be revered .
the power of love , as the basis of a state , has never been tried .
we must not imagine that all things are <unk> into confusion if every tender protestant be not compelled to bear his part in certain social conventions ; nor doubt that roads can be built , letters carried , and the fruit of labor secured , when the government of force is at an end .
are our methods now so excellent that all competition is hopeless ?
could not a nation of friends even devise better ways ?
on the other hand , let not the most conservative and timid fear anything from a premature surrender of the bayonet and the system of force .
for , according to the order of nature , which is quite superior to our <name> , it stands thus ; there <name> always be a government of force where men are selfish ; and when they are pure enough to <unk> the code of force they <name> be wise enough to see how these public ends of the post-office , of the highway , of commerce and the exchange of property , of museums and libraries , of institutions of <name> and science can be answered .
we live in a very low state of the world , and pay unwilling tribute to governments founded on force .
there is not , among the most religious and instructed men of the most religious and civil nations , a reliance on the moral sentiment and a sufficient belief in the unity of things , to persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial restraints , as well as the solar system ; or that the private citizen might be reasonable and a good neighbor , without the hint of a jail or a <unk> .
what is strange too , there never was in any man sufficient <name> in the power of <unk> to inspire him with the broad design of <unk> the state on the principle of right and love .
all those who have pretended this design have been partial reformers , and have admitted in some manner the supremacy of the bad state .
i do not call to mind a single human being who has steadily denied the authority of the laws , on the simple ground of his own moral nature .
such designs , full of genius and full of fate as they are , are not entertained except <unk> as <unk> .
if the individual who exhibits them dare to think them practicable , he <unk> scholars and <unk> ; and men of talent and women of superior sentiments can not hide their contempt .
not the less does nature continue to fill the heart of youth with suggestions of this enthusiasm , and there are now men ,  if indeed i can speak in the plural number ,  more exactly , i <name> say , i have just been conversing with one man , to whom no weight of adverse experience <name> make it for a moment appear impossible that thousands of human beings might exercise towards each other the grandest and simplest sentiments , as well as a knot of friends , or a pair of lovers .
***** <unk> and <unk> .
in countless <unk> waves the <unk> <unk> strives : in thousand <unk> grafts the parent fruit <unk> ; so , in the new-born millions , the perfect <name> lives .
not less are <unk> dear to every child they wake , and each with novel life his sphere fills for his proper sake .
viii .
<unk> and <unk> .
i can not often enough say that a man is only a relative and representative nature .
each is a hint of the truth , but far enough from being that truth which yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests to us .
if i seek it in him i shall not find it .
could any man conduct into me the pure stream of that which he pretends to be !
long afterwards i find that quality elsewhere which he promised me .
the genius of the <unk> is intoxicating to the student , yet how few particulars of it can i detach from all their books .
the man momentarily stands for the thought , but <name> not bear examination ; and a society of men <name> <unk> represent well enough a certain quality and culture , for example , chivalry or beauty of manners ; but separate them and there is no gentleman and no <name> in the group .
the least hint sets us on the pursuit of a character which no man realizes .
we have such exorbitant eyes that on seeing the smallest arc we complete the curve , and when the curtain is lifted from the diagram which it seemed to veil , we are vexed to find that no more was drawn than just that fragment of an arc which we first beheld .
we are greatly too liberal in our construction of each other 's faculty and promise .
exactly what the parties have already done they shall do again ; but that which we inferred from their nature and <unk> , they <name> not do .
that is in nature , but not in them .
that happens in the world , which we often witness in a public debate .
each of the speakers expresses himself imperfectly ; no one of them hears much that another says , such is the <unk> of mind of each ; and the audience , who have only to hear and not to speak , judge very wisely and <unk> how <unk> and <unk> is each of the <unk> to his own affair .
great men or men of great gifts you shall easily find , but symmetrical men never .
when i meet a pure intellectual force or a generosity of affection , i believe here then is man ; and am presently mortified by the discovery that this individual is no more available to his own or to the general ends than his companions ; because the power which <name> my respect is not supported by the total <unk> of his talents .
all persons exist to society by some shining trait of beauty or utility which they have .
we borrow the proportions of the man from that one fine feature , and finish the portrait symmetrically ; which is false , for the rest of his body is small or deformed .
i observe a person who makes a good public appearance , and conclude thence the perfection of his private character , on which this is based ; but he has no private character .
he is a graceful cloak or <unk> for holidays .
all our poets , heroes , and saints , fail utterly in some one or in many parts to satisfy our idea , fail to draw our spontaneous interest , and so leave us without any <name> of realization but in our own future .
our exaggeration of all fine characters arises from the fact that we identify each in turn with the soul .
but there are no such men as we fable ; no <name> , nor pericles , nor caesar , nor <name> , nor washington , such as we have made .
we <unk> a great deal of nonsense because it was allowed by great men .
there is none without his <unk> .
i verily believe if an <name> should come to chant the chorus of the moral law , he would eat too much gingerbread , or take liberties with private letters , or do some precious atrocity .
it is bad enough that our geniuses can not do anything useful , but it is worse that no man is fit for society who has fine traits .
he is admired at a distance , but he can not come near without appearing a cripple .
the men of fine parts protect themselves by solitude , or by courtesy , or by satire , or by an acid worldly manner , each concealing as he best can his incapacity for useful association , but they want either love or self-reliance .
our native love of reality joins with this experience to teach us a little reserve , and to dissuade a too sudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons .
young people admire talents or particular excellences ; as we grow older we value total powers and effects , as the impression , the quality , the spirit of men and things .
the genius is all .
the man ,  it is his system : we do not try a solitary word or act , but his habit .
the acts which you praise , i praise not , since they are departures from his <name> , and are mere <unk> .
the magnetism which arranges tribes and races in one polarity is alone to be respected ; the men are <unk> .
yet we unjustly select a particle , and say , 'o <unk> number one !
what <unk> i feel to thee !
what prodigious virtues are these of thine !
how constitutional to thee , and <unk> . '
whilst we speak the <unk> is withdrawn ; down falls our filing in a heap with the rest , and we continue our <unk> to the wretched shaving .
let us go for <unk> ; for the magnetism , not for the needles .
human life and its persons are poor <unk> pretensions .
a personal influence is an <unk> <unk> .
if they say it is great , it is great ; if they say it is small , it is small ; you see it , and you see it not , by turns ; it <unk> all its size from the momentary estimation of the speakers : the <unk> vanishes if you go too near , vanishes if you go too far , and only blazes at one <name> .
who can tell if washington be a great man or no ?
who can tell if <name> be ?
yes , or any but the twelve , or six , or three great gods of fame ?
and they too loom and fade before the eternal .
we are <unk> creatures , <unk> for two elements , having two sets of faculties , the particular and the catholic .
we adjust our instrument for general observation , and sweep the heavens as easily as we pick out a single figure in the terrestrial landscape .
we are practically skilful in detecting elements for which we have no place in our theory , and no name .
thus we are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men and in bodies of men , not accounted for in an arithmetical addition of all their <unk> properties .
there is a genius of a nation , which is not to be found in the numerical citizens , but which <unk> the society .
england , strong , punctual , practical , <unk> england i should not find if i should go to the island to seek it .
in the parliament , in the <unk> , at <unk> , i might see a great number of <name> , ignorant , <unk> , conventional , proud men ,  many old women ,  and not anywhere the englishman who made the good speeches , combined the accurate engines , and did the bold and nervous deeds .
it is even worse in <name> , where , from the intellectual quickness of the race , the genius of the country is more splendid in its promise and more slight in its performance .
webster can not do the work of webster .
we conceive distinctly enough the french , the spanish , the <name> genius , and it is not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in either of those nations a single individual who corresponded with the type .
we infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language , which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone .
and , universally , a good example of this social force is the veracity of language , which can not be <unk> .
in any controversy concerning morals , an appeal may be made with safety to the sentiments which the language of the people expresses .
proverbs , words , and <unk> convey the public sense with more purity and precision than the wisest individual .
in the famous dispute with the <unk> , the <unk> had a good deal of reason .
general ideas are <unk> .
they are our gods : they round and <unk> the most partial and sordid way of living .
our <unk> to details can not quite degrade our life and divest it of poetry .
the <unk> is reckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale , yet he is saturated with the laws of the world .
his measures are the hours ; morning and night , <unk> and <unk> , geometry , astronomy and all the lovely accidents of nature play through his mind .
money , which represents the prose of life , and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology , is , in its effects and laws , as beautiful as roses .
property keeps the accounts of the world , and is always moral .
the property <name> be found where the labor , the wisdom , and the virtue have been in nations , in classes , and ( the whole <unk> considered , with the compensations ) in the individual also .
how wise the world appears , when the laws and usages of nations are largely detailed , and the completeness of the municipal system is considered !
nothing is left out .
if you go into the markets and the <unk> , the <unk> ' and <unk> ' offices , the offices of sealers of weights and measures , of inspection of provisions ,  it <name> appear as if one man had made it all .
wherever you go , a wit like your own has been before you , and has realized its thought .
the <unk> mysteries , the egyptian architecture , the indian astronomy , the greek sculpture , show that there always were seeing and knowing men in the planet .
the world is full of <unk> ties , of <unk> , of secret and public legions of honor ; that of scholars , for example ; and that of gentlemen , <unk> with the upper class of every country and every culture .
i am very much struck in literature by the appearance that one person wrote all the books ; as if the editor of a journal planted his body of reporters in different parts of the field of action , and relieved some by others from time to time ; but there is such equality and identity both of judgment and point of view in the narrative that it is plainly the work of one <unk> , <unk> gentleman .
i looked into <unk> <unk> yesterday : it is as correct and elegant after our canon of to-day as if it were newly written .
the <unk> of all good books seems to give me an existence as wide as man .
what is well done i feel as if i did ; what is ill done i <unk> not of .
shakspeare 's passages of passion ( for example , in lear and hamlet ) are in the very dialect of the present year .
i am faithful again to the whole over the members in my use of books .
i find the most pleasure in reading a book in a manner least flattering to the author .
i read <unk> , and sometimes plato , as i might read a dictionary , for a mechanical help to the fancy and the imagination .
i read for the <unk> , as if one should use a fine picture in a <unk> experiment , for its <name> colors .
't is not <unk> , but a piece of nature and fate that i explore .
it is a greater <name> to see the author 's author , than himself .
a higher pleasure of the same kind i found lately at a concert , where i went to hear <unk> 's <unk> .
as the master overpowered the littleness and <unk> of the performers and made them conductors of his electricity , so it was easy to observe what efforts nature was making , through so many hoarse , wooden , and imperfect persons , to produce beautiful voices , fluid and <unk> men and women .
the genius of nature was paramount at the <unk> .
this preference of the genius to the parts is the secret of that <unk> of <name> , which is found in all superior minds .
<name> , in the artist , is proportion , or a habitual respect to the whole by an eye loving beauty in details .
and the wonder and charm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes .
proportion is almost impossible to human beings .
there is no one who does not exaggerate .
in conversation , men are encumbered with personality , and talk too much .
in modern sculpture , picture , and poetry , the beauty is miscellaneous ; the artist works here and there and at all points , adding and adding , instead of unfolding the unit of his thought .
beautiful details we must have , or no artist ; but they must be means and never other .
the eye must not lose sight for a moment of the purpose .
lively boys write to their ear and eye , and the cool reader finds nothing but sweet <unk> in it .
when they grow older , they respect the argument .
we obey the same intellectual integrity when we study in exceptions the law of the world .
anomalous facts , as the never quite obsolete rumors of magic and <unk> , and the new <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , are of ideal use .
they are good indications .
<unk> is insignificant as an <name> of healing , but of great value as criticism on the <unk> or medical practice of the time .
so with mesmerism , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> church ; they are poor pretensions enough , but good criticism on the science , philosophy , and preaching of the day .
for these abnormal <unk> of the <unk> ought to be normal , and things of course .
all things show us that on every side we are very near to the best .
it seems not worth while to execute with too much pains some one intellectual , or <unk> , or civil feat , when presently the dream <name> scatter , and we shall burst into universal power .
the reason of idleness and of crime is the <unk> of our hopes .
whilst we are waiting we beguile the time with jokes , with sleep , with eating , and with crimes .
thus we settle it in our cool libraries , that all the agents with which we deal are subalterns , which we can well afford to let pass , and life <name> be simpler when we live at the centre and <unk> the surfaces .
i wish to speak with all respect of persons , but sometimes i must pinch myself to keep awake and preserve the due decorum .
they melt so fast into each other that they are like grass and trees , and it needs an effort to treat them as individuals .
though the <unk> man certainly finds persons a <unk> in household matters , the divine man does not respect them ; he sees them as a rack of clouds , or a fleet of ripples which the wind drives over the surface of the water .
but this is flat rebellion .
nature <name> not be buddhist : she <unk> <unk> , and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million of fresh particulars .
it is all idle talking : as much as a man is a whole , so is he also a part ; and it were partial not to see it .
what you say in your pompous distribution only <unk> you into your class and section .
you have not got rid of parts by denying them , but are the more partial .
you are one thing , but nature is one thing and the other thing , in the same moment .
she <name> not remain <unk> in a thought , but rushes into persons ; and when each person , inflamed to a fury of personality , would conquer all things to his poor <unk> , she raises up against him another person , and by many persons <unk> again a sort of whole .
she <name> have all .
<name> bottom can not play all the parts , work it how he may ; there <name> be somebody else , and the world <name> be round .
everything must have its flower or effort at the beautiful , coarser or finer according to its stuff .
they relieve and recommend each other , and the sanity of society is a balance of a thousand <unk> .
she <unk> <unk> , and <name> only forgive an induction which is rare and casual .
we like to come to a height of land and see the landscape , just as we value a general remark in conversation .
but it is not the intention of nature that we should live by general views .
we fetch fire and water , run about all day among the shops and markets , and get our clothes and shoes made and mended , and are the victims of these details ; and once in a fortnight we arrive perhaps at a rational moment .
if we were not thus infatuated , if we saw the real from hour to hour , we should not be here to write and to read , but should have been burned or frozen long ago .
she would never get anything done , if she suffered admirable <unk> and universal geniuses .
she loves better a wheelwright who dreams all night of wheels , and a groom who is part of his horse ; for she is full of work , and these are her hands .
as the frugal farmer takes care that his cattle shall eat down the <unk> , and swine shall eat the waste of his house , and poultry shall pick the crumbs ,  so our economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit of mind into every district and condition of existence , plants an eye wherever a new <name> of light can fall , and gathering up into some man every property in the universe , establishes <unk> occult mutual attractions among her offspring , that all this wash and waste of power may be imparted and exchanged .
great dangers undoubtedly <unk> from this incarnation and distribution of the <unk> , and hence nature has her <unk> , as if she were <unk> ; and <name> of <unk> fancied he could have given useful advice .
but she does not go <unk> ; she has <unk> at the bottom of the cup .
solitude would ripen a plentiful crop of despots .
the <unk> thinks of men as having his manner , or as not having his manner ; and as having degrees of it , more and less .
but when he comes into a public assembly he sees that men have very different manners from his own , and in their way admirable .
in his childhood and youth he has had many checks and <unk> , and thinks modestly enough of his own endowment .
when afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious circumstance , it seems the only talent ; he is delighted with his success , and accounts himself already the fellow of the great .
but he goes into a mob , into a banking house , into a mechanic 's shop , into a mill , into a laboratory , into a ship , into a camp , and in each new place he is no better than an idiot ; other talents take place , and rule the hour .
the rotation which whirls every leaf and pebble to the meridian , reaches to every gift of man , and we all take turns at the top .
for nature , who <unk> <unk> , has set her heart on breaking up all styles and tricks , and it is so much easier to do what one has done before than to do a new thing , that there is a perpetual tendency to a set mode .
in every conversation , even the highest , there is a certain trick , which may be soon learned by an acute person and then that particular style continued indefinitely .
each man too is a tyrant in tendency , because he would impose his idea on others ; and their trick is their natural defence .
<name> would absorb the race ; but <name> paine or the <unk> <unk> helps humanity by resisting this exuberance of power .
hence the immense benefit of party in politics , as it reveals faults of character in a chief , which the intellectual force of the persons , with ordinary opportunity and not hurled into <unk> by hatred , could not have seen .
since we are all so stupid , what benefit that there should be two <unk> !
it is like that brute advantage so essential to astronomy , of having the diameter of the earth 's orbit for a base of its triangles .
democracy is morose , and runs to anarchy , but in the state and in the schools it is indispensable to resist the consolidation of all men into a few men .
if <name> was perfect , why are you and i alive ?
as long as any man exists , there is some need of him ; let him fight for his own .
a new poet has appeared ; a new character approached us ; why should we refuse to eat bread until we have found his regiment and section in our old <unk> ?
why not a new man ?
here is a new enterprise of <name> farm , of <unk> , of <unk> : why so impatient to <unk> them <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or by any known and <unk> name ?
let it be a new way of living .
why have only two or three ways of life , and not thousands ?
every man is wanted , and no man is wanted much .
we came this time for <unk> , not for corn .
we want the great genius only for <name> ; for one <name> more in our constellation , for one tree more in our grove .
but he thinks we wish to belong to him , as he wishes to occupy us .
he greatly mistakes us .
i think i have done well if i have acquired a new word from a good author ; and my business with him is to find my own , though it were only to melt him down into an epithet or an image for daily use :  " into paint <name> i grind thee , my bride ! "
to <unk> the confusion , and make it impossible to arrive at any general statement ,  when we have insisted on the imperfection of individuals , our affections and our experience urge that every individual is entitled to honor , and a very generous treatment is sure to be repaid .
a <unk> sees only two or three persons , and allows them all their room ; they spread themselves at large .
the statesman looks at many , and compares the few habitually with others , and these look less .
yet are they not entitled to this generosity of reception ?
and is not <unk> the means of insight ?
for though <unk> say that the cards beat all the players , though they were never so skilful , yet in the contest we are now considering , the players are also the game , and share the power of the cards .
if you criticise a fine genius , the odds are that you are out of your reckoning , and instead of the poet , are <unk> your own caricature of him .
for there is somewhat <unk> and infinite in every man , especially in every genius , which , if you can come very near him , sports with all your limitations .
for rightly every man is a channel through which heaven <unk> , and whilst i fancied i was <unk> him , i was <unk> or rather terminating my own soul .
after <unk> goethe as a courtier , artificial , <unk> , worldly ,  i took up this book of <name> , and found him an indian of the wilderness , a piece of pure nature like an apple or an oak , large as morning or night , and virtuous as a <unk> .
but care is taken that the whole tune shall be played .
if we were not kept among surfaces , every thing would be large and universal ; now the excluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they have been excluded .
" your turn now , my turn next , " is the rule of the game .
the universality being hindered in its primary form , comes in the secondary form of all sides ; the points come in succession to the meridian , and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed .
nature keeps herself whole and her representation complete in the experience of each mind .
she suffers no seat to be vacant in her college .
it is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die but only retire a little from sight and afterwards return again .
whatever does not concern us is concealed from us .
as soon as a person is no longer related to our present well-being , he is concealed , or dies , as we say .
really , all things and persons are related to us , but according to our nature they act on us not at once but in succession , and we are made aware of their presence one at a time .
all persons , all things which we have known , are here present , and many more than we see ; the world is full .
as the ancient said , the world is a <unk> or solid ; and if we saw all things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to move .
for though nothing is impassable to the soul , but all things are <unk> to it and like highways , yet this is only whilst the soul does not see them .
as soon as the soul sees any object , it stops before that object .
therefore , the divine providence which keeps the universe open in every direction to the soul , <unk> all the furniture and all the persons that do not concern a particular soul , from the senses of that individual .
through <unk> eternal things the man finds his road as if they did not subsist , and does not once suspect their being .
as soon as he needs a new object , suddenly he beholds it , and no longer attempts to pass through it , but takes another way .
when he has exhausted for the time the nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing , that object is withdrawn from his observation , and though still in his immediate neighborhood , he does not suspect its presence .
nothing is dead : men feign themselves dead , and endure mock funerals and mournful <unk> , and there they stand looking out of the window , sound and well , in some new and strange disguise .
<name> is not dead ; he is very well alive : nor <name> , nor <name> , nor mahomet , nor aristotle ; at times we believe we have seen them all , and could easily tell the names under which they go .
if we can not make voluntary and conscious steps in the admirable science of <unk> , let us see the parts wisely , and infer the genius of nature from the best particulars with a becoming <name> .
what is best in each kind is an index of what should be the average of that thing .
love shows me the opulence of nature , by disclosing to me in my friend a hidden wealth , and i infer an equal depth of good in every other direction .
it is commonly said by farmers that a good pear or apple costs no more time or pains to rear than a poor one ; so i would have no work of <name> , no speech , or action , or thought , or friend , but the best .
the end and the means , the <unk> and the game ,  life is made up of the <unk> and reaction of these two amicable powers , whose marriage appears beforehand monstrous , as each denies and tends to abolish the other .
we must reconcile the contradictions as we can , but their discord and their concord introduce wild absurdities into our thinking and speech .
no sentence <name> hold the whole truth , and the only way in which we can be just , is by giving ourselves the lie ; speech is better than silence ; silence is better than speech ;  all things are in contact ; every atom has a sphere of repulsion ;  things are , and are not , at the same time ;  and the like .
all the universe over , there is but one thing , this old <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , of which any proposition may be affirmed or denied .
very <unk> therefore i assert that every man is a <unk> , that nature secures him as an instrument by <unk> , preventing the tendencies to religion and science ; and now further assert , that , each man 's genius being nearly and affectionately explored , he is justified in his individuality , as his nature is found to be immense ; and now i add that every man is a <unk> also , and , as our earth , whilst it spins on its own axis , spins all the time around the sun through the celestial spaces , so the least of its rational children , the most dedicated to his private affair , works out , though as it were under a disguise , the universal problem .
we fancy men are individuals ; so are pumpkins ; but every pumpkin in the field goes through every point of pumpkin history .
the rabid democrat , as soon as he is senator and <name> man , has ripened beyond possibility of sincere <unk> , and unless he can resist the sun , he must be conservative the remainder of his days .
lord <name> said in his old age that " if he were to begin life again , he would be damned but he would begin as <unk> . "
we hide this universality if we can , but it appears at all points .
we are as ungrateful as children .
there is nothing we <name> and strive to draw to us but in some hour we turn and rend it .
we keep a running fire of sarcasm at ignorance and the life of the senses ; then goes by , perchance , a fair girl , a piece of life , <name> and happy , and making the commonest offices beautiful by the energy and heart with which she does them ; and seeing this we admire and love her and them , and say , <unk> !
a genuine creature of the fair earth , not dissipated or too early ripened by books , philosophy , religion , society , or care ! '
insinuating a treachery and contempt for all we had so long loved and wrought in ourselves and others .
if we could have any security against moods !
if the profoundest prophet could be holden to his words , and the hearer who is ready to sell all and join the crusade could have any certificate that tomorrow his prophet shall not <unk> his testimony !
but the truth sits veiled there on the bench , and never <unk> an <unk> syllable ; and the most sincere and revolutionary doctrine , put as if the ark of god were carried forward some <unk> , and planted there for the succor of the world , shall in a few weeks be coldly set aside by the same speaker , as morbid ; " i thought i was right , but i was not , "  and the same immeasurable credulity demanded for new <unk> .
if we were not of all opinions !
if we did not in any moment shift the platform on which we stand , and look and speak from another !
if there could be any regulation , any <unk> , ' that a man should never leave his point of view without sound of trumpet .
i am always <unk> , as always knowing there are other moods .
how sincere and confidential we can be , saying all that lies in the mind , and yet go away feeling that all is yet <unk> , from the incapacity of the parties to know each other , although they use the same words !
my companion assumes to know my mood and habit of thought , and we go on from explanation to explanation until all is said which words can , and we leave matters just as they were at first , because of that vicious assumption .
is it that every man believes every other to be an incurable <unk> , and himself a <unk> ?
i talked yesterday with a pair of philosophers ; i endeavored to show my good men that i love everything by turns and nothing long ; that i loved the centre , but <unk> on the <unk> ; that i loved man , if men seemed to me mice and rats ; that i revered saints , but woke up glad that the old pagan world stood its ground and died hard ; that i was glad of men of every gift and nobility , but would not live in their arms .
could they but once understand that i loved to know that they existed , and heartily wished them <unk> , yet , out of my poverty of life and thought , had no word or welcome for them when they came to see me , and could well consent to their living in oregon , for any claim i felt on them ,  it would be a great satisfaction .
***** new england reformers .
in the suburb , in the town , on the railway , in the square , came a beam of goodness down doubling daylight everywhere : peace now each for malice takes , beauty for his sinful weeks , for the <name> <name> aye makes him an <name> whom she leads .
new england reformers .
a lecture read before the society in <unk> hall , on <name> , march 3 , 1844 .
whoever has had opportunity of acquaintance with society in new england during the last twenty-five years , with those middle and with those leading sections that may constitute any just representation of the character and aim of the community , <name> have been struck with the great activity of thought and experimenting .
his attention must be commanded by the signs that the church , or religious party , is falling from the church nominal , and is appearing in temperance and <unk> societies ; in movements of <unk> and of socialists ; and in very significant assemblies called sabbath and bible conventions ; composed of <unk> , of seekers , of all the soul of the soldiery of dissent , and meeting to call in question the authority of the sabbath , of the <unk> , and of the church .
in these movements nothing was more remarkable than the discontent they <unk> in the <unk> .
the spirit of protest and of detachment drove the members of these conventions to bear testimony against the church , and immediately afterward , to declare their discontent with these conventions , their independence of their <unk> , and their impatience of the methods whereby they were working .
they defied each other , like a congress of kings , each of whom had a realm to rule , and a way of his own that made concert unprofitable .
what a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world !
one apostle thought all men should go to farming , and another that no man should buy or sell , that the use of money was the cardinal evil ; another that the mischief was in our diet , that we eat and drink damnation .
these made <unk> bread , and were foes to the death to <unk> .
it was in vain urged by the housewife that god made <unk> , as well as dough , and loves <unk> just as dearly as he loves vegetation ; that <unk> develops the <unk> element in the grain , and makes it more <unk> and more <unk> .
no ; they wish the pure wheat , and <name> die but it shall not ferment .
stop , dear nature , these incessant advances of thine ; let us scotch these <unk> wheels !
others attacked the system of agriculture , the use of animal <unk> in farming , and the tyranny of man over brute nature ; these abuses polluted his food .
the ox must be taken from the plough and the horse from the cart , the hundred acres of the farm must be <unk> , and the man must walk , wherever boats and locomotives <name> not <name> him .
even the insect world was to be defended ,  that had been too long neglected , and a society for the protection of <unk> , slugs , and <unk> was to be incorporated without delay .
with these appeared the <unk> of <unk> , of <unk> , of mesmerism , of <unk> , and their wonderful theories of the <name> miracles !
others assailed particular <unk> , as that of the lawyer , that of the merchant , of the manufacturer , of the clergyman , of the scholar .
others attacked the institution of marriage as the fountain of social evils .
others devoted themselves to the worrying of churches and meetings for public worship ; and the fertile forms of <unk> among the elder puritans seemed to have their match in the plenty of the new harvest of reform .
with this din of opinion and debate there was a keener scrutiny of institutions and domestic life than any we had known ; there was sincere protesting against existing evils , and there were changes of employment dictated by conscience .
no doubt there was plentiful <unk> , and cases of <unk> might occur .
but in each of these movements emerged a good result , a tendency to the adoption of simpler methods , and an assertion of the sufficiency of the private man .
thus it was directly in the spirit and genius of the age , what happened in one instance when a church <unk> and threatened to <unk> one of its members on account of the somewhat hostile part to the church which his conscience led him to take in the <unk> business ; the threatened individual immediately <unk> the church in a public and formal process .
this has been several times repeated : it was excellent when it was done the first time , but of course loses all value when it is copied .
every project in the history of reform , no matter how violent and surprising , is good when it is the dictate of a man 's genius and constitution , but very dull and suspicious when adopted from another .
it is right and beautiful in any man to say , 'i <name> take this coat , or this book , or this measure of corn of yours , '  in whom we see the act to be original , and to flow from the whole spirit and <name> of him ; for then that taking <name> have a giving as free and divine ; but we are very easily disposed to resist the same generosity of speech when we miss originality and truth to character in it .
there was in all the practical activities of new england for the last quarter of a century , a gradual withdrawal of tender consciences from the social organizations .
there is observable throughout , the contest between mechanical and spiritual methods , but with a steady tendency of the thoughtful and virtuous to a deeper belief and reliance on spiritual facts .
in politics for example it is easy to see the progress of dissent .
the country is full of rebellion ; the country is full of kings .
hands off !
let there be no control and no interference in the administration of the affairs of this kingdom of me .
hence the growth of the doctrine and of the party of free trade , and the willingness to try that experiment , in the face of what appear <unk> facts .
i confess , the motto of the globe newspaper is so attractive to me that i can seldom find much appetite to read what is below it in its columns : " the world is governed too much . "
so the country is frequently affording solitary examples of resistance to the government , solitary <unk> , who throw themselves on their reserved rights ; nay , who have reserved all their rights ; who reply to the <unk> and to the clerk of court that they do not know the state , and embarrass the courts of law by <unk> and the commander-in-chief of the militia by <unk> .
the same disposition to scrutiny and dissent appeared in civil , festive , <unk> , and domestic society .
a restless , prying , conscientious criticism broke out in unexpected quarters .
who gave me the money with which i bought my coat ?
why should professional labor and that of the <unk> be paid so <unk> to the labor of the <name> and <unk> ?
this whole business of trade gives me to pause and think , as it constitutes false relations between men ; inasmuch as i am prone to count myself relieved of any responsibility to behave well and nobly to that person whom i pay with money ; whereas if i had not that commodity , i should be put on my good behavior in all companies , and man would be a benefactor to man , as being himself his only certificate that he had a right to those aids and services which each asked of the other .
am i not too protected a person ?
is there not a wide <unk> between the lot of me and the lot of thee , my poor brother , my poor sister ?
am i not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of those gymnastics which <name> labor and the emergencies of poverty constitute ?
i find nothing healthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society ; i do not like the close air of saloons .
i begin to suspect myself to be a prisoner , though treated with all this courtesy and luxury .
i pay a destructive tax in my conformity .
the same insatiable criticism may be traced in the efforts for the reform of education .
the popular education has been taxed with a want of truth and nature .
it was complained that an education to things was not given .
we are students of words : we are shut up in schools , and colleges , and <unk> , for ten or fifteen years , and come out at last with a bag of wind , a memory of words , and do not know a thing .
we can not use our hands , or our legs , or our eyes , or our arms .
we do not know an <unk> root in the woods , we can not tell our course by the stars , nor the hour of the day by the sun .
it is well if we can swim and skate .
we are afraid of a horse , of a cow , of a dog , of a snake , of a spider .
the <name> rule was to teach a boy nothing that he could not learn standing .
the old english rule was , 'all summer in the field , and all <name> in the study . '
and it seems as if a man should learn to plant , or to fish , or to hunt , that he might secure his subsistence at all events , and not be painful to his friends and fellow-men .
the lessons of science should be experimental also .
the sight of the planet through a telescope is worth all the course on astronomy ; the shock of the electric spark in the elbow , <unk> all the theories ; the taste of the <unk> oxide , the firing of an artificial volcano , are better than volumes of chemistry .
one of the traits of the new spirit is the inquisition it fixed on our <unk> devotion to the dead languages .
the ancient languages , with great beauty of structure , contain wonderful remains of genius , which draw , and always <name> draw , certain <unk> men ,  greek men , and <name> men ,  in all countries , to their study ; but by a wonderful drowsiness of usage they had exacted the study of all men .
once ( say two centuries ago ) , latin and greek had a strict relation to all the science and culture there was in europe , and the mathematics had a momentary importance at some <name> of activity in physical science .
these things became <unk> as education , as the manner of men is .
but the good spirit never cared for the colleges , and though all men and boys were now drilled in latin , greek , and mathematics , it had quite left these shells high and dry on the beach , and was now creating and feeding other matters at other ends of the world .
but in a hundred high schools and colleges this warfare against common sense still goes on .
four , or six , or ten years , the pupil is <unk> greek and latin , and as soon as he leaves the university , as it is ludicrously called , he shuts those books for the last time .
some thousands of young men are graduated at our colleges in this country every year , and the persons who , at forty years , still read greek , can all be counted on your hand .
i never met with ten .
four or five persons i have seen who read plato .
but is not this absurd , that the whole liberal talent of this country should be directed in its best years on studies which lead to nothing ?
what was the consequence ?
some intelligent persons said or thought , 'is that greek and latin some spell to <unk> with , and not words of reason ?
if the physician , the lawyer , the divine , never use it to come at their ends , i need never learn it to come at mine .
<unk> is gone out of fashion , and i <name> omit this <unk> , and go straight to affairs . '
so they jumped the greek and latin , and read law , medicine , or sermons , without it .
to the astonishment of all , the self-made men took even ground at once with the oldest of the regular graduates , and in a few months the most conservative circles of boston and new york had quite forgotten who of their <unk> was <unk> , and who was not .
one tendency appears alike in the philosophical speculation and in the rudest <unk> movements , through all the <unk> and all the <unk> , the wish , namely , to cast aside the superfluous and arrive at short methods ; urged , as i suppose , by an intuition that the human spirit is equal to all emergencies , alone , and that man is more often injured than helped by the means he uses .
i conceive this gradual casting off of material aids , and the indication of growing trust in the private <unk> powers of the individual , to be the affirmative principle of the recent philosophy , and that it is feeling its own profound truth and is reaching forward at this very hour to the happiest conclusions .
i readily concede that in this , as in every period of intellectual activity , there has been a noise of denial and protest ; much was to be resisted , much was to be got rid of by those who were reared in the old , before they could begin to affirm and to construct .
many a reformer <unk> in his removal of rubbish ; and that makes the <unk> of the class .
they are partial ; they are not equal to the work they pretend .
they lose their way ; in the assault on the kingdom of darkness they expend all their energy on some accidental evil , and lose their sanity and power of benefit .
it is of little moment that one or two or twenty errors of our social system be corrected , but of much that the man be in his senses .
the criticism and attack on institutions , which we have witnessed , has made one thing plain , that society gains nothing whilst a man , not himself <unk> , attempts to <unk> things around him : he has become tediously good in some particular but negligent or narrow in the rest ; and hypocrisy and vanity are often the disgusting result .
it is handsomer to remain in the establishment better than the establishment , and conduct that in the best manner , than to make a <name> against evil by some single improvement , without supporting it by a total regeneration .
do not be so vain of your one objection .
do you think there is only one ?
alas !
my good friend , there is no part of society or of life better than any other part .
all our things are right and wrong together .
the wave of evil washes all our institutions alike .
do you complain of our marriage ?
our marriage is no worse than our education , our diet , our trade , our social customs .
do you complain of the laws of property ?
it is a <unk> to give such importance to them .
can we not play the game of life with these counters , as well as with those ?
in the institution of property , as well as out of it ?
let into it the new and renewing principle of love , and property <name> be universality .
no one gives the impression of superiority to the institution , which he must give who <name> reform it .
it makes no difference what you say , you must make me feel that you are aloof from it ; by your natural and supernatural advantages do easily see to the end of it ,  do see how man can do without it .
now all men are on one side .
no man deserves to be heard against property .
only love , only an idea , is against property as we hold it .
i can not afford to be irritable and <unk> , nor to waste all my time in attacks .
if i should go out of church whenever i hear a false sentiment i could never stay there five minutes .
but why come out ?
the street is as false as the church , and when i get to my house , or to my manners , or to my speech , i have not got away from the lie .
when we see an eager assailant of one of these wrongs , a special reformer , we feel like asking him , what right have you , sir , to your one virtue ?
is virtue <unk> ?
this is a <name> amidst the rags of a beggar .
in another way the right <name> be <unk> .
in the midst of abuses , in the heart of cities , in the aisles of false churches , alike in one place and in another ,  wherever , namely , a just and heroic soul finds itself , there it <name> do what is next at hand , and by the new quality of character it shall put forth it shall <unk> that old condition , law or school in which it stands , before the law of its own mind .
if partiality was one fault of the movement party , the other defect was their reliance on association .
doubts such as those i have intimated drove many good persons to agitate the questions of social reform .
but the revolt against the spirit of commerce , the spirit of aristocracy , and the inveterate abuses of cities , did not appear possible to individuals ; and to do battle against <name> they armed themselves with <name> , and against concert they relied on new concert .
following or advancing beyond the ideas of st. <name> , of <unk> , and of <name> , three communities have already been formed in massachusetts on kindred plans , and many more in the country at large .
they aim to give every member a share in the <name> labor , to give an equal reward to labor and to talent , and to unite a liberal culture with an education to labor .
the scheme offers , by the <unk> of associated labor and expense , to make every member <name> , on the same amount of property , that , in separate families , would leave every member poor .
these new associations are composed of men and women of superior talents and sentiments ; yet it may easily be questioned whether such a community <name> draw , except in its beginnings , the able and the good ; whether those who have energy <name> not prefer their chance of superiority and power in the world , to the humble <unk> of the association ; whether such a retreat does not promise to become an asylum to those who have tried and failed , rather than a field to the strong ; and whether the members <name> not necessarily be fractions of men , because each finds that he can not enter it , without some compromise .
friendship and association are very fine things , and a grand phalanx of the best of the human race , banded for some catholic object ; yes , excellent ; but remember that no society can ever be so large as one man .
he , in his friendship , in his natural and momentary associations , <unk> or <unk> himself ; but in the hour in which he mortgages himself to two or ten or twenty , he dwarfs himself below the stature of one .
but the men of less <name> could not thus believe , and to such , concert appears the sole specific of strength .
i have failed , and you have failed , but perhaps together we shall not fail .
our housekeeping is not satisfactory to us , but perhaps a phalanx , a community , might be .
many of us have differed in opinion , and we could find no man who could make the truth plain , but possibly a college , or an ecclesiastical council might .
i have not been able either to persuade my brother or to prevail on myself , to disuse the traffic or the <unk> of <name> , but perhaps a pledge of total <unk> might effectually restrain us .
the candidate my party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar , but he <name> be honest in the senate , for we can bring public opinion to bear on him .
thus concert was the specific in all cases .
but concert is neither better nor worse , neither more nor less potent than individual force .
all the men in the world can not make a statue walk and speak , can not make a drop of blood , or a blade of grass , any more than one man can .
but let there be one man , let there be truth in two men , in ten men , then is concert for the first time possible ; because the force which moves the world is a new quality , and can never be furnished by adding whatever quantities of a different kind .
what is the use of the concert of the false and the <unk> ?
there can be no concert in two , where there is no concert in one .
when the individual is not individual , but is <unk> ; when his thoughts look one way and his actions another ; when his <name> is traversed by his habits ; when his <name> , enlightened by reason , is warped by his sense ; when with one hand he rows and with the other backs water , what concert can be ?
i do not wonder at the interest these projects inspire .
the world is awaking to the idea of union , and these experiments show what it is thinking of .
it is and <name> be magic .
men <name> live and communicate , and plough , and reap , and govern , as by added ethereal power , when once they are united ; as in a celebrated experiment , by expiration and respiration exactly together , four persons lift a heavy man from the ground by the little finger only , and without sense of weight .
but this union must be inward , and not one of <unk> , and is to be reached by a reverse of the methods they use .
the union is only perfect when all the <unk> are isolated .
it is the union of friends who live in different streets or towns .
each man , if he attempts to join himself to others , is on all sides cramped and diminished of his proportion ; and the <unk> the union the smaller and the more pitiful he is .
but leave him alone , to recognize in every hour and place the secret soul ; he <name> go up and down doing the works of a true member , and , to the astonishment of all , the work <name> be done with concert , though no man spoke .
government <name> be <unk> without any governor .
the union must be ideal in actual individualism .
i pass to the indication in some particulars of that <name> in man , which the heart is preaching to us in these days , and which engages the more regard , from the consideration that the speculations of one generation are the history of the next following .
in alluding just now to our system of education , i spoke of the <unk> of its details .
but it is open to graver criticism than the <unk> of its members : it is a system of despair .
the disease with which the human mind now labors is want of <name> .
men do not believe in a power of education .
we do not think we can speak to divine sentiments in man , and we do not try .
we renounce all high aims .
we believe that the defects of so many perverse and so many frivolous people who make up society , are organic , and society is a hospital of <unk> .
a man of good sense but of little <name> , whose compassion seemed to lead him to church as often as he went there , said to me that " he liked to have <unk> , and fairs , and churches , and other public amusements go on . "
i am afraid the remark is too honest , and comes from the same origin as the maxim of the tyrant , " if you would rule the world quietly , you must keep it amused . "
i notice too that the ground on which eminent public servants urge the claims of popular education is fear ; 'this country is filling up with thousands and millions of voters , and you must educate them to keep them from our throats . '
we do not believe that any education , any system of philosophy , any influence of genius , <name> ever give depth of insight to a superficial mind .
having settled ourselves into this <unk> , our skill is expended to procure <unk> , diversion , <unk> .
we adorn the victim with <name> skill , his tongue with languages , his body with inoffensive and comely manners .
so have we cunningly hid the tragedy of limitation and inner death we can not avert .
is it strange that society should be devoured by a secret melancholy which breaks through all its smiles and all its gayety and games ?
but even one step farther our <unk> has gone .
it appears that some doubt is felt by good and wise men whether really the happiness and probity of men is increased by the culture of the mind in those <unk> to which we give the name of education .
unhappily too the doubt comes from scholars , from persons who have tried these methods .
in their experience the scholar was not raised by the sacred thoughts amongst which he dwelt , but used them to selfish ends .
he was a profane person , and became a showman , turning his gifts to a <unk> use , and not to his own sustenance and growth .
it was found that the intellect could be independently developed , that is , in separation from the man , as any single organ can be <unk> , and the result was monstrous .
a canine appetite for knowledge was generated , which must still be fed but was never satisfied , and this knowledge , not being directed on action , never took the character of substantial , humane truth , blessing those whom it entered .
it gave the scholar certain powers of expression , the power of speech , the power of poetry , of literary <name> , but it did not bring him to peace or to <unk> .
when the literary class betray a destitution of <name> , it is not strange that society should be disheartened and <unk> by unbelief .
what remedy ?
life must be lived on a higher plane .
we must go up to a higher platform , to which we are always invited to ascend ; there , the whole aspect of things changes .
i resist the skepticism of our education and of our educated men .
i do not believe that the differences of opinion and character in men are organic .
i do not recognize , beside the class of the good and the wise , a permanent class of <unk> , or a class of <unk> , or of <unk> , or of <unk> .
i do not believe in two classes .
you remember the story of the poor woman who <unk> king <name> of macedon to <name> her justice , which <name> refused : the woman exclaimed , " i appeal : " the king , astonished , asked to whom she appealed : the woman replied , " from <name> drunk to <name> sober . "
the text <name> suit me very well .
i believe not in two classes of men , but in man in two moods , in <name> drunk and <name> sober .
i think , according to the good-hearted word of plato , " unwillingly the soul is deprived of truth . "
iron conservative , miser , or thief , no man is but by a supposed necessity which he <unk> by shortness or <unk> of sight .
the soul lets no man go without some <unk> and <unk> of a <unk> presence .
it would be easy to show , by a narrow scanning of any man's biography , that we are not so wedded to our paltry performances of every kind but that every man has at intervals the <name> to scorn his performances , in comparing them with his belief of what he should do ;  that he puts himself on the side of his enemies , listening gladly to what they say of him , and accusing himself of the same things .
what is it men love in genius , but its infinite <name> , which <unk> all it has done ?
genius counts all its miracles poor and short .
its own idea it never executed .
the iliad , the hamlet , the <unk> column , the <name> arch , the gothic minster , the <name> anthem , when they are ended , the master casts behind him .
how sinks the song in the waves of <name> which the universe pours over his soul !
before that gracious infinite out of which he <name> these few strokes , how mean they look , though the praises of the world attend them .
from the triumphs of his <name> he turns with <name> to this greater defeat .
let those admire who <name> .
with silent <name> he sees himself to be capable of a beauty that <unk> all which his hands have done ; all which human hands have ever done .
well , we are all the children of genius , the children of virtue ,  and feel their inspirations in our happier hours .
is not every man sometimes a radical in politics ?
men are <unk> when they are least vigorous , or when they are most luxurious .
they are <unk> after dinner , or before taking their rest ; when they are sick , or aged : in the morning , or when their intellect or their conscience has been aroused ; when they hear music , or when they read poetry , they are <unk> .
in the circle of the <unk> <unk> that could be collected in england , old or new , let a powerful and stimulating intellect , a man of great heart and mind , act on them , and very quickly these frozen <unk> <name> yield to the friendly influence , these hopeless <name> begin to <name> , these <unk> <name> begin to love , these immovable statues <name> begin to spin and revolve .
i can not help recalling the fine anecdote which <unk> relates of bishop berkeley , when he was preparing to leave england with his plan of planting the gospel among the american savages .
" lord bathurst told me that the members of the <unk> club being met at his house at dinner , they agreed to rally berkeley , who was also his guest , on his scheme at <unk> .
berkeley , having listened to the many lively things they had to say , begged to be heard in his turn , and displayed his plan with such an astonishing and animating force of eloquence and enthusiasm , that they were struck dumb , and , after some pause , rose up all together with earnestness , exclaiming , 'let us set out with him immediately . ' "
men in all ways are better than they seem .
they like flattery for the moment , but they know the truth for their own .
it is a foolish cowardice which keeps us from trusting them and speaking to them rude truth .
they resent your honesty for an instant , they <name> thank you for it always .
what is it we heartily wish of each other ?
is it to be pleased and flattered ?
no , but to be convicted and exposed , to be shamed out of our nonsense of all kinds , and made men of , instead of ghosts and phantoms .
we are weary of gliding <unk> through the world , which is itself so slight and unreal .
we crave a sense of reality , though it come in strokes of pain .
i explain so ,  by this <unk> love of truth ,  those excesses and errors into which souls of great vigor , but not equal insight , often fall .
they feel the poverty at the bottom of all the seeming affluence of the world .
they know the speed with which they come straight through the thin masquerade , and conceive a disgust at the <unk> of nature : <unk> , <unk> , <name> fox , <name> , <name> ,  and i could easily add names nearer home , of raging riders , who drive their steeds so hard , in the violence of living to forget its illusion : they would know the worst , and tread the floors of hell .
the heroes of ancient and modern fame , <unk> , themistocles , <unk> , <name> , caesar , have treated life and fortune as a game to be well and skilfully played , but the stake not to be so valued but that any time it could be held as a trifle light as air , and thrown up .
caesar , just before the battle of <unk> , discourses with the egyptian priest concerning the fountains of the nile , and offers to quit the army , the empire , and <name> , if he <name> show him those mysterious sources .
the same magnanimity shows itself in our social relations , in the preference , namely , which each man gives to the society of superiors over that of his equals .
all that a man has <name> he give for right relations with his mates .
all that he has <name> he give for an erect demeanor in every company and on each occasion .
he aims at such things as his neighbors prize , and gives his days and nights , his talents and his heart , to strike a good stroke , to acquit himself in all men 's sight as a man .
the consideration of an eminent citizen , of a noted merchant , of a man of <name> in his profession ; a naval and military honor , a general 's commission , a marshal 's baton , a ducal coronet , the <name> of poets , and , anyhow procured , the acknowledgment of eminent merit ,  have this lustre for each candidate that they enable him to walk erect and <unk> in the presence of some persons before whom he felt himself inferior .
having raised himself to this rank , having established his equality with class after class of those with whom he would live well , he still finds certain others before whom he can not possess himself , because they have somewhat fairer , somewhat grander , somewhat purer , which <unk> homage of him .
is his ambition pure ?
then <name> his laurels and his possessions seem worthless : instead of avoiding these men who make his fine gold dim , he <name> cast all behind him and seek their society only , woo and embrace this his humiliation and mortification , until he shall know why his eye sinks , his voice is husky , and his brilliant talents are paralyzed in this presence .
he is sure that the soul which gives the lie to all things <name> tell none .
his constitution <name> not mislead him .
if it can not <name> itself as it ought , high and <unk> in the presence of any man ; if the secret oracles whose whisper makes the sweetness and dignity of his life do here withdraw and accompany him no longer ,  it is time to <unk> what he has valued , to <unk> himself of what he has acquired , and with caesar to take in his hand the army , the empire , and <name> , and say , " all these <name> i relinquish , if you <name> show me the fountains of the nile . "
dear to us are those who love us ; the swift moments we spend with them are a compensation for a great deal of misery ; they enlarge our life ;  but dearer are those who reject us as unworthy , for they add another life : they build a heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed , and thereby supply to us new powers out of the recesses of the spirit , and urge us to new and <unk> performances .
as every man at heart wishes the best and not inferior society , wishes to be convicted of his error and to come to himself ,  so he wishes that the same healing should not stop in his thought , but should penetrate his <name> or active power .
the selfish man suffers more from his selfishness than he from whom that selfishness <unk> some important benefit .
what he most wishes is to be lifted to some higher platform , that he may see beyond his present fear the <unk> good , so that his fear , his coldness , his custom may be broken up like fragments of ice , melted and carried away in the great stream of good <name> .
do you ask my aid ?
i also wish to be a benefactor .
i wish more to be a benefactor and servant than you wish to be served by me ; and surely the greatest good fortune that could befall me is precisely to be so moved by you that i should say , 'take me and all mine , and use me and mine freely to your ends ' !
for i could not say it otherwise than because a great enlargement had come to my heart and mind , which made me superior to my fortunes .
here we are paralyzed with fear ; we hold on to our little properties , house and land , office and money , for the bread which they have in our experience yielded us , although we confess that our being does not flow through them .
we <name> to be made great ; we <name> to be touched with that fire which shall command this ice to stream , and make our existence a benefit .
if therefore we start objections to your project , o friend of the slave , or friend of the poor , or of the race , understand well that it is because we wish to drive you to drive us into your measures .
we wish to hear ourselves <unk> .
we are haunted with a belief that you have a secret which it would <unk> advantage us to learn , and we would force you to impart it to us , though it should bring us to prison , or to worse extremity .
nothing shall warp me from the belief that every man is a lover of truth .
there is no pure lie , no pure malignity in nature .
the entertainment of the proposition of depravity is the last profligacy and profanation .
there is no skepticism , no <unk> but that .
could it be received into common belief , suicide would <unk> the planet .
it has had a name to live in some <unk> theology , but each man 's innocence and his real liking of his neighbor have kept it a dead letter .
i remember standing at the polls one day when the anger of the political contest gave a certain <unk> to the faces of the independent <unk> , and a good man at my side , looking on the people , remarked , " i am satisfied that the largest part of these men , on either side , mean to vote right . "
i suppose considerate observers , looking at the masses of men in their blameless and in their equivocal actions , <name> assent , that in spite of selfishness and frivolity , the general purpose in the great number of persons is fidelity .
the reason why any one refuses his assent to your opinion , or his aid to your benevolent design , is in you : he refuses to accept you as a <unk> of truth , because , though you think you have it , he feels that you have it not .
you have not given him the authentic sign .
if it were worth while to run into details this general doctrine of the latent but ever <unk> spirit , it would be easy to <unk> illustration in particulars of a man 's equality to the church , of his equality to the state , and of his equality to every other man .
it is yet in all men 's memory that , a few years ago , the liberal churches complained that the <unk> church denied to them the name of <name> .
i think the complaint was confession : a religious church would not complain .
a religious man like <unk> , fox , or swedenborg is not irritated by wanting the sanction of the church , but the church feels the accusation of his presence and belief .
it only needs that a just man should walk in our streets to make it appear how pitiful and <unk> a contrivance is our legislation .
the man whose part is taken and who does not wait for society in anything , has a power which society can not choose but feel .
the familiar experiment called the <unk> paradox , in which a capillary column of water balances the ocean , is a symbol of the relation of one man to the whole family of men .
the wise <unk> , on hearing the lives of socrates , <unk> and <unk> read , " judged them to be great men every way , excepting , that they were too much subjected to the reverence of the laws , which to second and authorize , true virtue must abate very much of its original vigor . "
and as a man is equal to the church and equal to the state , so he is equal to every other man .
the <unk> of power in men are superficial ; and all <name> and searching conversation , in which a man lays himself open to his brother , <unk> each of their radical unity .
when two persons sit and converse in a thoroughly good understanding , the remark is sure to be made , see how we have disputed about words !
let a clear , apprehensive mind , such as every man knows among his friends , converse with the most commanding poetic genius , i think it would appear that there was no inequality such as men fancy , between them ; that a perfect understanding , a like receiving , a like perceiving , abolished differences ; and the poet would confess that his creative imagination gave him no deep advantage , but only the superficial one that he could express himself and the other could not ; that his advantage was a knack , which might impose on indolent men but could not impose on lovers of truth ; for they know the tax of talent , or what a price of greatness the power of expression too often pays .
i believe it is the conviction of the purest men , that the net amount of man and man does not much vary .
each is incomparably superior to his companion in some faculty .
his want of skill in other directions has added to his fitness for his own work .
each seems to have some compensation yielded to him by his infirmity , and every hindrance <unk> as a concentration of his force .
these and the like experiences intimate that man stands in strict connection with a higher fact never yet manifested .
there is power over and behind us , and we are the channels of its communications .
we seek to say thus and so , and over our head some spirit sits which <unk> what we say .
we would persuade our fellow to this or that ; another self within our eyes <unk> him .
that which we keep back , this reveals .
in vain we compose our faces and our words ; it holds uncontrollable communication with the enemy , and he answers civilly to us , but believes the spirit .
we exclaim , 'there 's a traitor in the house ! '
but at last it appears that he is the true man , and i am the traitor .
this open channel to the highest life is the first and last reality , so subtle , so quiet , yet so tenacious , that although i have never expressed the truth , and although i have never heard the expression of it from any other , i know that the whole truth is here for me .
what if i can not answer your questions ?
i am not pained that i can not frame a reply to the question , what is the operation we call providence ?
there lies the unspoken thing , present , <unk> .
every time we converse we seek to translate it into speech , but whether we hit or whether we miss , we have the fact .
every discourse is an approximate answer : but it is of small consequence that we do not get it into verbs and <unk> , whilst it abides for contemplation forever .
if the <unk> of the <unk> heart shall make themselves good in time , the man who shall be born , whose advent men and events prepare and <unk> , is one who shall enjoy his connection with a higher life , with the man within man ; shall destroy distrust by his trust , shall use his native but forgotten methods , shall not take counsel of flesh and blood , but shall rely on the law alive and beautiful which works over our heads and under our feet .
pitiless , it avails itself of our success when we obey it , and of our ruin when we <unk> it .
men are all secret believers in it , else the word justice would have no meaning : they believe that the best is the true ; that right is done at last ; or chaos would come .
it rewards actions after their nature , and not after the design of the agent .
<unk> , ' it saith to man , 'in every hour , paid or unpaid , see only that thou work , and thou canst not escape the reward : whether thy work be fine or coarse , planting corn or writing <unk> , so only it be honest work , done to thine own approbation , it shall earn a reward to the senses as well as to the thought : no matter how often defeated , you are born to victory .
the reward of a thing well done , is to have done it . '
as soon as a man is wonted to look beyond surfaces , and to see how this high <name> prevails without an exception or an interval , he settles himself into serenity .
he can already rely on the laws of gravity , that every stone <name> fall where it is due ; the good globe is faithful , and carries us securely through the celestial spaces , anxious or resigned , we need not interfere to help it on : and he <name> learn one day the mild lesson they teach , that our own orbit is all our task , and we need not assist the administration of the universe .
do not be so impatient to set the town right concerning the <unk> pretensions and the false reputation of certain men of standing .
they are laboring harder to set the town right concerning themselves , and <name> certainly succeed .
suppress for a few days your criticism on the <unk> of this or that teacher or <unk> , and he <name> have demonstrated his <unk> to all men 's eyes .
in like manner , let a man fall into the divine <unk> , and he is enlarged .
obedience to his genius is the only <unk> influence .
we wish to escape from subjection and a sense of inferiority , and we make <unk> <unk> , we drink water , we eat grass , we refuse the laws , we go to jail : it is all in vain ; only by obedience to his genius , only by the freest activity in the way constitutional to him , does an <name> seem to arise before a man and lead him by the hand out of all the wards of the prison .
that which <unk> us , <unk> in beauty and wonder as we are , is cheerfulness and courage , and the endeavor to realize our aspirations .
the life of man is the true romance , which when it is valiantly conducted <name> yield the imagination a higher <name> than any fiction .
all around us what powers are wrapped up under the coarse <unk> of custom , and all wonder prevented .
it is so wonderful to our <unk> that a man can see without his eyes , that it does not occur to them that it is just as wonderful that he should see with them ; and that is ever the difference between the wise and the unwise : the latter wonders at what is unusual , the wise man wonders at the usual .
shall not the heart which has received so much , trust the power by which it lives ?
may it not quit other <unk> , and listen to the soul that has guided it so gently and taught it so much , secure that the future <name> be worthy of the past ?

<name> e. <name> co. life of <name> <name> <name> <name> was born in boston , may 25 , <unk> .
he was descended from a long line of new england ministers , men of refinement and education .
as a school-boy he was quiet and retiring , reading a great deal , but not paying much attention to his lessons .
he entered harvard at the early age of fourteen , but never attained a high rank there , although he took a prize for an essay on socrates , and was made class poet after several others had declined .
next to his reserve and the faultless propriety of his conduct , his contemporaries at college seemed most impressed by the great maturity of his mind .
<name> appears never to have been really a boy .
he was always serene and thoughtful , impressing all who knew him with that <unk> which was his most distinguishing characteristic .
after <unk> from college he taught school for a time , and then entered the harvard divinity school under dr. <unk> , the great <unk> preacher .
although he was not strong enough to attend all the lectures of the divinity course , the college authorities deemed the name <name> sufficient passport to the ministry .
he was accordingly " <unk> to preach " by the <unk> association of ministers on october 10 , 1826 .
as a preacher , <name> was interesting , though not particularly original .
his talent seems to have been in giving new meaning to the old truths of religion .
one of his hearers has said : " in looking back on his preaching i find he has impressed truths to which i always assented in such a manner as to make them appear new , like a clearer revelation . "
although his sermons were always couched in scriptural language , they were touched with the light of that genius which <unk> the conventional and commonplace .
in his other pastoral duties <name> was not quite so successful .
it is characteristic of his deep humanity and his dislike for all fuss and commonplace that he appeared to least advantage at a funeral .
a <unk> in such matters , an old sexton , once remarked that on such occasions " he did not appear at ease at all .
to tell the truth , in my opinion , that young man was not born to be a minister . "
<name> did not long remain a minister .
in 1832 he preached a sermon in which he announced certain views in regard to the communion service which were disapproved by a large part of his congregation .
he found it impossible to continue preaching , and , with the most friendly feelings on both sides , he parted from his congregation .
a few months later ( 1833 ) he went to europe for a short year of travel .
while abroad , he visited <name> savage <unk> , coleridge and wordsworth , and <name> carlyle .
this visit to carlyle was to both men a most interesting experience .
they parted feeling that they had much intellectually in common .
this belief <unk> a sympathy which , by the time they had discovered how different they really were , had grown so strong a habit that they always kept up their intimacy .
this year of travel opened <name> 's eyes to many things of which he had previously been ignorant ; he had profited by detachment from the concerns of a limited community and an isolated church .
after his return he began to find his true field of activity in the <unk> , and delivered a number of addresses in boston and its vicinity .
while thus coming before the open public on the lecture platform , he was all the time preparing the treatise which was to embody all the <unk> elements of his philosophical doctrine .
this was the essay nature , which was published in 1836 .
by its <name> of external nature as an incarnation of the divine mind it struck the fundamental principle of <name> 's religious belief .
the essay had a very small circulation at first , though later it became widely known .
in the <name> of 1836 <name> followed up his discourse on nature by a course of twelve lectures on the " philosophy of history , " a considerable portion of which eventually became embodied in his essays .
the next year ( 1837 ) was the year of the delivery of the man thinking , or the american scholar address before the <unk> beta <unk> society at cambridge .
this society , composed of the first twenty-five men in each class <unk> from college , has annual meetings which have called forth the best efforts of many distinguished scholars and thinkers .
<name> 's address was listened to with the most profound interest .
it declared a sort of intellectual independence for <name> .
henceforth we were to be emancipated from <unk> foreign influences , and a national literature was to expand under the <unk> care of the republic .
these two discourses , nature and the american scholar , strike the <unk> of <name> 's philosophical , poetical , and moral teachings .
in fact he had , as every great teacher has , only a limited number of principles and theories to teach .
these principles of life can all be enumerated in twenty words  self-reliance , culture , intellectual and moral independence , the divinity of nature and man , the necessity of labor , and high ideals .
<name> spent the latter part of his life in lecturing and in literary work .
his son , dr. <name> <name> , gave an interesting account of how these lectures were constructed .
" all through his life he kept a journal .
this book , he said , was his <unk> bank . '
the thoughts thus received and garnered in his journals were <unk> , and a great many of them appeared in his published works .
they were religiously set down just as they came , in no order except <unk> , but later they were grouped , enlarged or <unk> , illustrated , worked into a lecture or discourse , and , after having in this capacity undergone repeated testing and <unk> , were finally carefully sifted and more rigidly <unk> , and were printed as essays . "
besides his essays and lectures <name> left some poetry in which is embodied those thoughts which were to him too deep for prose expression .
<name> <name> holmes in speaking of this says : " <name> wrote occasionally in verse from his <unk> until he had reached the age which used to be known as the grand <unk> , sixty-three ... . his poems are not and hardly can become popular ; they are not meant to be liked by the many , but to be dearly loved and cherished by the few ... . his occasional lawlessness in technical construction , his somewhat fantastic expressions , his <unk> <unk> hardly <unk> from the pleasant surprise his verses so often bring with them ... .
the poetic license which we allow in the verse of <name> is more than excused by the <name> spirit which makes us forget its occasional <unk> , sometimes to be pleased with them as characteristic of the writer . "
<name> was always a striking figure in the intellectual life of <name> .
his discourses were above all things inspiring .
through them many were induced to strive for a higher <unk> .
his influence can be discerned in all the literary movements of the time .
he was the central figure of the so-called <unk> school which was so prominent fifty years ago , although he always rather held aloof from any enthusiastic participation in the movement .
<name> lived a quiet life in concord , massachusetts .
" he was a first-rate neighbor and one who always kept his fences up . "
he traveled extensively on his lecturing tours , even going as far as england .
in english traits he has recorded his impressions of what he saw of english life and manners .
<name> <name> holmes has described him in this wise : " his personal appearance was that of the typical new <unk> of <unk> ancestry .
tall , spare , slender , with sloping shoulders , slightly stooping in his later years , with light hair and eyes , the <unk> complexion , the prominent , somewhat arched nose which belongs to many of the new england sub-species , thin lips , suggestive of delicacy , but having nothing like <unk> , still less of the rigidity which is often noticeable in the generation succeeding next to that of the men in their shirt-sleeves , he would have been noticed anywhere as one evidently a scholarly thinker astray from the alcove or the study , which were his natural <unk> .
his voice was very sweet , and penetrating without any <unk> or <name> of effort .
his enunciation was beautifully clear , but he often hesitated as if waiting for the right word to present itself .
his manner was very quiet , his smile was pleasant , but he did not like explosive laughter any better than hawthorne did .
none who met him can fail to recall that serene and kindly presence , in which there was mingled a certain spiritual remoteness with the most benignant human welcome to all who were privileged to enjoy his companionship . "
<name> died <name> 27 , 1882 , after a few days ' illness from pneumonia .
dr. <name> in his excellent biography says : " seldom had 'the <unk> whose name is death ' gathered such illustrious harvest as between december 1880 and <name> 1882 .
in the first month of this period <name> eliot passed away , in the ensuing february carlyle followed ; in <name> lord <unk> died , deplored by his party , nor <unk> by his country ; in february of the following year longfellow was carried to the tomb ; in <name> <unk> was laid to rest by the sea , and the pavement of westminster <name> was disturbed to receive the dust of <name> .
and now <name> lay down in death beside the painter of man and the <unk> of nature , the <unk> statesman , the poet of the plain man and the poet of the artist , and the prophet whose name is <unk> linked with his own .
all these men passed into eternity laden with the spoils of time , but of none of them could it be said , as of <name> , that the most shining intellectual <name> and the most potent intellectual force of a continent had departed along with him . "
critical opinions of <name> and his writings .
<name> <name> , in an address on <name> delivered in boston , gave an excellent estimate of the rank we should accord to him in the great <unk> of letters .
some , perhaps , <name> think that <name> was <unk> and cold , but dispassionate readers <name> be inclined to agree with his judgment of our great american .
after a review of the poetical works of <name> the english critic draws his conclusions as follows : " i do not then place <name> among the great poets .
but i go farther , and say that i do not place him among the great writers , the great men of letters .
who are the great men of letters ?
they are men like cicero , plato , bacon , <unk> , swift , voltaire  writers with , in the first place , a genius and instinct for style ... .
brilliant and powerful passages in a man 's writings do not prove his possession of it .
<name> has passages of <name> and pathetic eloquence ; he has passages of shrewd and felicitous wit ; he has crisp <unk> ; he has passages of exquisitely touched observation of nature .
yet he is not a great writer ... . carlyle <unk> perfectly the defects of his friend 's poetic and literary productions when he says : 'for me it is too ethereal , speculative , <unk> ; i <name> have all things condense themselves , take shape and body , if they are to have my sympathy . '
... " ... . not with the <unk> and grays , not with the <unk> and <unk> , not with the <unk> and <unk> , not with the <unk> and <unk> , can we rank <name> .
no man could see this clearer than <name> himself .
<unk> , my friend , ' he writes in reply to carlyle , who had <unk> him to creative work ,  <unk> , my friend , i can do no such <name> thing as you say .
i do not belong to the poets , but only to a low department of literature ,  the reporters ; suburban men . '
he <unk> his friend 's praise ; praise <unk> to a fault ' he calls it ; praise <unk> to the <unk> of me ,  cold , fastidious , ebbing person that i am . ' "
after all this unfavorable criticism <name> begins to praise .
quoting passages from the essays , he adds : " this is tonic indeed !
and let no one object that it is too general ; that more practical , positive direction is what we want ... .
yes , truly , his insight is admirable ; his truth is precious .
yet the secret of his effect is not even in these ; it is in his temper .
it is in the hopeful , serene , beautiful temper wherewith these , in <name> , are <unk> united ; in which they work and have their being ... . one can scarcely overrate the importance of holding fast to happiness and <name> .
it gives to <name> 's work an invaluable virtue .
as <unk> poetry is , in my judgment , the most important done in verse , in our language , during the present century , so <name> 's essays are , i think , the most important work done in prose ... .
but by his conviction that in the life of the spirit is happiness , and by his <name> that this life of the spirit <name> come more and more to be <unk> understood , and to prevail , and to work for happiness ,  by this conviction and <name> <name> was great , and he <name> surely prove in the end to have been right in them ... . you can not prize him too much , nor heed him too diligently . "
<name> <unk> , a <name> critic of great influence in his own country , did much to obtain a hearing for <name> 's works in germany .
at first the germans could not understand the unusual english , the unaccustomed turns of phrase which are so characteristic of <name> 's style .
" macaulay gives them no difficulty ; even carlyle is comprehended .
but in <name> 's writings the broad turnpike is suddenly changed into a hazardous <name> <unk> .
his thoughts and his style are american .
he is not writing for berlin , but for the people of massachusetts ... .
it is an <name> to rise above what we have been taught ... . all great men are seen to possess this freedom .
they derive their standard from their own natures , and their observations on life are so natural and spontaneous that it would seem as if the most illiterate person with a scrap of common-sense would have made the same ... . we become wiser with them , and know not how the difficult appears easy and the involved plain .
" <name> possesses this <name> manner of communicating himself .
he inspires me with courage and confidence .
he has read and seen but <unk> the labor .
i meet in his works plenty of familiar facts , but he does not employ them to figure up anew the old worn-out problems : each stands on a new spot and serves for new combinations .
from everything he sees the direct line issuing which connects it with the focus of life ... . " ... . <name> 's theory is that of the <unk> of the individual . '
to discover what a young man is good for , and to equip him for the path he is to strike out in life , regardless of any other consideration , is the great duty to which he calls attention .
he makes men <unk> .
he reveals to the eyes of the <unk> the magnificent results of practical activity , and <unk> before the <unk> the grandeur of the ideal world of thought .
no man is to allow himself , through prejudice , to make a mistake in choosing the task to which he <name> devote his life .
<name> 's essays are , as it were , printed sermons  all having this same text ... .
the wealth and <name> of his language overpowered and entranced me anew .
but even now i can not say wherein the secret of his influence lies .
what he has written is like life itself  the unbroken thread ever lengthened through the addition of the small events which make up each day's experience . "
<unk> in his famous " life of carlyle " gives an interesting description of <name> 's visit to the <unk> in scotland : " the <unk> were sitting alone at dinner on a <name> afternoon at the end of <name> when a <unk> carriage drove to the door , and there stepped out of it a young american then unknown to fame , but whose influence in his own country equals that of carlyle in ours , and whose name stands connected with his wherever the english language is spoken .
<name> , the younger of the two , had just broken his <unk> fetters , and was looking out around him like a young eagle longing for light .
he had read carlyle 's articles and had discerned with the instinct of genius that here was a voice speaking real and fiery convictions , and no longer echoes and <unk> .
he had come to europe to study its social and spiritual phenomena ; and to the young <name> as to the old goethe , the most important of them appeared to be carlyle ... .
the acquaintance then begun to their mutual pleasure ripened into a deep friendship , which has remained <unk> in spite of wide <unk> of opinion throughout their working lives . "
carlyle wrote to his mother after <name> had left : " our third happiness was the arrival of a certain young unknown friend named <name> , from boston , in the united states , who turned aside so far from his british , french , and italian travels to see me here !
he had an introduction from mill and a frenchman ( baron <unk> nephew ) whom <name> knew at rome .
of course , we could do no other than welcome him ; the rather as he seemed to be one of the most lovable creatures in himself we had ever looked on .
he stayed till next day with us , and talked and heard to his heart 's content , and left us all really sad to part with him . "
in 1841 carlyle wrote to <name> <name> a few words apropos of the recent publication of <name> 's essays in england : " i love <name> 's book , not for its detached opinions , not even for the scheme of the general world he has framed for himself , or any eminence of talent he has expressed that with , but simply because it is his own book ; because there is a tone of veracity , an unmistakable air of its being his , and a real utterance of a human soul , not a mere <name> of such .
i consider it , in that sense , highly remarkable , rare , very rare , in these days of ours .
ach gott !
it is frightful to live among echoes .
the few that read the book , i imagine , <name> get benefit of it .
to <name> , i sometimes say that <name> , such as he is , seems to me like a kind of new <name> . "
<name> <unk> , the acute english critic , has made an <unk> study of <name> 's style , which may reconcile the reader to some of its exasperating peculiarities .
" one of the traits that every critic notes in <name> 's writing is that it is so abrupt , so sudden in its transitions , so <unk> , so <unk> .
dislike of a sentence that drags made him unconscious of the quality that french critics name <unk> .
everything is thrown in just as it comes , and sometimes the pell-mell is enough to persuade us that pope did not exaggerate when he said that no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts ... . apart from his difficult <unk> , <name> is not free from secondary faults .
he uses words that are not only odd , but vicious in construction ; he is sometimes oblique and he is often clumsy ; and there is a visible feeling after <unk> that do not always come .
when people say that <name> 's style must be good and admirable because it fits his thought , they forget that though it is well that a robe should fit , there is still something to be said about its cut and fashion ... .
yet , as happens to all fine minds , there came to <name> ways of expression deeply marked with character .
on every <name> there is set the strong stamp of sincerity , and the attraction of a certain <unk> ; the most awkward sentence rings true ; and there is often a pure and simple note that touches us more than if it were the perfection of elaborated <name> .
the uncouth procession of the periods <unk> the <unk> of the thought , and that , too , is a kind of eloquence .
an honest reader easily <unk> the rude jolt or unexpected start when it shows a thinker faithfully working his way along arduous and <unk> tracks .
even at the roughest , <name> often <unk> a delightful cadence .
as he says of <unk> , his sentences are cubes which <name> stand firm , place them how or where you <name> .
he criticised swedenborg for being <unk> explanatory , and having an exaggerated feeling of the ignorance of men .
'men take truths of this nature , ' said <name> , 'very fast ; ' and his own style does no doubt very boldly take this capacity for granted in us .
in <unk> and pith of diction , ' again , of which mr. <name> speaks , he hits the <name> with a felicity that is almost his own in this generation .
he is terse , concentrated , and free from the important blunder of mistaking intellectual <unk> for meditation .
nor in fine does his abruptness ever impede a true <unk> .
the accent is homely and the apparel plain , but his bearing has a friendliness , a courtesy , a hospitable humanity , which goes nearer to our hearts than either literary decoration or <unk> unction .
that modest and lenient <unk> which gave such charm to his companionship breathes in his gravest writing , and prevents us from finding any <name> of it cold or hard or dry . "
<unk> .
whipple , the well-known american critic , wrote soon after <unk> death : " but <unk> and light ' are precious and inspiring only so far as they express the essential sweetness of the disposition of the thinker , and the essential illuminating power of his intelligence .
<name> 's greatness came from his character .
sweetness and light streamed from him because they were in him .
in everything he thought , wrote , and did , we feel the presence of a personality as vigorous and brave as it was sweet , and the particular radical thought he at any time expressed derived its power to animate and illuminate other minds from the might of the manhood , which was felt to be within and behind it .
to <unk> and light ' he therefore added the prime quality of fearless manliness .
" if the force of <name> 's character was thus inextricably blended with the force of all his faculties of intellect and imagination , and the refinement of all his sentiments , we have still to account for the peculiarities of his genius , and to answer the question , why do we instinctively apply the epithet <unk> ' to every characteristic passage in his writings ?
we are told that he was the last in a long line of clergymen , his ancestors , and that the modern doctrine of heredity accounts for the impressive emphasis he laid on the moral sentiment ; but that does not solve the puzzle why he unmistakably differed in his nature and genius from all other <unk> .
an imaginary genealogical chart of descent connecting him with <unk> or <unk> would be more satisfactory .
" what distinguishes the <name> was his exceptional genius and character , that something in him which separated him from all other <unk> , as it separated him from all other eminent men of letters , and impressed every intelligent reader with the feeling that he was not only <unk> but aboriginal . '
some traits of his mind and character may be traced back to his ancestors , but what doctrine of heredity can give us the <name> of his genius ?
indeed , the safest course to pursue is to quote his own words , and despairingly confess that it is the nature of genius 'to spring , like the rainbow daughter of wonder , from the invisible , to abolish the past , and refuse all history . ' "

<name> 1883 the american scholar .
this address was delivered at cambridge in 1837 , before the harvard chapter of the <unk> beta <unk> society , a college fraternity composed of the first twenty-five men in each <unk> class .
the society has annual meetings , which have been the occasion for addresses from the most distinguished scholars and thinkers of the day .
mr. president and gentlemen , i greet you on the <unk> of our literary year .
our anniversary is one of <name> , and , perhaps , not enough of labor .
we do not meet for games of strength [ 1 ] or skill , for the recitation of histories , tragedies , and odes , like the ancient greeks ; for parliaments of love and <unk> , like the <unk> ; [ 2 ] nor for the advancement of science , like our <unk> in the british and european capitals .
thus far , our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give to letters any more .
as such it is precious as the sign of an indestructible instinct .
perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be , and <name> be , something else ; when the <unk> intellect of this continent <name> look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectation of the world with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill .
our day of dependence , our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands , draws to a close .
the millions that around us are rushing into life can not always be fed on the sere remains of foreign <unk> .
[ 3 ] events , actions arise that must be <name> , that <name> sing themselves .
who can doubt that poetry <name> revive and lead in a new age , as the <name> in the constellation harp , which now flames in our zenith , astronomers announce , shall one day be the <unk> [ 4 ] for a thousand years ?
in the light of this <name> i accept the topic which not only usage but the nature of our association seem to <unk> to this day ,  the american scholar .
year by year we come up hither to read one more chapter of his biography .
let us inquire what new lights , new events , and more days have thrown on his character , his duties , and his hopes .
it is one of those fables which out of an unknown antiquity convey an unlooked-for wisdom , that the gods , in the beginning , divided man into men , that he might be more helpful to himself ; just as the hand was divided into fingers , the better to answer its end .
[ 5 ] the old fable covers a doctrine ever new and sublime ; that there is one man ,  present to all particular men only partially , or through one faculty ; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole man .
man is not a farmer , or a professor , or an engineer , but he is all .
man is priest , and scholar , and statesman , and <unk> , and soldier .
in the divided or social state these functions are <unk> out to individuals , each of whom aims to do his stint [ 6 ] of the joint work , whilst each other performs his .
the fable implies that the individual , to possess himself , must sometimes return from his own labor to embrace all the other laborers .
but , unfortunately , this original unit , this fountain of power , has been so distributed to multitudes , has been so minutely subdivided and <unk> out , that it is spilled into drops , and can not be gathered .
the state of society is one in which the members have suffered amputation from the trunk and strut about so many walking monsters ,  a good finger , a neck , a stomach , an elbow , but never a man .
man is thus metamorphosed into a thing , into many things .
the planter , who is man sent out into the field to gather food , is seldom cheered by any idea of the true dignity of his ministry .
he sees his bushel and his cart , and nothing beyond , and sinks into the farmer , instead of man on the farm .
the <unk> scarcely ever gives an ideal worth to his work , but is ridden [ 7 ] by the routine of his craft , and the soul is subject to dollars .
the priest becomes a form ; the attorney a <unk> ; the mechanic a machine ; the sailor a rope of the ship .
in this distribution of functions the scholar is the delegated intellect .
in the right state he is man thinking .
in the degenerate state , when the victim of society , he tends to become a mere thinker , or , still worse , the parrot of other men 's thinking .
in this view of him , as man thinking , the whole theory of his office is contained .
him nature <unk> with all her placid , all her <unk> pictures .
[ 8 ] him the past <unk> .
him the future invites .
is not indeed every man a student , and do not all things exist for the student 's <unk> ?
and , finally , is not the true scholar the only true master ?
but as the old oracle said , " all things have two handles : beware of the wrong one .
" [ 9 ] in life , too often , the scholar <unk> with mankind and <unk> his privilege .
let us see him in his school , and consider him in reference to the main influences he receives .
* * * * * i .
the first in time and the first in importance of the influences upon the mind is that of nature .
every day , the sun ; [ 10 ] and , after sunset , night and her stars .
ever the winds blow ; ever the grass grows .
every day , men and women , conversing , beholding and beholden .
[ 11 ] the scholar must needs stand wistful and admiring before this great spectacle .
he must settle its value in his mind .
what is nature to him ?
there is never a beginning , there is never an end , to the inexplicable continuity of this web of god , but always circular power returning into itself .
[ 12 ] therein it resembles his own spirit , whose beginning , whose ending , he never can find ,  so entire , so boundless .
far too as her splendors shine , system on system shooting like rays , upward , downward , without center , without circumference ,  in the mass and in the particle , nature <unk> to render account of herself to the mind .
classification begins .
to the young mind everything is individual , stands by itself .
by and by it finds how to join two things and see in them one nature ; then three , then three thousand ; and so , <unk> over by its own <unk> instinct , it goes on tying things together , diminishing anomalies , discovering roots running under ground whereby contrary and remote things cohere and flower out from one stem .
it presently learns that since the <name> of history there has been a constant accumulation and classifying of facts .
but what is classification but the perceiving that these objects are not chaotic , and are not foreign , but have a law which is also a law of the human mind ?
the astronomer discovers that geometry , a pure abstraction of the human mind , is the measure of <unk> motion .
the chemist finds proportions and intelligible method throughout matter ; and science is nothing but the finding of analogy , identity , in the most remote parts .
the ambitious soul sits down before each <unk> fact ; one after another reduces all strange constitutions , all new powers , to their class and their law , and goes on forever to animate the last <unk> of organization , the outskirts of nature , by insight .
thus to him , to this school-boy under the bending dome of day , is suggested that he and it proceed from one root ; one is leaf and one is flower ; relation , sympathy , stirring in every vein .
and what is that root ?
is not that the soul of his soul ?  a thought too bold ?  a dream too wild ?
yet when this spiritual light shall have revealed the law of more earthly natures ,  when he has learned to worship the soul , and to see that the natural philosophy that now is , is only the first <unk> of its gigantic hand ,  he shall look forward to an <unk> knowledge as to a becoming creator .
[ 13 ] he shall see that nature is the opposite of the soul , answering to it part for part .
one is seal and one is print .
its beauty is the beauty of his own mind .
its laws are the laws of his own mind .
nature then becomes to him the measure of his attainments .
so much of nature as he is ignorant of , so much of his own mind does he not yet possess .
and , in fine , the ancient precept , " know thyself , " [ 14 ] and the modern precept , " study nature , " become at last one maxim .
* * * * * ii .
the next great influence into the spirit of the scholar is the mind of the past ,  in whatever form , whether of literature , of <name> , of institutions , that mind is inscribed .
books are the best type of the influence of the past , and perhaps we shall get at the truth ,  learn the amount of this influence more conveniently ,  by considering their value alone .
the theory of books is <name> .
the scholar of the first age received into him the world around ; brooded thereon ; gave it the new arrangement of his own mind , and uttered it again .
it came into him life ; it went out from him truth .
it came to him short-lived actions ; it went out from him immortal thoughts .
it came to him business ; it went from him poetry .
it was dead fact ; now , it is quick thought .
it can stand , and it can go .
it now endures , it now flies , it now inspires .
[ 15 ] precisely in proportion to the depth of mind from which it issued , so high does it soar , so long does it sing .
or , i might say , it depends on how far the process had gone , of <unk> life into truth .
in proportion to the completeness of the <unk> , so <name> the purity and <unk> of the product be .
but none is quite perfect .
as no air-pump can by any means make a perfect vacuum , [ 16 ] so neither can any artist entirely exclude the conventional , the local , the perishable from his book , or write a book of pure thought , that shall be as efficient , in all respects , to a remote posterity , as to contemporaries , or rather to the second age .
each age , it is found , must write its own books ; or rather , each generation for the next succeeding .
the books of an older period <name> not fit this .
yet hence arises a grave mischief .
the sacredness which attaches to the act of creation , the act of thought , is instantly transferred to the record .
the poet chanting was felt to be a divine man .
henceforth the chant is divine also .
the writer was a just and wise spirit .
henceforward it is settled the book is perfect ; as love of the hero <unk> into worship of his statue .
instantly the book becomes <unk> .
[ 17 ] the guide is a tyrant .
we sought a brother , and lo , a governor .
the sluggish and perverted mind of the multitude , always slow to open to the incursions of reason , having once so opened , having once received this book , stands upon it , and makes an outcry if it is <unk> .
colleges are built on it .
books are written on it by thinkers , not by man thinking , by men of talent , that is , who start wrong , who set out from accepted dogmas , not from their own sight of principles .
meek young men grow up in libraries , believing it their duty to accept the views which cicero , which locke , [ 18 ] which bacon , [ 19 ] have given ; forgetful that cicero , locke and bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote these books .
hence , instead of man thinking , we have the <unk> .
hence the <unk> class , who value books , as such ; not as related to nature and the human constitution , but as making a sort of third estate [ 20 ] with the world and soul .
hence the <unk> of readings , [ 21 ] the <unk> , [ 22 ] the <unk> [ 23 ] of all degrees .
this is bad ; this is worse than it seems .
books are the best of things , well used ; abused , among the worst .
what is the right use ?
what is the one end which all means go to effect ?
they are for nothing but to inspire .
[ 24 ] i had better never see a book than to be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit , and made a satellite instead of a system .
the one thing in the world of value is the active soul ,  the soul , free , sovereign , active .
this every man is entitled to ; this every man contains within him , although in almost all men obstructed , and as yet unborn .
the soul active sees absolute truth and utters truth , or creates .
in this action it is genius ; not the privilege of here and there a favorite , but the sound estate of every man .
[ 25 ] in its essence it is progressive .
the book , the college , the school of <name> , the institution of any kind , stop with some past utterance of genius .
this is good , say they ,  let us hold by this .
they pin me down .
[ 26 ] they look backward and not forward .
but genius always looks forward .
the eyes of man are set in his forehead , not in his <unk> .
man hopes .
genius creates .
to create ,  to create ,  is the proof of a divine presence .
whatever talents may be , if the man create not , the pure <unk> of the deity is not his ; [ 27 ]  cinders and smoke there may be , but not yet flame .
there are creative manners , there are creative actions , and creative words ; manners , actions , words , that is , indicative of no custom or authority , but springing spontaneous from the mind 's own sense of good and fair .
on the other part , instead of being its own seer , let it receive always from another mind its truth , though it were in torrents of light , without periods of solitude , inquest , and <unk> ; and a fatal <unk> [ 28 ] is done .
genius is always sufficiently the enemy of genius by <unk> .
[ 29 ] the literature of every nation bear me witness .
the english dramatic poets have <unk> now for two hundred years .
[ 30 ] undoubtedly there is a right way of reading , so it be sternly <unk> .
man thinking must not be subdued by his instruments .
books are for the scholar 's idle times .
when he can read god directly , the hour is too precious to be wasted in other men 's <unk> of their readings .
[ 31 ] but when the intervals of darkness come , as come they must ,  when the soul <unk> not , when the sun is hid and the stars withdraw their shining ,  we repair to the lamps which were kindled by their <name> , to guide our steps to the east again , where the <name> is .
[ 32 ] we hear , that we may speak .
the arabian proverb says , " a <unk> , looking on a <unk> , <unk> fruitful . "
it is remarkable , the character of the pleasure we derive from the best books .
they impress us ever with the conviction that one nature wrote and the same reads .
we read the verses of one of the great english poets , of chaucer , [ 33 ] of <unk> , [ 34 ] of <unk> , [ 35 ] with the most modern <name> ,  with a pleasure , i mean , which is in great part caused by the abstraction of all time from their verses .
there is some awe mixed with the <name> of our surprise , when this poet , who lived in some past world , two or three hundred years ago , says that which lies close to my own soul , that which i also had well-nigh thought and said .
but for the evidence thence afforded to the philosophical doctrine of the identity of all minds , we should suppose some <unk> <name> , some foresight of souls that were to be , and some preparation of stores for their future wants , like the fact observed in insects , who lay up food before death for the young grub they shall never see .
i would not be hurried by any love of system , by any exaggeration of instincts , to <unk> the book .
we all know that as the human body can be nourished on any food , though it were boiled grass and the broth of shoes , so the human mind can be fed by any knowledge .
and great and heroic men have existed who had almost no other information than by the printed <name> .
i only would say that it needs a strong head to bear that diet .
one must be an inventor to read well .
as the proverb says , " he that would bring home the wealth of the indies must <name> out the wealth of the indies . "
there is then creative reading as well as creative writing .
when the mind is braced by labor and invention , the <name> of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion .
every sentence is doubly significant , and the sense of our author is as broad as the world .
we then see , what is always true , that as the seer 's hour of vision is short and rare among heavy days and months , so is its record , perchance , the least part of his volume .
the discerning <name> read , in his plato [ 36 ] or shakespeare , only that least part ,  only the authentic utterances of the oracle ;  all the rest he rejects , were it never so many times <unk> and shakespeare 's .
of course there is a portion of reading quite indispensable to a wise man .
history and exact science he must learn by laborious reading .
colleges , in like manner , have their indispensable office ,  to teach elements .
but they can only highly serve us when they aim not to drill , but to create ; when they gather from far every <name> of various genius to their hospitable halls , and by the concentrated fires set the hearts of their youth on flame .
thought and knowledge are natures in which apparatus and pretension avail nothing .
gowns [ 37 ] and pecuniary foundations , [ 38 ] though of towns of gold , can never <unk> the least sentence or syllable of wit .
[ 39 ] forget this , and our american colleges <name> recede in their public importance , whilst they grow richer every year .
* * * * * iii .
there goes in the world a notion that the scholar should be a <unk> , a <unk> , [ 40 ]  as unfit for any handiwork or public labor as a penknife for an axe .
the so-called " practical men " sneer at speculative men , as if , because they speculate or see , they could do nothing .
i have heard it said that the clergy  who are always , more universally than any other class , the scholars of their day  are addressed as women ; that the rough , spontaneous conversation of men they do not hear , but only a mincing [ 41 ] and diluted speech .
they are often virtually <unk> ; and indeed there are advocates for their celibacy .
as far as this is true of the studious classes , it is not just and wise .
action is with the scholar subordinate , but it is essential .
without it he is not yet man .
without it thought can never ripen into truth .
whilst the world hangs before the eye as a cloud of beauty , we can not even see its beauty .
inaction is cowardice , but there can be no scholar without the heroic mind .
the <unk> [ 42 ] of thought , the transition through which it passes from the unconscious to the conscious , is action .
only so much do i know , as i have lived .
instantly we know whose words are loaded with life , and whose not .
the world  this shadow of the soul , or other me , lies wide around .
its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me acquainted with myself .
i launch eagerly into this resounding tumult .
i grasp the hands of those next me , and take my place in the ring to suffer and to work , taught by an instinct that so shall the dumb abyss [ 43 ] be vocal with speech .
i pierce its order ; i <unk> its fear ; [ 44 ] i dispose of it within the circuit of my expanding life .
so much only of life as i know by experience , so much of the wilderness have i vanquished and planted , or so far have i extended my being , my dominion .
i do not see how any man can afford , for the sake of his nerves and his nap , to spare any action in which he can partake .
it is pearls and rubies to his discourse .
drudgery , calamity , exasperation , want , are instructors in eloquence and wisdom .
the true scholar <unk> every opportunity of action passed by , as a loss of power .
it is the raw material out of which the intellect <unk> her splendid products .
a strange process too , this by which experience is converted into thought , as a <unk> is converted into satin .
[ 45 ] the manufacture goes forward at all hours .
the actions and events of our childhood and youth are now matters of <unk> observation .
they lie like fair pictures in the air .
not so with our recent actions ,  with the business which we now have in hand .
on this we are quite unable to speculate .
our affections as yet circulate through it .
we no more feel or know it than we feel the feet , or the hand , or the <name> of our body .
the new deed is yet a part of life ,  remains for a time immersed in our unconscious life .
in some contemplative hour it <unk> itself from the life like a ripe fruit , [ 46 ] to become a thought of the mind .
instantly it is raised , transfigured ; the <unk> has put on <unk> .
[ 47 ] henceforth it is an object of beauty , however base its origin and neighborhood .
observe , too , the impossibility of <unk> this act .
in its grub state it can not fly , it can not shine , it is a dull grub .
but suddenly , without observation , the selfsame thing <unk> beautiful wings , and is an <name> of wisdom .
so is there no fact , no event , in our private history , which shall not , sooner or later , lose its adhesive , inert form , and astonish us by soaring from our body into the <unk> .
[ 48 ] cradle and infancy , school and playground , the fear of boys , and dogs , and <unk> , [ 49 ] the love of little maids and berries , and many another fact that once filled the whole sky , are gone already ; friend and relative , profession and party , town and country , nation and world , must also soar and sing .
[ 50 ] of course , he who has put forth his total strength in fit actions has the richest return of wisdom .
i <name> not shut myself out of this globe of action , and <unk> an oak into a flower-pot , there to hunger and pine ; nor trust the revenue of some single faculty , and exhaust one vein of thought , much like those <unk> , [ 51 ] who , getting their livelihood by carving shepherds , <unk> , and smoking dutchmen , for all europe , went out one day to the mountain to find stock , and discovered that they had <unk> up the last of their <unk> .
authors we have , in <name> , who have written out their vein , and who , moved by a commendable <name> , sail for greece or palestine , follow the trapper into the prairie , or ramble round algiers , to <unk> their <unk> stock .
if it were only for a vocabulary , the scholar would be <unk> of action .
life is our dictionary .
[ 52 ] years are well spent in country labors ; in town ; in the insight into trades and manufactures ; in <name> intercourse with many men and women ; in science ; in <name> ; to the one end of <unk> in all their facts a language by which to illustrate and embody our perceptions .
i learn immediately from any speaker how much he has already lived , through the poverty or the splendor of his speech .
life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get tiles and <unk> for the masonry of to-day .
this is the way to learn grammar .
colleges and books only copy the language which the field and the <unk> made .
but the final value of action , like that of books , and better than books , is that it is a resource .
that great principle of <unk> in nature , that shows itself in the inspiring and <unk> of the breath ; in <name> and <unk> ; in the ebb and flow of the sea ; in day and night ; in heat and cold ; and , as yet more deeply <unk> in every atom and every fluid , is known to us under the name of polarity ,  these " fits of easy transmission and reflection , " as <name> [ 53 ] called them , are the law of nature because they are the law of spirit .
the mind now thinks , now acts , and each fit <unk> the other .
when the artist has exhausted his materials , when the fancy no longer paints , when thoughts are no longer apprehended and books are a weariness ,  he has always the resource to live .
character is higher than intellect .
thinking is the function .
living is the <unk> .
the stream retreats to its source .
a great soul <name> be strong to live , as well as strong to think .
does he lack organ or medium to impart his truth ?
he can still fall back on this elemental force of living them .
this is a total act .
thinking is a partial act .
let the grandeur of justice shine in his affairs .
let the beauty of affection cheer his lowly roof .
those " far from fame , " who dwell and act with him , <name> feel the force of his constitution in the doings and passages of the day better than it can be measured by any public and designed display .
time shall teach him that the scholar loses no hour which the man lives .
herein he <unk> the sacred germ of his instinct , screened from influence .
what is lost in <unk> is gained in strength .
not out of those on whom systems of education have exhausted their culture comes the helpful giant to destroy the old or to build the new , but out of <unk> [ 54 ] savage nature ; out of terrible <unk> [ 55 ] and <unk> [ 56 ] come at last <name> [ 57 ] and shakespeare .
i hear therefore with <name> whatever is beginning to be said of the dignity and necessity of labor to every citizen .
there is virtue yet in the hoe and the spade , [ 58 ] for learned as well as for <unk> hands .
and labor is everywhere welcome ; always we are invited to work ; only be this limitation observed , that a man shall not for the sake of wider activity sacrifice any opinion to the popular judgments and modes of action .
* * * * * i have now spoken of the education of the scholar by nature , by books , and by action .
it remains to say somewhat of his duties .
they are such as become man thinking .
they may all be comprised in self-trust .
the office of the scholar is to cheer , to raise , and to guide men by showing them facts amidst appearances .
he <unk> the slow , <unk> , and unpaid task of observation .
<unk> [ 59 ] and <name> , [ 60 ] in their glazed <unk> , may catalogue the stars with the praise of all men , and , the results being splendid and useful , honor is sure .
but he , in his private observatory , <unk> obscure and nebulous [ 61 ] stars of the human mind , which as yet no man has thought of as such ,  watching days and months sometimes for a few facts ; correcting still his old records ,  must relinquish display and immediate fame .
in the long period of his preparation he must betray often an ignorance and <unk> in popular arts , <unk> the disdain of the able who shoulder him aside .
long he must <unk> in his speech ; often forego the living for the dead .
worse yet , he must accept  how often !  poverty and solitude .
for the ease and pleasure of treading the old road , accepting the fashions , the education , the religion of society , he takes the cross of making his own , and , of course , the <unk> , the faint heart , the frequent uncertainty and loss of time , which are the <unk> and <unk> vines in the way of the <unk> and <unk> ; and the state of <unk> hostility in which he seems to stand to society , and especially to educated society .
for all this loss and scorn , what offset ?
he is to find consolation in exercising the highest functions of human nature .
he is one who raises himself from private considerations and breathes and lives on public and illustrious thoughts .
he is the world 's eye .
he is the world 's heart .
he is to resist the vulgar prosperity that <unk> ever to barbarism , by preserving and communicating heroic sentiments , <name> biographies , melodious verse , and the conclusions of history .
whatsoever oracles the human heart , in all emergencies , in all solemn hours , has uttered as its commentary on the world of actions ,  these he shall receive and impart .
and whatsoever new verdict reason from her inviolable seat <unk> on the passing men and events of to-day ,  this he shall hear and <unk> .
these being his functions , it becomes him to feel all confidence in himself , and to defer never to the popular cry .
he and he only knows the world .
the world of any moment is the merest appearance .
some great decorum , some <unk> [ 62 ] of a government , some <unk> trade , or war , or man , is cried up [ 63 ] by half mankind and cried down by the other half , as if all depended on this particular up or down .
the odds are that the whole question is not worth the poorest thought which the scholar has lost in listening to the controversy .
let him not quit his belief that a <unk> is a <unk> , though the ancient and honorable [ 64 ] of the earth affirm it to be the crack of doom .
in silence , in steadiness , in severe abstraction , let him hold by himself ; add observation to observation , patient of neglect , patient of reproach , and bide his own time ,  happy enough if he can satisfy himself alone that this day he has seen something truly .
success <unk> on every right step .
for the instinct is sure that <unk> him to tell his brother what he thinks .
he then learns that in going down into the secrets of his own mind he has descended into the secrets of all minds .
he learns that he who has mastered any law in his private thoughts is master to that extent of all men whose language he speaks , and of all into whose language his own can be translated .
the poet , in utter solitude remembering his spontaneous thoughts and recording them , is found to have recorded that which men in cities vast find true for them also .
the orator <unk> at first the fitness of his <name> confessions , his want of knowledge of the persons he addresses , until he finds that he is the complement [ 65 ] of his hearers ;  that they drink his words because he <unk> for them their own nature ; the deeper he dives into his <unk> , <unk> presentiment , to his wonder he finds this is the most acceptable , most public and universally true .
the people delight in it ; the better part of every man feels  this is my music ; this is myself .
in self-trust all the virtues are comprehended .
free should the scholar be ,  free and brave .
free even to the definition of freedom , " without any hindrance that does not arise out of his own constitution . "
brave ; for fear is a thing which a scholar by his very function puts behind him .
fear always springs from ignorance .
it is a shame to him if his <unk> , amid dangerous times , arise from the presumption that like children and women his is a protected class ; or if he seek a temporary peace by the diversion of his thoughts from politics or vexed questions , hiding his head like an ostrich in the flowering bushes , peeping into <unk> , and turning rhymes , as a boy whistles to keep his courage up .
so is the danger a danger still ; so is the fear worse .
<unk> let him turn and face it .
let him look into its eye and search its nature , inspect its origin ,  see the <unk> of this lion ,  which lies no great way back ; he <name> then find in himself a perfect comprehension of its nature and extent ; he <name> have made his hands meet on the other side , and can henceforth defy it and pass on superior .
the world is his who can see through its pretension .
what <unk> , what <unk> custom , what overgrown error you behold is there only by sufferance ,  by your sufferance .
see it to be a lie , and you have already dealt it its mortal blow .
yes , we are the cowed ,  we the <unk> .
it is a mischievous notion that we are come late into nature ; that the world was finished a long time ago .
as the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of god , so it is ever to so much of his attributes as we bring to it .
to ignorance and sin it is flint .
they adapt themselves to it as they may ; but in proportion as a man has any thing in him divine , the firmament flows before him and takes his <unk> [ 66 ] and form .
not he is great who can alter matter , but he who can alter my state of mind .
they are the kings of the world who give the color of their present thought to all nature and all <name> , and persuade men , by the cheerful serenity of their carrying the matter , that this thing which they do is the apple which the ages have desired to pluck , now at last ripe , and inviting nations to the harvest .
the great man makes the great thing .
wherever <unk> [ 67 ] sits , there is the head of the table .
linnæus [ 68 ] makes botany the most alluring of studies , and wins it from the farmer and the <unk> : davy , [ 69 ] chemistry ; and cuvier , [ 70 ] fossils .
the day is always his who works in it with serenity and great aims .
the unstable estimates of men crowd to him whose mind is filled with a truth , as the heaped waves of the atlantic follow the moon .
[ 71 ] for this self-trust , the reason is deeper than can be <unk> ,  darker than can be enlightened .
i might not <name> with me the feeling of my audience in stating my own belief .
but i have already shown the ground of my <name> , in <unk> to the doctrine that man is one .
i believe man has been wronged ; he has wronged himself .
he has almost lost the light that can lead him back to his prerogatives .
men are become of no account .
men in history , men in the world of to-day , are bugs , are spawn , and are called " the mass " and " the herd . "
in a century , in a <unk> , one or two men ; [ 72 ] that is to say , one or two <unk> to the right state of every man .
all the rest behold in the hero or the poet their own green and crude being ,  ripened ; yes , and are content to be less , so that may attain to its full stature .
what a testimony , full of grandeur , full of pity , is borne to the demands of his own nature , by the poor <unk> , the poor partisan , who rejoices in the <name> of his chief !
the poor and the low find some amends to their immense moral capacity , for their acquiescence in a political and social inferiority .
[ 73 ] they are content to be brushed like flies from the path of a great person , so that justice shall be done by him to that common nature which it is the dearest <name> of all to see enlarged and glorified .
they sun themselves in the great man 's light , and feel it to be their own element .
they cast the dignity of man from their <unk> selves upon the shoulders of a hero , and <name> perish to add one drop of blood to make that great heart beat , those giant <unk> combat and conquer .
he lives for us , and we live in him .
men such as they [ 74 ] are very naturally seek money or power ; and power because it is as good as money ,  the " spoils , " so called , " of office . "
and why not ?
for they aspire to the highest , and this , in their <unk> , they dream is highest .
wake them and they shall quit the false good and leap to the true , and leave governments to clerks and desks .
this revolution is to be wrought by the gradual domestication of the idea of culture .
the main enterprise of the world for splendor , for extent , is the <unk> of a man .
here are the materials strewn along the ground .
the private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy , more formidable to its enemy , more sweet and serene in its influence to its friend , than any kingdom in history .
for a man , rightly viewed , <unk> [ 75 ] the particular natures of all men .
each philosopher , each bard , each actor has only done for me , as by a delegate , what one day i can do for myself .
the books which once we valued more than the apple of the eye , we have quite exhausted .
what is that but saying that we have come up with the point of view which the universal mind took through the eyes of one scribe ; we have been that man , and have passed on .
first , one , then another , we drain all <unk> , and <unk> greater by all these supplies , we crave a better and a more abundant food .
the man has never lived that can feed us ever .
the human mind can not be <unk> in a person who shall set a barrier on any one side to this unbounded , <unk> empire .
it is one central fire , which , flaming now out of the lips of <unk> , <unk> the capes of sicily , and now out of the throat of vesuvius , <unk> the towers and vineyards of naples .
it is one light which beams out of a thousand stars .
it is one soul which <unk> all men .
* * * * * but i have dwelt perhaps tediously upon this abstraction of the scholar .
i ought not to delay longer to add what i have to say of nearer reference to the time and to this country .
historically , there is thought to be a difference in the ideas which <unk> over successive epochs , and there are data for marking the genius of the classic , of the romantic , and now of the reflective or philosophical age .
[ 76 ] with the views i have intimated of the <unk> or the identity of the mind through all individuals , i do not much dwell on these differences .
in fact , i believe each individual passes through all three .
the boy is a greek ; the youth , romantic ; the adult , reflective .
i deny not , however , that a revolution in the leading idea may be distinctly enough traced .
our age is <unk> as the age of <unk> .
[ 77 ] must that needs be evil ?
we , it seems , are critical .
we are embarrassed with second thoughts .
[ 78 ] we can not enjoy anything for hankering to know whereof the pleasure consists .
we are lined with eyes .
we see with our feet .
the time is infected with hamlet 's unhappiness ,  " <unk> o'er with the pale cast of thought .
" [ 79 ] is it so bad then ?
sight is the last thing to be pitied .
would we be blind ?
do we fear lest we should <unk> nature and god , and drink truth dry ?
i look upon the discontent of the literary class as a mere announcement of the fact that they find themselves not in the state of mind of their fathers , and regret the coming state as untried ; as a boy dreads the water before he has learned that he can swim .
if there is any period one would <name> to be born in , is it not the age of revolution ; when the old and the new stand side by side and admit of being compared ; when the energies of all men are searched by fear and by <name> ; when the historic glories of the old can be compensated by the <name> possibilities of the new <name> ?
this time , like all times , is a very good one , if we but know what to do with it .
i read with some <name> of the auspicious signs of the coming days , as they glimmer already through poetry and <name> , through philosophy and science , through church and state .
one of these signs is the fact that the same movement [ 80 ] which effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the state assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect .
instead of the sublime and beautiful , the near , the low , the common , was explored and <unk> .
that which had been <unk> trodden under foot by those who were <unk> and <unk> themselves for long journeys into far countries , is suddenly found to be richer than all foreign parts .
the literature of the poor , the feelings of the child , the philosophy of the street , the meaning of household life , are the topics of the time .
it is a great stride .
it is a sign  is it not ?  of new vigor when the extremities are made active , when currents of warm life run into the hands and the feet .
i ask not for the great , the remote , the romantic ; what is doing in italy or arabia ; what is greek <name> , or <unk> <unk> ; i embrace the common , i explore and sit at the feet of the familiar , the low .
give me insight into to-day , and you may have the antique and future worlds .
what would we really know the meaning of ?
the meal in the <unk> ; the milk in the pan ; the ballad in the street ; the news of the boat ; the glance of the eye ; the form and the gait of the body ;  show me the ultimate reason of these matters ; show me the sublime presence of the highest spiritual cause lurking , as always it does <unk> , in these suburbs and extremities of nature ; let me see every trifle bristling with the polarity that ranges it instantly on an eternal law ; [ 81 ] and the shop , the plow , and the ledger referred to the like cause by which light <unk> and poets sing ;  and the world lies no longer a dull <unk> and <unk> , but has form and order : there is no trifle , there is no puzzle , but one design unites and <unk> the farthest pinnacle and the lowest trench .
this idea has inspired the genius of goldsmith , [ 82 ] burns , [ 83 ] <unk> , [ 84 ] and , in a newer time , of goethe , [ 85 ] wordsworth , [ 86 ] and carlyle .
[ 87 ] this idea they have differently followed and with various success .
in contrast with their writing , the style of pope , [ 88 ] of <name> , [ 89 ] of gibbon , [ 90 ] looks cold and <unk> .
this writing is <unk> .
man is surprised to find that things near are not less beautiful and wondrous than things remote .
the near explains the far .
the drop is a small ocean .
a man is related to all nature .
this perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries .
goethe , in this very thing the most modern of the <unk> , has shown us , as none ever did , the genius of the ancients .
there is one man of genius who has done much for this philosophy of life , whose literary value has never yet been rightly estimated :  i mean <name> swedenborg .
[ 91 ] the most imaginative of men , yet writing with the precision of a mathematician , he endeavored to <unk> a purely philosophical ethics on the popular christianity of his time .
such an attempt of course must have difficulty which no genius could <unk> .
but he saw and showed the connexion between nature and the affections of the soul .
he pierced the emblematic or spiritual character of the visible , audible , tangible world .
especially did his <unk> muse hover over and interpret the lower parts of nature ; he showed the mysterious bond that allies moral evil to the foul material forms , and has given in <unk> <unk> a theory of insanity , of beasts , of unclean and fearful things .
another sign of our times , also marked by an analogous political movement , is the new importance given to the single person .
everything that tends to insulate the individual  to surround him with barriers of natural respect , so that each man shall feel the world is his , and man shall treat with man as a sovereign state with a sovereign state  tends to true union as well as greatness .
" i learned , " said the melancholy <unk> , [ 92 ] " that no man in god 's wide earth is either willing or able to help any other man . "
help must come from the bosom alone .
the scholar is that man who must take up into himself all the ability of the time , all the contributions of the past , all the hopes of the future .
he must be an university of <unk> .
if there be one lesson more than another that should pierce his ear , it is  the world is nothing , the man is all ; in yourself is the law of all nature , and you know not yet how a <unk> of sap ascends ; in yourself slumbers the whole of reason ; it is for you to know all ; it is for you to dare all .
mr. president and gentlemen , this confidence in the <unk> might of man belongs , by all motives , by all prophecy , by all preparation , to the american scholar .
we have listened too long to the courtly muses of europe .
the spirit of the american <name> is already suspected to be timid , imitative , tame .
public and private avarice make the air we breathe thick and fat .
the scholar is decent , indolent , <unk> .
see already the tragic consequence .
the mind of this country , taught to aim at low objects , eats upon itself .
there is no work for any one but the decorous and the <unk> .
young men of the fairest promise , who begin life upon our shores , inflated by the mountain winds , shined upon by all the stars of god , find the earth below not in unison with these , but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire , and turn <unk> , or die of disgust , some of them <unk> .
what is the remedy ?
they did not yet see , and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career do not yet see , that if the single man plant himself <unk> on his instincts , and there abide , the huge world <name> come round to him .
<name> ,  <name> ; with the shades of all the good and great for company ; and for solace the perspective of your own infinite life ; and for work the study and the communication of principles , the making those instincts prevalent , the conversion of the world .
is it not the chief disgrace in the world , not to be an unit ; not to be reckoned one character ; not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear , but to be reckoned in the gross , in the hundred , or the thousand , of the party , the section , to which we belong ; and our opinion predicted <unk> , as the north , or the south ?
not so , brothers and friends ,  please god , ours shall not be so .
we <name> walk on our own feet ; we <name> work with our own hands ; we <name> speak our own minds .
then shall man be no longer a name for pity , for doubt , and for sensual indulgence .
the dread of man and the love of man shall be a wall of defense and a wreath of <name> around all .
a nation of men <name> for the first time exist , because each believes himself inspired by the divine soul which also inspires all men .
compensation .
[ 93 ] the wings of time are black and white , pied with morning and with night .
mountain tall and ocean deep trembling balance duly keep .
in changing moon , in tidal wave , glows the feud of want and have .
gauge of more and less through space electric <name> and pencil plays .
the lonely earth amid the balls that hurry through the eternal halls , a <unk> flying to the void , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> spark , shoots across the neutral dark .
man 's the elm , and wealth the vine , stanch and strong the tendrils twine ; through the frail ringlets thee deceive , none from its stock that vine can <unk> .
fear not , then , thou child infirm , there 's no god dare wrong a worm .
<name> crowns cleave to deserts , and power to him who power exerts ; hast not thy share ?
on winged feet , lo !
it rushes thee to meet ; and all that nature made thy own , floating in air or pent in stone , <name> rive the hills and swim the sea , and , like thy shadow , follow thee .
ever since i was a boy , i have wished to write a discourse on compensation : for it seemed to me when very young , that on this subject life was ahead of theology , and the people knew more than the preachers taught .
the documents , [ 94 ] too , from which the doctrine is to be drawn , charmed my fancy by their endless variety , and lay always before me , even in sleep ; for they are the tools in our hands , the bread in our basket , the transactions of the street , the farm , and the <unk> , greetings , relations , debts and <unk> , the influence of character , the nature and endowment of all men .
it seemed to me , also , that in it might be shown men a <name> of divinity , the present action of the soul of this world , clean from all vestige of tradition , and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love , conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be , because it really is now .
it appeared , moreover , that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us , it would be a <name> in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey that would not suffer us to lose our way .
i was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church .
the preacher , a man esteemed for his orthodoxy , unfolded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the last judgment .
he assumed that judgment is not executed in this world ; that the wicked are successful ; that the good are miserable ; [ 95 ] and then urged from reason and from scripture a compensation to be made to both parties in the next life .
no offense appeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine .
as far as i could observe , when the meeting broke up , they separated without remark on the sermon .
yet what was the import of this teaching ?
what did the preacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in the present life ?
was it that houses and lands , offices , wine , horses , dress , luxury , are had by unprincipled men , whilst the saints are poor and despised ; and that a compensation is to be made to these last hereafter , by giving them the like <unk> another day ,  bank stock and <unk> , [ 96 ] venison and champagne ?
this must be the compensation intended ; for what else ?
is it that they are to have leave to pray and praise ?
to love and serve men ?
why , that they can do now .
the legitimate inference the disciple would draw was : " we are to have such a good time as the sinners have now " ; or , to push it to its extreme import : " you sin now ; we shall sin by and by ; we would sin now , if we could ; not being successful , we expect our revenue to-morrow . "
the fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful ; that justice is not done now .
the blindness of the preacher consisted in <unk> to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly success , instead of confronting and <unk> the world from the truth ; announcing the presence of the soul ; the <unk> of the <name> : and so establishing the standard of good and ill , of success and falsehood .
i find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day , and the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they treat the related topics .
i think that our popular theology has gained in decorum , and not in principle , over the superstitions it has displaced .
but men are better than this theology .
their daily life gives it the lie .
every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experience ; and all men feel sometimes the falsehood which they can not demonstrate .
few men are wiser than they know .
that which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought , if said in conversation , would probably be questioned in silence .
if a man <unk> in a mixed company on providence and the divine laws , he is answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer , but his incapacity to make his own statement .
i shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts that indicate the path of the law of compensation ; happy beyond my expectation , if i shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle .
polarity , [ 97 ] or action and reaction , we meet in every part of nature ; in darkness and light ; in heat and cold ; in the ebb and flow of waters ; in male and female ; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and animals ; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the animal body ; in the <unk> and <unk> [ 98 ] of the heart ; in the undulations of fluids , and of sound ; in the centrifugal and centripetal gravity ; in electricity , <unk> , and chemical affinity .
<unk> magnetism at one end of a needle ; the opposite magnetism takes place at the other end .
if the south attracts , the north <unk> .
to empty here , you must condense there .
an inevitable <unk> <unk> nature , so that each thing is a half , and suggests another thing to make it whole ; as , spirit , matter ; man , woman ; odd , even ; <unk> , objective ; in , out ; upper , under ; motion , rest ; yea , nay .
whilst the world is thus <unk> , so is every one of its parts .
the entire system of things gets represented in every particle .
there is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea , day and night , man and woman , in a single needle of the pine , in a kernel of corn , in each individual of every animal tribe .
the reaction , so grand in the elements , is repeated within these small boundaries .
for example , in the animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures are favorites , but a certain compensation balances every gift and every defect .
a <unk> given to one part is paid out of a reduction from another part of the same creature .
if the head and neck are enlarged , the trunk and extremities are cut short .
the theory of the mechanic forces is another example .
what we gain in power is lost in time ; and the converse .
the <unk> or compensating errors of the planets is another instance .
the influences of climate and soil in political history is another .
the cold climate <unk> .
the barren soil does not breed fevers , crocodiles , tigers , or scorpions .
the same <unk> <unk> the nature and condition of man .
every excess causes a defect ; every defect an excess .
every sweet hath its sour ; every evil its good .
every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse .
it is to answer for its moderation with its life .
for every grain of wit there is a grain of folly .
for everything you have missed , you have gained something else ; and for everything you gain , you lose something .
if riches increase , they are increased [ 99 ] that use them .
if the <unk> gathers too much , nature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest , swells the estate , but kills the owner .
nature hates <unk> and exceptions .
the waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing , than the varieties of condition tend to <unk> themselves .
there is always some <unk> circumstance that puts down the overbearing , the strong , the <name> , the fortunate , substantially on the same ground with all others .
is a man too strong and fierce for society , and by temper and position a bad citizen ,  a morose ruffian , with a dash of the pirate in him ;  nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters , who are getting along in the dame 's classes at the village school , and love and fear for them <unk> his grim scowl to courtesy .
thus she <unk> to <unk> [ 100 ] the granite and <unk> , takes the boar out and puts the lamb in , and keeps her balance true .
the farmer imagines power and place are fine things .
but the president has paid dear for his white house .
[ 101 ] it has commonly cost him all his peace , and the best of his many attributes .
to preserve for a short time so conspicuous an appearance before the world , he is content to eat dust [ 102 ] before the real masters who stand erect behind the throne .
or , do men <name> the more substantial and permanent grandeur of genius ?
neither has this an immunity .
he who by force of <name> or of thought , is great , and overlooks [ 103 ] thousands , has the charges of that eminence .
with every influx of light comes new danger .
has he light ?
he must bear witness to the light , and always outrun that sympathy which gives him such keen satisfaction , by his fidelity to new revelations of the incessant soul .
he must hate father and mother , wife and child .
has he all that the world loves and admires and <unk> ?  he must cast behind him their admiration , and afflict them by faithfulness to his truth , and become a <unk> and a hissing .
this law writes the laws of cities and nations .
it is in vain to build or plot or combine against it .
things refuse to be <unk> long .
res <unk> <unk> male <unk> [ 104 ] though no checks to a new evil appear , the checks exist , and <name> appear .
if the government is cruel , the governor 's life is not safe .
if you tax too high , the revenue <name> yield nothing .
if you make the criminal code sanguinary , <unk> <name> not convict .
if the law is too mild , private vengeance comes in .
if the government is a terrific democracy , the pressure is resisted by an <unk> of energy in the citizen , and life glows with a fiercer flame .
the true life and <unk> of man seem to elude the utmost <unk> or <unk> of condition , and to establish themselves with great <unk> under all varieties of circumstances .
under all governments the influence of character remains the same ,  in turkey and in new england about alike .
under the primeval despots of egypt , history honestly confesses that man must have been as free as culture could make him .
these appearances indicate the fact that the universe is represented in every one of its particles .
everything in nature contains all the powers of nature .
everything is made of one hidden stuff ; as the naturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis , and regards a horse as a running man , a fish as a swimming man , a bird as a flying man , a tree as a rooted man .
each new form repeats not only the main character of the type , but part for part all the details , all the aims , <unk> , <unk> , energies , and whole system of every other .
every occupation , trade , <name> , transaction , is a <unk> of the world and a <unk> of every other .
each one is an entire emblem of human life ; of its good and ill , its trials , its enemies , its course and its end .
and each one must somehow accommodate the whole man , and recite all his <name> .
the world globes itself in a drop of dew .
[ 105 ] the microscope can not find the <unk> which is less perfect for being little .
[ 106 ] eyes , ears , taste , smell , motion , resistance , appetite , and organs of reproduction that take hold on eternity ,  all find room to consist in the small creature .
so do we put our life into every act .
the true doctrine of omnipresence is , that god reappears with all his parts in every moss and cobweb .
[ 107 ] the value of the universe <unk> to throw itself into every point .
if the good is there , so is the evil ; if the affinity , so the repulsion ; if the force , so the limitation .
thus is the universe alive .
all things are moral .
that soul , which within us is a sentiment , outside of us is a law .
we feel its inspiration ; out there in history we can see its fatal strength .
" it is in the world , and the world was made by it . "
justice is not postponed .
a perfect <unk> <unk> its balance in all parts of life .
[ greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] , [ 108 ]  the dice of god are always loaded .
the world looks like a multiplication table , or a mathematical equation , which , turn it how you <name> , balances itself .
take what figure you <name> , its exact value , nor more nor less , still returns to you .
every secret is told , every crime is punished , every virtue rewarded , every wrong <unk> , in silence and certainty .
what we call retribution is the universal necessity by which the whole appears wherever a part appears .
if you see smoke , there must be fire .
if you see a hand or limb , you know that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind .
every act rewards itself , or , in other words , <unk> itself , in a twofold manner ; first , in the thing , or in real nature ; and secondly , in the circumstance , or in apparent nature .
men call the circumstance the retribution .
the <unk> retribution is in the thing , and is seen by the soul .
the retribution in the circumstance is seen by the understanding ; it is inseparable from the thing , but is often spread over a long time , and so does not become distinct until after many years .
the specific stripes may follow late after the offense , but they follow because they accompany it .
crime and punishment grow out of one stem .
punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which concealed it .
cause and effect , means and ends , seed and fruit , can not be severed ; for the effect already blooms in the cause , the end <unk> in the means , the fruit in the seed .
whilst thus the world <name> be whole , and refuses to be <unk> , we seek to act partially , to <unk> , to appropriate ; for example ,  to gratify the senses , we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs of the character .
the ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the solution of one problem ,  how to detach the sensual sweet , the sensual strong , the sensual bright , etc. , from the moral sweet , the moral deep , the moral fair ; that is , again , to contrive to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as to leave it bottomless ; to get a one end , without an other end .
the soul says , eat ; the body would feast .
the soul says , the man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul ; the body would join the flesh only .
the soul says , have dominion over all things to the ends of virtue ; the body would have the power over things to its own ends .
the soul strives <unk> [ 109 ] to live and work through all things .
it would be the only fact .
all things shall be added unto it ,  power , pleasure , knowledge , beauty .
the particular man aims to be somebody ; to set up for himself ; to truck and <unk> for a private good ; and , in particulars , to ride , that he may ride ; to dress , that he may be dressed ; to eat , that he may eat ; and to govern , that he may be seen .
men seek to be great ; they would have offices , wealth , power , and fame .
they think that to be great is to possess one side of nature ,  the sweet , without the other side ,  the bitter .
this dividing and <unk> is steadily counteracted .
up to this day , it must be owned , no <unk> has had the smallest success .
the parted water <unk> behind our hand .
pleasure is taken out of pleasant things , profit out of profitable things , power out of strong things , as soon as we seek to separate them from the whole .
we can no more have things and get the sensual good , by itself , than we can get an inside that shall have no outside , or a light without a shadow .
" drive out nature with a fork , she comes running back .
" [ 110 ] life <unk> itself with inevitable conditions , which the unwise seek to dodge , which one and another <unk> that he does not know ; that they do not touch him ;  but the brag is on his lips , the conditions are in his soul .
if he escapes them in one part , they attack him in another more vital part .
if he has escaped them in form , and in the appearance , it is because he has resisted his life , and fled from himself , and the retribution is so much death .
so signal is the failure of all attempts to make this separation of the good from the tax , that the experiment would not be tried ,  since to try it is to be mad ,  but for the circumstance , that when the disease began in the <name> , of rebellion and separation , the intellect is at once infected , so that the man ceases to see god whole in each object , but is able to see the sensual <unk> of an object , and not see the sensual hurt ; he sees the mermaid 's head , but not the dragon 's tail ; and thinks he can cut off that which he would have , from that which he would not have .
" how secret <name> thou who <unk> in the highest heavens in silence , o thou only great god , sprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal <unk> upon such as have unbridled desires !
" [ 111 ] the human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable , of history , of law , of proverbs , of conversation .
it finds a tongue in literature unawares .
thus the greeks called jupiter , [ 112 ] supreme mind ; but having <unk> ascribed to him many base actions , they involuntarily made amends to reason , by tying up the hands [ 113 ] of so bad a god .
he is made as helpless as a king of england .
[ 114 ] prometheus [ 115 ] knows one secret which jove must bargain for ; <name> , [ 116 ] another .
he can not get his own thunders ; <name> keeps the key of them .
" of all the gods , i only know the keys that <unk> the solid doors within whose vaults his thunders sleep . "
a plain confession of the <unk> of the all , and of its moral aim .
the indian mythology ends in the same ethics ; and it would seem impossible for any fable to be invented to get any currency which was not moral .
<name> [ 117 ] forgot to ask youth for her lover , and though <unk> is immortal , he is old , achilles [ 118 ] is not quite invulnerable ; the sacred waters did not wash the heel by which <unk> held him .
<unk> , [ 119 ] in the <unk> , is not quite immortal , for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was bathing in the <unk> blood , and that spot which it covered is mortal .
and so it must be .
there is a crack in everything god has made .
it would seem , there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares , even into the wild <unk> in which the human fancy attempted to make bold holiday , and to shake itself free of the old laws ,  this <unk> , this kick of the gun , <unk> that the law is fatal ; that in nature nothing can be given , all things are sold .
this is that ancient doctrine of <unk> , [ 120 ] who keeps watch in the universe , and lets no offense go <unk> .
the furies , [ 121 ] they said , are attendants on justice , and if the sun in heaven should <unk> his path , they would punish him .
the poets related that stone walls , and iron swords , and leathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of their owners ; that the belt which ajax gave <name> [ 122 ] dragged the trojan hero over the field at the wheels of the car of achilles , and the sword which <name> gave ajax was that on whose point ajax fell .
they recorded , that when the <unk> [ 123 ] erected a statue to <unk> , a <name> in the games , one of his rivals went to it by night , and endeavored to throw it down by repeated blows , until at last he moved it from its pedestal , and was crushed to death beneath its fall .
this voice of fable has in it somewhat divine .
it came from thought above the <name> of the writer .
that is the best part of each writer , which has nothing private in it ; [ 124 ] that which he does not know , that which flowed out of his constitution , and not from his too active invention ; that which in the study of a single artist you might not easily find , but in the study of many , you would abstract as the spirit of them all .
phidias it is not , but the work of man in that early <unk> [ 125 ] world , that i would know .
the name and circumstance of phidias , however convenient for history , embarrass when we come to the highest criticism .
we are to see that which man was tending to do in a given period , and was hindered , or , if you <name> , modified in doing , by the interfering <unk> of phidias , of <name> , of shakespeare , the organ whereby man at the moment wrought .
still more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs of all nations , which are always the literature of reason , or the statements of an absolute truth , without qualification .
proverbs , like the sacred books of each nation , are the sanctuary of the intuitions .
that which the droning world , chained to appearances , <name> not allow the <unk> to say in his own words , it <name> suffer him to say in proverbs without contradiction .
and this law of laws which the pulpit , the senate , and the college deny , is hourly preached in all markets and workshops by flights of proverbs , whose teaching is as true and as <unk> as that of birds and flies .
all things are double , one against <unk>  <unk> for tat ; [ 126 ] an eye for an eye ; a tooth for a tooth ; blood for blood ; measure for measure ; love for <unk>  give and it shall be given <unk>   he that <unk> shall be watered <unk>  what <name> you have ?
quoth god ; pay for it and take it.  nothing venture , nothing <unk>  thou shalt be paid exactly for what thou hast done , no more , no <unk>  who doth not work shall not <unk>  harm watch , harm <unk>  curses always recoil on the head of him who <unk> them.  if you put a chain around the neck of a slave , the other end <unk> itself around your <unk>  bad counsel <unk> the <unk>  the devil is an ass .
it is thus written , because it is thus in life .
our action is <unk> and characterized above our <name> by the law of nature .
we aim at a petty end quite aside from the public good , but our act arranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of the world .
a man can not speak but he judges himself .
with his <name> , or against his <name> , he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every word .
every opinion reacts on him who utters it .
it is a <unk> thrown at a <name> , but the other end remains in the <unk> 's bag .
or , rather , it is a harpoon hurled at the whale , <unk> , as it flies , a coil of cord in the boat , and if the harpoon is not good , or not well thrown , it <name> go nigh to cut the steersman in twain , or to sink the boat .
you can not do wrong without suffering wrong .
" no man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him , " said burke .
[ 127 ] the exclusive in fashionable life does not see that he <unk> himself from enjoyment in the attempt to appropriate it .
the <unk> in religion does not see that he shuts the door of heaven on himself , in striving to shut out others .
treat men as <unk> [ 128 ] and <unk> , and you shall suffer as well as they .
if you leave out their heart , you shall lose your own .
the senses would make things of all persons ; of women , of children , of the poor .
the vulgar proverb , " i <name> get it from his purse or get it from his skin , " is sound philosophy .
all <unk> of love and <unk> in our social relations are speedily punished .
they are punished by fear .
whilst i stand in simple relations to my <unk> , i have no displeasure in meeting him .
we meet as water meets water , or as two currents of air mix , with perfect diffusion and <unk> of nature .
but as soon as there is any departure from simplicity , and attempt at <unk> , or good for me that is not good for him , my neighbor feels the wrong ; he shrinks from me as far as i have shrunk from him ; his eyes no longer seek mine ; there is war between us ; there is hate in him and fear in me .
all the old abuses in society , universal and particular , all unjust accumulations of property and power , are avenged in the same manner .
fear is an instructor of great sagacity , and the herald of all revolutions .
one thing he teaches , that there is <unk> where he appears .
he is a carrion crow , and though you see not well what he hovers for , there is death somewhere .
our property is timid , our laws are timid , our cultivated classes are timid .
fear for ages has <unk> and <unk> and <unk> over government and property .
that obscene [ 129 ] bird is not there for nothing .
he indicates great wrongs which must be revised .
of the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly follows the suspension of our voluntary activity .
the terror of cloudless noon , the <name> of polycrates , [ 130 ] the awe of prosperity , the instinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of a <name> <unk> and <unk> virtue , are the <unk> of the balance of justice through the heart and mind of man .
experienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay <name> and lot [ 131 ] as they go along , and that a man often pays dear for a small <unk> .
the <unk> runs in his own debt .
has a man gained anything who has received a hundred favors and rendered none ?
has he gained by borrowing , through indolence or cunning , his <unk> wares , or horses , or money ?
there arises on the deed the instant acknowledgment of benefit on the one part , and of debt on the other ; that is , of superiority and inferiority .
the transaction remains in the memory of himself and his neighbor ; and every new transaction alters , according to its nature , their relation to each other .
he may soon come to see that he had better have broken his own bones than to have ridden in his neighbor 's coach , and that " the highest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it . "
a wise man <name> extend this lesson to all parts of life , and know that it is the part of <name> to face every claimant , and pay every just demand on your time , your talents , or your heart .
always pay ; for , first or last , you must pay your entire debt .
persons and events may stand for a time between you and justice , but it is only a postponement .
you must pay at last your own debt .
if you are wise , you <name> dread a prosperity which only loads you with more .
benefit is the end of nature .
but for every benefit which you receive , a tax is levied .
he is great who <unk> the most benefits .
he is base  and that is the one base thing in the universe  to receive favors and render none .
in the order of nature we can not render benefits to those from whom we receive them , or only seldom .
[ 132 ] but the benefit we receive must be rendered again , line for line , deed for deed , cent for cent , to somebody .
beware of too much good staying in your hand .
it <name> fast corrupt and worm worms .
[ 133 ] pay it away quickly in some sort .
labor is watched over by the same pitiless laws .
cheapest , say the prudent , is the dearest labor .
what we buy in a broom , a mat , a wagon , a knife , is some application of good sense to a common want .
it is best to pay in your land a skillful gardener , or to buy good sense applied to gardening ; in your sailor , good sense applied to navigation ; in the house , good sense applied to cooking , sewing , serving ; in your agent , good sense applied to accounts and affairs .
so do you multiply your presence , or spread yourself throughout your estate .
but because of the <unk> constitution of things , in labor as in life there can be no cheating .
the thief steals from himself .
the swindler <unk> himself .
for the real price of labor is knowledge and virtue , whereof wealth and credit are signs .
these signs , like paper money , may be <unk> or stolen , but that which they represent , namely , knowledge and virtue , can not be <unk> or stolen .
these ends of labor can not be answered but by real exertions of the mind , and in obedience to pure motives .
the cheat , the defaulter , the gambler , can not extort the knowledge of material and moral nature which his honest care and pains yield to the <unk> .
the law of nature is , do the thing , and you shall have the power : but they who do not the thing have not the power .
human labor , through all its forms , from the sharpening of a stake to the construction of a city or an epic , is one immense illustration of the perfect compensation of the universe .
the absolute balance of give and take , the doctrine that everything has its price ,  and if that price is not paid , not that thing but something else is obtained , and that it is impossible to get anything without its price ,  is not less sublime in the columns of a ledger than in the <unk> of states , in the laws of light and darkness , in all the action and reaction of nature .
i can not doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those processes with which he is conversant , the stern ethics which <name> on his chisel edge , which are measured out by his plumb and foot rule , which stand as manifest in the footing of the shop <name> as in the history of a state ,  do recommend to him his trade , and though seldom named , exalt his business to his imagination .
the league between virtue and nature engages all things to assume a hostile front to vice .
the beautiful laws and substances of the world persecute and whip the traitor .
he finds that things are arranged for truth and benefit , but there is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue .
commit a crime , [ 134 ] and the earth is made of glass .
commit a crime , and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground , such as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and mole .
you can not recall the spoken word , [ 135 ] you can not wipe out the <unk> , you can not draw up the ladder , so as to leave no inlet or clew .
some damning circumstance always <unk> .
the laws and substances of nature  water , snow , wind , gravitation  become penalties to the thief .
on the other hand , the law holds with equal <unk> for all right action .
love , and you shall be loved .
all love is mathematically just , as much as the two sides of an <unk> equation .
the good man has absolute good , which like fire turns everything to its own nature , so that you can not do him any harm ; but as the <name> armies sent against <name> , when he approached , cast down their colors and from enemies became friends , so disasters of all kinds , as sickness , offense , poverty , prove benefactors :  " winds blow and waters roll strength to the brave , and power and deity , yet in themselves are nothing . "
the good are befriended even by weakness and defect .
as no man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him , so no man had ever a defect that was not somewhere made useful to him .
the stag in the fable [ 136 ] admired his horns and blamed his feet , but when the <name> came , his feet saved him , and afterwards , caught in the thicket , his horns destroyed him .
every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults .
as no man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it , so no man has a thorough acquaintance with the <unk> or talents of men , until he has suffered from the one , and seen the triumph of the other over his own want of the same .
has he a defect of temper that <unk> him to live in society ?
thereby he is driven to entertain himself alone , and acquire habits of <unk> ; and thus , like the wounded oyster , he <unk> his shell with <name> .
our strength grows out of our weakness .
the indignation which arms itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed .
a great man is always willing to be little .
whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages , he goes to sleep .
when he is punished , tormented , defeated , he has a chance to learn something ; he has been put on his wits , on his manhood ; he has gained facts ; learns his ignorance ; is cured of the insanity of conceit ; has got moderation and real skill .
the wise man throws himself on the side of his assailants .
it is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point .
the wound <unk> and falls off from him like a dead skin , and when they would triumph , lo !
he has passed on invulnerable .
blame is safer than praise .
i hate to be defended in a newspaper .
as long as all that is said is said against me , i feel a certain assurance of success .
but as soon as <unk> words of praise are spoken for me , i feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies .
in general , every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor .
as the sandwich <unk> believes that the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself , so we gain the strength of the temptation we resist .
the same guards which protect us from disaster , defect , and enmity , defend us , if we <name> , from selfishness and fraud .
bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions , nor is shrewdness in trade a <name> of wisdom .
men suffer all their life long , under the foolish superstition that they can be cheated .
but it is as impossible for a man to be cheated by anyone but himself , [ 137 ] as for a thing to be and not to be at the same time .
there is a third silent party to all our bargains .
the nature and soul of things takes on itself the <unk> of the fulfillment of every contract , so that honest service can not come to loss .
if you serve an ungrateful master , serve him the more .
put god in your debt .
every stroke shall be repaid .
the longer the payment is <unk> , [ 138 ] the better for you ; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this <unk> .
the history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature , to make water run up hill , to twist a rope of sand .
it makes no difference whether the actors be many or one , a tyrant or a mob .
a mob [ 139 ] is a society of bodies voluntarily <unk> themselves of reason , and traversing its work .
the mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast .
its fit hour of activity is night .
its actions are insane like its whole constitution ; it <unk> a principle ; it would whip a right ; it would tar and feather justice , by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these .
it resembles the prank of boys , who run with fire engines to put out the ruddy <name> streaming to the stars .
the <unk> spirit turns their spite against the <unk> .
the martyr can not be <unk> .
every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame ; every prison , a more illustrious abode ; every burned book or house <unk> the world ; every suppressed or <unk> word <unk> through the earth from side to side .
hours of sanity and consideration are always arriving to communities , as to individuals , when the truth is seen , and the martyrs are justified .
thus do all things preach the <unk> of circumstances .
the man is all .
everything has two sides , a good and an evil .
every advantage has its tax .
i learn to be content .
but the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of <unk> .
the thoughtless say , on hearing these representations , what boots it to do well ?
there is one event to good and evil ; if i gain any good , i must pay for it ; if i lose any good , i gain some other ; all actions are indifferent .
there is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation , to wit , its own nature .
the soul is not a compensation , but a life .
the soul is .
under all this running sea of circumstance , whose waters ebb and flow with perfect balance , lies the aboriginal abyss of real being .
essence , or god , is not a relation , or a part , but the whole .
being is the vast affirmative , excluding negation , <unk> , and swallowing up all relations , parts , and times within itself .
nature , truth , virtue , are the influx from thence .
vice is the absence or departure of the same .
nothing , falsehood , may indeed stand as the great night or shade , on which , as a background , the living universe paints itself forth , but no fact is <unk> by it ; it can not work , for it is not .
it can not work any good ; it can not work any harm .
it is harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be .
we feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts , because the criminal adheres to his vice and <unk> , and does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature .
there is no stunning <unk> of his nonsense before men and angels .
has he therefore outwitted the law ?
inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie with him , he so far <unk> from nature .
in some manner there <name> be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also ; but should we not see it , this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account .
neither can it be said , on the other hand , that the gain of <unk> must be bought by any loss .
there is no penalty to virtue ; no penalty to wisdom ; they are proper additions of being .
in a virtuous action , i properly am ; in a virtuous act , i add to the world ; i plant into deserts conquered from chaos and nothing , and see the darkness receding on the limits of the horizon .
there can be no excess to love ; none to knowledge ; none to beauty , when these attributes are considered in the purest sense .
the soul refuses limits , and always affirms an optimism , [ 140 ] never a <unk> .
man 's life is a progress , and not a station .
his instinct is trust .
our instinct uses " more " and " less " in application to man , of the presence of the soul , and not of its absence ; the brave man is greater than the coward ; the true , the benevolent , the wise , is more a man , and not less , than the fool and knave .
there is no tax on the good of virtue ; for that is the incoming of god himself , or absolute existence without any comparative .
material good has its tax , and if it came without desert or sweat , has no root in me , and the next wind <name> blow it away .
but all the good of nature is the soul 's , and may be had , if paid for in nature 's lawful coin , that is , by labor which the heart and the head allow .
i no longer wish to meet a good i do not earn ; for example , to find a pot of buried gold , knowing that it brings with it new burdens .
i do not wish more external goods ,  neither possessions , nor honors , nor powers , nor persons .
the gain is apparent ; the tax is certain .
but there is no tax on the knowledge that the compensation exists , and that it is not desirable to dig up treasure .
herein i rejoice with a serene eternal peace .
i contract the boundaries of possible mischief .
i learn the wisdom of st. <name> , [ 141 ]  " nothing can , work me damage except myself ; the harm , that i sustain i <name> about with me , and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault . "
in the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of condition .
the radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of more and less .
how can less not feel the pain ; how not feel indignation or <unk> towards more ?
look at those who have less faculty , and one feels sad , and knows not well what to make of it .
he almost shuns their eye ; he fears they <name> upbraid god .
what should they do ?
it seems a great injustice .
but see the facts nearly , and these mountainous inequalities vanish .
love reduces them , as the sun melts the iceberg in the sea .
the heart and soul of all men being one , this bitterness of his and mine ceases .
his is mine .
i am my brother , and my brother is me .
if i feel overshadowed and outdone by great neighbors , i can yet love ; i can still receive ; and he that <unk> maketh his own the grandeur he loves .
thereby i make the discovery that my brother is my guardian , acting for me with the <unk> designs , and the estate i so admired and envied is my own .
it is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things .
<name> [ 142 ] and shakespeare are fragments of the soul , and by love i conquer and <unk> them in my own conscious domain .
his [ 143 ] virtue ,  is not that mine ?
his wit ,  if it can not be made mine , it is not wit .
such , also , is the natural history of calamity .
the changes which break up at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements of a nature whose law is growth .
every soul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting its whole system of things , its friends , and home , and laws , and <name> , as the <unk> crawls out of its beautiful but stony case , because it no longer admits of its growth , and slowly forms a new house .
in proportion to the vigor of the individual , these revolutions are frequent , until in some happier mind they are incessant , and all worldly relations <name> very loosely about him , becoming , as it were , a transparent fluid membrane through which the living form is seen , and not , as in most men , an indurated heterogeneous fabric of many dates , and of no settled character , in which the man is imprisoned .
then there can be enlargement , and the man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday .
and such should be the outward biography of man in time , a putting off of dead circumstances day by day , as he <unk> his raiment day by day .
but to us , in our lapsed estate , resting , not advancing , resisting , not <unk> with the divine expansion , this growth comes by shocks .
we can not part with our friend .
we can not let our angels go .
we do not see that they only go out , that archangels may come in .
we are <unk> of the old .
we do not believe in the riches of the soul , in its proper eternity and omnipresence .
we do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or <unk> that beautiful yesterday .
we linger in the ruins of the old tent , where once we had bread and shelter and organs , nor believe that the spirit can feed , cover , and nerve us again .
we can not again find aught so dear , so sweet , so graceful .
but we sit and weep in vain .
the voice of the almighty saith , " up and onward forevermore ! "
we can not stay amid the ruins .
neither <name> we rely on the new ; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes , like those monsters who look backwards .
and yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also , after long intervals of time .
a fever , a mutilation , a cruel disappointment , a loss of wealth , a loss of friends , seems at the moment unpaid loss , and <unk> .
but the sure years reveal the deep <unk> force that <unk> all facts .
the death of a dear friend , wife , brother , lover , which seemed nothing but privation , somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius ; for it commonly <unk> revolutions in our way of life , terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed , breaks up a wonted occupation , or a household , or style of living , and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character .
it permits or <unk> the formation of new acquaintances , and the reception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the next years ; and the man or woman who would have remained a <name> garden flower , with no room for its roots and too much <name> for its head , by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener , is made the <unk> [ 144 ] of the forest , yielding shade and fruit to wide <unk> of men .
self-reliance " ne te <unk> extra .
" [ 145 ] " man is his own <name> ; and the soul that can render an honest and a perfect man , commands all light , all influence , all fate ; nothing to him falls early or too late .
our acts our angels are , or good or ill , our fatal shadows that walk by us still .
" [ 146 ] * * * * * cast the <unk> on the rocks , <unk> him with the <unk> 's <unk> ; <unk> with the hawk and fox , power and speed be hands and feet .
[ 147 ] i read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional .
the soul always hears an admonition in such lines , let the subject be what it may .
the sentiment they <unk> is of more value than any thought they may contain .
to believe your own thought , to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men ,  that is genius .
[ 148 ] speak your latent conviction , and it shall be the universal sense ; [ 149 ] for the inmost in due time becomes the <unk> ,  and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the last judgment .
familiar as the voice of the mind is to each , the highest merit we <unk> to <name> , plato , [ 150 ] and <name> [ 151 ] is , that they set at naught books and traditions , and spoke not what men , but what they thought .
a man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within , more than the <unk> of the firmament of bards and sages .
yet he <unk> without notice his thought , because it is his .
in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts : [ 152 ] they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty .
great works of <name> have no more affecting lesson for us than this .
they teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored <unk> then most when [ 153 ] the whole cry of voices is on the other side .
else , to-morrow a stranger <name> say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time , and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another .
there is a time in every man 's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance ; that imitation is suicide ; [ 154 ] that he must take himself for better , for worse , as his portion ; that though the wide universe is full of good , no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till .
the power which resides in him is new in nature , and none but he knows what that is which he can do , nor does he know until he has tried .
not for nothing one face , one character , one fact , makes much impression on him , and another none .
this sculpture in the memory is not without <unk> <name> .
the eye was placed where one <name> should fall , that it might testify of that particular <name> .
we but half express ourselves , [ 155 ] and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents .
it may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues , so it be faithfully imparted , but god <name> not have his work made manifest by cowards .
a man is relieved and <name> when he has put his heart into his work and done his best ; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace .
it is a deliverance which does not deliver .
in the attempt his genius deserts him ; no muse <unk> ; no invention , no <name> .
trust thyself : [ 156 ] every heart <unk> to that iron string .
accept the place the divine providence has found for you , the society of your contemporaries , the connection of events .
great men have always done so , and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age , betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart , working through their hands , <unk> in all their being .
and we are now men , and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent <name> ; and not <unk> and invalids in a protected corner , not cowards fleeing before a revolution , but guides , <unk> , and benefactors , obeying the almighty effort , and advancing on chaos [ 157 ] and the dark .
what pretty oracles nature yields us on this text , in the face and behavior of children , babes , and even brutes !
that divided and rebel mind , that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has <unk> the strength and means opposed to our purpose , these [ 158 ] have not .
their mind being whole , their eye is as yet <unk> , and when we look in their faces we are disconcerted .
infancy <unk> to nobody : all conform to it , so that one babe commonly makes four or five [ 159 ] out of the adults who <unk> and play to it .
so god has armed youth and <unk> and manhood no less with its own <unk> and charm , and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by , if it <name> stand by itself .
do not think the youth has no force , because he can not speak to you and me .
hark !
in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic .
it seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries .
bashful or bold , then , he <name> know how to make us seniors very unnecessary .
the nonchalance [ 160 ] of boys who are sure of a dinner , and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one , is the healthy attitude of human nature .
a boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the <unk> ; [ 161 ] independent , irresponsible , looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by , he tries and sentences them on their merits , in the swift , summary way of boys , as good , bad , interesting , silly , eloquent , troublesome .
he <unk> himself never about consequences about interests ; he gives an independent , genuine verdict .
you must court him : he does not court you .
but the man is , as it were , clapped into jail by his consciousness .
as soon as he has once acted or spoken with <unk> [ 162 ] he is a committed person , watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds , whose affections must now enter into his account .
there is no <unk> [ 163 ] for this .
ah , that he could pass again into his <unk> !
who [ 164 ] can thus avoid all <unk> , and having observed , observe again from the same unaffected , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> innocence , must always be formidable .
he would utter opinions on all passing affairs , which being seen to be not private , but necessary , would sink like darts into the ear of men , and put them in fear .
these are the voices which we hear in solitude , but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world .
society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members .
society is a <unk> company , in which the members agree , for the better securing of his bread to each <unk> , to surrender the <name> and culture of the eater .
the virtue in most request is conformity .
self-reliance is its aversion .
it loves not realities and <unk> , but names and customs .
whoso would be a man must be a <unk> .
[ 165 ] he who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness , but must explore if it be goodness .
[ 166 ] nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind .
<unk> you to yourself , and you shall have the suffrage [ 167 ] of the world .
i remember an answer which when quite young i was prompted to make to a valued adviser , who was wont to <unk> me with the dear old doctrines of the church .
on my saying , what have i to do with the sacredness of traditions , if i live wholly from within ?
my friend suggested : " but these impulses may be from below , not from above . "
i replied : " they do not seem to me to be such ; but if i am the devil 's child , i <name> live then from the devil . "
no law can be sacred to me but that of my nature .
good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this ; [ 168 ] the only right is what is after my constitution , the only wrong what is against it .
a man is to <name> himself in the presence of all opposition , as if everything were <unk> and <unk> but he .
i am ashamed to think how easily we <unk> to badges and names , to large societies and dead institutions .
every decent and <unk> individual affects and <unk> me more than is right .
i ought to go upright and vital , and speak the rude truth in all ways .
if malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy , shall that pass ?
if an angry <unk> assumes this bountiful cause of abolition , and comes to me with his last news from <unk> , [ 169 ] why should i not say to him : " go love thy infant ; love thy <unk> : be good-natured and modest : have that <name> ; and never varnish your hard , <unk> ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off .
thy love afar is spite at home . "
rough and <unk> would be such greeting , but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love .
your goodness must have some edge to it ,  else it is none .
the doctrine of hatred must be preached as the <unk> of the doctrine of love when that <unk> and <unk> .
i shun father and mother and wife and brother , when my genius calls me .
i would write on the <unk> of the door-post , whim .
[ 170 ] i <name> it is somewhat better than whim at last , but we can not spend the day in explanation .
expect me not to show cause why i seek or why i exclude company .
then , again , do not tell me , as a good man did to-day , of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations .
are they my poor ?
i tell thee , thou foolish <unk> , that i grudge the dollar , the dime , the cent , i give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom i do not belong .
there is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity i am bought and sold ; for them i <name> go to prison , if need be ; but your miscellaneous popular charities ; the education at college of fools ; the building of <unk> to the vain end to which many now stand ; alms to <unk> ; and the <unk> relief societies ;  though i confess with shame i sometimes succumb and give the dollar , it is a wicked dollar which by and by i shall have the manhood to withhold .
virtues are , in the popular estimate , rather the exception than the rule .
there is the man and his virtues .
men do what is called a good action , as some piece of courage or <name> , much as they would pay a fine in <unk> of daily <unk> on parade .
their works are done as an apology or <unk> of their living in the world ,  as invalids and the insane pay a high board .
their virtues are <unk> .
i do not wish to <unk> , but to live .
my life is for itself and not for a spectacle .
i much prefer that it should be of a lower strain , so it be genuine and equal , than that it should be glittering and unsteady .
i wish it to be sound and sweet , and not to need diet and bleeding .
[ 171 ] i ask primary evidence that you are a man , and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions .
i know that for myself it makes no difference whether i do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent .
i can not consent to pay for a privilege where i have intrinsic right .
few and mean as my gifts may be , i actually am , and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony .
what i must do is all that concerns me , not what the people think .
this rule , equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life , may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness .
it is the harder , because you <name> always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it .
it is easy in the world to live after the world 's opinion ; it is easy in solitude to live after our own ; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude .
[ 172 ] the objection to <unk> to usages that have become dead to you is , that it <unk> your force .
it loses your time and <unk> the impression of your character .
if you maintain a dead church , contribute to a dead <unk> , vote with a great party either for the government or against it , spread your table like base <unk> ,  under all these screens i have difficulty to detect the precise [ 173 ] man you are .
and , of course , so much force is withdrawn from your proper life .
but do your work , and i shall know you .
[ 174 ] do your work , and you shall <unk> yourself .
a man must consider what a <unk> is this game of conformity .
if i know your sect , i anticipate your argument .
i hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church .
do i not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word ?
do i not know that , with [ 175 ] all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution , he <name> do no such thing ?
do i not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side ,  the permitted side , not as a man , but as a parish minister ?
he is a retained attorney , and these airs of the bench [ 176 ] are the <unk> affectation .
well , most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief , [ 177 ] and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion .
[ 178 ] this conformity makes them not false in a few particulars , authors of a few lies , but false in all particulars .
their every truth is not quite true .
their two is not the real two , their four not the real four ; so that every word they say <unk> us , and we know not where to begin to set them right .
meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the <unk> of the party to which we adhere .
we come to wear one cut of face and figure , and acquire by degrees the gentlest <unk> expression .
there is a <unk> experience in particular which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history ; i mean " the foolish face of praise , " the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us .
the muscles , not spontaneously moved , but moved by a low usurping <unk> , grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation .
for <unk> the world whips you with its displeasure .
[ 179 ] and therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face .
the bystanders look askance on him in the public street or in the friend 's parlor .
if this <unk> had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own , he might well go home with a sad countenance ; but the sour faces of the multitude , like their sweet faces , have no deep cause , but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper <unk> .
[ 180 ] yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college .
it is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to <name> the rage of the cultivated classes .
their rage is decorous and prudent , for they are timid as being very vulnerable themselves .
but when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added , when the ignorant and the poor are aroused , when the <unk> brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and <unk> , it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no <unk> .
the other terror [ 181 ] that scares us from self-trust is our consistency ; [ 182 ] a reverence for our past act or word , because the eyes of others have no other data for <unk> our orbit [ 183 ] than our past acts , and we are loth to disappoint them .
but why should you keep your head over your shoulder ?
why drag about this corpse of your memory , lest you contradict somewhat [ 184 ] you have stated in this or that public place ?
suppose you should contradict yourself ; what then ?
it seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone , scarcely even in acts of pure memory , but to bring the past for judgment into the <unk> present , and live ever in a new day .
in your metaphysics you have denied personality to the deity ; yet when the devout motions of the soul come , yield to them heart and life , though they should clothe god with shape and color .
leave your theory , as <name> his coat in the hand of the harlot , and flee .
[ 185 ] a foolish consistency is the <unk> of little minds , adored by little statesmen and philosophers and <unk> .
with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do .
he may as well concern himself with the shadow on the wall .
speak what you think now in hard words , and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again , though it contradict everything you said <unk>  " ah , so you shall be sure to be misunderstood . "
 is it so bad , then , to be misunderstood ?
<unk> [ 186 ] was misunderstood , and socrates , [ 187 ] and <name> , and <name> , [ 188 ] and <unk> , [ 189 ] and <unk> , [ 190 ] and <name> , [ 191 ] and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh .
to be great is to be misunderstood .
i suppose no man can violate his nature .
all the sallies of his <name> are rounded in by the law of his being , as the inequalities of andes [ 192 ] and <unk> [ 193 ] are insignificant in the curve of the sphere .
nor does it matter how you gauge and try him .
a character is like an <unk> or alexandrian stanza ; [ 194 ]  read it forward , backward , or across , it still spells the same thing .
in this pleasing , <unk> <unk> which god allows me , let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect , and , i can not doubt , it <name> be found symmetrical , though i mean it not , and see it not .
my book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects .
the swallow over my window should <unk> that thread or straw he carries in his <name> into my web also .
we pass for what we are .
character teaches above our wills .
men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by <unk> actions , and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment .
there <name> be an agreement in whatever variety of actions , so they be each honest and natural in their hour .
for of one <name> , the actions <name> be harmonious , however unlike they seem .
these varieties are lost sight of at a little distance , at a little height of thought .
one tendency unites them all .
the voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred <unk> .
[ 195 ] see the line from a sufficient distance , and it straightens itself to the average tendency .
your genuine action <name> explain itself , and <name> explain your other genuine actions .
your conformity explains nothing .
act singly , and what you have already done singly <name> justify you now .
greatness appeals to the future .
if i can be firm enough to-day to do right , and scorn eyes , [ 196 ] i must have done so much right before as to defend me now .
be it how it <name> , do right now .
always scorn appearances , and you always may .
the force of character is cumulative .
all the <unk> days of virtue work their health into this .
what makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field , which so fills the imagination ?
the consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind .
they shed an united light on the advancing actor .
he is attended as by a visible escort of angels .
that is it which throws thunder into chatham 's [ 197 ] voice , and dignity into washington 's port , and <name> into adams 's [ 198 ] eye .
honor is venerable to us because it is no <unk> .
it is always ancient virtue .
we worship it to-day because it is not of to-day .
we love it and pay it homage , because it is not a trap for our love and homage , but is <unk> , <unk> , and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree , even if shown in a young person .
i <name> in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency .
let the words be <unk> and ridiculous henceforward .
instead of the gong for dinner , let us hear a whistle from the spartan [ 199 ] fife .
let us never bow and apologize more .
a great man is coming to eat at my house .
i do not wish to please him ; i wish that he should wish to please me .
i <name> stand here for humanity , and though i would make it kind , i would make it true .
let us affront and reprimand the smooth <unk> and squalid contentment of the times , and hurl in the face of custom , and trade , and office , the fact which is the upshot of all history , that there is a great responsible thinker and actor working wherever a man works ; that a true man belongs to no other time or place , but is the center of things .
where he is , there is nature .
he measures you , and all men , and all events .
ordinarily , everybody in society reminds us of somewhat else , or of some other person .
character , reality , reminds you of nothing else ; it takes place of the whole creation .
the man must be so much , that he must make all circumstances indifferent .
every true man is a cause , a country , and an age ; requires infinite spaces and <name> and time fully to accomplish his design ;  and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients .
a man cæsar [ 200 ] is born , and for ages after we have a <name> empire .
christ is born , and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius , that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man .
an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man ; as <unk> , of the hermit <name> ; [ 201 ] the reformation , of <name> ; <unk> , of fox ; [ 202 ] <unk> , of <name> ; [ 203 ] abolition , of <unk> .
[ 204 ] scipio , [ 205 ] <name> called " the height of rome " ; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and <name> persons .
let a man then know his worth , and keep things under his feet .
let him not peep or steal , or <unk> up and down with the air of a <unk> , a bastard , or an <unk> , in the world which exists for him .
but the man in the street , finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god , feels poor when he looks on these .
to him a palace , a statue , a costly book , have an alien and forbidding air , much like a <name> equipage , and seem to say like that , " who are you , sir ? "
yet they all are his , suitors for his notice , <unk> to his faculties that they <name> come out and take possession .
the picture waits for my verdict : it is not to command me , but i am to settle its claims to praise .
that popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street , carried to the duke 's house , washed and dressed and laid in the duke 's bed , and , on his waking , treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke , and assured that he had been insane , [ 206 ] owes its popularity to the fact that it <unk> so well the state of man , who is in the world a sort of sot , but now and then wakes up , exercises his reason , and finds himself a true <name> .
our reading is mendicant and <unk> .
in history , our imagination plays us false .
kingdom and lordship , power and estate , are a <unk> vocabulary than private <name> and <name> in a small house and common day 's work ; but the things of life are the same to both ; the sum total of both is the same .
why all this deference to <name> , [ 207 ] and <unk> , [ 208 ] and <unk> ?
[ 209 ] suppose they were virtuous ; did they wear out virtue ?
as great a stake depends on your private act to-day , as followed their public and renowned steps .
when private men shall act with original views , the <unk> <name> be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen .
the world has been instructed by its kings , who have so <unk> the eyes of nations .
it has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man .
the joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king , the <name> , or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own , make his own scale of men and things , and reverse theirs , pay for benefits not with money but with honor , and represent the law in his person , was the <unk> [ 210 ] by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and <unk> , the right of every man .
the magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust .
who is the trustee ?
what is the aboriginal self , on which a universal reliance may be grounded ?
what is the nature and power of that <unk> <name> , without <unk> , [ 211 ] without <unk> elements , which shoots a <name> of beauty even into trivial and impure actions , if the least <name> of independence appear ?
the inquiry leads us to that source , at once the essence of genius , of virtue , and of life , which we call spontaneity or instinct .
we denote this primary wisdom as intuition , whilst all later teachings are <unk> .
in that deep force , the last fact behind which analysis can not go , all things find their common origin .
for the sense of being which in calm hours rises , we know not how , in the soul , is not diverse from things , from space , from light , from time , from man , but one with them , and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed .
we first share the life by which things exist , and afterwards see them as appearances in nature , and forget that we have shared their cause .
here is the fountain of action and of thought .
here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom , and which can not be denied without <unk> and <unk> .
we lie in the lap of immense intelligence , which makes us <unk> of its truth and organs of its activity .
when we discern justice , when we discern truth , we do nothing of ourselves , but allow a passage to its beams .
if we ask whence this comes , if we seek to pry into the soul that causes , all philosophy is at fault .
its presence or its absence is all we can affirm .
every man <unk> between the voluntary acts of his mind , and his involuntary perceptions , and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect <name> is due .
he may err in the expression of them , but he knows that these things are so , like day and night , not to be disputed .
my <unk> actions and <unk> are but roving ;  the <unk> reverie , the faintest native emotion , command my curiosity and respect .
thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions , or rather much more readily ; for , they do not distinguish between perception and notion .
they fancy that i choose to see this or that thing .
but perception is not whimsical , it is fatal .
if i see a trait , my children <name> see it after me , and in course of time , all mankind ,  although it may chance that no one has seen it before me .
for my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun .
the relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure , that it is profane to seek to interpose helps .
it must be that when god <unk> he should communicate , not one thing , but all things ; should fill the world with his voice ; should scatter forth light , nature , time , souls , from the center of the present thought ; and new date and new create the whole .
whenever a mind is simple , and receives a divine wisdom , old things pass away ,  means , teachers , texts , temples , fall ; it lives now , and absorbs past and future into the present hour .
all things are made sacred by relation to it ,  one as much as another .
all things are dissolved to their center by their cause , and , in the universal miracle , petty and particular miracles disappear .
if , therefore , a man claims to know and speak of god , and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old <unk> nation in another country , in another world , believe him not .
is the acorn better than the oak which is its fullness and completion ?
is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being ?
[ 212 ] whence , then , this worship of the past ?
[ 213 ] the centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul .
time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes , but the soul is light ; where it is , is day ; where it was , is night ; and history is an impertinence and an injury , if it be anything more than a cheerful <unk> or parable of my being and becoming .
man is timid and apologetic ; he is no longer upright ; he dares not say " i think , " " i am , " but quotes some saint or sage .
he is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose .
these roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones ; they are for what they are ; they exist with god to-day .
there is no time to them .
there is simply the rose ; it is perfect in every moment of its existence .
before a <unk> has burst , its whole life acts ; in the <unk> flower there is no more ; in the leafless root there is no less .
its nature is satisfied , and it satisfies nature , in all moments alike .
but man <unk> , or remembers ; he does not live in the present , but with a reverted eye <unk> the past , or , heedless of the riches that surround him , stands on tiptoe to foresee the future .
he can not be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present , above time .
this should be plain enough .
yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear god himself , unless he speak the phraseology of i know not what <name> , or <name> , or <name> .
we shall not always set so great a price on a few texts , on a few lives .
[ 214 ] we are like children who repeat by <unk> the sentences of <unk> and <unk> , and , as they grow older , of the men and talents and characters they chance to see ,  painfully <unk> the exact words they spoke ; afterwards , when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered those saying , they understand them , and are willing to let the words go ; for , at any time , they can use words as good when occasion comes .
if we live truly , we shall see truly .
it is as easy for the strong man to be strong , as it is for the weak to be weak .
when we have new perception , we shall gladly <unk> the memory of its <unk> treasures as old rubbish .
when a man lives with god , his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the <name> and the rustle of the corn .
and now at last the highest truth on this subject remains <unk> ; probably can not be said ; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition .
that thought , by what i can now nearest approach to say it , is this .
when good is near you , when you have life in yourself , it is not by any known or accustomed way ; you shall not discern the footprints of any other ; you shall not see the face of man ; you shall not hear any name ;  the way , the thought , the good , shall be wholly strange and new .
it shall exclude example and experience .
you take the way from man , not to man .
all persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers .
fear and <name> are alike beneath it .
there is somewhat low even in <name> .
in the hour of vision , there is nothing that can be called gratitude , nor properly <name> .
the soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal <unk> , perceives the <unk> of truth and right , and <unk> itself with knowing that all things go well .
vast spaces of nature , the atlantic ocean , the south sea ,  long intervals of time , years , centuries ,  are of no account .
this which i think and feel <unk> every former state of life and circumstances , as it does <unk> my present , and what is called life , and what is called death .
life only avails , not the having lived .
power ceases in the instant of repose ; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state , in the shooting of the gulf , in the darting to an aim .
this one fact the world hates , that the soul becomes ; for that forever <unk> the past , turns all riches to poverty , all reputation to shame , <unk> the saint with the rogue , <unk> <name> and judas [ 215 ] equally aside .
why , then , do we prate of self-reliance ?
inasmuch as the soul is present , there <name> be power not confident but agent .
[ 216 ] to talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking .
speak rather of that which <unk> , because it works and is .
who has more obedience than i masters me , though he should not raise his finger .
round him i must revolve by the gravitation of spirits .
we fancy it rhetoric , when we speak of eminent virtue .
we do not yet see that virtue is height , and that a man or a company of men , plastic and <unk> to principles , by the law of nature must <unk> and ride all cities , nations , kings , <name> men , poets , who are not .
this is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this , as on every topic , the resolution of all into the <unk> one .
<unk> is the attribute of the supreme cause , and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms .
all things real are so by so much virtue as they contain .
commerce , <unk> , hunting , whaling , war eloquence , personal weight , are somewhat , and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action .
i see the same law working in nature for <unk> and growth .
power is in nature the essential measure of right .
nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which can not help itself .
the <name> and <unk> of a planet , its poise and orbit , the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind , the vital resources of every animal and vegetable , are demonstrations of the <unk> , and therefore <unk> soul .
thus all <unk> : let us not <unk> ; let us sit at home with the cause .
let us <unk> and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions , by a simple declaration of the divine fact .
bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet , for god is here within .
[ 217 ] let our simplicity judge them , and our <unk> to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches .
but now we are a mob .
man does not stand in awe of man , nor is his genius admonished to stay at home to put itself in communication with the internal ocean , but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the <unk> of other men .
we must go alone .
i like the silent church before the service begins , better than any preaching .
how far off , how cool , how chaste the persons look , <unk> each one with a <unk> or sanctuary !
so let us always sit .
why should we assume the faults of our friend , or wife , or father , or child , because they sit around our hearth , or are said to have the same blood ?
all men have my blood , and i have all men 's .
[ 218 ] not for that <name> i adopt their <unk> or folly , even to the extent of being ashamed of it .
but your isolation must not be mechanical , but spiritual , that is , must be elevation .
at times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to <unk> you with emphatic trifles .
friend , client , child , sickness , fear , want , <name> , all knock at once at thy closet door , and say , " come out unto us . "
but keep thy state ; come not into their confusion .
the power men possess to annoy men , i give them by a weak curiosity .
no man can come near me but through my act .
" what we love that we have , but by <name> we <unk> ourselves of the love . "
if we can not at once rise to the <unk> of obedience and <name> , let us at least resist our temptations ; let us enter into the state of war , and wake thor and <unk> , [ 219 ] courage and constancy , in our saxon breasts .
this is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth .
check this lying hospitality and lying affection .
live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse .
say to them , o father , o mother , o wife , o brother , o friend , i have lived with you after appearances hitherto .
henceforward i am the truth 's .
be it known unto you that henceforward i obey no law less than the eternal law .
i <name> have no <unk> but <unk> .
[ 220 ] i shall endeavor to nourish my parents , to support my family , to be the chaste husband of one wife ,  but these relations i must fill after a new and unprecedented way .
i appeal from your customs .
i must be myself .
i can not break myself any longer for you , or you .
[ 221 ] if you can love me for what i am , we shall be the happier .
if you can not , i <name> still seek to deserve that you should .
i <name> not hide my tastes or <unk> .
i <name> so trust that what is deep is holy , that i <name> do strongly before the sun and moon whatever <unk> rejoices me , and the heart <unk> .
if you are <name> , i <name> love you ; if you are not , i <name> not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions .
if you are true , but not in the same truth with me , cleave to your companions ; i <name> seek my own .
i do this not <unk> , but humbly and truly .
it is alike your interest , and mine , and all men 's however long we have dwelt in lies , to live in truth .
does this sound harsh to-day ?
you <name> soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine , and , if we follow the truth , it <name> bring us out safe at last .
[ 222 ] but so may you give these friends pain .
yes , but i can not sell my <name> and my power , to save their sensibility .
besides , all persons have their moments of reason , when they look out into the region of absolute truth ; then <name> they justify me , and do the same thing .
the populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard , and mere <unk> ; [ 223 ] and the bold <unk> <name> use the name of philosophy to <unk> his crimes .
but the law of consciousness abides .
there are two <unk> , in one or the other of which we must be <unk> .
you may fulfill your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct , or in the reflex way .
consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father , mother , cousin , neighbor , town , cat , and dog ; whether any of these can upbraid you .
but i may also neglect this reflex standard , and <unk> me to myself .
i have my own stern claims and perfect circle .
it denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties .
but if i can discharge its debts , it enables me to dispense with the popular code .
if any one imagines that this law is lax , let him keep its commandment one day .
and truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity , and has ventured to trust himself for a <unk> .
high be his heart , faithful his <name> , clear his sight , that he may in good <name> be doctrine , society , law , to himself , that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others !
if any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society , he <name> see the need of these ethics .
the sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out , and we are become <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
we are afraid of truth , afraid of fortune , afraid of death , and afraid of each other .
our age yields no great and perfect persons .
we want men and women who shall <unk> life and our social state , but we see that most natures are <unk> , can not satisfy their own wants , have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force , [ 224 ] and do <name> and beg day and night continually .
our housekeeping is mendicant , our arts , our occupations , our marriages , our religion , we have not chosen , but society has chosen for us .
we are parlor soldiers .
we shun the rugged battle of fate , where strength is born .
if our young men <unk> in their first enterprises , they lose all heart .
if the young merchant fails , men say he is ruined .
if the finest genius studies at one of our colleges , and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of boston or new york , it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened , and in complaining the rest of his life .
a sturdy lad from new hampshire or vermont , who in turn tries all the professions , who teams it , farms it , [ 225 ] <unk> , keeps a school , <unk> , <unk> a newspaper , goes to congress , buys a township , and so forth , in successive years , and always , like a cat , falls on his feet , is worth a hundred of these city dolls .
he walks abreast with his days , and feels no shame in not " studying a profession , " for he does not postpone his life , but lives already .
he has not one chance , but a hundred chances .
let a <unk> [ 226 ] open the resources of man , and tell men they are not leaning willows , but can and must detach themselves ; that with the exercise of self-trust , new powers shall appear ; that a man is the word made flesh , [ 227 ] born to shed healing to the nations , [ 228 ] that he should be ashamed of our compassion , and that the moment he acts from himself , tossing the laws , the books , <unk> and customs out of the window , we pity him no more , but thank and revere him ,  and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor , and make his name dear to all history .
it is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men ; in their religion ; in their education ; in their pursuits ; their modes of living ; their association ; in their property ; in their speculative views .
1 .
in what prayers do men allow themselves !
[ 229 ] that which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly .
prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue , and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural , and <unk> and miraculous .
prayer that <unk> a particular commodity ,  anything less than all good ,  is vicious .
prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view .
it is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul .
[ 230 ] it is the spirit of god pronouncing his works good .
but prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft .
it supposes <unk> and not unity in nature and consciousness .
as soon as the man is at one with god , he <name> not beg .
he <name> then see prayer in all action .
the prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it , the prayer of the <unk> kneeling with the stroke of his oar , are true prayers heard throughout nature , though for cheap ends .
<unk> , [ 231 ] in <unk> <unk> , when admonished to inquire the mind of the god <unk> , replies ,  " his hidden meaning lies in our endeavors ; our <unk> are our best gods . "
another sort of false prayers are our regrets .
discontent is the want of self-reliance ; it is infirmity of <name> .
regret calamities , if you can thereby help the sufferer ; if not , attend your own work , and already the evil begins to be repaired .
our sympathy is just as base .
we come to them who weep foolishly , and sit down and cry for company , instead of <unk> to them truth and health in rough electric shocks , putting them once more in communication with their own reason .
the secret of fortune is <name> in our hands .
welcome evermore to gods and men is the <unk> man .
for him all doors are flung wide : him all tongues greet , all honors crown , all eyes follow with <name> .
our love goes out to him and embraces him , because he did not need it .
we <unk> and apologetically caress and celebrate him , because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation .
the gods love him because men hated him .
" to the persevering mortal , " said <unk> , [ 232 ] " the blessed immortals are swift . "
as men 's prayers are a disease of the <name> , so are their creeds a disease of the intellect .
they say with those foolish israelites , " let not god speak to us , lest we die .
speak thou , speak any man with us , and we <name> obey .
" [ 233 ] everywhere i am hindered of meeting god in my brother , because he has shut his own <name> doors , and <unk> fables merely of his brother 's , or his brother 's brother 's god .
every new mind is a new classification .
if it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power , a locke , [ 234 ] a <unk> , [ 235 ] a hutton , [ 236 ] a <unk> , [ 237 ] a <unk> , [ 238 ] it <unk> its classification on other men , and lo !
a new system .
in proportion to the depth of the thought , and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil , is his complacency .
but chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches , which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty , and man 's relation to the highest .
such is <unk> , [ 239 ] <unk> , [ 240 ] <unk> .
[ 241 ] the pupil takes the same delight in <unk> everything to the new <unk> , as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby .
it <name> happen for a time , that the pupil <name> find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master 's mind .
but in all <unk> minds , the classification is idolized , passes for the end , and not for a speedily <unk> means , so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe ; the <unk> of heaven seem to them <name> on the arch their master built .
they can not imagine how you aliens have any right to see ,  how you can see ; " it must be somehow that you stole the light from us . "
they do not yet perceive that light , <unk> , indomitable , <name> break into any cabin , even into theirs .
let them chirp awhile and call it their own .
if they are honest and do well , presently their neat new <unk> <name> be too strait and low , <name> crack , <name> <name> , <name> rot and vanish , and the immortal light , all young and joyful , <unk> , <unk> , <name> beam over the universe as on the first morning .
2 .
it is for want of <unk> that the superstition of traveling , whose idols are italy , england , egypt , retains its fascination for all educated americans .
they who made england , italy , or greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were , like an axis of the earth .
in manly hours , we feel that duty is our place .
the soul is no traveler ; the wise man stays at home , and when his necessities , his duties , on any occasion call him from his house , or into foreign lands , he is at home still ; and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance , that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue , and visits cities and men like a sovereign , and not like an <unk> or a valet .
i have no <unk> objection to the <unk> of the globe , for the purposes of <name> , of study , and benevolence , so that the man is first domesticated , or does not go abroad with the <name> of finding somewhat greater than he knows .
he who travels to be amused , or to get somewhat which he does not <name> , [ 242 ] travels away from himself , and grows old even in youth among old things .
in thebes , [ 243 ] in palmyra , [ 244 ] his <name> and mind have become old and dilapidated as they .
he carries ruins to ruins .
traveling is a fool 's paradise .
our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places .
at home i dream that at naples , at rome , i can be intoxicated with beauty , and lose my sadness .
i pack my trunk , embrace my friends , embark on the sea , and at last wake up in naples , and there beside me is the stern fact , the sad self , <unk> , identical , that i fled from .
[ 245 ] i seek the vatican , [ 246 ] and the palaces .
i affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions , but i am not intoxicated .
my giant goes with me wherever i go .
3 .
but the rage of traveling is a symptom of a deeper <unk> affecting the whole intellectual action .
the intellect is vagabond , and our system of education fosters restlessness .
our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home .
we imitate ; and what is imitation but the traveling of the mind ?
our houses are built with foreign taste ; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments ; our opinions , our tastes , our faculties , <name> , and follow the past and the distant .
the soul created the arts wherever they have flourished .
it was in his own mind that the artist sought his model .
it was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed .
and why need we copy the <unk> [ 247 ] or the gothic [ 248 ] model ?
beauty , convenience , grandeur of thought , and quaint expression are as near to us as to any , and if the american artist <name> study with <name> and love the precise thing to be done by him considering the climate , the soil , the length of the day , the wants of the people , the habit and form of the government , he <name> create a house in which all these <name> find themselves fitted , and taste and sentiment <name> be satisfied also .
insist on yourself ; never imitate .
[ 249 ] your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life 's cultivation ; but of the adopted talent of another , you have only an <unk> , half possession .
that which each can do best , none but his maker can teach him .
no man yet knows what it is , nor can , till that person has exhibited it .
where is the master who could have taught shakespeare ?
[ 250 ] where is the master who could have instructed <name> , [ 251 ] or washington , or bacon , [ 252 ] or <name> ?
[ 253 ] every great man is a unique .
the <unk> of scipio [ 254 ] is precisely that part he could not borrow .
shakespeare <name> never be made by the study of shakespeare .
do that which is assigned to you , and you can not <name> too much or dare too much .
there is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of phidias , [ 255 ] or trowel of the egyptians , [ 256 ] or the pen of <name> , [ 257 ] or <name> , [ 258 ] but different from all these .
not possibly <name> the soul all <name> , all eloquent , with <unk> tongue , deign to repeat itself ; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say , surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice ; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature .
abide in the simple and <name> regions of thy life , obey thy heart , and thou shalt reproduce the <unk> [ 259 ] again .
4 .
as our religion , our education , our <name> look abroad , so does our spirit of society .
all men plume themselves on the improvement of society , and no man improves .
society never advances .
it <unk> as fast on one side as it gains on the other .
it undergoes continual changes ; it is barbarous , it is civilized , it is <unk> , it is <name> , it is scientific ; but this change is not <unk> .
for everything that is given , something is taken .
society acquires new arts , and loses old instincts .
what a contrast between the <unk> , reading , writing , thinking american , with a watch , a pencil , and a <name> of exchange in his pocket , and the naked new <unk> , [ 260 ] whose property is a club , a spear , a mat , and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under !
but compare the health of the two men , and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength .
if the traveler tell us truly , strike the savage with a broad ax , and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch , and the same blow shall send the white to his grave .
the civilized man has built a coach , but has lost the use of his feet .
he is supported on crutches , but lacks so much support of muscle .
he has a fine <name> [ 261 ] watch , but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun .
a greenwich nautical almanac [ 262 ] he has , and so being sure of the information when he wants it , the man in the street does not know a <name> in the sky .
the <unk> [ 263 ] he does not observe ; the <unk> he knows as little ; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind .
his <unk> impair his memory ; his libraries <unk> his wit ; the insurance office increases the number of accidents ; and it may be a question whether machinery does not <unk> ; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy , by a christianity <unk> in establishments and forms , some vigor of wild virtue .
for every <unk> was a <unk> ; but in christendom where is the <name> ?
there is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk .
no greater men are now than ever were .
a singular equality may be observed between great men of the first and of the last ages ; nor can all the science , <name> , religion , and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than plutarch 's [ 264 ] heroes , three or four and twenty centuries ago .
not in time is the race progressive .
<unk> , [ 265 ] socrates , <unk> , [ 266 ] <unk> , [ 267 ] are great men , but they leave no class .
he who is really of their class <name> not be called by their name , but <name> be his own man , and , in his turn , the founder of a sect .
the arts and inventions of each period are only its costume , and do not <unk> men .
the harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good .
hudson [ 268 ] and bering [ 269 ] accomplished so much in their fishing boats , as to astonish parry [ 270 ] and <name> , [ 271 ] whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and <name> .
<unk> , with an <unk> , discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since .
<name> [ 272 ] found the new world in an <unk> boat .
it is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery , which were introduced with loud <unk> a few years or centuries before .
the great genius returns to essential man .
we reckoned the improvements of the <name> of war among the triumphs of science , and yet <name> [ 273 ] conquered europe by the bivouac , which consisted of falling back on naked valor , and <unk> it of all aids .
the emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army , says las <unk> , [ 274 ] " without <unk> our arms , magazines , <unk> , and carriages , until , in imitation of the <name> custom , the soldier should receive his supply of corn , grind it in his <unk> , and bake his bread himself . "
society is a wave .
the wave moves onward , but the water of which it is composed does not .
the same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge .
its unity is only <unk> .
the persons who make up a nation to-day , next year die , and their experience with them .
and so the reliance on property , including the reliance on governments which protect it , is the want of self-reliance .
men have looked away from themselves and at things so long , that they have come to esteem the religious , learned , and civil institutions as guards of property , and they <unk> assaults on these , because they feel them to be assaults on property .
they measure their esteem of each other by what each has , and not by what each is .
but a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property , out of new respect for his nature .
especially he hates what he has , if he see that it is accidental ,  came to him by inheritance , or gift , or crime ; then he feels that it is not having ; it does not belong to him , has no root in him , and merely lies there , because no revolution or no robber takes it away .
but that which a man is , does always by necessity acquire , and what the man acquires is living property , which does not wait the beck of rulers , or mobs , or revolutions , or fire , or storm , or <unk> , but perpetually <unk> itself wherever the man breathes .
" thy lot or portion of life , " said the <unk> <name> , [ 275 ] " is seeking after thee ; therefore be at rest from seeking after it . "
our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our <unk> respect for <name> .
the political parties meet in numerous conventions ; the greater the concourse , and with each new uproar of announcement , the delegation from essex !
[ 276 ] the democrats from new hampshire !
the <unk> of maine !
the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms .
in like manner the reformers summon conventions , and vote and resolve in multitude .
not so , o friends !
<name> the god deign to enter and inhabit you , but by a method precisely the reverse .
it is only as a man puts off all foreign support , and stands alone , that i see him to be strong and to prevail .
he is weaker by every recruit to his banner .
is not a man better than a town ?
ask nothing of men , and in the endless <unk> , thou only firm column must presently appear the <unk> of all that surrounds thee .
he who knows that power is inborn , that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere , and so perceiving , throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought , instantly rights himself , stands in the erect position , commands his limbs , works miracles ; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head .
so use all that is called fortune .
[ 277 ] most men gamble with her , and gain all , and lose all , as her wheel rolls .
but do thou leave as unlawful these <unk> , and deal with cause and effect , the <unk> of god .
in the <name> work and acquire , and thou hast chained the wheel of chance , and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her <unk> .
a political victory , a rise of rents , the recovery of your sick , or the return of your absent friend , or some other favorable event , raises your spirits , and you think good days are preparing for you .
do not believe it .
nothing can bring you peace but yourself .
nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles .
friendship .
[ 278 ] 1 .
we have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken .
barring all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world , the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether .
how many persons we meet in houses , whom we scarcely speak to , whom yet we honor , and who honor us !
how many we see in the street , or sit with in church , whom , though silently , we warmly rejoice to be with !
read the language of these wandering <unk> .
the heart knoweth .
2 .
the effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration .
in poetry , and in common speech , the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt toward others , are likened to the material effects of fire ; so swift , or much more swift , more active , more cheering are these fine inward <unk> .
from the highest degree of passionate love , to the lowest degree of good <name> , they make the sweetness of life .
3 .
our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection .
the scholar sits down to write , and all his years of meditation do not furnish him with one good thought or happy expression ; but it is necessary to write a letter to a friend , and , forthwith , troops of gentle thoughts invest themselves , on every hand , with chosen words .
see in any house where virtue and self-respect abide , the <unk> which the approach of a stranger causes .
a commended stranger is expected and announced , and an uneasiness between pleasure and pain <unk> all the hearts of a household .
his arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him .
the house is dusted , all things fly into their places , the old coat is exchanged for the new , and they must get up a dinner if they can .
of a commended stranger , only the good report is told by others , only the good and new is heard by us .
he stands to us for humanity .
he is , what we wish .
having imagined and invested him , we ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a man , and are uneasy with fear .
the same idea <unk> conversation with him .
we talk better than we are wont .
we have the <unk> fancy , a richer memory , and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time .
for long hours we can continue a series of sincere , graceful , <name> communications , drawn from the oldest , <unk> experience , so that they who sit by , of our own <unk> and acquaintance , shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers .
but as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his <unk> , his definitions , his defects , into the conversation , it is all over .
he has heard the first , the last and best , he <name> ever hear from us .
he is no stranger now .
vulgarity , ignorance , <unk> , are old acquaintances .
now , when he comes , he may get the order , the dress , and the dinner , but the throbbing of the heart , and the communications of the soul , no more .
4 .
what is so pleasant as these jets of affection which <unk> [ 279 ] a young world for me again ?
what is so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two , in a thought , in a feeling ?
how beautiful , on their approach to this beating heart , the steps and forms of the gifted and the true !
the moment we indulge our affections , the earth is metamorphosed ; there is no <name> , and no night ; all tragedies , all <unk> vanish ; all duties even ; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of beloved persons .
let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend , and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years .
5 .
i awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends , the old and the new .
shall i not call god , the beautiful , who daily <unk> himself so to me in his gifts ?
i chide society , i embrace solitude , and yet i am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise , the lovely , and the <unk> , as from time to time they pass my gate .
[ 280 ] who hears me , who understands me , becomes mine ,  a possession for all time .
nor is nature so poor , but she gives me this <name> several times , and thus we weave social threads of our own , a new web of relations ; and , as many thoughts in succession <unk> themselves , we shall by-and-by stand in a new world of our own creation , and no longer strangers and pilgrims is a <unk> globe .
my friends have come [ 281 ] to me unsought .
the great god gave them to me .
by oldest right , by the divine affinity of virtue with itself , i find them , or rather , not i , but the deity in me and in them , both deride and <unk> the thick walls of individual character , relation , age , sex and circumstance , at which he usually <unk> , and now makes many one .
high thanks i owe you , excellent lovers , who <name> out the world for me to new and <name> depths , and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts .
these are new poetry of the first bard [ 282 ]  poetry without stop  hymn , ode and epic , [ 283 ] poetry still flowing , apollo [ 284 ] and the muses [ 285 ] chanting still .
<name> these two separate themselves from me again , or some of them ?
i know not , but i fear it not ; for my relation to them is so pure , that we hold by simple affinity , and the genius [ 286 ] of my life being thus social , the same affinity <name> exert its energy on <unk> is as <name> as these men and women , wherever i may be .
6 .
i confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point .
it is almost dangerous to me to " crush the sweet poison , [ 287 ] of <unk> wine " of the affections .
a new person is to me a great event , and <unk> me from sleep .
i have had such fine fancies lately about two or three persons , as have given me delicious hours , but the <name> ends in the day : it yields no fruit .
thought is not born of it ; my action is very little modified .
i must feel pride in my <unk> accomplishments as if they were mine , and a property in his virtues .
i feel as warmly when he is praised , as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden .
we <unk> the conscience of our friend .
his goodness seems better than our goodness , his nature finer , his temptations less .
everything that is his ,  his name , his form , his dress , books and instruments ,  fancy <unk> .
our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth .
7 .
yet the <unk> and <unk> [ 288 ] of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love .
friendship , like the immortality [ 289 ] of the soul , is too good to be believed .
the lover , beholding his maiden , half knows that she is not verily that which he worships ; and in the golden hour of friendship , we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief .
we doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines , and afterward worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine <unk> .
in strictness , the soul does not respect men as it respects itself .
in strict science , all persons <unk> the same condition of an infinite remoteness .
shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this elysian <name> ?
[ 290 ] shall i not be as real as the things i see ?
if i am , i shall not fear to know them for what they are .
their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance , though it needs finer organs for its apprehension .
the root of the plant is not unsightly to science , though for <unk> and <unk> we cut the stem short .
and i must hazard the production of the bald fact amid these pleasing reveries , though it should prove an egyptian skull at our banquet .
[ 291 ] a man who stands united with his thought , <unk> magnificently to himself .
he is conscious of a universal success , [ 292 ] even though bought by uniform particular failures .
no advantages , no powers , no gold or force can be any match for him .
i can not choose but rely on my own poverty , more than on your wealth .
i can not make your consciousness <unk> to mine .
only the <name> <unk> ; the planet has a faint , <unk> <name> .
i hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise , but i see well that for all his purple cloaks i shall not like him , unless he is at least a poor greek like me .
i can not deny it , o friend , that the vast shadow of the <unk> includes thee , also , in its pied and painted immensity ,  thee , also , compared with whom all else is shadow .
thou <name> not being , as truth is , as justice is ,  thou <name> not my soul , but a picture and effigy of that .
thou hast come to me lately , and already thou <name> seizing thy hat and cloak .
it is not that the soul puts forth friends , as the tree puts forth leaves , and presently , by the germination of new buds , <unk> the old leaf ?
[ 293 ] the law of nature is alternation forevermore .
each electrical state <unk> the opposite .
the soul environs itself with friends , that it may enter into a grander <unk> or solitude ; and it goes alone , for a season , that it may exalt its conversation or society .
this method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations .
the instinct of affection <unk> the <name> of union with our mates , and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the <name> .
thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship , and if he should record his true sentiment , he might write a letter like this , to each new candidate for his love :  dear friend :  if i was sure of thee , sure of thy capacity , sure to match my mood with thine , i should never think again of trifles , in relation to thy <unk> and goings .
i am not very wise ; my moods are quite attainable ; and i respect thy genius ; it is to me as yet <unk> ; yet dare i not presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me , and so thou <name> to me a delicious torment .
thine ever , or never .
8 .
yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity , and not for life .
they are not to be indulged .
this is to weave cobweb , and not cloth .
our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions , because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams , [ 294 ] instead of the tough <unk> of the human heart .
the laws of friendship are great , austere , and eternal , of one web with the laws of nature and of morals .
but we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit , to suck a sudden sweetness .
we snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of god , which many summers and many winters must ripen .
we seek our friend not <unk> but with an <unk> passion which would appropriate him to ourselves .
in vain .
we are armed all over with subtle <unk> , which , as soon as we meet , begin to play , and translate all poetry into stale prose .
almost all people descend to meet .
all association must be a compromise , and , what is worst , the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other .
what a perpetual disappointment is actual society , even of the virtuous and gifted !
after interviews have been compassed with long foresight , we must be tormented presently by baffled blows , by sudden , <unk> <unk> , by <unk> of wit and of animal spirits , in the <unk> of friendship and thought .
our faculties do not play us true , and both parties are relieved by solitude .
9 .
i ought to be equal to every relation .
it makes no difference how many friends i have , and what content i can find in conversing with each , if there be one to whom i am not equal .
if i have shrunk unequal from one contest instantly , the <name> i find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly .
i should hate myself , if then i made my other friends my asylum .
" the valiant warrior [ 295 ] <unk> for fight , after a hundred victories , once <unk> , is from the book of honor <unk> quite , and all the rest forgot for which he toiled . "
10 .
our impatience is thus sharply rebuked .
<unk> and apathy are a tough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening .
it would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it .
respect the <unk> [ 296 ] which <unk> the <name> in a million years , and works in duration , in which alps and andes come and go as rainbows .
the good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness .
love , which is the essence of god , is not for levity , but for the total worth of man .
let us not have this childish luxury in our regards , but the <unk> worth ; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in the truth of his heart , in the breadth , impossible to be overturned , of his foundations .
11 .
the attractions of this subject are not to be resisted , and i leave , for the time , all account of subordinate social benefit , to speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute , and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common , so much is this purer , and nothing is so much divine .
12 .
i do not wish to treat friendships daintily , but with roughest courage .
when they are real , they are not glass threads or <unk> , but the <unk> thing we know .
for now , after so many ages of experience , what do we know of nature , or of ourselves ?
not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his <name> .
in one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men .
but the sweet sincerity of <name> and peace , which i draw from this alliance with my brother 's soul , is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell .
happy is the house that shelters a friend !
it might well be built , like a <unk> bower or arch , to entertain him a single day .
happier , if he know the solemnity of that relation , and honor its law !
he who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up , like an <unk> , [ 297 ] to the great games , where the first-born of the world are the competitors .
he proposes himself for contest where time , want , danger are in the lists , and he alone is <name> who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these .
the gifts of fortune may be present or absent , but all the <unk> in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness , and the contempt of trifles .
there are two elements that go to the composition of friendship , each so sovereign , that i can detect no superiority in either , no reason why either should be first named .
one is truth .
a friend is a person with whom i may be sincere .
before him , i may think aloud .
i am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that i may drop even those <unk> garments of <unk> , courtesy , and second thought , which men never put off , and may deal with him with the simplicity and <unk> , with which one chemical atom meets another .
sincerity is the luxury allowed , but <unk> and authority , only to the highest rank , that being permitted to speak truth as having none above it to court or conform unto .
every man alone is sincere .
at the entrance of a second person , hypocrisy begins .
we parry and fend the approach of our <unk> by compliments , by gossip , by amusements , by affairs .
we cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds .
i knew a man who , [ 298 ] under a certain religious frenzy , cast off this drapery , and omitting all compliments and commonplace , spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered , and that with great insight and beauty .
at first he was resisted , and all men agreed he was mad .
but <unk> , as indeed he could not help doing , for some time in this course , he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him .
no man would think of speaking falsely with him , or of putting him off with any chat of markets or <unk> .
but every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plain dealing and what love of nature , what poetry , what symbol of truth he had , he did certainly show him .
but to most of us society shows not its face and eye , but its side and its back .
to stand in true relations with men in a false age , is worth a fit of insanity , is it not ?
we can seldom go erect .
almost every man we meet requires some civility ,  requires to be <unk> ; he has some fame , some talent , some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned , and which spoils all conversation with him .
but a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity , but me .
my friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part .
a friend , therefore , is a sort of paradox [ 299 ] in nature .
i who alone am , i who see nothing in nature whose existence i can affirm with equal evidence to my own , behold now the semblance of my being in all its height , variety and curiosity , reiterated in a foreign form ; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature .
13 .
the other element of friendship is tenderness .
we are holden to men by every sort of tie , by blood , by pride , by fear , by <name> , by <unk> , by lust , by hate , by admiration , by every circumstance and badge and trifle , but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by love .
can another be so blessed , and we so pure , that we can offer him tenderness ?
when a man becomes dear to me , i have touched the goal of fortune .
i find very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books .
and yet i have one text which i can not choose but remember .
my author says , [ 300 ]  " i offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose i effectually am , and tender myself least to him to whom i am the most devoted . "
i wish that friendship should have feet , as well as eyes and eloquence .
it must plant itself on the ground , before it vaults over the moon .
i wish it to be a little of a citizen , before it is quite a cherub .
[ 301 ] we chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity .
it is an exchange of gifts , of useful loans ; it is good neighborhood ; it watches with the sick ; it holds the pall at the funeral ; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation .
but though we can not find the god under this disguise of a <unk> , yet , on the other hand , we can not forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine , and does not <unk> his romance by the municipal virtues of justice , punctuality , fidelity and pity .
i hate the <unk> of the name of friendship to signify <unk> and worldly alliances .
i much prefer the company of <unk> and <unk> , to the silken and perfumed amity which only <unk> its days of encounter by a frivolous display , by rides in a <unk> , [ 302 ] and dinners at the best taverns .
the end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined ; more strict than any of which we have experience .
it is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death .
it is fit for serene days , and graceful gifts , and country rambles , but also for rough roads and hard fare , shipwreck , poverty , and persecution .
it keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the <unk> of religion .
we are to <unk> to each other the daily needs and offices of man 's life , and embellish it by courage , wisdom and unity .
it should never fall into something usual and settled , but should be alert and inventive , and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery .
14 .
friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly , each so <unk> , and so happily adapted , and withal so circumstanced , ( for even in that particular , a poet says , love demands that the parties be altogether paired , ) that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured .
it can not subsist in its perfection , say some of those who are learned in this warm <name> of the heart , betwixt more than two .
i am not quite so strict in my terms , perhaps because i have never known so high a fellowship as others .
i please my imagination more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other , and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence .
but i find this law of one to one , [ 303 ] peremptory for conversation , which is the practice and consummation of friendship .
do not mix waters too much .
the best mix as ill as good and bad .
you shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two several men , but let all three of you come together , and you shall not have one new and hearty word .
two may talk and one may hear , but three can not take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort .
in good company there is never such discourse between two , across the table , as takes place when you leave them alone .
in good company , the individuals at once <unk> their egotism into a social soul exactly <unk> with the several <unk> there present .
no <unk> of friend to friend , no <unk> of brother to sister , of wife to husband , are there pertinent , but quite otherwise .
only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party , and not poorly limited to his own .
now this convention , which good sense demands , destroys the high freedom of great conversation , which requires an absolute running of two souls into one .
15 .
no two men but being left alone with each other , enter into simpler relations .
yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse .
unrelated men give little <name> to each other ; <name> never suspect the latent powers of each .
we talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation , as if it were a permanent property in some individuals .
conversation is an evanescent relation ,  no more .
a man is reputed to have thought and eloquence ; he can not , for all that , say a word to his cousin or his uncle .
they accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade .
in the sun it <name> <name> the hour .
among those who enjoy his thought , he <name> regain his tongue .
16 .
friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and <unk> , that <unk> each with the presence of power and of consent in the other party .
let me be alone to the end of the world , rather than that my friend should <unk> by a word or a look his real sympathy .
i am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance .
let him not cease an instant to be himself .
the only <name> i have in his being mine , is that the not mine is mine .
i hate , where i looked for a manly furtherance , or at least a manly resistance , to find a mush of concession .
better be a <unk> in the side of your friend , than his <name> .
the condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it .
that high office requires great and sublime parts .
there must be very two before there can be very one .
let it be an alliance of two large formidable natures , mutually beheld , mutually feared , before yet they recognize the deep identity which beneath these <unk> unites them .
17 .
he only is fit for this society who is magnanimous ; who is sure that greatness and goodness are always economy ; who is not swift to <unk> with his fortunes .
let him not <unk> with this .
leave to the <name> its ages to grow , nor expect to <unk> the births of the eternal .
friendship demands a religious treatment .
we talk of choosing our friends , but friends are <unk> .
reverence is a great part of it .
treat your friend as a spectacle .
of course he has merits that are not yours , and that you can not honor , if you must needs hold him close to your person .
stand aside ; give those merits room ; let them mount and expand .
are you the friend of your <unk> buttons , or of his thought ?
to a great heart he <name> still be a stranger in a thousand particulars , that he may come near in the <unk> ground .
leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property , and to suck a short and <unk> pleasure instead of the noblest benefits .
18 .
let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation .
why should we <unk> <name> and beautiful souls by intruding on them ?
why insist on rash personal relations with your friend ?
why go to his house , or know his mother and brother and sisters ?
why be visited by him at your own ?
are these things material to our covenant ?
leave this touching and clawing .
let him be to me a spirit .
a message , a thought , a sincerity , a glance from him i want , but not news , nor <unk> .
i can get politics , and chat , and <unk> conveniences , from cheaper companions .
should not the society of my friend be to me poetic , pure , universal , and great as nature itself ?
ought i to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon , or that clump of waving grass that divides the <name> ?
let us not <unk> but raise it to that standard .
that great defying eye , that scornful beauty of his mien and action , do not pique yourself on reducing , but rather fortify and enhance .
worship his <unk> ; wish him not less by a thought , but hoard and tell them all .
guard him as thy counterpart .
let him be to thee forever a sort of beautiful enemy , <unk> , devoutly revered , and not a trivial <unk> to be soon <unk> and cast aside .
the hues of the <name> , the light of the <name> , are not to be seen , if the eye is too near .
to my friend i write a letter , and from him i receive a letter .
that seems to you a little .
it suffices me .
it is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give and of me to receive .
it <unk> nobody .
in these warm lines the heart <name> trust itself , as it <name> not to the tongue , and pour out the prophecy of a <unk> existence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good .
19 .
respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience for its opening .
we must be our own before we can be another 's .
there is at least this satisfaction in crime , according to the latin proverb ;  you can speak to your accomplice on even terms .
<unk> <unk> [ 304 ] <unk> , <unk> .
to those whom we admire and love , at first we can not .
yet the least defect of self-possession <unk> , in my judgment , the entire relation .
there can never be deep peace between two spirits , never mutual respect until , in their dialogue , each stands for the whole world .
20 .
what is so great as friendship , let us <name> with what grandeur of spirit we can .
let us be silent ,  so we may hear the whisper of the gods .
let us not interfere .
who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls , or how to say anything to such ?
no matter how ingenious , no matter how graceful and bland .
there are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom , and for you to say aught is to be frivolous .
wait , and thy heart shall speak .
wait until the necessary and everlasting <unk> you , until day and night avail themselves of your lips .
the only reward of virtue , is virtue ; the only way to have a friend is to be one .
you shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house .
if unlike , his soul only <unk> the faster from you , and you shall catch never a true glance of his eye .
we see the <name> afar off , and they repel us ; why should we intrude ?
late ,  very late ,  we perceive that no arrangements , no introductions , no <unk> or habits of society , would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we <name> ,  but solely the <unk> of nature in us to the same degree it is in them ; then shall we meet as water with water ; and if we should not meet them then , we shall not want them , for we are already they .
in the last analysis , love is only the reflection of a man 's own <unk> from other men .
men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends , as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul .
21 .
the higher the style we demand of friendship , of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and blood .
we walk alone in the world .
friends , such as we <name> , are dreams and fables .
but a sublime <name> cheers ever the faithful heart , that elsewhere , in other regions of the universal power , souls are now acting , enduring and daring , which can love us , and which we can love .
we may congratulate ourselves that the period of <unk> , [ 305 ] of follies , of blunders , and of shame , is passed in solitude , and when we are finished men , we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands .
only be admonished by what you already see , not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons , where no friendship can be .
our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god attends .
by <unk> in your path , though you forfeit the little you gain the great .
you demonstrate yourself , so as to put yourself out of the reach of false relations , and you draw to you the first-born of the world , those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at once , and before whom the vulgar great show as <unk> and shadows merely .
22 .
it is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual , as if so we could lose any genuine love .
whatever correction of our popular views we make from insight , nature <name> be sure to bear us out in , and though it seem to <name> us of some <name> , <name> repay us with a greater .
let us feel , if we <name> , the absolute insulation of man .
we are sure that we have all in us .
we go to europe , or we pursue persons , or we read books , in the instinctive <name> that these <name> call it out and reveal us to ourselves .
beggars all .
the persons are such as we ; the europe , an old faded garment of dead persons ; the books , their ghosts .
let us drop this idolatry .
let us give over this <unk> .
let us even bid our dearest friends farewell , and defy them , saying , " who are you ?
<unk> me .
i <name> be dependent no more . "
ah !
seest thou not , o brother , that thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform , and only be more each other 's , because we are more our own ?
a friend is <unk> : [ 306 ] he looks to the past and the future .
he is the child of all my foregoing hours , the prophet of those to come , and the <unk> [ 307 ] of a greater friend .
23 .
i do then with my friends as i do with my books .
i would have them where i can find them , but i seldom use them .
we must have society on our own terms , and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause .
i can not afford to speak much with my friend .
if he is great , he makes me so great that i can not descend to converse .
in the great days , <unk> hover before me , far before me in the firmament .
i ought then to dedicate myself to them .
i go in that i may seize them , i go out that i may seize them .
i fear only that i may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light .
then , though i prize my friends , i can not afford to talk with them and study their visions , lest i lose my own .
it would indeed give me a certain household <name> to quit this lofty seeking , this spiritual astronomy , or search of stars , and come down to warm sympathies with you ; but then i know well i shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods .
it is true , next week i shall have languid moods , when i can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects ; then i shall regret the lost literature of your mind , and wish you were by my side again .
but if you come , perhaps you <name> fill my mind only with new visions , not with yourself but with your <unk> , and i shall not be able any more than now to converse with you .
so i <name> owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse .
i <name> receive from them , not what they have , but what they are .
they shall give me that which properly they can not give , but which <unk> from them .
but they shall not hold me by any relations less <unk> and pure .
we <name> meet as though we met not , and part as though we parted not .
24 .
it has seemed to me lately more possible than i knew , to <name> a friendship greatly , on one side , without due correspondence on the other .
why should i <unk> myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious ?
it never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space , and only a small part on the reflecting planet .
let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion .
if he is unequal , he <name> presently pass away ; but thou <name> enlarged by thy own shining , and no longer a mate for frogs and worms , dost soar and burn with the gods of the <unk> .
[ 308 ] it is thought a disgrace to love <unk> .
but the great <name> see that true love can not be <unk> .
true love transcends the unworthy object , and dwells and broods on the eternal , and when the poor interposed mask <unk> , it is not sad , but feels rid of so much earth , and feels its <unk> the surer .
yet these things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation .
the essence of friendship is <unk> , a total magnanimity and trust .
it must not surmise or provide for infirmity .
it treats its object as a god , that it may <unk> both .
heroism [ 309 ] " paradise is under the shadow of swords , " [ 310 ] <unk> 1 .
in the elder english <unk> , [ 311 ] and mainly in the plays of beaumont and <name> , [ 312 ] there is a constant recognition of <unk> , as if a <name> behavior were as easily marked in the society of their age , as color is in our american population .
when any <name> , <name> , or <unk> [ 313 ] enters , though he be a stranger , the duke or governor exclaims , this is a gentleman ,  and <unk> <unk> without end ; but all the rest are slag and refuse .
in <name> with this delight in personal advantages , there is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character and dialogue ,  as in <unk> , sophocles , the mad lover , the double marriage , [ 314 ]  wherein the speaker is so <name> and cordial , and on such deep grounds of character , that the dialogue , on the slightest additional incident in the plot , rises naturally into poetry .
among many texts , take the following .
the <name> martius has conquered athens  all but the invincible spirits of sophocles , the duke of athens , and <unk> , his wife .
the beauty of the latter <unk> martius , and he seeks to save her husband ; but sophocles <name> not ask his life , although assured , that a word <name> save him , and the execution of both proceeds .
" <unk> bid thy wife farewell .
<unk> no , i <name> take no leave .
my <unk> , yonder , above , 'bout <unk> 's crown .
[ 315 ] my spirit shall hover for thee .
prithee , haste .
<unk> stay , sophocles  with this , tie up my sight ; let not soft nature so transformed be , and lose her gentler <unk> humanity , to make me see my lord bleed .
so , 't is well ; never one object underneath the sun <name> i behold before my sophocles : farewell ; now teach the romans how to die .
<unk> dost know what 't is to die ?
<unk> thou dost not , martius , and therefore , not what 't is to live ; to die is to begin to live .
it is to end an old , stale , weary work , and to commence a newer and a better .
't is to leave deceitful knaves for the society of gods and goodness .
thou , thyself , must part at last , from all thy garlands , pleasures , triumphs , and prove thy fortitude what then 'twill do .
<unk> but <name> not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus ?
<unk> why should i grieve or vex for being sent to them i ever loved best ?
now , i 'll kneel , but with my back toward thee ; 't is the last duty this trunk can do the gods .
<unk> strike , strike , <unk> , or martius ' heart <name> leap out at his mouth : this is a man , a woman !
kiss thy lord , and live with all the freedom you were wont .
o love !
thou doubly hast afflicted me with virtue and with beauty .
treacherous heart , my hand shall cast thee quick into my urn , ere thou <unk> this knot of piety .
<unk> what ails my brother ?
<unk> martius , oh martius , thou now hast found a way to conquer me .
<unk> o <name> of rome !
what gratitude can speak fit words to follow such a deed as this ?
<unk> this admirable duke , <unk> , with his disdain of fortune and of death , <unk> himself , has <unk> me , and though my arm hath <unk> his body here , his soul hath <unk> martius ' soul .
by romulus , [ 316 ] he is all soul , i think ; he hath no flesh , and spirit can not be <unk> ; then we have vanquished nothing ; he is free , and martius walks now in captivity . "
2 .
i do not readily remember any poem , play , sermon , novel , or oration , that our press vents in the last few years , which goes to the same tune .
we have a great many <unk> and <unk> , but not often the sound of any fife .
yet , wordsworth 's <unk> , and the ode of " <name> , " [ 317 ] and some <unk> , have a certain <name> music ; and <name> [ 318 ] <name> sometimes draw a stroke like the portrait of lord <unk> , given by <unk> of burley .
[ 319 ] <name> carlyle , [ 320 ] with his natural taste for what is manly and daring in character , has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical and historical pictures .
earlier , <name> burns [ 321 ] has given us a song or two .
in the <unk> <unk> , [ 322 ] there is an account of the battle of <unk> , [ 323 ] which deserves to be read .
and <name> <unk> 's [ 324 ] history of the saracens <unk> the prodigies of individual valor with admiration , all the more evident on the part of the <unk> , that he seems to think that his place in <name> oxford [ 325 ] requires of him some proper protestations of abhorrence .
but if we explore the literature of heroism , we shall quickly come to plutarch , [ 326 ] who is its doctor and historian .
to him we owe the <unk> , [ 327 ] the <name> , [ 328 ] the <unk> , [ 329 ] the scipio [ 330 ] of old , and i must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the ancient writers .
each of his " lives " is a refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and political <unk> .
a wild courage , a <unk> [ 331 ] not of the schools , but of the blood , shines in every anecdote , and has given that book its immense fame .
3 .
we need books of this <unk> <unk> virtue , more than books of political science , or of private economy .
life is a festival only to the wise .
seen from the nook and <unk> of <name> , it wears a ragged and dangerous front .
the <unk> of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also .
the disease and deformity around us certify the <unk> of natural , intellectual , and moral laws , and often violation on violation to breed such compound misery .
a <unk> that bends a man 's head back to his heels , hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes , insanity that makes him eat grass ; war , plague , cholera , famine indicate a certain ferocity in nature , which , as it had its inlet by human crime , must have its outlet by human suffering .
unhappily , almost no man exists who has not in his own person become , to some amount , a <unk> in the sin , and so made himself liable to a share in the <unk> .
4 .
our culture , therefore , must not omit the arming of the man .
let him hear in season that he is born into the state of war , and that the commonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go dancing in the weeds of peace , but warned , <unk> , and neither defying nor dreading the thunder , let him take both reputation and life in his hand , and , with perfect <unk> , dare the <unk> and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech , and the <unk> of his behavior .
5 .
toward all this external evil , the man within the breast assumes a warlike attitude , and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with the infinite army of enemies .
to this military attitude of the soul we give the name of heroism .
its rudest form is the contempt for safety and ease , which makes the attractiveness of war .
it is a self-trust which <unk> the restraints of <name> , in the <unk> of its energy and power to repair the harms it may suffer .
the hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his <name> , but pleasantly , and , as it were , merrily , he advances to his own music , alike in frightful alarms , and in the tipsy mirth of universal <unk> .
there is somewhat not philosophical in heroism ; there is somewhat not holy in it ; it seems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it ; it has pride ; it is the extreme of individual nature .
nevertheless , we must profoundly revere it .
there is somewhat in great actions , which does not allow us to go behind them .
heroism feels and never reasons , and therefore is always right ; and although a different breeding , different religion , and greater intellectual activity , would have modified or even reversed the particular action , yet for the hero , that thing he does is the highest deed , and is not open to the censure of philosophers or <unk> .
it is the <unk> of the <unk> man , that he finds a quality in him that is negligent of expense , of health , of life , of danger , of hatred , of reproach , and knows that his <name> is higher and more excellent than all actual and all possible antagonists .
6 .
heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind , and in contradiction , for a time , to the voice of the great and good .
heroism is an obedience [ 332 ] to a secret impulse of an individual 's character .
now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him , for every man must be supposed to see a little further on his own proper path than any one else .
therefore , just and wise men take <unk> at his act , until after some little time be past : then they see it to be in unison with their acts .
all prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity ; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good .
but it finds its own success at last , and then the prudent also <unk> .
7 .
self-trust is the essence of heroism .
it is the state of the soul at war , and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and wrong , and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents .
it speaks the truth , and it is just , generous , hospitable , temperate , scornful of petty calculations , and scornful of being scorned .
it <unk> ; it is of an undaunted boldness , and of a fortitude not to be wearied out .
its jest is the littleness of common life .
that false <name> which <unk> on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of heroism .
heroism , like <unk> , [ 333 ] is almost ashamed of its body .
what shall it say , then , to the <unk> , and <unk> , to the toilet , compliments , quarrels , cards , and <unk> , which rack the wit of all human society .
what joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures !
there seems to be no interval between greatness and meanness .
when the spirit is not master of the world then it is its dupe .
yet the little man takes the great hoax so innocently , works in it so headlong and believing , is born red , and dies gray , arranging his toilet , attending on his own health , laying traps for sweet food and strong wine , setting his heart on a horse or a rifle , made happy with a little gossip or a little praise , that the great soul can not choose but laugh at such <name> nonsense .
" indeed , these humble considerations [ 334 ] make me out of love with greatness .
what a disgrace is it to me to take note how many pairs of silk stockings thou hast , namely , these and those that were the <unk> ones ; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts , as one for <unk> , and one other for use ! "
8 .
citizens , thinking after the laws of arithmetic , consider the inconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside , reckon narrowly the loss of time and the unusual display : the soul of a better quality thrusts back the unreasonable economy into the vaults of life , and says , i <name> obey the god , and the sacrifice and the fire he <name> provide .
<unk> <unk> , [ 335 ] the arabian <unk> , describes a heroic extreme in the hospitality of <unk> , in <unk> , [ 336 ] " when i was in <unk> i saw a great building , like a palace , the gates of which were open and fixed back to the wall with large nails .
i asked the reason , and was told that the house had not been shut , night or day , for a hundred years .
strangers may present themselves at any hour , and in whatever number ; the master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals , and is never happier than when they tarry for some time .
nothing of the kind have i seen in any other country . "
the magnanimous know very well that they who give time , or money , or shelter , to the stranger  so it be done for love , and not for ostentation  do , as it were , put god under obligation to them , so perfect are the compensations of the universe .
in some way the time they seem to lose is redeemed , and the pains they seem to take <unk> themselves .
these men fan the flame of human love , and raise the standard of civil virtue among mankind .
but hospitality must be for service , and not for show , or it pulls down the host .
the brave soul rates itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies .
it gives what it hath , and all it hath , but its own majesty can lend a better <name> to <unk> [ 337 ] and fair water than belong to city feasts .
9 .
the temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor to the <unk> he has .
but he loves it for its <unk> , not for its <unk> .
it seems not worth his while to be solemn , and denounce with bitterness <unk> or <unk> , the use of tobacco , or opium , or tea , or silk , or gold .
a great man scarcely knows how he <unk> , how he dresses ; but without railing or precision , his living is natural and poetic .
<name> eliot , [ 338 ] the indian apostle , drank water , and said of wine ,  " it is a <name> , generous liquor , and we should be humbly thankful for it , but , as i remember , water was made before it . "
better still is the temperance of king <name> [ 339 ] who poured out on the ground unto the lord the water which three of his warriors had brought him to drink , at the peril of their lives .
10 .
it is told of brutus , [ 340 ] that when he fell on his sword , after the battle of philippi , [ 341 ] he quoted a line of <unk> , [ 342 ]  " o virtue !
i have followed thee through life , and i find thee at last but a shade . "
i doubt not the hero is <unk> by this report .
the heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness .
it does not ask to dine nicely , and to sleep warm .
the essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough .
poverty is its ornament .
it does not need plenty , and can very well abide its loss .
11 .
but that which takes my fancy most , in the heroic class , is the good humor and hilarity they exhibit .
it is a height to which common duty can very well attain , to suffer and to dare with solemnity .
but these rare souls set opinion , success , and life , at so cheap a rate , that they <name> not soothe their enemies by petitions , or the show of sorrow , but wear their own habitual greatness .
scipio , [ 343 ] charged with <unk> , refuses to do himself so great a disgrace as to wait for justification , though he had the scroll of his accounts in his hands , but tears it to pieces before the <unk> .
socrates ' [ 344 ] condemnation of himself to be maintained in all honor in the <unk> , [ 345 ] during his life , and sir <name> more 's [ 346 ] <unk> at the scaffold , are of the same strain .
in beaumont and <name> 's " sea voyage , " <unk> tells the stout captain and his company , <unk> why , slaves , 't is in our power to <name> ye .
<unk> very likely , 'tis in our powers , then , to be hanged , and scorn ye .
these replies are sound and whole .
sport is the bloom and glow of a perfect health .
the great <name> not condescend to take anything seriously ; all must be as <name> as the song of a canary , though it were the building of cities , or the eradication of old and foolish churches and nations , which have <unk> the earth long thousands of years .
simple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind them , and play their own play in innocent defiance of the <unk> [ 347 ] of the world ; and such would appear , could we see the human race assembled in vision , like little children frolicking together ; though , to the eyes of mankind at large , they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and influences .
12 .
the interest these fine stories have for us , the power of a romance over the boy who <unk> the forbidden book under his bench at school , our delight in the hero , is the main fact to our purpose .
all these great and transcendent properties are ours .
if we <unk> in beholding the greek energy , the <name> pride , it is that we are already <unk> the same sentiment .
let us find room for this great guest in our small houses .
the first step of <unk> <name> be to <unk> us of our superstitious associations with places and times , with number and size .
why should these words , athenian , <name> , <name> , and england , so tingle in the ear ?
where the heart is , there the muses , there the gods sojourn , and not in any geography of fame .
massachusetts , connecticut river , and boston bay , you think paltry places , and the ear loves names of foreign and classic <unk> .
but here we are ; and , if we <name> tarry a little , we may come to learn that here is best .
see to it only that thyself is here ;  and <name> and nature , <name> and fate , friends , angels , and the supreme being , shall not be absent from the chamber where thou <unk> .
<unk> , [ 348 ] brave and affectionate , does not seem to us to need olympus [ 349 ] to die upon , nor the syrian <name> .
he lies very well where he is .
the <unk> [ 350 ] were handsome ground enough for washington to tread , and london streets for the feet of <name> .
[ 351 ] a great man makes his climate genial in the imagination of men , and its air the beloved element of all delicate spirits .
that country is the fairest , which is inhabited by the noblest minds .
the pictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions of pericles , [ 352 ] xenophon , [ 353 ] <name> , [ 354 ] bayard , [ 355 ] <name> , [ 356 ] hampden , [ 357 ] teach us how <unk> mean our life is , that we , by the depth of our living , should deck it with more than regal or national splendor , and act on principles that should interest man and nature in the length of our days .
13 .
we have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men , who never ripened , or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary .
when we see their air and mien , when we hear them speak of society , or books , or religion , we admire their superiority ; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state ; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant , who is sent to work revolutions .
but they enter an active profession , and the forming colossus [ 358 ] shrinks to the common size of man .
the magic they used was the ideal tendencies , which always make the actual ridiculous ; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they put their horses of the sun to plow in its furrow .
they found no example and no companion , and their heart fainted .
what then ?
the lesson they gave in their first aspirations , is yet true ; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief .
or why should a woman <unk> herself to any historical woman , and think , because <unk> , [ 359 ] or <unk> , [ 360 ] or de <unk> , [ 361 ] or the <unk> souls who have had genius and cultivation , do not satisfy the imagination and the serene <unk> , [ 362 ] none can ,  certainly not she .
why not ?
she has a new and <unk> problem to solve , perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed .
let the maiden , with erect soul , walk serenely on her way , accept the hint of each new experience , search , in turn , all the objects that solicit her eye , that she may learn the power and the charm of her new-born being which is the kindling of a new <name> in the recesses of space .
the fair girl , who <unk> interference by a decided and proud choice of influences , so careless of pleasing , so wilful and lofty , inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness .
the silent heart encourages her ; o friend , never strike sail to a fear !
come into port greatly , or sail with god the seas .
not in vain you live , for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision .
14 .
the characteristic of a genuine heroism is its persistency .
all men have wandering impulses , fits and starts of generosity .
but when you have chosen your part , abide by it , and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world .
the heroic can not be the common , nor the common the heroic .
yet we have the weakness to expect the sympathy of people in those actions whose excellence is that they outrun sympathy , and appeal to a tardy justice .
if you would serve your brother , because it is fit for you to serve him , do not take back your words when you find that prudent people do not commend you .
adhere to your own act , and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant , and broken the monotony of a decorous age .
it was a high counsel [ 363 ] that i once heard given to a young person ,  " always do what you are afraid to do . "
a simple manly character need never make an apology , but should regard its past action with the calmness of <unk> , [ 364 ] when he admitted that the event of the battle was happy , yet did not regret his <unk> from the battle .
15 .
there is no weakness or exposure for which we can not find consolation in the thought ,  this is a part of my constitution , part of my relation and office to my fellow-creature .
has nature <unk> with me that i should never appear to disadvantage , never make a ridiculous figure ?
let us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money .
greatness once and forever has done with opinion .
we tell our charities , not because we wish to be praised for them , not because we think they have great merit , but for our justification .
it is a capital blunder ; as you discover , when another man <unk> his charities .
16 .
to speak the truth , even with some <unk> , to live with some <unk> of temperance , or some extremes of generosity , seems to be an <unk> which common <unk> would appoint to those who are at ease and in plenty , in sign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude of suffering men .
and not only need we breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties of <unk> , of debt , of solitude , of <unk> , but it <unk> the wise man to look with a bold eye into those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men , and to <unk> himself with disgusting forms of disease , with sounds of <unk> , and the vision of violent death .
17 .
times of heroism are generally times of terror , but the day never shines in which this element may not work .
the circumstances of man , we say , are historically somewhat better in this country , and at this hour , than perhaps ever before .
more freedom exists for culture .
it <name> not now run against an ax at the first step out of the beaten track of opinion .
but whoso is heroic <name> always find crises to try his edge .
human virtue demands her champions and martyrs , and the trial of persecution always proceeds .
it is but the other day that the brave lovejoy [ 365 ] gave his breast to the bullets of a mob , for the rights of free speech and opinion , and died when it was better not to live .
18 .
i see not any road to perfect peace which a man can walk , but to take counsel of his own bosom .
let him quit too much association , let him go home much , and establish himself in those courses he <unk> .
the <unk> retention of simple and high sentiments in obscure duties is <unk> the character to that temper which <name> work with honor , if need be , in the tumult , or on the scaffold .
whatever outrages have happened to men may befall a man again ; and very easily in a republic , if there appear any signs of a decay of religion .
coarse slander , fire , tar and feathers , and the <unk> , the youth may freely bring home to his mind , and with what sweetness of temper he can , and inquire how fast he can fix his sense of duty , <unk> such penalties , whenever it may please the next newspaper and a sufficient number of his neighbors to pronounce his opinions incendiary .
19 .
it may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most susceptible heart to see how quick a bound nature has set to the utmost infliction of malice .
we rapidly approach a brink over which no enemy can follow us .
" let them rave : [ 366 ] thou <name> quiet in thy grave . "
in the gloom of our ignorance of what shall be , in the hour when we are deaf to the higher voices , who does not envy them who have seen safely to an end their <unk> endeavor ?
who that sees the meanness of our politics , but <unk> <unk> washington that he is long already wrapped in his shroud , and forever safe ; that he was laid sweet in his grave , the <name> of humanity not yet <unk> in him ?
who does not sometimes envy the good and brave , who are no more to suffer from the <unk> of the natural world , and await with curious complacency the speedy term of his own conversation with finite nature ?
and yet the love that <name> be annihilated sooner than treacherous has already made death impossible , and affirms itself no mortal , but a native of the deeps of absolute and <unk> being .
manners [ 367 ] 1 .
half the world , it is said , knows not how the other half live .
our exploring expedition saw the <unk> islanders [ 368 ] getting their dinner off human bones ; and they are said to eat their own wives and children .
the <unk> of the modern inhabitants of <unk> [ 369 ] ( west of old thebes ) is philosophical to a fault .
to set up their housekeeping , nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots , a stone to grind meal , and a mat which is the bed .
the house , namely , a tomb , is ready without rent or taxes .
no rain can pass through the roof , and there is no door , for there is no want of one , as there is nothing to lose .
if the house do not please them , they walk out and enter another , as there are several hundreds at their command .
" it is somewhat singular , " adds <unk> , to whom we owe this account , " to talk of happiness among people who live in <unk> , among corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they knew nothing of . "
in the deserts of <unk> [ 370 ] the <unk> still dwell in caves , like <unk> , and the language of these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats , and to the whistling of birds .
again , the <unk> [ 371 ] have no proper names ; individuals are called after their height , thickness , or other accidental quality , and have <unk> merely .
but the salt , the dates , the <name> , and the gold , for which these horrible regions are visited , find their way into countries , where the purchaser and <unk> can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and <unk> ; countries where man serves himself with metals , wood , stone , glass , gum , cotton , silk and wool ; honors himself with architecture ; [ 372 ] writes laws , and <unk> to execute his <name> through the hands of many nations ; and , especially , establishes a select society , running through all the countries of intelligent men , a <unk> aristocracy , or fraternity of the best , which , without written law , or exact usage of any kind , <unk> itself , <unk> every <unk> island , and adopts and makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears .
2 .
what fact more conspicuous in modern history , than the creation of the gentleman ?
chivalry [ 373 ] is that , and loyalty is that , and , in english literature , half the drama , and all the novels , from sir <name> <name> [ 374 ] to sir <name> <name> , [ 375 ] paint this figure .
the word gentleman , which , like the word <name> , must hereafter characterize the present and the few preceding centuries , by the importance attached to it , is a homage to personal and <unk> properties .
frivolous and fantastic additions have got associated with the name , but the steady interest of mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable properties which it <unk> .
an element which unites all the most forcible persons of every country ; makes them intelligible and agreeable to each other , and is somewhat so precise , that it is at once felt if an individual lack the <unk> sign , [ 376 ] can not be any casual product , but must be an average result of the character and faculties universally found in men .
it seems a certain permanent average ; as the atmosphere is a permanent composition , whilst so many gases are combined only to be <unk> .
comme il <unk> , is the frenchman 's description of good society , as we must be .
it is a spontaneous fruit of talents and feelings of precisely that class who have most vigor , who take the lead in the world of this hour , and , though far from pure , far from constituting the <unk> and highest tone of human feeling , is as good as the whole society permits it to be .
it is made of the spirit , more than of the talent of men , and is a compound result , into which every great force enters as an <unk> , namely , virtue , wit , beauty , wealth , and power .
3 .
there is something equivocal in all the words in use to express the excellence of manners and social cultivation , because the qualities are <unk> , and the last effect is assumed by the senses as the cause .
the word gentleman has not any <unk> abstract [ 377 ] to express the quality .
<unk> is mean , and <unk> [ 378 ] is obsolete .
but we must keep alive in the vernacular the distinction between fashion , a word of narrow and often sinister meaning , and the heroic character which the gentleman imports .
the usual words , however , must be respected : they <name> be found to contain the root of the matter .
the point of distinction in all this class of names , as courtesy , chivalry , fashion , and the like , is , that the flower and fruit , not the grain of the tree , are contemplated .
it is beauty which is the aim this time , and not worth .
the result is now in question , although our words intimate well enough the popular feeling , that the appearance supposes a substance .
the gentleman is a man of truth , lord of his own actions , and expressing that lordship in his behavior , not in any manner dependent and servile either on persons , or opinions , or possessions .
beyond this fact of truth and real force , the word denotes <unk> and benevolence : manhood first , and then gentleness .
the popular notion certainly adds a condition of ease and fortune ; but that is a natural result of personal force and love , that they should possess and dispense the goods of the world .
in times of violence , every eminent person must fall in with many opportunities to approve his <unk> and worth ; therefore every man 's name that emerged at all from the mass in the feudal ages , [ 379 ] rattles in our ear like a flourish of trumpets .
but personal force never goes out of fashion .
that is still paramount to-day , and , in the moving crowd of good society , the men of valor and reality are known , and rise to their natural place .
the competition is transferred from war to politics and trade , but the personal force appears readily enough in these new <unk> .
4 .
power first , or no leading class .
in politics and in trade , <unk> and pirates are of better promise than talkers and clerks .
god knows [ 380 ] that all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door ; but whenever used in strictness , and with any emphasis , the name <name> be found to point at original energy .
it describes a man standing in his own right , and working after untaught methods .
in a good lord , there must first be a good animal , at least to the extent of yielding the incomparable advantage of animal spirits .
[ 381 ] the ruling class must have more , but they must have these , giving in every company the sense of power , [ 382 ] which makes things easy to be done which <unk> the wise .
the society of the energetic class , in their friendly and festive meetings , is full of courage , and of attempts , which intimidate the pale scholar .
the courage which girls exhibit is like a battle of lundy 's <name> , [ 383 ] or a <unk> .
the intellect <unk> on memory to make some supplies to face these <unk> squadrons .
but memory is a base mendicant with basket and badge , in the presence of these sudden masters .
the rulers of society must be up to the work of the world , and equal to their versatile office : men of the right <unk> pattern , [ 384 ] who have great range of affinity .
i am far from believing the timid maxim [ 385 ] of lord falkland , [ 386 ] ( " that for ceremony there must go two to it ; since a bold fellow <name> go through the <unk> forms , " ) and am of opinion that the gentleman is the bold fellow whose forms are not to be broken through ; and only that <unk> nature is rightful master , which is the complement of whatever person it <unk> with .
my gentleman gives the law where he is ; he <name> <unk> saints in chapel , <unk> veterans in the field , and <unk> all courtesy in the hall .
he is good company for pirates , and good with <unk> ; so that it is useless to fortify yourself against him ; he has the private entrance to all minds , and i could as easily exclude myself as him .
the famous gentlemen of <name> and europe have been of this strong type : saladin , [ 387 ] <unk> , [ 388 ] the cid , [ 389 ] <name> cæsar , [ 390 ] scipio , [ 391 ] <name> , [ 392 ] pericles , [ 393 ] and the <unk> personages .
they sat very carelessly in their chairs , and were too excellent themselves to value any condition at a high rate .
5 .
a plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary , in the popular judgment , to the completion of this man of the world : and it is a material deputy which walks through the dance which the first has led .
money is not essential , but this wide affinity is , which transcends the habits of <unk> and caste , and makes itself felt by men of all classes .
if the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles , and not with <unk> , he <name> never be a leader in fashion ; and if the man of the people can not speak on equal terms with the gentleman , so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order , he is not to be feared .
<unk> , [ 394 ] socrates , [ 395 ] and <unk> [ 396 ] are gentlemen of the best blood , who have chosen the condition of poverty , when that of wealth was equally open to them .
i use these old names , but the men i speak of are my contemporaries .
[ 397 ] fortune <name> not supply to every generation one of these <unk> knights , but every collection of men furnishes some example of the class : and the politics of this country , and the trade of every town , are controlled by these hardy and irresponsible <unk> , who have invention to take the lead , and a broad sympathy which puts them in fellowship with crowds , and makes their action popular .
6 .
the manners of this class are observed and caught with devotion by men of taste .
the association of these masters with each other , and with men intelligent of their merits , is mutually agreeable and stimulating .
the good forms , the happiest expressions of each , are repeated and adopted .
by swift consent , everything superfluous is dropped , everything graceful is renewed .
fine manners [ 398 ] show themselves formidable to the uncultivated man .
they are a <unk> science of defence to parry and intimidate ; but once matched by the skill of the other party , they drop the point of the sword ,  points and fences disappear , and the youth finds himself in a more transparent atmosphere , wherein life is a less troublesome game , and not a misunderstanding rises between the players .
manners aim to facilitate life , to get rid of <unk> , and bring the man pure to <unk> .
they aid our dealing and conversation , as a railway aids traveling , by getting rid of all <unk> obstructions of the road , and leaving nothing to be conquered but pure space .
these forms very soon become fixed , and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with more heed , that it becomes a badge of social and civil distinctions .
thus grows up fashion , an equivocal semblance , the most <unk> , the most fantastic and frivolous , the most feared and followed , and which morals and violence assault in vain .
7 .
there exists a strict relation between the class of power , and the exclusive and polished circles .
the last are always filled or filling from the first .
the strong men usually give some allowance even to the <unk> of fashion , for that affinity they find in it .
<name> , [ 399 ] child of the revolution , destroyer of the old <unk> , [ 400 ] never ceased to court the <unk> st. germain : [ 401 ] doubtless with the feeling , that fashion is a homage to men of his stamp .
fashion , though in a strange way , represents all manly virtue .
it is a virtue gone to seed : it is a kind of <unk> honor .
it does not often caress the great , but the children of the great : it is a hall of the past .
it usually sets its face against the great of this hour .
great men are not commonly in its halls : they are absent in the field : they are working , not <unk> .
fashion is made up of their children ; of those , who , through the value and virtue of somebody , have acquired lustre to their name , marks of distinction , means of cultivation and generosity , and , in their physical organization , a certain health and excellence , which secures to them , if not the highest power to work , yet high power to enjoy .
the class of power , the working heroes , the <name> , [ 402 ] the <name> , [ 403 ] the <name> , see that this is the festivity and permanent celebration of such as they ; that fashion is <unk> talent ; is mexico , [ 404 ] <unk> , [ 405 ] and <unk> [ 406 ] [ 407 ] beaten out thin ; that the brilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy names as their own , fifty or sixty years ago .
they are the <unk> , their sons shall be the <unk> , and their sons , in the ordinary course of things , must yield the possession of the harvest , to new competitors with keener eyes and stronger frames .
the city is recruited from the country .
in the year <unk> , it is said , every legitimate monarch in europe was imbecile .
the city would have died out , rotted , and exploded , long ago , but that it was reinforced from the fields .
it is only country which came to town day before yesterday , that is city and court to-day .
8 .
aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable results .
these mutual selections are indestructible .
if they provoke anger in the least favored class , and the excluded majority revenge themselves on the excluding minority , by the strong hand , and kill them , at once a new class finds itself at the top , as certainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk : and if the people should destroy class after class , until two men only were left , one of these would be the leader , and would be involuntarily served and copied by the other .
you may keep this minority out of sight and out of mind , but it is tenacious of life , and is one of the estates of the realm .
[ 408 ] i am the more struck with this tenacity , when i see its work .
it respects the administration of such unimportant matters , that we should not look for any <unk> in its rule .
we sometimes meet men under some strong moral influence , as a patriotic , a literary , a religious movement , and feel that the moral sentiment rules man and nature .
we think all other distinctions and ties <name> be slight and fugitive , this of caste or fashion , for example ; yet come from year to year , and see how permanent that is , in this boston or new york life of man , where , too , it has not the lease countenance from the law of the land .
not in egypt or in <name> a firmer or more impassable line .
here are associations whose ties go over , and under , and through it , a meeting of merchants , a military corps , a <unk> , a <unk> , a professional association , a political , a religious convention ;  the persons seem to draw <unk> near ; yet that assembly once dispersed , its members <name> not in the year meet again .
each returns to his degree in the scale of good society , porcelain remains porcelain , and earthen earthen .
the objects of fashion may be frivolous , or fashion may be <unk> , but the nature of this union and selection can be neither frivolous nor accidental .
each man 's rank in that perfect graduation depends on some symmetry in his structure , or some agreement in his structure to the symmetry of society .
its doors <unk> instantaneously to a natural claim of their own kind .
a natural gentleman finds his way in , and <name> keep the oldest patrician out , who has lost his intrinsic rank .
fashion understands itself ; <unk> and personal superiority of whatever country readily <unk> with those of every other .
the chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished themselves in london and <name> , by the purity of their <unk> .
[ 409 ] 9 .
to say what good of fashion we can ,  it rests on reality , and hates nothing so much as <unk> ;  to exclude and <unk> <unk> , and send them into everlasting " coventry , " [ 410 ] is its delight .
we <unk> , in turn , every other gift of men of the world ; but the habit , even in little and the least matters , of not appealing to any but our own sense of propriety , constitutes the foundation of all chivalry .
there is almost no kind of self-reliance , so it be sane and proportioned , which fashion does not occasionally adopt , and give it the freedom of its saloons .
a sainted soul is always elegant , and , if it <name> , passes unchallenged into the most guarded ring .
but so <name> jock the <unk> pass , in some crisis that brings him thither , and find favor , as long as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance , and the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and <unk> .
for there is nothing settled in manners , but the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual .
the maiden at her first ball , the countryman at a city dinner , believes that there is a ritual according to which every act and compliment must be performed , or the failing party must be cast out of this presence .
later , they learn that good sense and character make their own forms every moment , and speak or abstain , to take wine or refuse it , stay or go , sit in a chair or <unk> with children on the floor , or stand on their head , or what else <unk> , in a new and aboriginal way : and that strong <name> is always in fashion , let who <name> be <unk> .
all that fashion demands is composure , and <unk> .
a circle of men perfectly well-bred would be a company of sensible persons , in which every man's native manners and character appear .
if the <unk> have not this quality , he is nothing .
we are such lovers of self-reliance , that we excuse in man many sins , if he <name> show us a complete satisfaction in his position , which asks no leave to be of mine , or any man 's good opinion .
but any deference to some eminent man or woman of the world , <unk> all privilege of nobility .
he is an <unk> : i have nothing to do with him ; i <name> speak with his master .
a man should not go where he can not <name> his whole sphere or society with him ,  not bodily , the whole circle of his friends , but <unk> .
he should preserve in a new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation , which his daily associates draw him to , else he is shorn of his best beams , and <name> be an orphan in the <unk> club .
" if you could see <unk> <name> <unk> with his tail on !
[ 411 ]  " but <unk> <name> <unk> must always <name> his belongings in some fashion , if not added as honor , then severed as disgrace .
10 .
there <name> always be in society certain persons who are <unk> [ 412 ] of its approbation , and whose glance <name> at any time determine for the curious their standing in the world .
these are the <unk> of the lesser gods .
accept their coldness as an omen of <name> with the loftier deities , and allow them all their privilege .
they are clear in their office , nor could they be thus formidable , without their own merits .
but do not measure the importance of this class by their pretension , or imagine that a <unk> can be the <unk> of honor and shame .
they pass also at their just rate ; for how can they otherwise , in circles which exist as a sort of <unk> office [ 413 ] for the sifting of character ?
11 .
as the first thing man requires of man is reality , so that appears in all the forms of society .
we pointedly , and by name , introduce the parties to each other .
know you before all heaven and earth , that this is <name> , and this is <name> ;  they look each other in the eye ; they grasp each other 's hand , to identify and <unk> each other .
it is a great satisfaction .
a gentleman never <unk> ; his eyes look straight forward , and he assures the other party , first of all , that he has been met .
for what is it that we seek , in so many visits and hospitalities ?
is it your draperies , pictures , and decorations ?
or , do we not <unk> ask .
was a man in the house ?
i may easily go into a great household where there is much substance , excellent provision for comfort , luxury , and taste , and yet not encounter there any <unk> , [ 414 ] who shall subordinate these appendages .
i may go into a cottage , and find a farmer who feels that he is the man i have come to see , and fronts me accordingly .
it was therefore a very natural point of old feudal etiquette , that a gentleman who received a visit , though it were of his sovereign , should not leave his roof , but should wait his arrival at the door of his house .
no house , though it were the tuileries , [ 415 ] or the <unk> , [ 416 ] is good for anything without a master .
and yet we are not often gratified by this hospitality .
everybody we know surrounds himself with a fine house , fine books , conservatory , gardens , equipage , and all manner of toys , as screens to interpose between himself and his guests .
does it not seem as if man was of a very sly , elusive nature , and dreaded nothing so much as a full <unk> front to front with his fellow ?
it were <unk> , i know , quite to abolish the use of these screens , which are of eminent convenience , whether the guest is too great , or too little .
we call together many friends who keep each other in play , or by luxuries and ornaments we amuse the young people , and guard our retirement .
or if , perchance , a searching <unk> comes to our gate , before whose eyes we have no care to stand , then again we run to our curtain , and hide ourselves as <name> [ 417 ] at the voice of the lord god in the garden .
cardinal <unk> , [ 418 ] the pope 's [ 419 ] <unk> at <name> , defended himself from the glances of <name> , by an immense pair of green spectacles .
<name> remarked them , and speedily managed to rally them off : and yet <name> , in his turn , was not great enough , with eight hundred thousand troops at his back , to face a pair of <unk> eyes , but fenced himself with etiquette , and within triple barriers of reserve : and , as all the world knows from madame de <unk> , [ 420 ] was wont , when he found himself observed , to discharge his face of all expression .
but emperors and <name> men are by no means the most skillful masters of good manners .
no rent roll nor <unk> can <unk> skulking and <unk> : and the first point of courtesy must always be truth , as really all forms of <unk> point that way .
12 .
i have just been reading , in mr. <unk> 's [ <unk> ] translation , montaigne 's [ 422 ] account of his journey into italy , and am struck with nothing more <unk> than the self-respecting fashions of the time .
his arrival in each place , the arrival of a gentleman of <name> , is an event of some consequence .
wherever he goes , he pays a visit to whatever <name> or gentleman of note resides upon his road , as a duty to himself and to civilization .
when he leaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks , he causes his arms to be painted and <name> up as a perpetual sign to the house , as was the custom of gentlemen .
13 .
the complement of this graceful self-respect , and that of all the points of good breeding i most require and insist upon , is deference .
i like that every chair should be a throne , and hold a king .
i prefer a tendency to <unk> , to an excess of fellowship .
let the <unk> objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence .
let us not be too much acquainted .
i would have a man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures , that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and <unk> .
[ 423 ] we should meet each morning , as from foreign countries , and spending the day together , should depart at night , as into foreign countries .
in all things i would have the island of a man <unk> .
let us sit apart as the gods , talking from peak to peak all round olympus .
no degree of affection need invade this religion .
this is <unk> and <name> to keep the other sweet .
lovers should guard their strangeness .
if they forgive too much , all slides into confusion and meanness .
it is easy to push this deference to a chinese etiquette ; [ 424 ] but coolness and absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities .
a gentleman makes no noise : a <name> is serene proportionate is our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious house with blast and running , to secure some paltry convenience .
not less i dislike a low sympathy of each with his neighbors 's needs .
must we have a good understanding with one another 's <unk> ?
as foolish people who have lived long together , know when each wants salt or sugar .
i pray my companion , if he wishes for bread , to ask me for bread , and if he wishes for <unk> or arsenic , to ask me for them , and not to hold out his plate , as if i knew already .
every natural function can be dignified by deliberation and privacy .
let us leave hurry to slaves .
the compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should recall , [ 425 ] however remotely , the grandeur of our <name> .
14 .
the flower of courtesy does not very well bide handling , but if we dare to open another leaf , and explore what parts go to its conformation , we shall find also an intellectual quality .
to the leaders of men , the <name> as well as the flesh and the heart must furnish a proportion .
defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions .
men are too coarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs .
it is not quite sufficient to good breeding , a union of kindness and independence .
we imperatively require a perception of , and a homage to , beauty in our companions .
other virtues are in request in the field and work yard , but a certain degree of taste is not to be spared in those we sit with .
i could better eat with one who did not respect the truth or the laws , than with a <unk> and <unk> person .
moral qualities rule the world , but at short distances the senses are despotic .
the same discrimination of fit and fair runs out , if with less <unk> , into all parts of life .
the average spirit of the energetic class is good sense , acting under certain limitations and to certain ends .
it entertains every natural gift .
social in its nature , it respects everything which tends to unite men .
it delights in measure .
[ 426 ] the love of beauty is mainly the love of measure or proportion .
the person who screams , or uses the <unk> degree , or <unk> with heat , puts whole drawing-rooms to flight .
if you wish to be loved , love measure .
you must have genius , or a prodigious usefulness , if you <name> hide the want of measure .
this perception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of the social instrument .
society <name> pardon much to genius and special gifts , but , being in its nature a convention , it loves what is conventional , or what belongs to coming together .
that makes the good and bad of manners , namely , what helps or <unk> fellowship .
for , fashion is not good sense absolute , but relative ; not good sense private , but good sense entertaining company .
it hates corners and sharp points of character , hates quarrelsome , <unk> , solitary , and gloomy people ; hates whatever can interfere with total blending of parties ; whilst it values all peculiarities as in the highest degree refreshing , which can consist with good fellowship .
and besides the general infusion of wit to heighten civility , the direct splendor of intellectual power is ever welcome in fine society as the <unk> addition to its rule and its credit .
15 .
the dry light must shine in to adorn our festival , but it must be tempered and shaded , or that <name> also offend .
accuracy is essential to beauty , and quick perceptions to politeness , but not too quick perceptions .
one may be too punctual and too precise .
he must leave the <unk> of business at the door , when he comes into the palace of beauty .
society loves creole natures , [ 427 ] and sleepy , languishing manners , so that they cover sense , <name> , and good-will : the air of drowsy strength , which <unk> criticism ; perhaps , because such a person seems to reserve himself for the best of the game , and not spend himself on surfaces ; an ignoring eye , which does not see the annoyances , shifts , and inconveniences , that cloud the brow and smother the voice of the sensitive .
16 .
therefore , besides personal force and so much perception as constitutes unerring taste , society demands in its patrician class , another element already intimated , which it significantly terms <unk> , expressing all degrees of generosity , from the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige , up to the heights of magnanimity and love .
insight we must have , or we shall run against one another , and miss the way to our food ; but intellect is selfish and barren .
the secret of success in society , is a certain heartiness and sympathy .
a man who is not happy in the company , can not find any word in his memory that <name> fit the occasion .
all his information is a little impertinent .
a man who is happy there , finds in every turn of the conversation equally lucky occasions for the introduction of that which he has to say .
the favorites of society , and what it calls whole souls , are able men , and of more spirit than wit , who have no uncomfortable egotism , but who exactly fill the hour and the company , contented and contenting , at a marriage or a funeral , a ball or a jury , a <unk> or a <unk> .
england , which is <name> in gentlemen , furnished , in the beginning of the present century , a good model of that genius which the world loves , in mr. fox , [ 428 ] who added to his great abilities the most social disposition , and real love of men .
parliamentary history has few better passages than the debate , in which burke [ 429 ] and fox separated in the house of commons ; when fox urged on his old friend the claims of old friendship with such tenderness , that the house was moved to tears .
another anecdote is so close to my matter , that i must hazard the story .
a <unk> who had long <unk> him for a note of three hundred guineas , found him one day counting gold , and demanded payment .
" no , " said fox , " i owe this money to <name> [ 430 ] : it is a debt of honor : if an accident should happen to me , he has nothing to show . "
" then , " said the <unk> , " i change my debt into a debt of honor , " and tore the note in pieces .
fox thanked the man for his confidence , and paid him , saying , " his debt was of older standing , and <name> must wait . "
lover of <name> , friend of the hindoo , friend of the african slave , he possessed a great personal popularity ; and <name> said of him on the occasion of his visit to <name> , in <unk> , " mr. fox <name> always hold the first place in an assembly at the tuileries . "
17 .
we may easily seem ridiculous in our <unk> of courtesy , whenever we insist on benevolence as its foundation .
the painted <unk> fashion rises to cast a species of derision on what we say .
but i <name> neither be driven from some allowance to fashion as a symbolic institution , nor from the belief that love is the basis of courtesy .
" we must obtain that , if we can ; but by all means we must affirm this .
life owes much of its spirit to these sharp contrasts .
fashion which affects to be honor , is often , in all men 's experience , only a ballroom code .
yet , so long as it is the highest circle , in the imagination of the best heads on the planet , there is something necessary and excellent in it ; for it is not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the <unk> of anything preposterous ; and the respect which these mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan characters , and the curiosity with which details of high life are read , betray the universality of the love of cultivated manners .
i know that a comic <unk> would be felt , if we should enter the acknowledged 'first circles , ' and apply these terrific standards of justice , beauty , and benefit , to the individuals actually found there .
monarchs and heroes , sages and lovers , these <unk> are not .
fashion has many classes and many rules of probation and admission ; and not the best alone .
there is not only the right of conquest , which genius pretends ,  the individual , demonstrating his natural aristocracy best of the best ;  but less claims <name> pass for the time ; for fashion loves lions , and points , like <unk> , [ 431 ] to her horned company .
this gentleman is this afternoon arrived from denmark ; and that is my lord ride , who came yesterday from bagdad ; here is captain <unk> , from cape <unk> , and captain <unk> , [ 432 ] from the interior of the earth ; and monsieur <unk> , who came down this morning in a balloon ; mr. <unk> , the reformer ; and reverend <unk> bat , who has converted the whole torrid zone in his <name> school ; and <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> , who extinguished vesuvius by pouring into it the bay of naples ; <unk> , the persian ambassador ; and <unk> <unk> <name> , the exiled <unk> of <unk> , whose saddle is the new <unk>  but these are monsters of one day , and to-morrow <name> be dismissed to their holes and dens ; for , in these rooms every chair is waited for .
the artist , the scholar , and , in general , the <unk> , [ 433 ] wins its way up into these places , and gets represented here , somewhat on this footing of conquest .
another mode is to pass through all the degrees , spending a year and a day in st. <name> 's square , [ 434 ] being steeped in cologne water , [ 435 ] and perfumed , and dined , and introduced , and properly grounded in all the biography , and politics , and anecdotes of the <unk> .
18 .
yet these <unk> may have <name> and wit .
let there be grotesque sculpture about the gates and offices of temples .
let the creed and commandments even have the saucy homage of parody .
the forms of politeness universally express benevolence in <unk> degrees .
what if they are in the mouths of selfish men , and used as means of selfishness ?
what if the false gentleman almost bows the true out of the world ?
what if the false gentleman <unk> so to address his companion , as civilly to exclude all others from his discourse , and also to make them feel excluded ?
real service <name> not lose its nobleness .
all generosity is not merely french and sentimental ; nor is it to be concealed , that living blood and a passion of kindness does at last distinguish god 's gentleman from fashion 's .
the <unk> of sir <unk> <unk> is not wholly unintelligible to the present age .
" here lies sir <unk> <unk> , who loved his friend , and persuaded his enemy : what his mouth ate , his hand paid for : what his servants robbed , he restored : if a woman gave him pleasure , he supported her in pain : he never forgot his children : and whoso touched his finger , <name> after it his whole body . "
even the line of heroes is not utterly extinct .
there is still ever some admirable person in plain clothes , standing on the wharf , who jumps in to rescue a drowning man ; there is still some absurd inventor of charities ; some guide and comforter of runaway slaves ; some friend of poland ; [ 436 ] some <unk> ; [ 437 ] some fanatic who plants <unk> for the second and third generation , and orchards when he is grown old ; some <unk> piety ; some just man happy in an <unk> ; some youth ashamed of the favors of fortune , and impatiently casting them on other shoulders .
and these are the centers of society , on which it returns for fresh impulses .
these are the <unk> of fashion , which is an attempt to organize beauty of behavior .
the beautiful and the generous are in the theory , the doctors and apostles of this church : scipio , and the cid , and sir <name> <name> , and washington , and every pure and valiant heart , who worshiped beauty by word and by deed .
the persons who constitute the natural aristocracy , are not found in the actual aristocracy , or only on its edge ; as the chemical energy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum .
yet that is the infirmity of the <unk> , who do not know their sovereign , when he appears .
the theory of society supposes the existence and sovereignty of these .
it <unk> afar off their coming .
it says with the elder gods ,  " as heaven and earth are fairer far [ 438 ] than chaos and blank darkness , though once chiefs ; and as we show beyond that heaven and earth , in form and shape compact and beautiful ; so , on our heels a fresh perfection <unk> ; a power , more strong in beauty , born of us , and fated to excel us , as we pass in <name> that old darkness : ... for , 't is the eternal law , that first in beauty shall be first in might . "
19 .
therefore , within the <unk> circle of good society , there is a narrower and higher circle , concentration of its light , and flower of courtesy , to which there is always a tacit appeal of pride and reference , as to its inner and imperial court , the parliament of love and chivalry .
and this is constituted of those persons in whom heroic dispositions are native , with the love of beauty , the delight in society , and the power to embellish the passing day .
if the individuals who compose the purest circles of aristocracy in europe , the guarded blood of centuries , should pass in review , in such manner as that we could , leisurely and critically , inspect their behavior , we might find no gentleman , and no <name> ; for although excellent specimens of courtesy and <unk> would gratify us in the assemblage , in the particulars , we should detect offense .
because , elegance comes of no breeding , but of birth .
there must be romance of character , or the most fastidious exclusion of <unk> <name> not avail .
it must be genius which takes that direction : it must be not courteous , but courtesy .
high behavior is as rare in fiction as it is in fact .
<name> is praised for the fidelity with which he painted the demeanor and conversation of the superior classes .
certainly , kings and queens , nobles and great ladies , had some right to complain of the absurdity that had been put in their mouths , before the days of <unk> ; [ 439 ] but neither does <name> 's dialogue bear criticism .
his lords brave each other in smart <unk> speeches , but the dialogue is in costume , and does not please on the second reading ; it is not warm with life .
in shakespeare alone , the speakers do not strut and bridle , the dialogue is easily great , and he adds to so many titles that of being the <unk> man in england , and in christendom .
once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of <name> manners , in the presence of a man or woman who have no bar in their nature , but whose character <unk> freely in their word and gesture .
a beautiful form is better than a beautiful face : a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form : it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures ; it is the finest of the fine arts .
a man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature , yet , by the moral quality radiating from his countenance , he may abolish all considerations of magnitude , and in his manners equal the majesty of the world .
i have seen an individual whose manners though wholly within the conventions of elegant society , were never learned there , but were original and commanding , and held out protection and prosperity ; one who did not need the aid of a <unk> , but carried the holiday in his eye ; who <unk> the fancy by flinging wide the doors of new modes of existence ; who shook off the captivity of etiquette , with happy , spirited bearing , good-natured and free as <name> hood ; [ 440 ] yet with the port of an emperor ,  if need be , calm , serious , and fit to stand the gaze of millions .
20 .
the open air and the fields , the street and public chambers , are the places where man <unk> his <name> ; let him yield or divide the scepter at the door of the house .
woman , with her instinct of behavior , instantly detects in man a love of trifles , any coldness or imbecility , or , in short , any want of that large , flowing , and magnanimous deportment , which is indispensable as an exterior in the hall .
our american institutions have been friendly to her , and at this moment i esteem it a chief felicity of this country , that it <unk> in women .
a certain awkward consciousness of inferiority in the men , may give rise to the new chivalry in behalf of woman 's rights .
certainly , let her be as much better placed in the laws and in social forms , as the most zealous reformer can ask , but i confide so entirely in her inspiring and musical nature , that i believe only herself can show us how she shall be served .
the wonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at times into <unk> and godlike regions , and <unk> the pictures of <name> , [ 441 ] <unk> , [ 442 ] or <unk> ; [ 443 ] and , by the firmness with which she <unk> her upward path , she convinces the <unk> <unk> that another road exists than that which their feet know .
but besides those who make good in our imagination the place of muses and of <unk> <unk> , [ 444 ] are there not women who fill our vase with wine and roses to the brim , so that the wine runs over and fills the house with perfume ; who inspire us with courtesy ; who <unk> our tongues , and we speak ; who <unk> our eyes , and we see ?
we say things we never thought to have said ; for once , our walls of habitual reserve vanished , and left us at large ; we were children playing with children in a wide field of flowers .
steep us , we cried , in these influences , for days , for weeks , and we shall be <name> poets , and <name> write out in many-colored words the romance that you are .
was it hafiz [ 445 ] or <unk> [ 446 ] that said of his persian <name> , " she was an elemental force , and astonished me by her amount of life , when i saw her day after day radiating , every instant , <unk> <name> and <name> on all around her .
[ <unk> ] she was a <unk> powerful to reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one society ; like air or water , an element of such a great range of affinities , that it combines readily with a thousand substances .
where she is present , all others <name> be more than they are wont .
she was a unit and whole , so that whatsoever she did , became her .
she had too much sympathy and <name> to please , than that you could say , her manners were marked with dignity , yet no <name> could surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each occasion .
she did not study the persian grammar , nor the books of the seven poets , but all the poems of the seven seemed to be written upon her .
for , though the bias of her nature was not to thought , but to sympathy , yet was she so perfect in her own nature , as to meet intellectual persons by the fullness of her heart , warming them by her sentiments ; believing , as she did , that by dealing nobly with all , all would show themselves <name> . "
21 .
i know that this <unk> [ 448 ] pile of chivalry of fashion , which seems so fair and picturesque to those who look at the contemporary facts for science or for entertainment , is not equally pleasant to all spectators .
the constitution of our society makes it a giant 's castle to the ambitious youth who have not found their names enrolled in its golden book , [ 449 ] and whom it has excluded from its coveted honors and privileges .
they have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur is shadowy and relative : it is great by their allowance : its proudest gates <name> fly open at the approach of their courage and virtue .
for the present distress , however , of those who are <unk> to suffer from the <unk> of this <name> , there are easy remedies .
to remove your residence a couple of miles , or at most four , <name> commonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility .
for , the advantages which fashion values are plants which thrive in very confined localities , in a few streets , namely .
out of this <unk> , they go for nothing ; are of no use in the farm , in the forest , in the market , in war , in the nuptial society , in the literary or scientific circle , at sea , in friendship , in the heaven of thought or virtue .
22 .
but we have lingered long enough in these painted courts .
the worth of the thing signified must vindicate our taste for the emblem .
everything that is called fashion and courtesy <unk> itself before the cause and fountain of honor , creator of titles and dignities , namely , the heart of love .
this is the <name> blood , this the fire , which , in all countries and contingencies , <name> work after its kind and conquer ind expand all that approaches it .
this gives new meanings to every fact .
this <unk> the <name> , suffering no grandeur but its own .
what is <name> ?
are you <name> enough to help anybody ?
to succor the <unk> and the eccentric ?
<name> enough to make the canadian in his wagon , the <unk> with his consul 's paper which <unk> him " to the charitable , " the swarthy italian with his few broken words of english , the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town to town , even the poor insane or <unk> wreck of man or woman , feel the <name> exception of your presence and your house , from the general <unk> and <unk> ; to make such feel that they were greeted with a voice which made them both remember and <name> ?
what is vulgar , but to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive reasons ?
what is gentle , but to allow it , and give their heart and yours lone holiday from the national caution ?
without the <name> heart , wealth is an ugly beggar .
the king of <unk> [ 450 ] could not afford to be so bountiful as the poor <unk> [ 451 ] who dwelt at his gate .
<unk> had a humanity so broad and deep , that although his speech was so bold and free with the koran [ 452 ] as to disgust all the <unk> , yet was there never a poor outcast , eccentric , or insane man , some fool who had cut off his beard , or who had been mutilated under a vow , or had a pet madness in his <name> , but fled at once to him ,  that great heart lay there so <name> and hospitable in the center of the country ,  that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers <name> them to his side .
and the madness which he <unk> , he did not share .
is not this to be <name> ?
this only to be rightly <name> ?
23 .
but i shall hear without pain , that i play the courtier very ill , and talk of that which i do not well understand .
it is easy to see , that what is called by distinction society and fashion , has good laws as well as bad , has much that is necessary , and much that is absurd .
too good for <unk> , and too bad for blessing , it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology , in any attempt to settle its character .
" i overheard jove , [ 453 ] one day , " said <unk> , [ 454 ] " talking of destroying the earth ; he said , it had failed ; they were all rogues and <unk> , who went from bad to worse , as fast as the days succeeded each other .
<name> said , she hoped not ; they were only ridiculous little creatures , with this odd circumstance , that they had a blur , or indeterminate aspect , seen far or seen near ; if you called them bad , they would appear so ; if you called them good , they would appear so ; and there was no one person or action among them , which would not puzzle her owl , [ 455 ] much more all olympus , to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good . "
gifts [ 456 ] gifts of one who loved me  't was high time they came ; when he ceased to love me , time they stopped for shame .
1 .
it is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy , that the world owes the world more than the world can pay , and ought to go into <unk> , [ 457 ] and be sold .
i do not think this general <unk> , which involves in some sort all the population , to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at christmas and new year , and other times , in bestowing gifts ; since it is always so pleasant to be generous , though very vexatious to pay debts .
but the impediment lies in the choosing .
if , at any time , it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody , i am puzzled what to give , until the opportunity is gone .
flowers and fruits are always fit presents ; flowers , because they are a proud assertion that a <name> of beauty <unk> all the <unk> of the world .
these <name> natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature : they are like music heard out of a <unk> .
nature does not <unk> us : [ <unk> ] we are children , not pets : she is not fond : everything is dealt to us without fear or favor , after severe universal laws .
yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty .
men use to tell us that we love flattery , even though we are not deceived by it , because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted .
something like that pleasure , the flowers give us : what am i to whom these sweet hints are addressed ?
fruits are acceptable gifts , [ 459 ] because they are the flower of commodities , and admit of fantastic values being attached to them .
if a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him , and should set before me a basket of fine <unk> , i should think there was some proportion between the labor and the reward .
2 .
for common gifts , necessity makes <unk> and beauty every day , and one is glad when an imperative leaves him no <unk> , since if the man at the door have no shoes , you have not to consider whether you could procure him a <unk> .
and as it is always pleasing to see a man eat bread or drink water , in the house or out of doors , so it is always a great satisfaction to supply these first wants .
necessity does everything well .
in our condition of universal dependence , it seems heroic to let the <unk> [ 460 ] be the judge of his necessity , and to give all that is asked , though at great inconvenience .
if it be a fantastic <name> , it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him .
i can think of many parts i should prefer playing to that of the furies .
[ <unk> ] next to things of necessity , the rule for a gift , which one of my friends prescribed , is that we might convey to some person that which properly belonged to his character , and was easily associated with him in thought .
but our tokens of compliment and love are for the most part barbarous .
rings and other jewels are not gifts , but apologies for gifts .
the only gift is a portion of thyself .
thou must bleed for me .
therefore the poet brings his poem ; the shepherd , his lamb ; the farmer , corn ; the miner , a gem ; the sailor , <name> and shells ; the painter , his picture ; the girl , a handkerchief of her own sewing .
this is right and pleasing , for it <unk> society in so far to its primary basis , when a man's biography [ 462 ] is conveyed in his gift , and every man 's wealth is an index of his merit .
but it is a cold lifeless business when you go to the shops to buy me something which does not represent your life and talent , but a goldsmith 's .
that is fit for kings , and <name> men who represent kings , and a false state of property , to make presents of gold and silver stuffs , as a kind of symbolical <unk> , [ 463 ] or payment of blackmail .
[ <unk> ] 3 .
the law of benefits is a difficult channel , which requires careful sailing , or rude boats .
it is not the office of a man to receive gifts .
how dare you give them ?
we wish to be <unk> .
we do not quite forgive a <unk> .
the hand that feeds us is in some danger of being bitten .
we can receive anything from love , for that is a way of receiving it from ourselves ; but not from any one who assumes to bestow .
we sometimes hate the meat which we eat , because there seems something of degrading dependence in living by it .
" brother , if jove [ 465 ] to thee a present make , take heed that from his hands thou nothing take . "
we ask the whole .
nothing less <name> content us .
we <unk> society , if it do not give us besides earth , and fire , and water , opportunity , love , reverence , and objects of veneration .
4 .
he is a good man , who can receive a gift well .
we are either glad or sorry at a gift , and both emotions are unbecoming .
some violence , i think , is done , some degradation borne , when i rejoice or grieve at a gift .
i am sorry when my independence is invaded , or when a gift comes from such as do not know my spirit , and so the act is not supported ; and if the gift pleases me overmuch , then i should be ashamed that the <unk> should read my heart , and see that i love his commodity , and not him .
the gift , to be true , must be the flowing of the giver unto me , correspondent to my flowing unto him .
when the waters are at level , then my goods pass to him , and his to me .
all his are mine , all mine his .
i say to him , how can you give me this pot of oil , or this <unk> of wine , when all your oil and wine is mine , which belief of mine this gift seems to deny ?
hence the fitness of beautiful , not useful things for gifts .
this giving is flat usurpation , and therefore when the <unk> is ungrateful , as all <unk> hate all <unk> , [ 466 ] not at all considering the value of the gift , but looking back to the greater store it was taken from , i rather sympathize with the <unk> , than with the anger of my lord , <unk> .
for , the expectation of gratitude is mean , and is continually punished by the total insensibility of the obliged person .
it is a great happiness to get off without injury and <unk> , from one who has had the ill luck to be served by you .
it is a very <unk> business , [ 467 ] this of being served , and the debtor naturally wishes to give you a slap .
a golden text for these gentlemen is that which i admire in the buddhist , [ 468 ] who never thanks , and who says , " do not flatter your benefactors . "
5 .
the reason of these <unk> i conceive to be , that there is no <unk> between a man and any gift .
you can not give anything to a magnanimous person .
after you have served him , he at once puts you in debt by his magnanimity .
the service a man renders his friend is trivial and selfish , compared with the service he knows his friend stood in readiness to yield him , alike before he had begun to serve his friend , and now also .
compared with that good-will i bear my friend , the benefit it is in my power to render him seems small .
besides , our action on each other , good as well as evil , is so incidental and at random , that we can seldom hear the <unk> of any person who would thank us for a benefit , without some shame and humiliation .
we can rarely strike a direct stroke , but must be content with an oblique one ; we seldom have the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit , which is directly received .
but <unk> <unk> favors on every side without knowing it , and receives with wonder the thanks of all people .
6 .
i fear to breathe any treason against the majesty of love , which is the genius and god of gifts , and to whom we must not affect to <unk> .
let him give kingdoms or <unk> indifferently .
there are persons from whom we always expect <name> tokens ; let us not cease to expect them .
this is prerogative , and not to be limited by our municipal rules .
for the rest , i like to see that we can not be bought and sold .
the best of hospitality and of generosity is also not in the <name> , but in fate .
i find that i am not much to you ; you do not need me ; you do not feel me ; then am i thrust out of doors , though you <unk> me house and lands .
no services are of any value , but only likeness .
when i have attempted to join myself to others by services , it proved an intellectual trick  no more .
they eat your service like apples , and leave you out .
but love them , and they feel for you , and delight in you all the time .
nature [ 469 ] the rounded world is fair to see , nine times folded in mystery : though baffled seers can not impart the secret of its laboring heart , throb thine with nature 's throbbing breast , and all is clear from east to west .
spirit that <unk> each form within <unk> to spirit of its kin ; <unk> every atom glows , and hints the future which it owes .
1 .
there are days [ 470 ] which occur in this climate , at almost any season of the year , wherein the world reaches its perfection , when the air , the heavenly bodies , and the earth , make a <name> , as if nature would indulge her offspring ; when , in these bleak upper sides of the planet , nothing is to <name> that we have heard of the happiest latitudes , and we <unk> in the shining hours of <name> and cuba ; when everything that has life gives sign of satisfaction , and the cattle that lie on the ground seem to have great and tranquil thoughts .
these <unk> [ 471 ] may be looked for with a little more assurance in that pure october weather , which we distinguish by the name of indian summer .
[ 472 ] the day , immeasurably long , sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields .
to have lived through all its <name> hours , seems longevity enough .
the solitary places do not seem quite lonely .
at the gates of the forest , the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small , wise and foolish .
the knapsack of custom falls off his back with the first step he makes into these precincts .
here is sanctity which shames our religions , and reality which <unk> our heroes .
here we find nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other circumstance , and judges like a god all men that come to her .
we have crept out of our close and crowded houses into the night and morning , and we see what majestic beauties daily wrap us in their bosom .
how willingly we would escape the barriers which render them comparatively impotent , escape the <unk> and second thought , and suffer nature to entrance us .
the tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual morning , and is stimulating and heroic .
the anciently reported spells of these places creep on us .
the stems of pines , hemlocks , and oaks , almost gleam like iron on the excited eye .
the <unk> trees begin to persuade us to live with them , and quit our life of solemn trifles .
here no history , or church , or state , is <unk> on the divine sky and the immortal year .
how easily we might walk onward into opening landscape , absorbed by new pictures , and by thoughts fast succeeding each other , until by degrees the recollection of home was crowded out of the mind , all memory obliterated by the tyranny of the present , and we were led in triumph by nature .
2 .
these enchantments are medicinal , they sober and heal us .
these are plain pleasures , kindly and native to us .
we come to our own , and make friends with matter , which the ambitious chatter of the schools would persuade us to despise .
we never can part with it ; the mind loves its old home : as water to our thirst , so is the rock , the ground , to our eyes , and hands , and feet .
it is firm water : it is cold flame : what health , what affinity !
ever an old friend , ever like a dear friend and brother , when we chat <unk> with strangers , comes in this honest face , and takes a grave <name> with us , and shames us out of our nonsense .
cities give not the human senses room enough .
we go out daily and nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon , and require so much scope , just as we need water for our bath .
there are all degrees of natural influence , from these quarantine powers of nature , up to her dearest and gravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul .
there is the bucket of cold water from the spring , the <unk> to which the chilled traveler rushes for safety ,  and there is the sublime moral of autumn and of noon .
we nestle in nature , and draw our living as parasites from her roots and grains , and we receive glances from the heavenly bodies , which call us to solitude , and foretell the remotest future .
the blue zenith is the point in which romance and reality meet .
i think , if we should be rapt away into all that we dream of heaven , and should converse with <name> [ <unk> ] and <unk> , [ <unk> ] the upper sky would be all that would remain of our furniture .
3 .
it seems as if the day was not wholly profane , in which we have given heed to some natural object .
the fall of <unk> in a still air , preserving to each <name> its perfect form ; the blowing of sleet over a wide sheet of water , and over plains ; the waving <unk> ; the mimic waving of acres of <unk> , whose innumerable florets <unk> and ripple before the eye ; the reflections of trees and flowers in glassy lakes ; the musical steaming odorous south wind , which converts all trees to <unk> ; [ 475 ] the crackling and spurting of hemlock in the flames ; or of <unk> , which yield <name> to the walls and faces in the sitting-room ,  these are the music and pictures of the most ancient religion .
my house stands in low land , with limited outlook , and on the skirt of the village .
[ 476 ] but i go with my friend [ 477 ] to the shore of our little river , [ <unk> ] and with one stroke of the paddle , i leave the village politics and personalities , yes , and the world of villages and personalities behind , and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight , too bright almost for spotted man to enter without <unk> and probation .
[ <unk> ] we penetrate bodily this incredible beauty : we dip our hands in this painted element : our eyes are bathed in these lights and forms .
a holiday , a <unk> , [ 480 ] a <name> revel , the proudest , most <unk> festival that valor and beauty , power and taste , ever decked and enjoyed , establishes itself on the instant .
these sunset clouds , these delicately emerging stars , with their private and ineffable glances , signify it and <unk> it .
i am taught the poorness of our invention , the ugliness of towns and palaces .
<name> and luxury have early learned that they must work as <unk> and sequel to this original beauty .
i am <unk> for my return .
henceforth i shall be hard to please .
i can not go back to toys .
i am grown expensive and sophisticated .
i can no longer live without elegance : but a countryman shall be my master of revels .
he who knows the most , he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground , the waters , the plants , the heavens , and how to come at these enchantments , is the <name> and <name> man .
only as far as masters of the world have called in nature to their aid , can they reach the height of magnificence .
this is the meaning of their <unk> , [ 481 ] villas , <unk> , islands , parks , and preserves , to back their <unk> personality with these strong accessories .
i do not wonder that the landed interest should be invincible in the state with these dangerous auxiliaries .
these bribe and invite ; not kings , not palaces , not men , not women , but these tender and poetic stars , eloquent of secret promises .
we heard what the <name> man said , we knew of his villa , his grove , his wine , and his company , but the provocation and point of the invitation came out of these beguiling stars .
in their soft glances , i see what men strove to realize in some versailles , [ <unk> ] or <unk> , [ 483 ] or <unk> .
[ 484 ] indeed , it is the magical lights of the horizon , and the blue sky for the background , which save all our works of <name> , which were otherwise <unk> .
when the <name> tax the poor with servility and <unk> , they should consider the effect of man reputed to be the possessors of nature , on imaginative minds .
ah !
if the <name> were <name> as the poor fancy riches !
a boy hears a military band play on the field at night , and he has kings and queens , and famous chivalry palpably before him .
he hears the echoes of a horn in a hill country , in the notch mountains , [ 485 ] for example , which converts the mountains into an <unk> harp , [ <unk> ] and this supernatural <unk> <unk> to him the <name> [ 487 ] mythology , apollo , [ <unk> ] <name> , [ 489 ] and all divine hunters and <unk> .
can a musical note be so lofty , so haughtily beautiful !
to the poor young poet , thus fabulous is his picture of society ; he is loyal ; he respects the <name> ; they are <name> for the sake of his imagination ; how poor his fancy would be , if they were not <name> !
that they have some <unk> grove , which they call a park ; that they live in larger and <unk> saloons than he has visited , and go in coaches , keeping only the society of the elegant , to <unk> , and to distant cities , are the <unk> from which he has delineated estates of romance , compared with which their actual possessions are <unk> and <unk> .
the muse herself betrays her son , and <unk> the gift of wealthy and well-born beauty , by a radiation out of the air , and clouds , and forests that skirt the road ,  a certain haughty favor , as if from patrician genii to patricians , a kind of aristocracy in nature , a <name> of the power of the air .
4 .
the moral sensibility which makes <unk> [ <unk> ] and <unk> [ <unk> ] so easily , may not be always found , but the material landscape is never far off .
we can find these enchantments without visiting the como lake , [ 492 ] or the madeira islands .
[ <unk> ] we exaggerate the praises of local scenery .
in every landscape , the point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth , and that is seen from the first hillock as well as from the top of the <unk> .
the stars at night stoop down over the <unk> , <unk> common , [ <unk> ] with all the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the campagna , [ 495 ] or on the marble deserts of egypt .
the <unk> clouds and the colors of morning and evening , <name> <unk> maples and alders .
the difference between landscape and landscape is small , but there is great difference in the beholders .
there is nothing so wonderful in any particular landscape , as the necessity of being beautiful under which every landscape lies .
nature can not be surprised in undress .
beauty breaks in everywhere .
5 .
but it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic , which <unk> called natura <unk> , or nature passive .
one can hardly speak directly of it without excess .
it is as easy to <unk> in mixed companies what is called " the subject of religion . "
a susceptible person does not like to indulge his tastes in this kind , without the apology of some trivial necessity : he goes to see a <unk> , or to look at the crops , or to fetch a plant or a mineral from a remote locality , or he carries a <unk> , or a <unk> .
i suppose this shame must have a good reason .
a <unk> [ <unk> ] in nature is barren and unworthy .
the <unk> of fields is no better than his brother of broadway .
men are naturally hunters and inquisitive of woodcraft and i suppose that such a <unk> as <unk> and indians should furnish facts for would take place in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the " wreaths " and " <unk> <unk> " [ <unk> ] of the <unk> ; yet ordinarily , whether we are too clumsy for so subtle a topic , or from whatever cause , as soon as men begin to write on nature , they fall into <unk> .
frivolity is a most unfit tribute to pan , [ <unk> ] who ought to be represented in the mythology as the most continent of gods .
i would not be frivolous before the admirable reserve and <name> of time , yet i can not renounce the right of returning often to this old topic .
the multitude of false churches [ <unk> ] <unk> the true religion .
literature , poetry , science , are the homage of man to this <unk> secret , concerning which no sane man can affect an indifference or <unk> .
nature is loved by what is best in us .
it is loved as the city of god , although , or rather because there is no citizen .
the sunset is unlike anything that is underneath it : it wants men .
and the beauty of nature must always seem unreal and mocking , until the landscape has human figures , that are as good as itself .
if there were good men , there would never be this rapture in nature .
if the king is in the palace nobody looks at the walls .
it is when he is gone , and the house is filled with grooms and <unk> , that we turn from the people , to find relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the pictures and architecture .
the critics who complain of the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from the thing to be done , must consider that our hunting of the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against false society .
man is fallen ; nature is erect , and serves as a <unk> thermometer , detecting the presence or absence of the divine sentiment in man .
by fault of our dulness and selfishness , we are looking up to nature , but when we are convalescent , nature <name> look up to us .
we see the foaming <name> with <unk> ; if our own life flowed with the right energy , we should shame the <name> .
the stream of zeal sparkles with real fire , and not with reflex rays of sun and moon .
nature may be as <unk> studied as trade .
astronomy to the selfish becomes <unk> ; psychology , mesmerism ( with intent to show where our spoons are gone ) ; and anatomy and physiology become <unk> and <unk> .
6 .
but taking timely warning , and leaving many things <unk> on this topic , but not longer omit our homage to the efficient nature , natura <unk> , the quick cause , before which all forms flee as the driven snows , itself secret , its works driven before it in flocks and multitudes , ( as the ancient represented nature by proteus , [ 500 ] a shepherd ) , and in <unk> variety .
it <unk> itself in creatures , reaching from particles and <unk> , through transformation on transformation to the highest <unk> , arriving at consummate results without a shock or a leap .
a little heat , that is , a little motion , is all that differences the bald , dazzling white , and deadly cold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical climates .
all changes pass without violence , by reason of the two cardinal conditions of boundless space and boundless time .
geology has initiated us into the <unk> of nature , and taught us to disuse our <unk> measures , and exchange our mosaic [ <unk> ] and <unk> schemes [ <unk> ] for her large style .
we know nothing rightly , for want of perspective .
now we learn what patient periods must round themselves before the rock is formed , then before the rock is broken , and the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate into soil , and opened the door for the remote <name> , [ <unk> ] fauna , [ 504 ] ceres , [ 505 ] and <unk> , [ <unk> ] to come in .
how far off yet is the <unk> !
how far the quadruped !
how inconceivably remote is man !
all duly arrive , [ 507 ] and then race after race of men .
it is a long way from granite to the oyster ; farther yet to plato , [ <unk> ] and the preaching of the immortality of the soul .
yet all must come , as surely as the first atom has two sides .
7 .
motion or change , and identity or rest , are the first and second secrets of nature : motion and rest .
the whole code of her laws may be written on the <unk> , or the <unk> of a ring .
the whirling bubble on the surface of a <name> , admits us to the secret of the mechanics of the sky .
every shell on the beach is a key to it .
a little water made to <unk> in a cup explains the formation of the simpler shells ; the addition of matter from year to year , arrives at last at the most complex forms ; and yet so poor is nature with all her craft , that , from the beginning to the end of the universe , she has but one stuff ,  but one stuff with its two ends , to serve up all her <unk> variety .
compound it how she <name> , <name> , sand , fire , water , tree , man , it is still one stuff , and betrays the same properties .
8 .
nature is always consistent , though she <unk> to <unk> her own laws .
she keeps her laws , and seems to <unk> them .
she arms and <unk> an animal to find its place and living in the earth , and , at the same time , she arms and <unk> another animal to destroy it .
space exists to divide creatures ; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few feathers , she gives him a petty omnipresence .
the direction is forever onward , but the artist still goes back for materials , and begins again with the first elements on the most advanced stage : otherwise , all goes to ruin .
if we look at her work , we seem to catch a glance of a system in transition .
plants are the young of the world , vessels of health and vigor ; but they grope ever upward toward consciousness ; the trees are imperfect men , and seem to <unk> their imprisonment , rooted in the ground .
the animal is the novice and <unk> of a more advanced order .
the men , though young , having tasted the first drop from the cup of thought , are already dissipated : the maples and ferns are still <unk> ; yet no doubt , when they come to consciousness , they too <name> curse and swear .
flowers so strictly belong to youth , that we adult men soon come to feel , that their beautiful generations concern not us : we have had our day ; now let the children have theirs .
the flowers <unk> us , and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness .
9 .
things are so strictly related , that according to the skill of the eye , from any one object the parts and properties of any other may be predicted .
if we had eyes to see it , a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist , as readily as the city .
that identity makes us all one , and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale .
we talk of deviations from natural life , as if artificial life were not also natural .
the <unk> curled courtier in the <unk> of a palace has an animal nature , rude and aboriginal as a white bear , omnipotent to its own ends , and is directly related , there amid <unk> and <unk> , to himalaya <unk> [ <unk> ] and the axis of the globe .
if we consider how much we are nature 's , we need not be superstitious about towns , as if that terrific or <unk> force did not find us there also , and fashion cities .
nature , who made the <name> , made the house .
we may easily hear too much of rural influences .
the cool , disengaged air of natural objects , makes them enviable to us , chafed and irritable creatures with red faces , and we think we shall be as grand as they , if we camp out and eat roots , but let us be men instead of <unk> , and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us , though we sit in chairs of <name> on carpets of silk .
10 .
this guiding identity runs through all the surprises and contrasts of the piece , and <unk> every law .
man carries the world in his head , the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought .
because the history of nature is <unk> in his <name> , therefore is he the prophet and discoverer of her secrets .
every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody , before it was actually verified .
a man does not tie his shoe without recognizing laws which bind the farthest regions of nature : moon , plant , gas , <name> , are concrete geometry and <name> .
common sense knows its own , and recognizes the fact at first sight in chemical experiment .
the common sense of <name> , [ <unk> ] <name> , [ 511 ] davy [ 512 ] and black , [ 513 ] is the same common sense which made the arrangements which now it discovers .
11 .
if the identity expresses organized rest , the counter action runs also into organization .
the astronomers said , [ <unk> ] " give us matter , and a little motion , and we <name> construct the universe .
it is not enough that we should have matter , we must also have a single impulse , one shove to launch the mass , and generate the <name> of the centrifugal and centripetal [ <unk> ] forces .
once heave the ball from the hand , and we can show how all this mighty order grew . "
" a very unreasonable <unk> , " said the <unk> , " and a plain begging of the question .
could you not prevail to know the <name> of projection , as well as the continuation of it ? "
nature , meanwhile , had not waited for the discussion , but , right or wrong , bestowed the impulse , and the balls rolled .
it was no great affair , a mere push , but the astronomers were right in making much of it , for there is no end of the consequences of the act .
that famous aboriginal push <unk> itself through all the balls of the system , and through every atom of every ball , through all the races of creatures , and through the history and performances of every individual .
exaggeration is in the course of things .
nature sends no creature , no man into the world , without adding a small excess of his proper quality .
given the planet , it is still necessary to add the impulse ; so , to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path , a shove to put it on its way ; in every instance , a slight generosity , a drop too much .
without electricity the air would rot , and without this violence of direction which men and women have , without a spice of <unk> and fanatic , no excitement , no efficiency .
we aim above the <name> , to hit the <name> .
every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it .
and when now and then comes along some sad , <unk> man , who sees how paltry a game is played , and refuses to play , but <unk> the secret ;  how then ?
is the bird flown ?
o no , the wary nature sends a new troop of fairer forms , of <unk> youths , with a little more excess of direction to hold them fast to their several aims ; makes them a little <unk> in that direction in which they are <unk> , and on goes the game again with new whirl , for a generation or two more .
the child with his sweet pranks , the fool of his senses , commanded by every sight and sound , without any power to compare and rank his sensations , abandoned to a whistle or a painted chip , to a lead <unk> , or a <unk> dog , <unk> everything , <unk> nothing , delighted with every new thing , lies down at night overpowered by the fatigue , which this day of continual petty madness has incurred .
but nature has answered her purpose with the curly , dimpled lunatic .
she has <unk> every faculty , and has secured the symmetrical growth of the bodily frame , by all these attitudes and exertions ,  an end of the first importance , which could not be trusted to any care less perfect than her own .
this glitter , this <unk> <unk> plays round the top of every toy to his eye , to insure his fidelity , and he is deceived to his good .
we are made alive and kept alive by the same arts .
let the <unk> [ <unk> ] say what they please , we do not eat for the good of living , but because the meat is <unk> and the appetite is keen .
the vegetable life does not content itself with casting from the flower or the tree a single seed , but it fills the air and earth with a <unk> of seeds , that if thousands perish , thousands may plant themselves , that hundreds may come up , that tens may live to maturity , that , at least , one may replace the parent .
all things betray the same calculated profusion .
the excess of fear with which the animal frame is hedged round , shrinking from cold , starting at sight of a snake , or a sudden noise , protects us , through a multitude of groundless alarms , from some one real danger at last .
the lover seeks in marriage his private felicity and perfection , with no prospective end ; and nature hides in his happiness her own end , namely , progeny , or the perpetuity of the race .
12 .
but the craft with which the world is made runs also into the mind and character of men .
no man is quite sane ; each has a vein of folly in his composition , a slight determination of blood to the head , to make sure of holding him hard to some one point which nature had taken to heart .
great causes are never tried on their merits ; but the cause is reduced to particulars to suit the size of the partisans , and the contention is ever hottest on minor matters .
not less remarkable is the <unk> of each man in the importance of what he has to do or say .
the poet , the prophet , has a higher value for what he utters than any hearer , and therefore it gets spoken .
the strong , <unk> <name> [ 517 ] declares with an emphasis , not to be mistaken , that " god himself can not do without wise men . "
<name> <unk> [ 518 ] and <name> fox [ 519 ] betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their <unk> tracts , and <name> <unk> [ 520 ] once suffered himself to be worshiped as the christ .
each prophet comes presently to identify himself with his thought , and to esteem his hat and shoes sacred .
however this may discredit such persons with the judicious , it helps them with the people , as it gives heat , <unk> , and publicity to their words .
a similar experience is not infrequent in private life .
each young and ardent person writes a diary , in which , when the hours of prayer and penitence arrive , he <unk> his soul .
the pages thus written are , to him , burning and fragrant : he reads them on his knees by midnight and by the morning <name> ; he <unk> them with his tears : they are sacred ; too good for the world , and hardly yet to be shown to the dearest friend .
this is the man-child that is born to the soul , and her life still circulates in the babe .
the <unk> cord has not yet been cut .
after some time has elapsed , he begins to wish to admit his friend to this hallowed experience , and with hesitation , yet with firmness , exposes the pages to his eye .
<name> they not burn his eyes ?
the friend coldly turns them over , and passes from the writing to conversation , with easy transition , which strikes the other party with astonishment and vexation .
he can not suspect the writing itself .
days and nights of <unk> life , of communion with angels of darkness and of light , have engraved their shadowy characters on that <unk> book .
he suspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend .
is there then no friend ?
he can not yet credit that one may have impressive experience , and yet may not know how to put his private fact into literature ; and perhaps the discovery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers than we , that though we should hold our peace , the truth would not the less be spoken , might check injuriously the flames of our zeal .
a man can only speak , so long as he does not feel his speech to be partial and inadequate .
it is partial , but he does not see it to be so , whilst he utters it .
as soon as he is released from the instinctive and particular , and sees its partiality , he shuts his mouth in disgust .
for , no man can write anything , who does not think that what he writes is for the time the history of the world ; or do anything well , who does not esteem his work to be of importance .
my work may be of none , but i must not think it is of none , or i shall not do it with impunity .
13 .
in like manner , there is throughout nature something mocking , something that leads us on and on , but arrives nowhere , keeps no <name> with us .
all promise <unk> the performance .
we live in a system of <unk> .
every end is prospective of some other end , which is also temporary ; a round and final success nowhere .
we are encamped in nature , not domesticated .
hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink ; but bread and wine , mix and cook them how you <name> , leave us hungry and thirsty , after the stomach is full .
it is the same with all our arts and performances .
our music , our poetry , our language itself are not <unk> , but suggestions .
the hunger for wealth , which reduces the planet to a garden , fools the eager pursuer .
what is the end sought ?
plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty , from the intrusion of deformity or vulgarity of any kind .
but what an <unk> [ <unk> ] method !
what a train of means to secure a little conversation !
this palace of brick and stone , these servants , this kitchen , these stables , horses and equipage , this <unk> , and file of mortgages ; trade to all the world , <unk> and cottage by the water-side , all for a little conversation , high , clear , and spiritual !
could it not be had as well by beggars on the highway ?
no , all these things came from successive efforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life , and give opportunity .
conversation , character , were the avowed ends ; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings , cured the smoky chimney , silenced the creaking door , brought friends together in a warm and quiet room , and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment .
thought , virtue , beauty , were the ends ; but it was known that men of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache , or wet feet , or could lose good time , whilst the room was getting warm in <name> days .
unluckily , in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences , the main attention has been diverted to this object ; the old aims have been lost sight of , and to remove friction has come to be the end .
that is the ridicule of <name> men , and boston , london , vienna , and now the governments generally of the world , are cities and governments of the <name> , and the masses are not men , but poor men , that is , men who would be <name> ; this is the ridicule of the class , that they arrive with pains and sweat and fury nowhere ; when all is done , it is for nothing .
they are like one who has interrupted the conversation of a company to make his speech , and now has forgotten what he went to say .
the appearance strikes the eye everywhere of an aimless society , of aimless nations .
were the ends of nature so great and <unk> , as to exact this immense sacrifice of men ?
14 .
quite analogous to the <unk> in life , there is , as might be expected , a similar effect on the eye from the face of external nature .
there is in woods and waters a certain <unk> and flattery , together with a failure to yield a present satisfaction .
this disappointment is felt in every landscape .
i have seen the softness and beauty of the summer clouds floating feathery overhead , enjoying , as it seemed , their height and privilege of motion , whilst yet they appeared not so much the drapery of this place and hour , as <unk> to such pavilions and gardens of festivity beyond .
it is an odd jealousy ; but the poet finds himself not near enough to this object .
the pine tree , the river , the bank of flowers before him , does not seem to be nature .
nature is still elsewhere .
this or this is but <unk> and far-off reflection [ <unk> ] and <name> of the triumph that has passed by , and is now at its glancing splendor and <unk> , perchance in the neighboring fields , or , if you stand in the field , then in the adjacent woods .
the present object shall give you this sense of stillness that follows a pageant which has just gone by .
what splendid distance , what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness in the sunset !
but who can go where they are , or lay his hand or plant his foot thereon ?
off they fall from the round world forever and ever .
it is the same among men and women as among the silent trees ; always a referred existence , an absence , never a presence and satisfaction .
is it , that beauty can never be grasped ?
in persons and in landscapes is equally inaccessible ?
the accepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him .
she was heaven whilst he pursued her as a <name> : she can not be heaven , if she stoops to such a one as he .
15 .
what shall we say of this <unk> appearance of that first <unk> impulse , of this flattery and <unk> of so many well-meaning creatures ?
must we not suppose somewhere in the universe a slight treachery and derision ?
are we not engaged to a serious resentment of this use that is made of us ?
are we tickled trout , and fools of nature ?
one looks at the face of heaven and earth lays all <unk> at rest , and soothes us to wiser convictions .
to the intelligent , nature converts itself into a vast promise , and <name> not be rashly explained .
her secret is untold .
many and many an <unk> [ <unk> ] arrives : he has the whole mystery teeming in his <name> .
alas !
the same sorcery has spoiled his skill ; no syllable can he shape on his lips .
her mighty orbit vaults like the fresh rainbow into the deep , but no archangel 's wing was yet strong enough to follow it , and report of the return of the curve .
but it also appears , that our actions are seconded and disposed to greater conclusions than we designed .
we are escorted on every hand through life by spiritual agents , and a beneficent purpose lies in wait for us .
we can not <unk> words with nature , or deal with her as we deal with persons .
if we measure our individual forces against hers , we may easily feel as if we were the sport of an insuperable <name> .
but if , instead of identifying ourselves with the work , we feel that the soul of the workman streams through us , we shall find the peace of the morning dwelling first in our hearts , and the <unk> powers of gravity and chemistry , and , over them , of life <unk> within us in their highest form .
16 .
the uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness in the chain of causes occasions us , results from looking too much at one condition of nature , namely , motion .
but the drag is never taken from the wheel .
wherever the impulse exceeds the rest or identity <unk> its compensation .
all over the wide fields of earth grows the <unk> [ 524 ] or <unk> .
after every foolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of its hours ; and though we are always engaged with particulars , and often <unk> to them , we bring with us to every experiment the innate universal laws .
these , while they exist in the mind as ideas , stand around us in nature forever embodied , a present sanity to expose and cure the insanity of men .
our <unk> to particulars betrays us into a hundred foolish expectations .
we anticipate a new <name> from the invention of a locomotive , or a balloon ; the new engine brings with it the old checks .
they say that by <unk> , your salad shall be grown from the seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner : it is a symbol of our modern aims and endeavors ,  of our condensation and <unk> of objects : but nothing is gained : nature can not be cheated : man 's life is but seventy <unk> long , grow they swift or grow they slow .
in these checks and impossibilities , however , we find our advantage , not less than in impulses .
let the victory fall where it <name> , we are on that side .
and the knowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being , from the center to the poles of nature , and have some stake in every possibility , lends that sublime <unk> to death , which philosophy and religion have too outwardly and literally striven to express in the popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul .
the reality is more excellent than the report .
here is no ruin , no <unk> , no spent ball .
the divine <unk> never rest nor linger .
nature is the incarnation of a thought , and turns to a thought again , as ice becomes water and gas .
the world is mind precipitated , and the volatile essence is forever escaping again into the state of free thought .
hence the virtue and <unk> of the influence on the mind , of natural objects , whether inorganic or organized .
man imprisoned , man <unk> , man vegetative , speaks to man <unk> .
that power which does not respect quantity , which makes the whole and the particle its equal channel , delegates its smile to the morning , and <unk> its essence into every drop of rain .
every moment <unk> and every object : for wisdom is infused into every form .
it has been poured into us as blood ; it convulsed us as pain ; it slid into us as pleasure ; it enveloped us in dull , melancholy days , or in days of cheerful labor ; we did not guess its essence , until after a long time .
shakspeare ; [ 525 ] or , the poet [ <unk> 's note : shakspeare is spelled as " shakspeare " as well as " shakespeare " in this book .
the original <unk> have been retained . ]
1 .
great men are more distinguished by range and extent , than by originality .
if we require the originality which consists in weaving , like a spider , their web from their own bowels ; in finding <name> , and making bricks , and building the house ; no great men are original .
nor does valuable originality consist in <unk> to other men .
the hero is in the press of knights , and the thick of events ; and , seeing what men want , and sharing their <name> , he adds the needful length of sight and of arm , to come to the desired point .
the greatest genius is the most indebted man .
a poet is no <unk> , saying what comes uppermost and , because he says everything , saying , at last , something good ; but a heart in unison with his time and country .
there is nothing whimsical and fantastic in his production , but sweet and sad <name> , freighted with the <unk> convictions , and pointed with the most determined aim which any man or class knows of in his times .
2 .
the genius [ 526 ] of our life is jealous of individuals and <name> not have any individual great , except through the general .
there is no choice to genius .
a great man does not wake up on some fine morning , and say , " i am full of life , i <name> go to sea , and find an antarctic continent : to-day i <name> square the circle : i <name> ransack botany , and find a new food for man : i have a new architecture in my mind : i foresee a new mechanic power : " no , but he finds himself in the river of the thoughts and events , forced onward by the ideas and necessities of his contemporaries .
he stands where all the eyes of men look one way , and their hands all point in the direction in which he should go .
the church has reared him amidst rites and pomps , and he carries out the advice which her music gave him , and builds a cathedral needed by her <unk> and processions .
he finds a war raging : it <unk> him , by trumpet , in barracks , and he betters the instruction .
he finds two counties groping to bring coal , or flour , or fish , from the place of production to the place of consumption , and he hits on a railroad .
every master has found his materials collected , and his power lay in his sympathy with his people , and in his love of the materials he wrought in .
what an economy of power !
and what a compensation for the shortness of life !
all is done to his hand .
the world has brought him thus far on his way .
the human race has gone out before him , sunk the hills , filled the hollows , and bridged the rivers .
men , nations , poets , artisans , women , all have worked for him , and he enters into their labors .
choose any other thing , out of the line of tendency , out of the national feeling and history , and he would have all to do for himself : his powers would be expended in the first preparations .
great genial power , one would almost say , consists in not being original at all ; in being altogether receptive ; in letting the world do all , and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed through the mind .
3 .
shakspeare 's youth [ <unk> ] fell in a time when the english people were importunate for dramatic entertainments .
the court took offense easily at political allusions , and attempted to suppress them .
the puritans , [ <unk> ] a growing and energetic party and the religious among the <unk> church , [ <unk> ] would suppress them .
but the people wanted them .
<unk> , houses without roofs , and <unk> <unk> at country fairs , were the ready theaters of strolling players .
the people had tasted this new <name> ; and , as we could not <name> to suppress newspapers now ,  no , not by the strongest party ,  neither then could king , <unk> , or puritan ,  alone or united , suppress an organ , which was ballad , epic , newspaper , caucus , lecture , punch , [ 530 ] and library , at the same time .
probably king , <unk> , and puritan , all found their own account in it .
it had become , by all causes , a national interest ,  by no means conspicuous , so that some great scholar would have thought of treating it in an english history ,  but not a whit less considerable , because it was cheap , and of no account , like a baker 's shop .
the best proof of its vitality is the crowd of writers which suddenly broke into this field ; kyd , <unk> , greene , [ <unk> ] jonson , chapman , <unk> , webster , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ford , <unk> , beaumont , and <name> .
4 .
the secure possession , by the stage , of the public mind , is of the first importance to the poet who works for it .
he loses no time in idle experiments .
here is audience and expectation prepared .
in the case of shakspeare there is much more .
at the time when [ <unk> ] he left stratford , and went up to london , a great body of <unk> , of all dates and writers , existed in manuscript , and were in turn produced on the boards .
here is the tale of <name> , [ 533 ] which the audience <name> bear hearing some part of , every week ; the death of <name> cæsar , [ <unk> ] and other stories out of plutarch , [ <unk> ] which they never tire of ; a shelf full of english history , from the chronicles of <unk> [ <unk> ] and <name> , [ <unk> ] down to the <name> <unk> , [ <unk> ] which men hear eagerly ; and a string of doleful tragedies , <name> italian tales , [ <unk> ] and spanish voyages , [ <unk> ] which all the london <unk> know .
all the mass has been treated , with more or less skill , by every <unk> , and the <unk> has the soiled and tattered manuscripts .
it is now no longer possible to say who wrote them first .
they have been the property of the theater so long , and so many rising geniuses have enlarged or altered them , inserting a speech , or a whole scene , or adding a song , that no man can any longer claim copyright in this work of <name> .
happily , no man wishes to .
they are not yet desired in that way .
we have few readers , many spectators and hearers .
they had best lie where they are .
5 .
shakspeare , in common with his comrades , esteemed the mass of old plays , waste stock , in which any experiment could be freely tried .
had the prestige [ <unk> ] which hedges about a modern tragedy existed , nothing could have been done .
the rude warm blood of the living england circulated in the play , as in <unk> , and gave body which he wanted to his airy and majestic fancy .
the poet needs a ground in popular tradition on which he may work , and which , again , may restrain his <name> within the due temperance .
it holds him to the people , supplies a foundation for his edifice ; and , in furnishing so much work done to his hand , leaves him at leisure , and in full strength for the <unk> of his imagination .
in short , the poet owes to his legend what sculpture owed to the <name> .
sculpture in egypt , and in greece , grew up in subordination to architecture .
it was the ornament of the <name> wall : at first , a rude relief carved on <unk> , then the relief became bolder , and a head or arm was projected from the wall , the groups being still arranged with reference to the building , which serves also as a frame to hold the figures ; and when , at last , the greatest freedom of style and treatment was reached , the prevailing genius of architecture still enforced a certain calmness and <unk> in the statue .
as soon as the statue was begun for itself , and with no reference to the <name> or palace , the <name> began to decline : freak , extravagance , and exhibition , took the place of the old temperance .
this <unk> , which the sculptor found in architecture , the perilous irritability of poetic talent found in the accumulated dramatic materials to which the people were already wonted , and which had a certain excellence which no single genius , [ <unk> ] however extraordinary , could <name> to create .
6 .
in point of fact , it appears that shakspeare did owe debts in all directions , and was able to use whatever he found ; and the amount of indebtedness may be inferred from malone 's [ <unk> ] laborious <unk> in regard to the first , second , and third parts of <name> vi. , in which , " out of <unk> lines , <unk> were written by some author preceding shakspeare ; <unk> by him , on the foundation laid by his predecessors ; and 1899 were entirely his own . "
and the proceeding investigation hardly leaves a single drama of his absolute invention .
<unk> sentence is an important piece of external history .
in <name> viii , i think i see plainly the cropping out of the original rock on which his own finer stratum was laid .
the first play was written by a superior , thoughtful man , with a vicious ear .
i can <name> his lines , and know well their cadence .
see <unk> 's soliloquy , [ <unk> ] and the following scene from cromwell , [ <unk> ] where ,  instead of the <unk> of shakspeare , whose secret is , that the thought <unk> the tune , so that reading for the sense <name> best bring out the rhythm ,  here the lines are constructed on a given tune , and the verse has even a trace of pulpit eloquence .
but the play contains , through all its length , unmistakable traits of shakspeare 's hand , and some passages , as the account of the coronation , [ <unk> ] are like autographs .
what is odd , the compliment to <name> <name> [ <unk> ] is in bad rhythm .
[ <unk> ] 7 .
shakspeare knew that tradition supplies a better fable than any invention can .
if he lost any credit of design , he augmented his resources ; and , at that day , our <unk> demand for originality was not so much pressed .
there was no literature for the million .
the universal reading , the cheap press , were unknown .
a great poet , who appears in illiterate times , absorbs into his sphere all the light which is anywhere radiating .
every intellectual <name> , every flower of sentiment , it is his fine office to bring to his people ; and he comes to value his memory [ <unk> ] equally with his invention .
he is therefore little solicitous whence his thoughts have been derived ; whether through translation , whether through tradition , whether by travel in distant countries , whether by inspiration ; from whatever source , they are equally welcome to his <unk> audience .
nay , he <unk> very near home .
other men say wise things as well as he ; only they say a good many foolish things , and do not know when they have spoken wisely .
he knows the <name> of the true stone , and puts it in high place , wherever he finds it .
such is the happy position of <name> , [ 550 ] perhaps ; of chaucer , [ <unk> ] of saadi .
[ <unk> ] they felt that all wit was their wit .
and they are <unk> and <unk> , as well as poets .
each <unk> was heir and <unk> of all the hundred tales of the world ,  " presenting thebes ' [ <unk> ] and <unk> ' line and the tale of <name> divine . "
the influence of chaucer is conspicuous in all our early literature ; and , more recently , not only pope [ <unk> ] and <unk> [ <unk> ] have been beholden to him , but , in the whole society of english writers , a large <unk> debt is easily traced .
one is charmed with the opulence which feeds so many pensioners .
but chaucer is a huge <unk> .
[ <unk> ] chaucer , it seems , <name> continually , through <unk> [ <unk> ] and <unk> , [ <unk> ] from <unk> di <unk> , [ <unk> ] whose latin romance of the trojan war was in turn a <unk> from dares <unk> , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] and <unk> .
[ <unk> ] then <unk> , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ 564 ] and the <unk> poets , [ <unk> ] and his benefactors : the <unk> of the rose [ <unk> ] is only judicious translation from <name> of <unk> and <name> of <unk> : <unk> and <unk> , [ <unk> ] from <unk> of <unk> : the cock and the fox , [ <unk> ] from the <unk> of <name> : the house of fame , [ 569 ] from the french or italian : and poor <unk> [ 570 ] he uses as if he were only a <unk> or <unk> , out of which to build his house .
he steals by this apology ,  that what he takes has no worth where he finds it , and the greatest where he leaves it .
it has come to be practically a sort of rule in literature , that a man , having once shown himself capable of original writing , is entitled thenceforth to steal from the writings of others at discretion .
thought is the property of him who can entertain it ; and of him who can adequately place it .
a certain awkwardness marks the use of borrowed thoughts ; but , as soon as we have learned what to do with them , they become our own .
8 .
thus , all originality is relative .
every thinker is <unk> .
the learned member of the legislature , at <unk> , [ <unk> ] or at washington , speaks and votes for thousands .
show us the <unk> , and the now invisible channels by which the senator is made aware of their wishes , the crowd of practical and knowing men , who , by correspondence or conversation , are feeding him with evidence , anecdotes , and estimates , and it <name> <unk> his fine attitude and resistance of something of their impressiveness .
as sir <name> peel [ <unk> ] and mr. webster [ <unk> ] vote , so locke [ <unk> ] and <unk> [ <unk> ] think for thousands ; and so there were foundations all around <name> , [ <unk> ] menu , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] or <name> , [ <unk> ] from which they <name> ; friends , lovers , books , traditions , proverbs ,  all perished ,  which , if seen , would go to reduce the wonder .
did the bard speak with authority ?
did he feel himself <unk> by any companion ?
the appeal is to the consciousness of the writer .
is there at last in his breast a delphi [ <unk> ] whereof to ask concerning any thought or thing whether it be verily so , yea or nay ?
and to have answer , and rely on that ?
all the debts which such a man could contract to other wit , would never disturb his consciousness of originality : for the ministrations of books , and of other minds , are a whiff of smoke to that most private reality with which he has conversed .
9 .
it is easy to see that what is best written or done by genius , in the world , was no man 's work , but came by wide social labor , when a thousand wrought like one , sharing the same impulse .
our english bible [ <unk> ] is a wonderful specimen of the strength and music of the english language .
but it was not made by one man , or at one time ; but centuries and churches brought it to perfection .
there never was a time when there was not some translation existing .
the liturgy , [ <unk> ] admired for its energy and pathos , is an <unk> of the piety of ages and nations , a translation of the prayers and forms of the catholic church ,  these collected , too , in long periods , from the prayers and meditations of every saint and sacred writer all over the world .
<unk> [ <unk> ] makes the like remark in respect to the <unk> prayer , that the single <unk> of which it is composed were already in use , in the time of christ , in the <unk> forms .
[ <unk> ] he picked out the grains of gold .
the nervous language of the common law , [ <unk> ] the impressive forms of our courts , and the precision and substantial truth of the legal distinctions , are the contribution of all the <unk> , <unk> men who have lived in the countries where these laws govern .
the translation of plutarch gets its excellence by being translation on translation .
there never was a time when there was none .
all the truly <unk> and national phrases are kept , and all others successively picked out , and thrown away .
something like the same process had gone on , long before , with the originals of these books .
the world takes liberties with <unk> .
<unk> , [ <unk> ] <unk> fables , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] arabian nights , [ <unk> ] cid , [ <unk> ] iliad , [ <unk> ] <name> hood , [ <unk> ] scottish <unk> , [ <unk> ] are not the work of single men .
in the composition of such works , the time thinks , the market thinks , the <name> , the carpenter , the merchant , the farmer , the <unk> , all think for us .
every book supplies its time with one good word ; every municipal law , every trade , every folly of the day , and the generic catholic genius who is not afraid or ashamed to owe his originality to the originality of all , stands with the next age as the <unk> and embodiment of his own .
10 .
we have to thank the researches of <unk> , and the shakspeare society , [ <unk> ] for ascertaining the steps of the english drama , from the mysteries [ <unk> ] celebrated in churches and by <unk> , and the final detachment from the church , and the completion of secular plays , from <unk> and <unk> , [ <unk> ] and <unk> <unk> 's needle , [ <unk> ] down to the possession of the stage by the very pieces which shakspeare altered , <unk> , and finally made his own .
elated with success , and piqued by the growing interest of the problem , they have left no <unk> <unk> , no chest in a <name> unopened , no file of old yellow accounts to decompose in damp and worms , so keen was the <name> to discover whether the boy shakspeare <unk> [ <unk> ] or not , whether he held horses at the <unk> , whether he kept school , and why he left in his <name> only his <unk> bed to <name> <unk> , his wife .
11 .
there is somewhat touching in the madness with which the passing age <unk> the object on which all candles shine , and all eyes are turned ; the care with which it <unk> every trifle touching <name> <name> , [ <unk> ] and king <name> , [ 600 ] and the <unk> , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] and <unk> ; [ <unk> ] and lets pass without a single valuable note the founder of another dynasty , which alone <name> cause the tudor dynasty [ <unk> ] to be remembered ,  the man who carries the saxon race in him by the inspiration which feeds him , and on whose thoughts the foremost people of the world are now for some ages to be nourished , and minds to receive this and not another bias .
a popular player ,  nobody suspected he was the poet of the human race ; and the secret was kept as faithfully from poets and intellectual men , as from courtiers and frivolous people .
bacon , [ <unk> ] who took the inventory of the human understanding for his times , never mentioned his name .
<name> jonson , [ <unk> ] though we have strained his few words of regard and <unk> , had no suspicion of the elastic fame whose first vibrations he was attempting .
he no doubt thought the praise he has conceded to him generous , and esteemed himself , out of all question , the better poet of the two .
12 .
if it need wit to know wit , according to the proverb , <unk> time should be capable of recognizing it .
sir <name> <unk> [ <unk> ] was born four years after shakspeare , and died twenty-three years after him ; and i find , among his correspondents and acquaintances , the following persons : [ <unk> ] <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> , sir <name> <name> , <name> of essex , lord bacon , sir <name> <name> , <name> <name> , sir <name> vane , <name> <name> , dr. donne , <name> <unk> , <unk> , <name> cotton , <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> , kepler , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <name> <unk> , <unk> ; with all of whom exists some token of his having communicated , without <unk> many others , whom doubtless [ <unk> ] he saw ,  shakspeare , <unk> , jonson , beaumont , <unk> , two <unk> , <unk> , chapman and the rest .
since the constellation of great men who appeared in greece in the time of pericles , [ <unk> ] there was never any such society ;  yet their genius failed them to find out the best head in the universe .
our poet 's mask was impenetrable .
you can not see the mountain near .
it took a century to make it suspected ; and not until two centuries had passed , after his death , did any criticism which we think adequate begin to appear .
it was not possible to write the history of shakspeare till now ; for he is the father of <name> literature : it was on the introduction of shakspeare into <name> , by <unk> , [ <unk> ] and the translation of his works by <unk> [ <unk> ] and schlegel , [ <unk> ] that the rapid burst of <name> literature was most intimately connected .
it was not until the nineteenth century , whose speculative genius is a sort of living hamlet , [ <unk> ] that the tragedy of hamlet could find such wondering readers .
now , literature , philosophy , and thought , are <unk> .
his mind is the horizon beyond which , at present , we do not see .
our ears are educated to music by his rhythm .
coleridge [ <unk> ] and goethe [ <unk> ] are the only critics who have expressed our convictions with any adequate fidelity ; but there is in all cultivated minds a silent appreciation of his <unk> power and beauty , which , like christianity , <unk> the period .
[ <unk> 's note : number runs from 12 to 14 .
number 13 omitted ] 14 .
the shakspeare society have inquired in all directions , advertised the missing facts , offered money for any information that <name> lead to proof ; and with what result ?
beside some important illustration of the history of the english stage , to which i have <unk> , they have <unk> a few facts touching the property , and dealings in regard to property , of the poet .
it appears that , from year to year , he owned a larger share in the <unk> theater : [ <unk> ] its wardrobe and other <unk> were his : and he bought an estate in his native village , with his earnings , as writer and <unk> ; that he lived in the best house in stratford ; [ 619 ] was intrusted by his neighbors with their commissions in london , as of borrowing money , and the like ; and he was a veritable farmer .
about the time when he was writing <unk> , [ <unk> ] he <unk> <name> rogers , in the <unk> of stratford , for thirty-five shillings , ten pence , for corn delivered to him at different times ; and , in all respects , appears as a good husband with no reputation for eccentricity or excess .
he was a good-natured sort of man , an actor and <unk> in the theater , not in any striking manner distinguished from other actors and managers .
i admit the importance of this information .
it is well worth the pains that have been taken to procure it .
15 .
but whatever scraps of information concerning his condition these researches may have rescued , they can shed no light upon that infinite invention which is the concealed magnet of his attraction for us .
we are very clumsy writers of history .
we tell the chronicle of parentage , birth , <unk> , schooling , schoolmates , earning of money , marriage , publication of books , celebrity , death ; and when we have come to an end of this gossip no <name> of relation appears between it and the <unk> ; and it seems as if , had we dipped at random into the " modern plutarch , " and read any other life there , it would have fitted the poems as well .
it is the essence of poetry to spring , like the rainbow daughter of wonder , from the invisible , to abolish the past , and refuse all history .
malone , <unk> , <unk> , and collier , [ <unk> ] have wasted their oil .
the famed theaters , <unk> garden , <unk> <name> , the park , and <unk> , [ <unk> ] have vainly assisted .
<unk> , garrick , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , [ <unk> ] dedicate their lives to this genius ; him they crown , <unk> , obey , and express .
the genius knows them not .
the recitation begins ; one golden word leaps out immortal from all this painted <unk> , and sweetly torments us with invitations to its own inaccessible homes .
i remember , i went once to see the hamlet of a famed performer , [ <unk> ] the pride of the english stage ; and all i then heard , and all i now remember , of the <unk> , was that in which the <unk> had no part ; simply , hamlet 's question to the ghost ,  " what may this mean , [ <unk> ] that thou , dead <unk> , again in complete steel <unk> thus the glimpses of the moon ? "
that imagination which <unk> the closet he writes in to the world's <unk> , crowds it with agents in rank and order , as quickly reduces the big reality to be the glimpses of the moon .
these tricks of his magic spoil for us the illusions of the <unk> .
can any biography shed light on the localities into which the midsummer night 's dream [ 626 ] admits me ?
did shakspeare confide to any <unk> or parish <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , in stratford , the <name> of that delicate creation ?
the forest of <name> , [ <unk> ] the nimble air of <unk> castle , [ <unk> ] the moonlight of <name> 's villa , [ <unk> ] " the <unk> vast [ 630 ] and <unk> idle , " of <unk> 's captivity ,  where is the third cousin , or <unk> , the chancellor 's file of accounts , or private letter , that has kept one word of those transcendent secrets ?
in fine , in this drama , as in all great works of <name> ,  in the <unk> architecture [ <unk> ] of egypt and <name> ; in the <unk> sculpture ; [ <unk> ] the gothic ministers ; [ <unk> ] the italian painting ; [ <unk> ] the ballads of spain and scotland , [ <unk> ]  the genius draws up the ladder after him , when the creative age goes up to heaven , and gives way to a new , which sees the works , and ask in vain for a history .
16 .
shakspeare is the only biographer of shakspeare ; and even he can tell nothing , except to the shakspeare in us ; that is , to our most apprehensive and sympathetic hour .
he can not step from off his tripod , [ <unk> ] and give us anecdotes of his inspirations .
read the antique documents extricated , analyzed , and compared , by the <unk> <unk> and collier ; and now read one of those <unk> sentences ,  <unk> ,  which seem to have fallen out of heaven , and which , not your experience , but the man within the breast , has accepted , as words of fate ; and tell me if they match ; if the former account in any manner for the latter ; or , which gives the most historical insight into the man .
17 .
hence , though our external history is so meager , yet , with shakspeare for biographer , instead of <name> [ <unk> ] and <unk> , [ 638 ] we have really the information which is material , that which describes character and fortune , that which , if we were about to meet the man and deal with him , would most import us to know .
we have his recorded convictions on those questions which knock for answer at every heart ,  on life and death , on love , on wealth and poverty , on the prizes of life , and the ways whereby we come at them ; on the characters of men , and the influences , occult and open , which affect their fortunes ; and on those mysterious and <unk> powers which defy our science , and which yet <unk> their malice and their gift in our brightest hours .
who ever read the volume of the <unk> , without finding that the poet had there revealed , under masks that are no masks to the intelligent , the <name> of friendship and of love ; the confusion of sentiments in the most susceptible , and , at the same time , the most intellectual of men ?
what trait of his private mind has he hidden in his dramas ?
one can discern , in his ample pictures of the gentleman and the king , what forms and <unk> pleased him ; his delight in troops of friends , in large hospitality , in cheerful giving .
let <unk> , [ <unk> ] let warwick , [ <unk> ] let <name> [ <unk> ] the merchant , answer for his great heart .
so far from shakspeare 's being the least known , he is the one person , in all modern history , known to us .
what point of morals , of manners , of economy , of philosophy , of religion , of taste , of the conduct of life , has he not settled ?
what mystery has he not signified his knowledge of ?
what office , or function , or district of man 's work , has he not remembered ?
what king has he not taught state , as <unk> [ <unk> ] taught <name> ?
what maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy ?
what lover has he not <unk> ?
what sage has he not <unk> ?
what gentleman has he not instructed in the rudeness of his behavior ?
18 .
some able and appreciating critics think no criticism on shakspeare valuable , that does not rest purely on the dramatic merit ; that he is falsely judged as poet and philosopher .
i think as highly as these critics of his dramatic merit , who still think it secondary .
he was a full man , who liked to talk ; a <name> <unk> thoughts and images , which , seeking vent , found the drama next at hand .
had he been less , we should have had to consider how well he filled his place , how good a dramatist he was ,  and he is the best in the world .
but it turns out , that what he has to say is of that weight , as to withdraw some attention from the vehicle ; and he is like some saint whose history is to be rendered into all languages , into verse and prose , into songs and pictures , and cut up into proverbs ; so that the occasion which gave the saint 's meaning the form of a conversation , or of a prayer , or of a code of laws , is immaterial , compared with the universality of its application .
so it fares with the wise shakspeare and his book of life .
he wrote the airs for all our modern music : he wrote the text of modern life ; the text of manners : he <name> the man of england and europe ; the father of the man in <name> : he <name> the man , and described the day , and what is done in it : he read the hearts of men and women , their probity , and their second thought , and wiles ; the wiles of innocence , and the transitions by which virtues and vices slide into their <unk> : he could divide the mother 's part from the father 's part in the face of the child , or draw the fine <unk> of freedom and of fate : he knew the laws of repression which make the police of nature : and all the sweets and all the terrors of human lot lay in his mind as truly but as softly as the landscape lies on the eye .
and the importance of this wisdom of life sinks the form , as of drama or epic , out of notice .
't is like making a question concerning the paper on which a king 's message is written .
19 .
shakspeare is as much out of the category of eminent authors , as he is out of the crowd .
he is inconceivably wise ; the others , <unk> .
a good reader can , in a sort , nestle into plato 's <name> , and think from thence ; but not into shakspeare 's .
we are still out of doors .
for executive faculty , for creation , shakspeare is unique .
no man can imagine it better .
he was the farthest reach of <unk> compatible with an individual self ,  the <unk> of authors , and only just within the possibility of authorship .
with this wisdom of life , is the equal endowment of imaginative and of lyric power .
he clothed the creatures of his legend with form and sentiments , as if they were people who had lived under his roof ; and few real men have left such distinct characters as these <unk> .
and they spoke in language as sweet as it was fit .
yet his talents never seduced him into an ostentation , nor did he harp on one string .
an <unk> humanity [ <unk> ] <unk> all his faculties .
give a man of talents a story to tell , and his partiality <name> presently appear .
he has certain observations , opinions , topics , which have some accidental prominence , and which he disposes all to exhibit .
he <unk> this part , and <unk> that other part , consulting not the fitness of the thing , but his fitness and strength .
but shakspeare has no peculiarity , no importunate topic ; but all is duly given ; no veins , no curiosities : no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> is he : he has no discoverable egotism : the great he tells greatly ; the small , <unk> .
he is wise without emphasis or assertion ; he is strong , as nature is strong , who lifts the land into mountain slopes without effort , and by the same rule as she floats a bubble in the air , and likes as well to do the one as the other .
this makes that equality of power in farce , tragedy , narrative , and <unk> ; a merit so incessant , that each reader is incredulous of the perception of other readers .
20 .
this power of expression , or of transferring the inmost truth of things into music and verse , makes him the type of the poet , and has added a new problem to metaphysics .
this is that which throws him into natural history , as a main production of the globe , and as announcing new <unk> and <unk> .
things were <unk> in his poetry without loss or blur ; he could paint the fine with precision , the great with compass : the tragic and the comic indifferently , and without any <unk> or favor .
he carried his powerful execution into minute details , to a hair point ; finishes an <unk> or a <name> as firmly as he draws a mountain ; and yet these , like nature 's , <name> bear the scrutiny of the solar microscope .
21 .
in short , he is the chief example to prove that more or less of production , more or fewer pictures , is a thing indifferent .
he had the power to make one picture .
<unk> [ <unk> ] learned how to let one flower <unk> its image on his plate of iodine ; and then proceeds at leisure to <unk> a million .
there are always objects ; but there was never representation .
here is perfect representation , at last ; and now let the world of figures sit for their portraits .
no <unk> can be given for the making of a shakspeare ; but the possibility of the translation of things into song is demonstrated .
22 .
his lyric power lies in the genius of the piece .
the <unk> , though their excellence is lost in the splendor of the dramas , are as inimitable as they : and it is not a merit of lines , but a total merit of the piece ; like the tone of voice of some incomparable person , so is this a speech of poetic beings , and any clause as <unk> now as a whole poem .
23 .
though the speeches in the plays , and single lines , have a beauty which <unk> the ear to pause on them for their <unk> , [ <unk> ] yet the sentence is so loaded with meaning , and so linked with its <unk> and followers , that the <unk> is satisfied .
his means are as admirable as his ends ; every subordinate invention , by which he helps himself to connect some <unk> <unk> , is a poem too .
he is not reduced to dismount and walk , because his horses are running off with him in some distant direction ; he always rides .
24 .
the finest poetry was first experienced : but the thought has suffered a transformation since it was an experience .
cultivated men often attain a good degree of skill in writing verses ; but it is easy to read , through their poems , their personal history : any one acquainted with parties can name every figure : this is <name> , and that is <name> .
the sense thus remains <unk> .
it is a caterpillar with wings , and not yet a butterfly .
in the poet 's mind , the fact has gone quite over into the new element of thought , and has lost all that is <unk> .
this generosity <unk> with shakspeare .
we say , from the truth and <unk> of his pictures , that he knows the lesson by heart .
yet there is not a trace of egotism .
25 .
one more <name> trait properly belongs to the poet .
i mean his cheerfulness , without which no man can be a poet ,  for beauty is his aim .
he loves virtue , not for its obligation , but for its <name> : he delights in the world , in man , in woman , for the lovely light that sparkles from them .
beauty , the spirit of <name> and hilarity , he sheds over the universe .
<unk> [ <unk> ] relates , that poetry hath such charms that a lover might forsake his mistress to partake of them .
and the true bards have been noted for their firm and cheerful temper .
<name> lies in <name> ; chaucer is glad and erect ; and saadi says , " it was <unk> abroad that i was penitent ; but what had i to do with repentance ? "
not less sovereign and cheerful ,  much more sovereign and cheerful , is the tone of shakspeare .
his name suggests <name> and emancipation to the heart of men .
if he should appear in any company of human souls , who would not march in his troop ?
he touches nothing that does not borrow health and longevity from his <unk> style .
26 .
and now , how stands the account of man with this bard and benefactor , when in solitude , shutting our ears to the <unk> of his fame , we seek to strike the balance ?
solitude has austere lessons ; it can teach us to spare both heroes and poets ; and it weighs shakspeare also , and finds him to share the <unk> and imperfection of humanity .
27 .
shakspeare , <name> , <name> , [ <unk> ] chaucer , saw the splendor of meaning that plays over the visible world ; knew that a tree had another use than for apples , and corn another than for meal , and the ball of the earth , than for tillage and roads : that these things bore a second and finer harvest to the mind , being emblems of its thoughts , and conveying in all their natural history a certain mute commentary on human life .
shakspeare employed them as colors to compose his picture .
he rested in their beauty ; and never took the step which seemed inevitable to such genius , namely , to explore the virtue which resides in these symbols , and imparts this power ,  what is that which they themselves say ?
he converted the elements , which waited on his command , into entertainments .
he was master of the revels [ <unk> ] to mankind .
is it not as if one should have , through majestic powers of science , the comets given into his hand , or the planets and their moons , and should draw them from their orbits to glare with the municipal fireworks on a holiday night , and advertise in all towns , " very superior <unk> this evening ! "
are the agents of nature , and the power to understand them , worth no more than a street <unk> , or the breath of a cigar ?
one remembers again the <unk> in the koran , [ <unk> ]  " the heavens and the earth , and all that is between them , think ye we have created them in jest ? "
as long as the question is of talent and mental power , the world of men has not his equal to show .
but when the question is to life , and its materials , and its auxiliaries , how does he profit me ?
what does it signify ?
it is but a twelfth night , [ <unk> ] or midsummer night 's dream , or a <name> evening 's tale : what signifies another picture more or less ?
the egyptian verdict [ <unk> ] of the shakspeare societies comes to mind , that he was a jovial actor and manager .
i can not marry this fact to his verse .
other admirable men have led lives in some sort of keeping with their thought ; but this man , in wide contrast .
had he been less , had he reached only the common measure of great authors , of bacon , <name> , tasso , [ <unk> ] <unk> , [ <unk> ] we might leave the fact in the twilight of human fate : but , that this man of men , he who gave to the science of mind a new and larger subject than had ever existed , and planted the standard of humanity some <unk> forward into chaos ,  that he should not be wise for himself ,  it must even go into the world 's history , that the best poet led an obscure and profane life , using his genius for the public amusement .
28 .
well , other men , priest and prophet , <unk> , [ <unk> ] <name> , [ <unk> ] and swede , [ <unk> ] beheld the same objects : they also saw through them that which was contained .
and to what purpose ?
the beauty straightway vanished ; they read commandments , <unk> mountainous duty ; an obligation , a sadness , as of piled mountains , fell on them , and life became ghastly , <unk> , a pilgrim 's progress , [ <unk> ] a probation , <unk> round with doleful histories , of <name> 's fall [ <unk> ] and curse , behind us ; with <unk> and <unk> [ <unk> ] and penal fires before us ; and the heart of the seer and the heart of the listener sank in them .
29 .
it must be conceded that these are <unk> of <unk> .
the world still wants its <unk> , a <unk> , who shall not trifle with shakspeare the player , nor shall grope in graves with swedenborg the mourner ; but who shall see , speak , and act , with equal inspiration .
for knowledge <name> brighten the <name> ; right is more beautiful than private affection ; and love is compatible with universal wisdom .
<name> .
[ <unk> ] what right have i to write on <name> , whereof i have little , and that of the negative sort ?
my <name> consists in avoiding and going without , not in the inventing of means and methods , not in adroit steering , not in gentle repairing .
i have no skill to make money spend well , no genius in my economy , and whoever sees my garden discovers that i must have some other garden .
yet i love facts , and hate <unk> [ <unk> ] and people without perception .
then i have the same title to write on <name> that i have to write on poetry or holiness .
we write from aspiration and antagonism , as well as from experience .
we paint those qualities which we do not possess .
the poet admires the man of energy and tactics ; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar ; and where a man is not vain and <unk> you shall find what he has not by his praise .
moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words of love and friendship [ <unk> ] with words of coarser sound , and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant , not to own it in passing .
<name> is the virtue of the senses .
it is the science of appearances .
it is the <unk> action of the inward life .
it is god taking thought for oxen .
it moves matter after the laws of matter .
it is content to seek health of body by complying with physical conditions , and health of mind by the laws of the intellect .
the world of the senses is a world of shows ; it does not exist for itself , but has a symbolic character ; and a true <name> or law of shows recognizes the <unk> of other laws and knows that its own office is subaltern ; knows that it is surface and not centre where it works .
<name> is false when detached .
it is legitimate when it is the natural history of the soul incarnate , when it <unk> the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the senses .
there are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world .
it is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate three .
one class lives to the utility of the symbol , <unk> health and wealth a final good .
another class live above this <name> of the beauty of the symbol , as the poet and artist and the naturalist and man of science .
a third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified ; these are wise men .
the first class have common sense ; the second , taste ; and the third , spiritual perception .
once in a long time , a man traverses the whole scale , and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly , then also has a clear eye for its beauty , and lastly , whilst he <unk> his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature , does not offer to build houses and barns thereon <unk> the splendor of the god which he sees bursting through each chink and <unk> .
the world is filled with the proverbs [ <unk> ] and acts and <unk> of a base <name> , which is a devotion to matter , as if we possessed no other faculties than the palate , the nose , the touch , the eye and ear ; a <name> which <unk> the rule of three , which never <unk> , which gives never , which seldom lends , and asks but one question of any project ,  <name> it bake bread ?
this is a disease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed .
but culture , revealing the high origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the man as the end , <unk> everything else , as health and bodily life , into means .
it sees <name> not to be a several faculty , but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants .
cultivated men always feel and speak so as if a great fortune , the achievement of a civil or social measure , great personal influence , a graceful and commanding address , had their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit .
if a man lose his balance and <unk> himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake , he may be a good wheel or pin , [ <unk> ] but he is not a cultivated man .
the <unk> <name> , making the senses final , is the god of <unk> and cowards , and is the subject of all comedy .
it is nature 's joke , and therefore literature 's .
the true <name> limits this <unk> by admitting the knowledge of an internal and real world .
this recognition once made ,  the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and times being studied with the <unk> of their subordinate place , <name> reward any degree of attention .
for , our existence , thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods which they <name> ; so susceptible to climate and to country , so alive to social good and evil , so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and debt ,  reads all its primary lessons out of these books .
<name> does not go behind nature and ask whence it is ?
it takes the laws of the world whereby man 's being is <unk> , as they are , and keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good .
it respects space and time , climate , want , sleep , the law of polarity , [ <unk> ] growth and death .
there revolve , to give bound and period to his being on all sides , the sun and moon , the great <unk> in the sky : here lies stubborn matter , and <name> not swerve from its chemical routine .
here is a planted globe , pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed externally with civil partitions and properties which impose new restraints on the young inhabitant .
we eat of the bread which grows in the field .
we live by the air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot , too dry or too wet .
time , which shows so vacant , <unk> and divine in its coming , is slit and <unk> into trifles and tatters .
a door is to be painted , a lock to be repaired .
i want wood or oil , or meal , or salt ; the house smokes , or i have a headache ; then the tax ; and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains , and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word ,  these eat up the hours .
do what we can , summer <name> have its flies .
[ <unk> ] if we walk in the woods we must feed mosquitoes .
if we go a-fishing we must expect a wet coat .
then climate is a great impediment to idle persons .
we often resolve to give up the care of the weather , but still we regard the clouds and the rain .
we are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years .
the hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and <unk> than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics .
the <unk> may ramble all day at <name> .
at night he may sleep on a mat under the moon , and wherever a wild <unk> grows , nature has , without a prayer even , spread a table for his morning meal .
the <unk> is perforce a <unk> .
he must brew , bake , salt and preserve his food .
he must pile wood and coal .
but as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new acquaintance with nature ; and as nature is <unk> significant , the inhabitants of these climates [ <unk> ] have always excelled the southerner in force .
such is the value of these matters that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these .
let him have accurate perceptions .
let him , if he have hands , handle ; if eyes , measure and discriminate ; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry , natural history and economics ; the more he has , the less is he willing to spare any one .
time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value .
some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action .
the domestic man , who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth , has <unk> which others never dream of .
the application of means to ends <unk> victory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war .
the good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of <unk> in a shed or in the <unk> of fruits in the cellar , as in <unk> campaigns [ <unk> ] or the files of the department of state .
in the rainy day he builds a <unk> , or gets his <unk> set in the corner of the <unk> , and stored with nails , <unk> , pincers , <unk> and chisel .
herein he tastes an old <name> of youth and childhood , the <unk> love of <unk> , presses and <unk> , and of the conveniences of long housekeeping .
his garden or his <unk>  very paltry places it may be  tells him many pleasant anecdotes .
one might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this <unk> element of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world .
let a man keep the law  any law ,  and his way <name> be <unk> with <unk> .
there is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount .
on the other hand , nature <unk> any neglect of <name> .
if you think the senses final , obey their law .
if you believe in the soul , do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect .
it is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception .
dr. <name> is reported to have said , [ <unk> ]  " if the child says he looked out of this window , when he looked out of that ,  whip him . "
our american character is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception , which is shown by the currency of the <unk> , " no mistake . "
but the discomfort of <unk> , of confusion of thought about facts , <unk> to the wants of to-morrow , is of no nation .
the beautiful laws of time and space , once dislocated by our <unk> , are holes and dens .
if the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands , instead of <name> it <name> yield us bees .
our words and actions to be fair must be timely .
a <name> and pleasant sound is the <unk> of the scythe in the mornings of <name> ; yet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a <unk> or <unk> 's rifle [ <unk> ] when it is too late in the season to make hay ?
scatter <unk> and " afternoon men " spoil much more than their own affairs in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them .
i have seen a criticism on some paintings , of which i am reminded when i see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses .
the last grand duke of <unk> , [ <unk> ] a man of superior understanding , said : " i have sometimes remarked in the presence of great works of <name> , and just now especially in dresden , how much a certain property <unk> to the effect which gives life to the figures , and to the life an irresistible truth .
this property is the hitting , in all the figures we draw , the right centre of gravity .
i mean the placing the figures firm upon their feet , making the hands grasp , and fastening the eyes on the spot where they should look .
even lifeless figures , as vessels and stools  let them be drawn ever so correctly  lose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their centre of gravity , and have a certain swimming and <unk> appearance .
the <name> in the dresden gallery [ <unk> ] ( the only great affecting picture which i have seen ) is the <unk> and most passionless piece you can imagine ; a couple of saints who worship the virgin and child .
nevertheless it awakens a deeper impression than the <unk> of ten crucified martyrs .
for , beside all the resistless beauty of form , it possesses in the highest degree the property of the <unk> of all the figures . "
this <unk> we demand of all the figures in this picture of life .
let them stand on their feet , and not float and swing .
let us know where to find them .
let them discriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed .
let them call a spade a spade .
[ <unk> ] let them give us facts , and honor their own senses with trust .
but what man shall dare task another with <unk> ?
who is prudent ?
the men we call greatest are least in this kingdom .
there is a certain fatal dislocation in our relation to nature , <unk> all our modes of living and making every law our enemy , which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of reform .
we must call the highest <name> to counsel , and ask why health and beauty and genius should now be the exception rather than the rule of human nature ?
we do not know the properties of plants and animals and the laws of nature , through our sympathy with the same ; but this remains the dream of poets .
poetry and <name> should be coincident .
poets should be <unk> ; that is , the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult , but should announce and lead the civil code and the day 's work .
but now the two things seem <unk> parted .
we have violated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins , and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena , we are surprised .
beauty should be the dowry of every man and woman , as invariably as sensation ; but it is rare .
health or sound organization should be universal .
genius should be the child of genius , and every child should be inspired ; but now it is not to be predicted of any child , and nowhere is it pure .
we call partial half lights , by courtesy , genius ; talent which converts itself to money ; talent which <unk> to-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow ; and society is officered by men of parts , [ <unk> ] as they are properly called , and not by divine men .
these use their gifts to <unk> luxury , not to abolish it .
genius is always <unk> ; and piety , and love .
appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease , and they find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it .
we have found out [ <unk> ] fine names to cover our <unk> withal , but no gifts can raise intemperance .
the man of talent affects to call his <unk> of the laws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing considered with his devotion to his <name> .
his <name> rebukes him .
that never taught him <unk> , nor the love of wine , nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed .
his <name> is less for every deduction from his holiness , and less for every defect of common sense .
on him who scorned the world , as he said , the scorned world <unk> its revenge .
he that <unk> small things <name> perish by little and little .
goethe 's tasso [ <unk> ] is very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait , and that is true tragedy .
it does not seem to me so genuine grief when some <unk> <name> iii .
[ <unk> ] <unk> and <unk> a score of innocent persons , as when <name> and tasso , both apparently right , wrong each other .
one living after the maxims of this world and consistent and true to them , the other fired with all divine sentiments , yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense , without submitting to their law .
that is a grief we all feel , a knot we can not untie .
tasso 's is no infrequent case in modern biography .
a man of genius , of an ardent temperament , reckless of physical laws , <unk> , becomes presently unfortunate , <unk> , a " <unk> cousin , " a thorn to himself and to others .
the scholar shames us by his <unk> [ <unk> ] life .
whilst something higher than <name> is active , he is admirable ; when common sense is wanted , he is an <unk> .
yesterday , cæsar [ <unk> ] was not so great ; to-day , job [ <unk> ] not so miserable .
yesterday , radiant with the light of an ideal world in which he lives , the first of men , and now oppressed by wants and by sickness , for which he must thank himself , none is so poor to do him reverence .
he resembles the opium eaters whom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of constantinople , who <unk> about all day , the most pitiful <unk> , yellow , emaciated , ragged , sneaking ; then at evening , when the bazaars are open , they slink to the <unk> , swallow their morsel and become tranquil , glorious and great .
and who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties , at last sinking , chilled , exhausted and fruitless , like a giant slaughtered by pins ?
is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and <unk> of this sort , which nature is not slack in sending him , as hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial ?
health , bread , climate , social position , have their importance , and he <name> give them their due .
let him esteem nature a perpetual counsellor , and her <unk> the exact measure of our deviations .
let him make the night night , and the day day .
let him control the habit of expense .
let him see that as much wisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire , and as much wisdom may be drawn from it .
the laws of the world are written out for him on every piece of money in his hand .
there is nothing he <name> not be the better for knowing , were it only the wisdom of poor <name> , [ 681 ] or the <unk> [ <unk> ] <name> of buying by the acre to sell by the foot ; or the thrift of the agriculturist , to stick [ <unk> ] in a tree between whiles , because it <name> grow whilst he sleeps ; or the <name> which consists in <unk> little strokes of the tool , little portions of time , particles of stock and small gains .
the eye of <name> may never shut .
iron , if kept at the <unk> 's , <name> rust ; beer , if not brewed in the right state of the atmosphere , <name> sour ; timber of ships <name> rot at sea , or if laid up high and dry , <name> strain , warp and <unk> .
money , if kept by us , yields no rent and is liable to loss ; if invested , is liable to <unk> of the particular kind of stock .
strike , says the smith , the iron is white .
keep the rake , says the <unk> , as nigh the scythe as you can , and the cart as nigh the rake .
our yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the extreme of this <name> .
it saves itself by its activity .
it takes bank notes ,  good , bad , clean , ragged , and saves itself by the speed with which it passes them off .
iron can not rust , nor beer sour , nor timber rot , nor <unk> go out of fashion , nor money stocks <unk> , in the few swift moments in which the yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his possession .
in skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed .
let him learn a <name> of a higher strain .
let him learn that everything in nature , even <unk> and feathers , go by law and not by luck , and that what he sows he <unk> .
by diligence and self-command let him put the bread he eats at his own disposal , and not at that of others , that he may not stand in bitter and false relations to other men ; for the best good of wealth is freedom .
let him practise the minor virtues .
[ <unk> ] how much of human life is lost in waiting !
let him not make his fellow creatures wait .
how many words and promises are promises of conversation !
let his be words of fate .
when he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float around the globe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written , amidst a swarming population , let him likewise feel the admonition to <unk> his being across all these <unk> forces , and keep a slender human word among the storms , distances and accidents that drive us hither and thither , and , by persistency , make the paltry force of one man reappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant climates .
we must not try to write the laws of any one virtue , looking at that only .
human nature loves no contradictions , but is symmetrical .
the <name> which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one set of men , whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another , but they are <unk> .
<name> concerns the present time , persons , property and existing forms .
but as every fact hath its roots in the soul , and , if the soul were changed , would cease to be , or would become some other thing , therefore the proper administration of outward things <name> always rest on a just apprehension of their cause and origin ; that is , the good man <name> be the wise man , and the <unk> the politic man .
every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar , but is a stab at the health of human society .
on the most profitable lie the course of events presently lays a destructive tax ; whilst frankness proves to be the best tactics , for it invites frankness , puts the parties on a convenient footing and makes their business a friendship .
trust men and they <name> be true to you ; treat them greatly and they <name> show themselves great , though they make an exception in your favor to all their rules of trade .
so , in regard to disagreeable and formidable things , <name> does not consist in evasion or in flight , but in courage .
he who wishes to walk in the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself up to resolution .
let him front the object of his worst apprehension , and his <unk> <name> commonly make his fears groundless .
the latin proverb says , [ <unk> ] " in battles the eye is first overcome . "
the eye is <unk> and greatly <unk> the perils of the hour .
entire self-possession may make a battle very little more dangerous to life than a match at <unk> or at football .
examples are cited by soldiers of men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given to it , and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball .
the terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin .
the <unk> , the sailor , <unk> it all day , and his health <unk> itself at as vigorous a pulse under the sleet as under the sun of <name> .
in the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors , fear comes readily to heart and <unk> the consequence of the other party ; but it is a bad counsellor .
every man is actually weak and apparently strong .
to himself he seems weak ; to others formidable .
you are afraid of grim ; but grim also is afraid of you .
you are solicitous of the good <name> of the meanest person , uneasy at his ill <name> .
but the <unk> offender of your peace and of the neighborhood , if you rip up his claims , is as thin and timid as any ; and the peace of society is often kept , because , as children say , one is afraid and the other dares not .
far off , men swell , bully and threaten : bring them hand to hand , and they are a feeble folk .
it is a proverb that " courtesy costs nothing " ; but calculation might come to value love for its profit .
love is fabled to be blind , but kindness is necessary to perception ; love is not a hood , but an <unk> .
if you meet a <unk> or a hostile partisan , never recognize the dividing lines , but meet on what common ground remains ,  if only that the sun shines and the rain rains for both ,  the area <name> widen very fast , and ere you know it , the boundary mountains on which the eye had fastened have melted into air .
if he set out to contend , [ <unk> ] almost st. <name> <name> lie , almost st. <name> <name> hate .
what low , poor , paltry , hypocritical people an argument on religion <name> make of the pure and chosen souls .
shuffle they <name> and crow , crook and hide , feign to confess here , only that they may brag and conquer there , and not a thought has enriched either party , and not an emotion of bravery , modesty , or <name> .
so neither should you put yourself in a false position to your contemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and bitterness .
though your views are in straight antagonism [ <unk> ] to theirs , assume an identity of sentiment , assume that you are saying precisely that which all think , and in the flow of wit and love roll out your <unk> in solid column , with not the infirmity of a doubt .
so at least shall you get an adequate deliverance .
the natural emotions of the soul are so much better than the voluntary ones that you <name> never do yourself justice in dispute .
the thought is not then taken hold of by the right handle , does not show itself proportioned and in its true bearings , but bears extorted , hoarse , and half witness .
but assume a consent and it shall presently be granted , since really and underneath their all external diversities , all men are of one heart and mind .
wisdom <name> never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly footing .
we refuse sympathy and intimacy with people , as if we waited for some better sympathy and intimacy to come .
but whence and when ?
to-morrow <name> be like to-day .
life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live .
our friends and <unk> die off from us .
scarcely can we say we see new men , new women , approaching us .
we are too old to regard fashion , too old to expect patronage of any greater or more powerful .
let us suck the sweetness of those affections and <unk> [ <unk> ] that grow near us .
these old shoes are easy to the feet .
undoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company , can easily whisper names prouder and that tickle the fancy more .
every man's imagination hath its friends ; and pleasant would life be with such companions .
but if you can not have them on good mutual terms , you can not have them .
if not the deity but our ambition <unk> and shapes the new relations , their virtue escapes , as strawberries lose their flavor in garden beds .
thus truth , frankness , courage , love , humility , and all the virtues range themselves on the side of <name> , or the <name> of securing a present well-being .
i do not know if all matter <name> be found to be made of one element , as oxygen or hydrogen , at last , but the world of manners and actions is wrought of one stuff , and begin where we <name> [ <unk> ] we are pretty sure in a short space to be mumbling our ten commandments .
circles .
[ <unk> ] the eye is the first circle ; the horizon which it forms is the second ; and throughout nature this primary picture is repeated without end .
it is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world .
st. <name> [ <unk> ] described the nature of god as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its circumference nowhere .
we are all our lifetime reading the copious sense of this first of forms .
one moral we have already deduced in considering the circular or <unk> character of every human action .
another analogy we shall now trace , that every action admits of being outdone .
our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn ; that there is no end in nature , but every end is a beginning ; that there is always another <name> risen on <unk> , [ <unk> ] and under every deep a lower deep opens .
this fact , as far as it <unk> the moral fact of the unattainable , the flying perfect , around which the hands of man can never meet , at once the <unk> and the <unk> of every success , may conveniently serve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every department .
there are no fixtures in nature .
the universe is fluid and volatile .
permanence is but a word of degrees .
our globe seen by god is a transparent law , not a mass of facts .
the law dissolves the fact and holds its fluid .
our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws after it all this train of cities and institutions .
let us rise into another idea ; they <name> disappear .
the greek sculpture [ <unk> ] is all melted away , as if it had been statues of ice : here and there a solitary figure or fragment remaining , as we see <unk> and scraps of snow left in cold <unk> and mountain <unk> in <name> and july .
for the genius that created it creates now somewhat else .
the greek letters [ <unk> ] last a little longer , but are already passing under the same sentence and tumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old .
the new continents are built out of the ruins of an old planet ; the new races fed out of the decomposition of the foregoing .
new arts destroy the old .
[ <unk> ] see the investment of capital in <unk> , made useless by <unk> ; fortifications , by gunpowder ; roads and canals , by railways ; sails , by steam ; steam , by electricity .
you admire this tower of granite , <unk> the hurts of so many ages .
yet a little waving hand built this huge wall , and that which builds is better than that which is built .
the hand that built can <unk> it down much faster .
better than the hand and <unk> was the invisible thought which wrought through it ; and thus ever , behind the coarse effect , is a fine cause , which , being narrowly seen , is itself the effect of a finer cause .
everything looks permanent until its secret is known .
a <name> estate appears to women and children a firm and lasting fact ; to a merchant , one easily created out of any materials , and easily lost .
an orchard , good tillage , good grounds , seem a fixture , like a gold mine , or a river , to a citizen ; but to a large farmer , not much more fixed than the state of the crop .
nature looks <unk> stable and secular , but it has a cause like all the rest ; and when once i comprehend that , <name> these fields stretch so <unk> wide , these leaves <name> so individually considerable ?
permanence is a word of degrees .
every thing is medial .
moons are no more bounds to spiritual power than <unk> .
the key to every man is his thought .
sturdy and defying though he look , he has a helm which he obeys , which is the idea after which all his facts are classified .
he can only be reformed by showing him a new idea which commands his own .
the life of man is a <unk> circle , [ <unk> ] which , from a ring imperceptibly small , rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles , and that without end .
the extent to which this generation of circles , wheel without wheel , <name> go , depends on the force or truth of the individual soul .
for it is the inert effort of each thought , having formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance , as for instance an empire , rules of an <name> , a local usage , a religious rite , to heap itself on that ridge and to <unk> and hem in the life .
but if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep , which also runs up into a high wave , with attempt again to stop and to bind .
but the heart refuses to be imprisoned ; [ <unk> ] in its first and narrowest pulses it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and innumerable <unk> .
every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series .
every general law only a particular fact of some more general law presently to disclose itself .
there is no outside , no <unk> wall , no circumference to us .
the man finishes his story ,  how good !
how final !
how it puts a new face on all things !
he fills the sky .
lo , on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere .
then already is our first speaker not man , but only a first speaker .
his only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist .
and so men do by themselves .
the result of to-day , which haunts the mind and can not be escaped <name> presently be <unk> into a word , and the principle that seemed to explain nature <name> itself be included as one example of a bolder generalization .
in the thought of to-morrow there is a power to <unk> all thy creed , all the creeds , all the <unk> of the nations , and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted .
every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of that he should be .
men walk as prophecies of the next age .
step by step we scale this mysterious ladder ; the steps are actions , the new prospect is power .
every several result is threatened and judged by that which follows .
every one seems to be contradicted by the new ; it is only limited by the new .
the new statement is always hated by the old , and , to those dwelling in the old , comes like an abyss of <unk> .
but the eye soon gets wonted to it , for the eye and it are effects of one cause ; then its <unk> and benefit appear , and presently , all its energy spent , it <unk> and <unk> before the revelation of the new hour .
fear not the new generalization .
does the fact look <unk> [ <unk> ] and material , threatening to degrade thy theory of spirit ?
resist it not ; it goes to <unk> and raise thy theory of matter just as much .
there are no fixtures to men , if we appeal to consciousness .
every man supposes himself not to be fully understood ; and if there is any truth in him , if he rests at last on the divine soul , i see not how it can be otherwise .
the last chamber , the last closet , he must feel was never opened ; there is always a <unk> unknown , <unk> .
that is , every man believes that he has a greater possibility .
our moods do not believe in each other .
to-day i am full of thoughts and can write what i please .
i see no reason why i should not have the same thought , the same power of expression , to-morrow .
what i write , whilst i write it , seems the most natural thing in the world : but yesterday i saw a dreary <unk> in this direction in which now i see so much ; and a month hence , i doubt not , i shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages .
alas for this infirm <name> , this <name> not strenuous , this vast ebb of a vast flow !
i am god in nature ; i am a weed by the wall .
the continual effort to raise himself above himself , [ <unk> ] to work a pitch above his last height , betrays itself in a man 's relations .
we thirst for approbation , yet can not forgive the <unk> .
the sweet of nature is love ; yet if i have a friend i am tormented by my <unk> .
the love of me <unk> the other party .
if he were high enough [ 700 ] to slight me , then could i love him , and rise by my affection to new heights .
a man 's growth is seen in the successive <unk> of his friends .
for every friend whom he loses for truth , he gains a better .
i thought as i walked in the woods and mused on any friends , why should i play with them this game of idolatry ?
i know and see too well , when not voluntarily blind , the speedy limits of persons called high and worthy .
<name> , <name> and great they are by the liberality of our speech , but truth is sad .
o blessed spirit , whom i forsake for these , they are not thee !
every personal consideration that we allow costs us heavenly state .
we sell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent pleasure .
how often must we learn this lesson ?
men cease to interest us when we find their limitations .
the only sin is limitation .
as soon as you once come up with a man 's limitations , it is all over with him .
has he talents ?
has he enterprises ?
has he knowledge ?
it boots not .
infinitely alluring and attractive was he to you yesterday , a great <name> , a sea to swim in ; now , you have found his shores , found it a pond , and you care not if you never see it again .
each new step we take in thought <unk> twenty seemingly discordant facts , as expressions of one law .
aristotle and plato [ <unk> ] are reckoned the respective heads of two schools .
a wise man <name> see that aristotle <unk> .
by going one step farther back in thought , discordant opinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one principle , and we can never go so far back as to <unk> a still higher vision .
beware when the great god lets loose a thinker on this planet .
then all things are at risk .
it is as when a conflagration has broken out in a great city , and no man knows what is safe , or where it <name> end .
there is not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow ; there is not any literary reputation , not the so-called eternal names of fame , that may not be revised and condemned .
the very hopes of man , the thoughts of his heart , the religion of nations , the manners and morals of mankind are all at the <name> of a new generalization .
generalization is always a new influx of the divinity into the mind .
hence the thrill that attends it .
valor consists in the power of <unk> , so that a man can not have his flank turned , can not be <unk> , but put him where you <name> , he stands .
this can only be by his preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth , and his alert acceptance of it from whatever quarter ; the intrepid conviction that his laws , his relations to society , his christianity , his world , may at any time be superseded and decease .
there are degrees in idealism .
we learn first to play with it <unk> , as the magnet was once a toy .
then we see in the <unk> of youth and poetry that it may be true , that it is true in gleams and fragments .
then , its countenance <unk> stern and grand , and we see that it must be true .
it now shows itself ethical and practical .
we learn that god is ; that he is in me ; and that all things are shadows of him .
the idealism of berkeley [ <unk> ] is only a crude statement of the idealism of <name> , and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature is the rapid <unk> of goodness executing and organizing itself .
much more obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time directly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in the minds of men .
the things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon , and which cause the present order of things , as a tree bears its apples .
a new degree of culture would instantly <unk> the entire system of human pursuits .
conversation is a game of circles .
in conversation we pluck up the <unk> [ <unk> ] which bound the common of silence on every side .
the parties are not to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this <unk> .
[ <unk> ] to-morrow they <name> have receded from this high-water <name> .
to-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old <unk> .
yet let us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls .
when each new speaker strikes a new light , <unk> us from the oppression of the last speaker to oppress us with the greatness and <unk> of his own thought , then yields us to another <unk> , we seem to recover our rights , to become men .
o , what truths profound and <unk> only in ages and orbs , are supposed in the announcement of every truth !
in common hours , society sits cold and <unk> .
we all stand waiting , empty ,  knowing , possibly , that we can be full , surrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us , but prose and trivial toys .
then cometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men , and by a flash of his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things , and the meaning of the very furniture , of cup and saucer , of chair and clock and <unk> , is manifest .
the facts which loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday ,  property , climate , breeding , personal beauty and the like , have strangely changed their proportions .
all that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles ; and <unk> , cities , climates , religions , leave their foundations and dance before our eyes .
and yet here again see the swift <unk> !
good as is discourse , silence is better , and shames it .
the length of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer .
if they were at a perfect understanding in any part , no words would be necessary thereon .
if at one in all parts , no words would be suffered .
literature is a point outside of our <unk> [ <unk> ] circle through which a new one may be described .
the use of literature is to afford us a platform whence we may command a view of our present life , a purchase by which we may move it .
we fill ourselves with ancient learning , <unk> ourselves the best we can in greek , in punic , [ <unk> ] in <name> houses , only that we may <unk> see french , english and american houses and modes of living .
in like manner [ <unk> ] we see literature best from the midst of wild nature , or from the din of affairs , or from a high religion .
the field can not be well seen from within the field .
the astronomer must have his diameter of the <unk> orbit as a base to find the <unk> of any <name> .
therefore we value the poet .
all the argument and all the wisdom is not in the <unk> , or the treatise on metaphysics , or the body of divinity , but in the sonnet or the play .
in my daily work i incline to repeat my old steps , and do not believe in <unk> force , in the power of change and reform .
but some <unk> [ <unk> ] or <unk> , [ 709 ] filled with the new wine of his imagination , writes me an ode or a brisk romance , full of daring thought and action .
he <unk> and <unk> me with his shrill tones , breaks up my whole chain of habits , and i open my eye on my own possibilities .
he <unk> wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world , and i am capable once more of choosing a straight path in theory and practice .
we have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world .
we can never see christianity from the catechism :  from the pastures , from a boat in the pond , from amidst the songs of <unk> we possibly may .
cleansed by the elemental light and wind , steeped in the sea of beautiful forms which the field offers us , we may chance to cast a right glance back upon biography .
christianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind ; yet was there never a young philosopher whose breeding had fallen into the <name> church by whom that brave text of <name> 's was not specially prized , " then shall also the son be subject unto him who put all things under him , that god may be all in all .
" [ <unk> ] let the claims and virtues of persons be never so great and welcome , the instinct of man presses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable , and gladly arms itself against the <unk> of <unk> with this generous word out of the book itself .
the natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric circles , and we now and then detect in nature slight dislocations which <unk> us that this surface on which we now stand is not fixed , but sliding .
these manifold tenacious qualities , [ 711 ] this chemistry and vegetation , these metals and animals , which seem to stand there for their own sake , are means and methods only , are words of god , and as fugitive as other words .
has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft , who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective affinities , who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement , namely that like draws to like , and that the goods which belong to you <unk> to you and need not be pursued with pains and cost ?
yet is that statement approximate also , and not final .
omnipresence is a higher fact .
not through subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart , but , rightly considered , these things proceed from the eternal generation of the soul .
cause and effect are two sides of one fact .
the same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues , and <unk> each in the light of a better .
the great man <name> not be prudent in the popular sense ; all his <name> <name> be so much deduction from his grandeur .
but it <unk> each to see , when he sacrifices <name> , to what god he <unk> it ; if to ease and pleasure , he had better be prudent still ; if to a great trust , he can well spare his mule and <unk> who has a winged chariot instead .
<name> draws on his boots to go through the woods , that his feet may be safer from the bite of snakes ; <name> never thinks of such a peril .
in many years neither is harmed by such an accident .
yet it seems to me that with every precaution you take against such an evil you put yourself into the power of the evil .
i suppose that the highest <name> is the lowest <name> .
is this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge of our orbit ?
think how many times we shall fall back into pitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the great sentiment , or make the verge of to-day the new centre .
besides , your bravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men .
the poor and the low have their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you .
" blessed be nothing " and " the worse things are , the better they are " are proverbs which express the <unk> of common life .
one man 's justice is another 's injustice ; one man 's beauty <unk> ugliness ; one man 's wisdom another 's folly ; as one beholds the same objects from a higher point of view .
one man thinks justice consists in paying debts , and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very <unk> in this duty and makes the <unk> wait tediously .
but that second man has his own way of looking at things ; asks himself which debt must i pay first , the debt to the <name> , or the debt to the poor ?
the debt of money , or the debt of thought to mankind , of genius to nature ?
for you , o broker , there is no other principle but arithmetic .
for me , commerce is of trivial import ; love , <name> , truth of character , the aspiration of man , these are sacred ; nor can i detach one duty , like you , from all other duties , and concentrate my forces mechanically on the payment of moneys .
let me live onward ; you shall find that , though slower , the progress of my character <name> <unk> all these debts without injustice to higher claims .
if a man should dedicate himself to the payment of notes , would not this be injustice ?
owes he no debt but money ?
and are all claims on him to be postponed to a landlord 's or a banker 's ?
there is no virtue which is final ; all are initial .
the virtues of society are vices of the saint .
the terror of reform is the discovery that we must cast away our virtues , or what we have always esteemed such , into the same pit that has consumed our <unk> vices .
forgive his crimes , forgive his virtues too , those smaller faults , half converts to the right .
[ <unk> ] it is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our <unk> also .
i accuse myself of sloth and <unk> day by day ; but when these waves of god flow into me i no longer reckon lost time .
i no longer poorly <unk> my possible achievement by what remains to me of the month or the year ; for these moments confer a sort of omnipresence and <unk> which asks nothing of duration , but sees that the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done , without time .
and thus , o circular philosopher , i hear some reader exclaim , you have arrived at a fine <unk> , [ <unk> ] at an <unk> and <unk> of all actions , and would fain teach us that if we are true , forsooth , our crimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the <name> of the true god .
i am not careful to justify myself .
i own i am <unk> [ <unk> ] by seeing the predominance of the <unk> principle throughout vegetable nature , and not less by beholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of the principle of good into every chink and hole that selfishness has left open , yea into selfishness and sin itself ; so that no evil is pure , nor hell itself without its extreme <unk> .
but lest i should mislead any when i have my own head and obey my whims , let me remind the reader that i am only an <unk> .
do not set the least value on what i do , or the least discredit on what i do not , as if i pretended to settle anything as true or false .
i <unk> all things .
no facts are to me sacred ; none are profane ; i simply experiment , an endless seeker with no past at my back .
yet this incessant movement and progression which all things partake could never become sensible to us but by contrast to some principle of fixture or stability in the soul .
whilst the eternal generation of circles proceeds , the eternal <unk> abides .
that central life is somewhat superior to creation , superior to knowledge and thought , and contains all its circles .
for ever it labors to create a life and thought as large and excellent as itself ; but in vain ; for that which is made <unk> how to make a better .
thus there is no sleep , no pause , no preservation , but all things renew , germinate and spring .
why should we import rags and relics into the new hour ?
nature <unk> the old , and old age seems the only disease : all others run into this one .
we call it by many names ,  fever , intemperance , insanity , stupidity and crime : they are all forms of old age : they are rest , <unk> , appropriation , <unk> ; not newness , not the way onward .
we <unk> every day .
i see no need of it .
whilst we converse with what is above us , we do not grow old , but grow young .
infancy , youth , receptive , aspiring , with religious eye looking upward , counts itself nothing and <unk> itself to the instruction flowing from all sides .
but the man and woman of seventy assume to know all ; throw up their <name> ; renounce aspiration ; accept the actual for the necessary and talk down to the young .
let them then become organs of the holy ghost ; let them be lovers ; let them behold truth ; and their eyes are uplifted , their wrinkles smoothed , they are perfumed again with <name> and power .
this old age ought not to creep on a human mind .
in nature every moment is new ; the past is always swallowed and forgotten ; the coming only is sacred .
nothing is secure but life , transition , the <unk> spirit .
no love can be bound by oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love .
no truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts .
people wish to be settled : only as far as they are unsettled is there any <name> for them .
life is a series of surprises .
we do not guess to-day the mood , the pleasure , the power of to-morrow , when we are building up our being .
of lower states ,  of acts of routine and sense , we can tell somewhat , but the <unk> of god , the total growths and universal movements of the soul , he <unk> ; they are incalculable .
i can know that truth is divine and helpful ; but how it shall help me i can have no guess , for so to be is the sole inlet of so to know .
the new position of the advancing man has all the powers of the old , yet has them all new .
it carries in its bosom all the energies of the past , yet is itself an <unk> of the morning .
i cast away in this new moment all my once <unk> knowledge , as vacant and vain .
now for the first time seem i to know any thing rightly .
the simplest words ,  we do not know what they mean except when we love and aspire .
the difference between talents and character is adroitness to keep the old and trodden round , and power and courage to make a new road to new and better goals .
character makes an overpowering present , a cheerful , determined hour , which <unk> all the company by making them see that much is possible and excellent that was not thought of .
character <unk> the impression of particular events .
when we see the conqueror we do not think much of any one battle or success .
we see that we had exaggerated the difficulty .
it was easy to him .
the great man is not <unk> or <unk> .
he is so much that events pass over him without much impression .
people say sometimes , " see what i have overcome ; see how cheerful i am ; see how completely i have triumphed over these black events . "
not if they still remind me of the black event ,  they have not yet conquered .
is it conquest to be a <name> and decorated sepulchre , or a <unk> widow , hysterically laughing ?
true conquest is the causing the black event to fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant result in a history so large and advancing .
the one thing which we seek with insatiable <name> is to forget ourselves , to be surprised out of our propriety , to lose our <unk> [ <unk> ] memory and to do something without knowing how or why ; in short to draw a new circle .
nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm .
the way of life is wonderful .
it is by abandonment .
the great moments of history are the facilities of performance through the strength of ideas , as the works of genius and religion .
" a man , " said <name> cromwell , [ <unk> ] " never rises so high as when he knows not whither he is going . "
dreams and drunkenness , the use of opium and alcohol are the semblance and counterfeit of this <unk> genius , and hence their dangerous attraction for men .
for the like reason they ask the aid of wild passions , as in the gaming and war , ape in some manner these flames and <unk> of the heart .
notes the american scholar [ footnote 1 : games of strength .
the public games of greece were athletic and intellectual contests of various kinds .
there were four of importance : the olympic , held every four years ; the <unk> , held every third olympic year ; and the <unk> and <unk> , held alternate years between the olympic periods .
these great national festivals exercised a strong influence in greece .
they were a secure bond of union between the numerous independent states and did much to help the nation to repel its foreign invaders .
in greece the accomplished athlete was <unk> almost as a god , and cases have been recorded where altars were erected and sacrifices made in his honor .
the extreme care and cultivation of the body induced by this national spirit is one of the most significant features of greek culture , and one which might wisely be imitated in the modern world . ]
[ footnote 2 : <unk> .
in southern <name> during the eleventh century , wandering poets went from castle to castle reciting or singing <unk> , composed in the old <unk> dialect , a sort of <unk> latin .
the life in the great feudal <unk> was so dull that the lords and ladies seized with avidity any amusement which promised to while away an idle hour .
the <unk> were made much of and became a strong element in the development of the southern spirit .
so-called courts of love were formed where questions of an <unk> nature were discussed in all their bearings ; learned opinions were expressed on the most trivial matters , and offenses were tried .
some of the <unk> poetry is of the highest artistic significance , though the mass of it is worthless <unk> trash . ]
[ footnote 3 : at the time this oration was delivered ( 1837 ) , many of the authors who have since given <name> a place in the world's literature were young men writing their first books .

[ footnote 5 : it is now a <unk> fact in the development of animal life that as any part of the body falls into disuse it in time disappears .
good examples of this are the disappearance of powerful fangs from the mouth of man , the loss of power in the wings of <unk> fowls ; and , vice <unk> , as new uses for a member arise , its structure changes to meet the new needs .
an example of this is the transformation from the hoof of a horse through the cloven hoofs of the cow to the eventual development of highly expert fingers in the monkey and man .

the brother of his hand is even now cleaving the arctic sea in the fin of the whale , and innumerable ages since was pawing the marsh in the flipper of the <unk> . "

the <unk> theory was first proved by the philosopher <unk> in this way .
<unk> began his speculations from a standpoint of absolute doubt .
then he said , " i think , therefore i am , " and from this formula he built up a number of ideas innate to the human mind , ideas which we can not but hold .
locke 's " essay on the human understanding " did much to discredit <unk> ' innate ideas , which had been very generally accepted in europe before . ]

in the seventeenth century , judicial corruption was so common that bacon 's offence was not considered so gross as it would now be .
as a philosopher bacon 's rank has been much disputed .
while some claim that to his improved method of studying nature are chiefly to be attributed the prodigious strides taken by modern science , others deny him all merit in this respect .

daughter of heaven and earth , <name> spring , with sudden passion languishing , maketh all things softly smile , <unk> pictures mile on mile , holds a cup with <unk> , whence a <unk> incense breathes .

the air is full of <unk> bland ; what was that i heard out of the hazy land ?
harp of the wind , or song of bird , or clapping of shepherd 's hands , or vagrant booming of the air , voice of a meteor lost in day ?
such tidings of the starry sphere can this elastic air convey .
or haply 't was the <unk> of the pent and darkened lake , cooled by the <unk> mountain 's shade , whose deeps , till beams of noonday break , afflicted moan , and latest hold even unto may the iceberg cold .

as southern wrath to northern right is but straw to <unk> ; as in the day of sacrifice , when heroes piled the pyre , the dismal massachusetts ice burned more than others ' fire , so spring guards with surface cold the garnered heat of ages old : hers to sow the seed of bread , that man and all the kinds be fed ; and , when the sunlight fills the hours , dissolves the crust , displays the flowers .

the dead log touched bursts into leaf , the <unk> whispers of the sheaf .
what god is this imperial heat , earth 's prime secret , sculpture 's seat ?

where haughty woods front the liberated floods : we <name> climb the <unk> hills , hear the uproar of their <name> ; we <name> <name> the leaps and gleams of the <unk> streams , and the murmuring rivers of sap mount in the pipes of the trees , giddy with day , to the topmost spire , which for a spike of tender green bartered its <unk> cap ; and the colours of <name> in the bird , and the love in its <name> heard , frog and lizard in holiday coats , and turtle brave in his golden spots ; we <name> hear the <name> roar of the insects evermore , while cheerful cries of crag and plain reply to the thunder of river and main .
as poured the flood of the ancient sea spilling over mountain chains , bending forests as bends the <unk> , faster flowing o'er the plains ,  a world-wide wave with a foaming edge that rims the running silver sheet ,  so pours the deluge of the heat broad northward o'er the land , painting artless <unk> , <unk> herbs with syrian spices , fanning secret fires which glow in <unk> and <unk> , climbing the northern zones , where a thousand pallid towns lie like <unk> by the main , or <unk> armies on a plain .
the <unk> sculptor moulds <unk> <name> and <name> folds , the <unk> painter pours <name> hues and purple dye ; <unk> flush the island floors , and the tints of heaven reply .

lo love 's inundation poured over space and race abroad !
spring is strong and virtuous , <unk> , cheerful , <unk> , quickening underneath the mould grains beyond the price of gold .
so deep and large her <unk> are , that one broad , long midsummer day shall to the planet <unk> the <unk> of a year of war .
drug the cup , thou butler sweet , and send the nectar round ; the feet that slid so long on sleet are glad to feel the ground .
fill and <unk> each kind with good according to its mind , fill each kind and <unk> with good agreeing with its fate , <name> and <name> , maiden and man .
the <unk> , the haunting air , <unk> , <unk> everywhere ; it preys on all , all prey on it , blooms in beauty , thinks in wit , stings the strong with enterprise , makes travellers long for indian skies , and where it comes this courier fleet fans in all hearts <unk> sweet , as if to-morrow should redeem the vanished rose of evening 's dream .
by houses lies a fresher green , on men and maids a <unk> mien , as if time brought a new <unk> of shining virgins every may , and summer came to ripen maids to a beauty that not fades .
the <unk> wash their <name> green , the <unk> their crimson tint , on the soft path each track is seen , the girl 's foot leaves its <unk> print .
the pebble loosened from the frost asks of the urchin to be <unk> .
in flint and marble beats a heart , the kind earth takes her children 's part , the green <name> is the school-boy 's friend , low leaves his quarrel apprehend , the fresh ground loves his top and ball , the air rings <unk> to his call , the brimming <name> invites a leap , he dives the hollow , climbs the steep .
the youth reads omens where he goes , and speaks all languages the rose .
the <unk> mocks with <name> noise the far halloo of human voice ; the perfumed <name> on the spray <unk> of faint memories far away .
a subtle chain of countless rings the next unto the farthest brings , and , striving to be man , the worm mounts through all the spires of form .
i saw the <unk> spring go forth , stepping daily onward north to greet staid ancient cavaliers filing single in stately train .
and who , and who are the travellers ?
they were night and day , and day and night , pilgrims wight with step <unk> .
i saw the days deformed and low , short and bent by cold and snow ; the <name> spring threw wreaths on them , <unk> <name> with <name> and <name> ; many a flower and many a gem , they were refreshed by the smell , they shook the snow from hats and <unk> , they put their <name> raiment on ; and those eternal forms , unhurt by a thousand storms , shot up to the height of the sky again , and danced as merrily as young men .
i saw them mask their awful glance sidewise meek in gossamer lids ; and to speak my thought if none forbids .
it was as if the eternal gods , tired of their starry periods , hid their majesty in cloth woven of tulips and painted moth .
on carpets green the <unk> march below may 's <unk> arch , each <name> , each god , each <name> <unk> , every <name> and virtue speed , marching duly in her train , and fainting nature at her need is made whole again .
't was the <unk> of field and wood , when magic wine for bards is brewed ; every tree and stem and chink gushed with syrup to the brink .
the air stole into the streets of towns , and betrayed the fund of <name> to the <unk> and <unk> boy : on from hall to chamber ran , from youth to maid , from boy to man , to babes , and to old eyes as well .
'once more , ' the old man cried , 'ye clouds , airy turrets <unk> , which once my infancy beguiled , beguile me with the wonted spell .
i know ye skilful to convoy the total freight of <name> and <name> into rude and homely nooks , shed mocking <unk> on shelf of books , on farmer 's byre , on <unk> , or on a pool of dancing chips .
i care not if the pomps you show be what they <unk> appear , or if <name> realms in sunset glow be bubbles of the atmosphere .
and if it be to you allowed to fool me with a shining cloud , so only new griefs are consoled by new delights , as old by old , frankly i <name> be your guest , count your change and cheer the best .
the world hath overmuch of pain ,  if nature give me <name> again , of such deceit i 'll not complain . '
ah !
well i mind the calendar , faithful through a thousand years , of the painted race of flowers , exact to days , exact to hours , counted on the spacious dial <name> <unk> zodiac <unk> .
i know the pretty almanac of the punctual <unk> , on their due days , of the birds .
i marked them <unk> , a flock of finches darting beneath the <name> arch , piping , as they flew , a march ,  belike the one they used in parting last year from <name> oak or <unk> ; dusky sparrows in a crowd , diving , darting northward free , suddenly betook them all , every one to his hole in the wall , or to his niche in the <unk> .
i greet with <name> the <unk> trains fresh from palms and cuba 's canes .
best gems of nature 's cabinet , with dews of tropic morning wet , beloved of children , bards , and spring , o birds , your perfect virtues bring , your song , your forms , your <unk> flight , your manners for the heart 's delight , nestle in hedge , or barn , or roof , here weave your chamber <unk> , forgive our harms , and condescend to man , as to a <unk> friend , and , generous , teach his awkward race courage , and probity , and <name> !
poets praise that hidden wine hid in milk we <name> at the barrier of time , when our life was new .
we had eaten <name> fruit , we were quick from head to foot , all the forms we look on shone as with <name> dews thereon .
what cared we for costly joys , the museum 's <unk> toys ?
gleam of <name> on the wall poured a deeper cheer than all the revels of the carnival .
we a <unk> did prefer to a marble theatre , could with gods on <unk> dine , nor cared for spices or for wine .
wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned , arch on arch , the <unk> land ; whistle of a woodland bird made the pulses dance , note of horn in valleys heard filled the region with romance .
none can tell how sweet , how virtuous , the morning air ; every accent <unk> well ; not alone the <unk> 's call , or shouting boys that <name> their ball , pass the height of minstrel skill , but the <unk> 's thoughtless cry , lowing oxen , sheep that <unk> , and the <unk> 's <unk> , softened are above their <name> .
all grating <unk> melt , no <unk> note is dealt , and though thy voice be shrill like rasping file on steel , such is the temper of the air , <name> waits with <name> and care , and <name> the faults of song repair .
so by remote superior lake , and by resounding <unk> , when northern storms and forests shake , and billows on the long beach break , the artful air doth separate note by note all sounds that grate , smothering in her ample breast all but godlike words , reporting to the happy ear only purified accords .
strangely wrought from barking waves , soft music <unk> the indian braves ,  <unk> which the child hears <unk> from the panther 's cave and the impenetrable wild .
one musician is sure , his wisdom <name> not fail , he has not tasted wine impure , nor bent to passion frail .
age can not cloud his memory , nor grief <unk> his voice , ranging down the ruled scale from tone of <name> to inward wail , <unk> the pitch of all in his <name> cave .
he all the fables knows , and in their causes tells ,  knows nature 's rarest moods , ever on her secret broods .
the muse of men is <name> , oft courted <name> not come ; in palaces and market squares entreated , she is dumb ; but my minstrel knows and tells the counsel of the gods , knows of holy book the spells , knows the law of night and day , and the heart of girl and boy , the tragic and the <name> , and what is writ on table round of <name> and his peers , what sea and land <unk> say in <unk> years .
he renders all his <name> in <name> wild as dreams , <unk> all extremes ,  what the spangled meadow saith to the children who have <name> ; only to children children sing , only to youth <name> spring be spring .
who is the bard thus magnified ?
when did he sing , and where abide ?
chief of song where poets feast is the <unk> which thou seest in the casement at my side .
<unk> harp , how strangely wise thy strain !
<name> for youth , <name> for youth , ( sweet is <name> , but sweeter truth , ) in the hall at summer <name> fate and beauty skilled to weave .
from the eager opening strings rung loud and bold the song .
who but loved the <unk> 's note ?
how should not the poet <unk> on its mystic tongue , with its primeval memory , reporting what old minstrels said of <name> locked the harp within ,  <name> paying the pain of sin , pent in a dungeon made of air ,  and some attain his voice to hear , words of pain and cries of fear , but <unk> all on <name> , as fits the griefs of bards to be .
and what if that <unk> shell , which thus the buried past can tell , should rive the future , and reveal what his dread folds would fain conceal ?
it shares the secret of the earth , and of the kinds that owe her birth .
speaks not of self that mystic tone , but of the <unk> alone : it trembles to the <unk> breath ,  as it <unk> , so it saith ; obeying meek the primal cause , it is the tongue of mundane laws : and this , at least , i dare affirm , since genius too has bound and term , there is no bard in all the choir , not <name> 's self , the poet sire , wise <name> 's odes of pensive pleasure , or shakspeare , whom no mind can measure , nor collins ' verse of tender pain , nor <name> 's clarion of disdain , <name> , the delight of generous boys , or wordsworth , pan 's recording voice ,  not one of all can put in verse , or to this presence could rehearse , the sights and voices <unk> the boy knew on the hills in spring , when pacing through the oaks he heard sharp queries of the <unk> , the heavy grouse 's sudden whirr , the rattle of the kingfisher ; saw bonfires of the harlot flies in the lowland , when day dies ; or marked , benighted and forlorn , the first far <unk> of morn .
these syllables that nature spoke , and the thoughts that in him woke , can adequately utter none save to his ear the <unk> lone .
and best can teach its <unk> chord how nature to the soul is moored , if once again that silent string , as <unk> it wont , would thrill and ring .
not long ago , at eventide , it seemed , so listening , at my side a window rose , and , to say sooth , i looked forth on the fields of youth : i saw fair boys <unk> steeds , i knew their forms in fancy weeds , long , long concealed by <unk> fates , mates of my youth ,  yet not my mates , stronger and bolder far than i , with <name> , with genius , well attired , and then as now from far admired , followed with love they knew not of , with passion cold and shy .
o <name> , for what <unk> rare !
renewed , i breathe elysian air , see youth 's glad mates in earliest bloom ,  break not my dream , <unk> tomb !
or teach thou , spring !
the grand recoil of life <unk> from the soil wherein was dropped the mortal spoil .
soft on the <unk> sleeps the haze !
so on thy broad mystic van lie the <unk> days , and waft the miracle to man .
<unk> of the eldest gods , <unk> of what harms betide , <unk> of the inmost powers prometheus proffered , jove denied ; disclosing treasures more than true , or in what far to-morrow due ; speaking by the tongues of flowers , by the <unk> <name> speaking , singing by the <unk> songs , heart of bird the man 's heart seeking ; whispering hints of treasure hid under morn 's <unk> lid , islands looming just beyond the dim horizon 's utmost bound ;  who can , like thee , our rags upbraid , or taunt us with our <name> decayed ?
or who like thee persuade , making the splendour of the air , the morn and sparkling dew , a snare ?
or who resent thy genius , wiles , and <unk> ?
there is no orator prevails to beckon or persuade like thee the youth or maid : thy birds , thy songs , thy <name> , thy gales , thy blooms , thy kinds , thy echoes in the wilderness , soothe pain , and age , and love 's distress , fire fainting <name> , and build heroic minds .
for thou , o spring !
canst <unk> all that high god did first create .
be still his arm and architect , rebuild the ruin , mend defect ; chemist to <unk> old worlds with new , coat sea and sky with <unk> blue , <unk> the plumage of the birds , and slough decay from grazing herds , sweep ruins from the <unk> mountain , cleanse the torrent at the fountain , <unk> alpine air by towns defiled , bring to fair mother fairer child , not less renew the heart and <name> , scatter the sloth , wash out the stain , make the aged eye <unk> , to parting soul bring grandeur near .
under gentle types , my spring masks the might of nature 's king , an energy that searches thorough from chaos to the dawning morrow ; into all our human plight , the soul 's pilgrimage and flight ; in city or in solitude , step by step , lifts bad to good , without halting , without rest , lifting better up to best ; planting seeds of knowledge pure , through earth to ripen , through heaven endure .
the <unk> .
a journal .
dedicated to my <unk> in <name> , 1858 .
wise and polite ,  and if i <name> their several portraits , you would own chaucer had no such worthy crew , nor <unk> in <unk> .
we crossed <unk> to <unk> with our friends , thence , in strong country carts , rode up the forks of the <unk> stream , intent to reach the <unk> lakes .
at <name> 's beach we chose our boats ; each man a boat and guide ,  ten men , ten guides , our company all told .
next morn , we swept with oars the <unk> , with skies of benediction , to round lake , where all the sacred mountains <name> around us , <unk> , seaward , <unk> , <unk> , and other <unk> without muse or name .
pleased with these grand companions , we glide on , instead of flowers , crowned with a wreath of hills , and made our distance wider , boat from boat , as each would hear the oracle alone .
by the bright morn the <name> flotilla slid through files of flags that gleamed like bayonets , through <unk> beds of <unk> , through scented banks of lilies white and gold , where the deer feeds at night , the <unk> by day , on through the upper <unk> , and up pere <unk> stream , to a small tortuous pass winding through grassy shallows in and out , two creeping miles of rushes , pads , and sponge , to <unk> water , and the lake of <unk> .
northward the length of <unk> we rowed , under low mountains , whose unbroken ridge ponderous with <unk> forest sloped the shore .
a pause and council : then , where near the head on the east a bay makes inward to the land between two <name> arms , we climb the bank , and in the twilight of the forest noon wield the first axe these echoes ever heard .
we cut young trees to make our poles and <unk> , barked the white spruce to <unk> the roof , then struck a light , and kindled the camp-fire .
the wood was <unk> with centennial trees ,  oak , cedar , <name> , poplar , beech and fir , <unk> and spruce .
in strict society three <unk> , white , pitch , and norway pine , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , grew thereby .
our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth , the <name> eight , beneath its shapely tower .
<unk> ! '
the wood god murmured through the leaves ,  <unk> , though late , <unk> , yet known to me . '
evening <name> on ; stars peeped through <unk> , which <unk> , like a cloud , our camping fire .
decayed <unk> trunks , like moonlight <unk> , lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor .
ten scholars , wonted to lie warm and soft in <unk> chambers daintily bestowed , lie here on <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> , and greet unanimous the joyful change .
so fast <name> nature <unk> her sons , though late returning to her <unk> ways .
off soundings , seamen do not suffer cold ; and , in the forest , delicate clerks , <unk> , sleep on the fragrant brush , as on <unk> .
up with the <name> , they fancied the light air that circled freshly in their forest dress made them to boys again .
happier that they slipped off their pack of duties , leagues behind , at the first mounting of the giant stairs .
no placard on these rocks warned to the polls , no door-bell heralded a visitor , no courier waits , no letter came or went , nothing was ploughed , or <unk> , or bought , or sold ; the frost might glitter , it would blight no crop , the falling rain <name> spoil no holiday .
we were made freemen of the forest laws , all dressed , like nature , fit for her own ends , <unk> nothing she can not perform .
in <unk> lakes , at morn or noon , the guide rows bareheaded : shoes , flannel shirt , and <unk> trousers make his brief <unk> : at night , or in the rain , he dons a <unk> which he <unk> at morn : a paddle in the right hand , or an oar , and in the left , a gun , his needful arms .
by turns we praised the stature of our guides , their rival strength and <unk> , their skill to row , to swim , to shoot , to build a camp , to climb a lofty stem , clean without boughs full fifty feet , and bring the eaglet down : temper to face wolf , bear , or <unk> , and wit to track or take him in his lair .
sound , ruddy men , frolic and innocent , in <name> , <unk> ; in summer , guides ; their <unk> arms pull at the oar <unk> three times ten thousand strokes , from morn to <name> .
look to yourselves , ye polished gentlemen !
no city airs or arts pass current here .
your rank is all reversed : let men of cloth bow to the stalwart <unk> in <unk> : they are the doctors of the wilderness , and we the <unk> <unk> .
in sooth , red flannel is a saucy test which few can put on with impunity .
what make you , master , fumbling at the oar ?
<name> you catch crabs ?
truth tries pretension here .
the sallow knows the <unk> 's thumb ; the oar , the guide 's .
dare you accept the tasks he shall impose , to find a spring , trap foxes , tell the sun 's time , determine the true north , or stumbling on through vast <unk> woods to thread by night the nearest way to camp ?
ask you , how went the hours ?
all day we swept the lake , searched every cove , north from camp <name> , south to <unk> bay , watching when the loud dogs should drive in deer , or whipping its rough surface for a trout ; or <unk> , diving from the rock at noon ; challenging <name> by our guns and cries ; or listening to the laughter of the <unk> ; or , in the evening twilight 's latest red , beholding the procession of the pines ; or , later yet , beneath a lighted <name> , in the boat 's bows , a silent <unk> stealing with paddle to the <unk> of the red deer , to aim at a square mist .
hark to that muffled roar !
a tree in the woods is fallen : but hush !
it has not scared the <name> who stands astonished at the meteor light , then turns to bound away ,  is it too late ?
sometimes we tried our rifles at a <name> , six rods , sixteen , twenty , or forty-five ; sometimes our wits at <name> and retort , with laughter sudden as the crack of rifle ; or parties scaled the near <unk> competing seekers of a <unk> lake , whose <unk> waves we named lake probability ,  our <unk> , long sought , not found .
two doctors in the camp dissected the slain deer , weighed the trout 's <name> , captured the lizard , salamander , <unk> , crab , mice , snail , <unk> , <unk> , and moth ; <unk> skill in water or in air waved the <unk> , and nothing came amiss ; the while , one leaden pot of alcohol gave an impartial tomb to all the kinds .
not less the ambitious botanist sought plants , orchis and <unk> , <name> , and long <unk> , <name> polygonum , <unk> 's pride , <unk> and <unk> , mushroom , sponge , and moss , or <unk> nodding in the gorge of falls .
above , the eagle flew , the <unk> screamed , the <name> croaked , owls hooted , the woodpecker loud hammered , and the heron rose in the swamp .
as water poured through the hollows of the hills to feed this wealth of lakes and rivulets , so nature shed all beauty lavishly from her <unk> horn .
lords of this realm , bounded by <name> and sunset , and the day rounded by hours where each <unk> the last in miracles of pomp , we must be proud , as if associates of the sylvan gods .
we seemed the dwellers of the zodiac , so pure the alpine element we breathed , so light , so lofty pictures came and went .
we <unk> on air , <unk> the distant town , its <unk> ways , big trifles , and we planned that we should build , <unk> , a spacious lodge , and how we should come hither with our sons , hereafter ,  willing they , and more adroit .
hard fare , hard bed , and comic misery ,  the <unk> , the <unk> , and the mosquito painted our necks , hands , ankles , with red bands : but , on the second day , we heed them not , nay , we saluted them auxiliaries , whom earlier we had <unk> with spiteful names .
for who defends our leafy <unk> from bold intrusion of the travelling crowd ,  who but the <unk> , mosquito , and the fly , which past endurance sting the tender <unk> , but which we learn to scatter with a smudge , or <unk> by a veil , or slight by scorn ?
our foaming ale we drunk from hunters ' pans , ale , and a sup of wine .
our steward gave venison and trout , potatoes , beans , <unk> ; all ate like <unk> , and , if any missed their wonted <unk> , <unk> hid the loss with hunters ' appetite and peals of mirth .
and stillman , our guides ' guide , and commodore , crusoe , crusader , <unk> <unk> , said aloud , " chronic <unk> never came from eating food indigestible " :  then murmured some , others applauded him who spoke the truth .
nor doubt but <unk> of graver thought checked in these souls the turbulent <unk> 'mid all the hints and glories of the home .
for who can tell what sudden <unk> were sought and found , amid the <name> and cry of scholars <unk> from their tasks , and let into this <unk> ' <unk> paradise , as chapels in the city 's thoroughfares , whither gaunt labour slips to wipe his brow , and meditate a moment on heaven 's rest .
judge with what sweet surprises nature spoke to each apart , lifting her lovely shows to spiritual lessons pointed home .
and as through dreams in watches of the night , so through all creatures in their form and ways some mystic hint <unk> the vigilant , not clearly voiced , but waking a new sense inviting to new knowledge , one with old .
hark to that <unk> chirp !
what ails the <unk> ?
<name> his capricious ways to draw the eye .
now soar again .
what wilt thou , restless bird , seeking in that chaste blue a <unk> light , <unk> in that pure for a purer sky ?
and presently the sky is changed ; o world !
what pictures and what harmonies are thine !
the clouds are <name> and dark , the air serene , so like the soul of me , what <unk> were me ?
a melancholy better than all mirth .
comes the sweet sadness at the retrospect , or at the foresight of <unk> years ?
like <name> <unk> cloudy promontory , whereon the purple <name> dwells in beauty superior to all its gaudy skirts .
and , that no day of life may lack romance , the spiritual stars rise nightly , shedding down a private beam into each several heart .
daily the bending skies solicit man , the seasons chariot him from this exile , the rainbow hours <unk> his glowing chair , the <unk> urge the heavy weeks along , suns haste to set , that so remoter lights beckon the wanderer to his vaster home .
with a vermilion pencil <name> the day when of our little fleet three cruising <unk> entering big <unk> , bound for the foaming falls of loud bog river , suddenly confront two of our mates returning with swift oars .
one held a printed journal waving high caught from a <unk> traveller , big with great news , and shouted the report for which the world had waited , now firm fact , of the <unk> laid beneath the sea , and landed on our coast , and <unk> with <unk> fire .
loud , exulting cries from boat to boat , and to the echoes round , greet the glad miracle .
thought 's new-found path shall supplement henceforth all trodden ways , match god 's equator with a zone of <name> , and lift man 's public action to a height worthy the enormous clouds of witnesses , when linked hemispheres attest his deed .
we have few moments in the longest life of such delight and wonder as there grew ,  nor yet <unk> to that solitude : a burst of <name> , as if we told the fact to ears intelligent ; as if gray rock and cedar grove and <name> and lake should know this feat of wit , this triumph of mankind ; as if we men were talking in a vein of sympathy so large , that ours was theirs , and a prime end of the most subtle element were fairly reached at last .
wake , echoing caves !
bend nearer , faint <unk> !
<name> <unk> , let them hear well !
't is theirs as much as ours .
a spasm throbbing through the <unk> of alp and andes , isle and continent , urging astonished chaos with a thrill to be a <name> , or serve the <name> of man .
the lightning has run <unk> too long ; he must to school , and learn his verb and noun , and teach his <unk> to earn his wage , spelling with guided tongue man 's messages shot through the weltering pit of the salt sea .
and yet i marked , even in the manly <name> of our <unk> doctor in his boat , ( perchance i erred , ) a shade of discontent ; or was it for mankind a generous shame , as of a luck not quite legitimate , since fortune snatched from wit the lion 's part ?
was it a college pique of town and gown , as one within whose memory it burned that not <unk> , but some <unk> , found ten years since the californian gold ?
and now , again , a hungry company of traders , led by <unk> sons of trade , <unk> borrowing from the shop the tools of science , not from the philosophers , had won the brightest <name> of all time .
't was always thus , and <name> be ; hand and head are ever rivals : but , though this be swift , the other slow ,  this the prometheus , and that the jove ,  yet , howsoever hid , it was from jove the other stole his fire , and , without jove , the good had never been .
it is not <unk> or cannibals , but ever the free race with front sublime , and these instructed by their wisest too , who do the feat , and lift humanity .
let not him mourn who best entitled was , nay , mourn not one : let him <unk> , yea , plant the tree that bears best apples , plant , and water it with wine , nor watch askance whether thy sons or strangers eat the fruit : enough that mankind eat , and are refreshed .
we flee away from cities , but we bring the best of cities with us , these learned <unk> , men knowing what they seek , armed eyes of experts .
we praise the guide , we praise the forest life ; but <name> we sacrifice our <unk> <name> of books and arts and trained experiment , or count the <unk> a match for agassiz ?
o no , not we !
witness the shout that shook wild <unk> lake ; witness the mute <unk> the joyful traveller gives , when on the verge of <unk> indian wilderness he hears from a <unk> stream <unk> 's notes on the piano , played with master 's hand .
'well done ! '
he cries ; 'the bear is kept at bay , the lynx , the rattlesnake , the flood , the fire ; all the fierce enemies , ague , hunger , cold , this thin spruce roof , this <unk> <unk> , this wild plantation <name> suffice to <name> .
now speed the <name> <unk> of <name> , what in the desert was impossible within four walls is possible again ,  culture and libraries , mysteries of skill , <unk> fame of masters , eager strife of keen competing youths , joined or alone to <unk> each other , and extort applause .
mind wakes a new-born giant from her sleep .
<unk> the old wheels ?
time takes fresh start again on for a thousand years of genius more . '
the holidays were fruitful , but must end ; one <name> evening had a cooler breath ; into each mind intruding duties crept ; under the cinders burned the fires of home ; nay , letters found us in our paradise ; so in the gladness of the new event we struck our camp , and left the happy hills .
the fortunate <name> that rose on us sank not ; the prodigal <name> rested on the land , the rivers <unk> onward to the sea , and nature , the inscrutable and mute , permitted on her infinite repose almost a smile to steal to cheer her sons , as if one riddle of the sphinx were guessed .
occasional and miscellaneous pieces .
brahma .
if the red slayer think he <unk> , or if the slain think he is slain , they know well the subtle ways i keep , and pass , and turn again .
far or forgot to me is near ; shadow and sunlight are the same ; the vanquished gods to me appear ; and one to me are shame and fame .
they reckon ill who leave me out ; when me they fly , i am the wings ; i am the <unk> and the doubt , and i the hymn the brahmin sings .
the strong gods pine for my abode , and pine in vain the sacred seven ; but thou , meek lover of the good !
find me , and turn thy back on heaven .
<unk> .
already blushes in thy cheek the <unk> which thou must speak ; the bird , how far it haply roam by cloud or isle , is flying home ; the maiden fears , and fearing runs into the charmed snare she shuns ; and every man , in love or pride , of his fate is never wide .
<name> a woman 's fan the ocean smooth ?
or prayers the stony <unk> sooth , or coax the thunder from its <name> ?
or tapers light the chaos dark ?
in spite of virtue and the muse , <unk> <name> have her dues , and all our struggles and our toils tighter wind the giant coils .
fate .
deep in the man sits fast his fate to mould his fortunes mean or great : unknown to cromwell as to me was cromwell 's measure or degree ; unknown to him , as to his horse , if he than his groom be better or worse .
he works , plots , fights , in rude affairs , with squires , lords , kings , his craft compares , till late he learned , through doubt and fear , broad england <unk> not his peer : obeying time , the last to own the genius from its cloudy throne .
for the <unk> is allied unto the thing so signified ; or say , the foresight that awaits is the same genius that creates .
freedom .
once i wished i might rehearse freedom 's <unk> in my verse , that the slave who caught the strain should throb until he snapped his chain .
but the spirit said , 'not so ; speak it not , or speak it low ; name not lightly to be said , gift too precious to be prayed , passion not to be expressed but by heaving of the breast : yet ,  wouldst thou the mountain find where this deity is <unk> , who gives to seas and sunset skies their <unk> beauty of surprise , and , when it lists him , waken can brute or savage into man ; or , if in thy heart he shine , blends the starry fates with thine , draws angels nigh to dwell with thee , and makes thy thoughts archangels be ; freedom 's secret wilt thou know ?  counsel not with flesh and blood ; <unk> not for cloak or food ; right thou <unk> , rush to do . '
ode <name> in the town hall , concord , july 4 , 1857 .
o tenderly the haughty day fills his blue urn with fire ; one morn is in the mighty heaven , and one in our <name> .
the cannon booms from town to town , our pulses are not less , the <unk> chime their tidings down , which children 's voices bless .
for he that flung the broad blue fold <unk> land and sea , one third part of the sky unrolled for the banner of the free .
the men are ripe of saxon kind to build an equal state ,  to take the statute from the mind , and make of duty fate .
united states !
the ages plead ,  present and past in <unk> ,  go put your creed into your deed , nor speak with double tongue .
for sea and land do n't understand , nor skies without a frown see rights for which the one hand fights by the other cloven down .
be just at home ; then write your scroll of honour o'er the sea , and bid the broad atlantic roll , a ferry of the free .
and , henceforth , there shall be no chain , save underneath the sea the wires shall murmur through the main sweet songs of <name> .
the conscious stars accord above , the waters wild below , and under , through the cable wove , her fiery errands go .
for he that <unk> high and wise , nor pauses in his plan , <name> take the sun out of the skies ere freedom out of man .
boston hymn .
read in music hall , <name> 1 , 1863 .
the word of the lord by night to the watching pilgrims came , as they sat by the seaside , and filled their hearts with flame .
god said , i am tired of kings , i suffer them no more ; up to my ear the morning brings the outrage of the poor .
think ye i made this ball a field of havoc and war , where tyrants great and tyrants small might <name> the weak and poor ?
my <name> , his name is freedom ,  choose him to be your king ; he shall cut <unk> east and west , and fend you with his wing .
lo !
i uncover the land which i hid of old time in the west , as the sculptor <unk> the statue when he has wrought his best ; i show columbia , of the rocks which dip their foot in the seas , and soar to the <unk> flocks of clouds , and the <unk> fleece .
i <name> divide my goods ; call in the wretch and slave : none shall rule but the humble , and none but toil shall have .
i <name> have never a <name> , no lineage counted great ; fishers and <unk> and <unk> shall constitute a state .
go , cut down trees in the forest , and trim the straightest boughs ; cut down the trees in the forest , and build me a wooden house .
call the people together , the young men and the <unk> , the <unk> in the harvest field , hireling , and him that <unk> ; and here in a pine state-house they shall choose men to rule in every needful faculty , in church , and state , and school .
lo , now !
if these poor men can govern the land and sea , and make just laws below the sun , as planets faithful be .
and ye shall <unk> men ; 't is nobleness to serve ; help them who can not help again : beware from right to swerve .
i break your bonds and <unk> , and i <unk> the slave : free be his heart and hand henceforth as wind and wandering wave .
i cause from every creature his proper good to flow : as much as he is and <unk> , so much he shall bestow .
but laying hands on another to coin his labour and sweat , he goes in pawn to his victim for eternal years in debt .
to-day <unk> the captive , so only are ye unbound ; lift up a people from the dust , trump of their rescue , sound !
pay ransom to the owner , and fill the bag to the brim .
who is the owner ?
the slave is owner , and ever was .
pay him .
o north !
give him beauty for rags , and honour , o south !
for his shame ; <name> !
coin thy golden crags with freedom 's image and name .
up !
and the dusky race that sat in darkness long ,  be swift their feet as antelopes , and as <unk> strong .
come , east and west and north , by races , as <unk> , and <name> my purpose forth , which neither halts nor shakes .
my <name> fulfilled shall be , for , in daylight or in dark , my thunderbolt has eyes to see his way home to the <name> .
<unk> .
i .
low and mournful be the strain , haughty thought be far from me ; tones of penitence and pain , <unk> of the tropic sea ; low and tender in the cell where a captive sits in chains , crooning ditties treasured well from his <unk> 's torrid plains .
sole estate his sire bequeathed  hapless sire to hapless son  was the wailing song he breathed , and his chain when life was done .
what his fault , or what his crime ?
or what ill planet crossed his prime ?
heart too soft and <name> too weak to front the fate that <unk> near ,  dove beneath the vulture 's beak ;  <name> song dissuade the thirsty spear ?
dragged from his mother 's arms and breast , displaced , <unk> here , his wistful toil to do his best chilled by a <unk> <unk> .
great men in the senate sate , sage and hero , side by side , building for their sons the state , which they shall rule with pride .
they forbore to break the chain which bound the dusky tribe , checked by the owners ' fierce disdain , lured by " union " as the bribe .
<name> sat by , and said , <unk> for pang your seed shall pay , hide in false peace your coward head , i bring round the <unk> . '
ii .
freedom all winged expands , nor <unk> in a narrow place ; her broad van seeks <unk> lands ; she loves a poor and virtuous race .
clinging to a colder zone whose dark sky sheds the <unk> down , the <unk> is her banner 's <name> , her stripes the <unk> streamers are .
long she loved the <unk> well : now the iron age is done , she <name> not refuse to dwell with the offspring of the sun ; <unk> of the desert far , where palms plume , <unk> blaze , he <unk> unhurt the burning ways in climates of the summer <name> .
he has avenues to god hid from men of northern <name> , far beholding , without cloud , what these with slowest steps attain .
if once the generous chief arrive to lead him willing to be led , for freedom he <name> strike and strive , and drain his heart till he be dead .
iii .
in an age of <unk> and toys , wanting wisdom , void of right , who shall nerve heroic boys to hazard all in freedom 's fight ,  break sharply off their jolly games , forsake their comrades <name> , and quit proud homes and youthful dames , for famine , toil , and fray ?
yet on the nimble air benign speed <unk> messages , that waft the breath of <name> divine to hearts in sloth and ease .
so nigh is grandeur to our dust , so near is god to man , when duty whispers low , thou must , the youth replies , i can .
iv .
o , well for the fortunate soul which music 's wings <unk> , stealing away the memory of sorrows new and old !
yet happier he whose inward sight , stayed on his <unk> thought , shuts his sense on toys of time , to vacant bosoms brought .
but best befriended of the god he who , in evil times , warned by an inward voice , <unk> not the darkness and the dread , <unk> by his rule and choice , feeling only the fiery thread leading over heroic ground , walled with mortal terror round , to the aim which him <unk> , and the sweet heaven his deed secures .
<unk> soldier on the walls , knowing this ,  and knows no more ,  whoever fights , whoever falls , justice conquers evermore , justice after as before ,  and he who battles on her side , god , though he were ten times slain , crowns him <name> glorified , <name> over death and pain ; forever : but his erring foe , <unk> that he prevails , looks from his victim lying low , and sees aloft the red right arm redress the eternal scales .
he , the poor foe , whom angels foil , blind with pride , and fooled by hate , <unk> within the dragon coil , reserved to a speechless fate .
v. blooms the <name> which belongs to the valiant chief who fights ; i see the wreath , i hear the songs <unk> the eternal rights , victors over daily wrongs : awful victors , they <unk> whom they <name> destroy , and their coming triumph hide in our downfall , or our <name> : they reach no term , they never sleep , in equal strength through space abide ; though , <unk> dwarfs , they crouch and creep , the strong they slay , the swift <unk> : fate 's grass grows rank in valley clods , and <unk> on the <unk> steep ,  speak it firmly , these are gods , all are ghosts beside .
love and thought .
two <unk> travellers use the highway , eros and the muse .
from the twins is nothing hidden , to the pair is naught forbidden ; hand in hand the comrades go every nook of nature through : each for other they were born , each can other best adorn ; they know one only mortal grief past all <unk> or relief , when , by false companions crossed , the pilgrims have each other lost .
lover 's petition .
good heart , that <unk> all !
i ask a modest boon and small : not of lands and towns the gift ,  too large a load for me to lift ,  but for one proper creature , which <unk> eye , sweeping the map of western earth , or the atlantic coast , from maine to <unk> 's domain , could not <unk> .
<unk> much to ask in all thy huge creation , so trivial a part ,  a solitary heart ?
yet count me not of spirit mean , or mine a mean demand , for 't is the concentration and worth of all the land , the sister of the sea , the daughter of the strand , composed of air and light , and of the <unk> <unk> .
so little to thy poet 's prayer thy large bounty well can spare .
and yet i think , if she were gone , the world were better left alone .
<name> .
roving , roving , as it seems , <name> lights my clouded dreams ; still for journeys she is dressed ; we wander far by east and west .
in the homestead , homely thought ; at my work i ramble not ; if from home chance draw me wide , <unk> <name> sits beside .
in my house and <unk> , though beloved , i miss her not ; but one i seek in foreign places , one face explore in foreign faces .
at home a deeper thought may light the inward sky with <unk> , and i greet from far the <name> , <name> of a dearer day .
but if upon the seas i sail , or <unk> on the glowing rail , i am but a thought of hers , loveliest of travellers .
so the gentle poet 's name to foreign parts is blown by fame ; seek him in his native town , he is hidden and unknown .
letters .
every day brings a ship , every ship brings a word ; well for those who have no fear , looking seaward well assured that the word the vessel brings is the word they wish to hear .
rubies .
they brought me rubies from the mine , and held them to the sun ; i said , they are drops of frozen wine from <name> 's <unk> that run .
i looked again ,  i thought them hearts of friends to friends unknown ; tides that should warm each neighbouring life are locked in sparkling stone .
but fire to thaw that ruddy snow , to break enchanted ice , and give love 's <name> tides to flow ,  when shall that sun arise ?
<name> 's song .
of <name> wise i learned a song ,  sing it low or sing it loud , it is mightier than the strong , and <unk> the proud .
i sing it to the surging crowd ,  good men it <name> calm and cheer , bad men it <name> chain and cage .
in the heart of the music peals a strain which only angels hear ; whether it waken <name> or rage , hushed myriads hark in vain , yet they who hear it shed their age , and take their youth again .
the test .
( <unk> <unk> . )
i <name> my verses in the wind , time and tide their faults may find .
all were <unk> through and through , five lines lasted sound and true ; five were <unk> in a pot than the south more fierce and hot ; these the <unk> could not melt , fire their fiercer flaming felt , and the meaning was more white than july 's meridian light .
<name> can not <unk> the snow , nor time <unk> what poets know .
have you eyes to find the five which five hundred did survive ?
solution .
i am the muse who <name> alway by jove , at <name> of the first day .
<unk> , <unk> , long i wrought to fire the stagnant earth with thought : on spawning slime my song prevails , wolves shed their fangs , and dragons scales ; flushed in the sky the sweet <unk> , earth smiled with flowers , and man was born .
then <name> <unk> her shepherd race , and nile <unk> her granite base ,  <unk> <unk> , <unk> nile ,  and , under vines , on <name> isle , or on <unk> <unk> bleak , forward stepped the perfect greek : that wit and <name> might find a tongue , and earth grow civil , <name> <name> .
flown to italy from greece , i brooded long , and held my peace , for i am wont to sing <unk> , and in days of evil plight unlock doors of new delight ; and sometimes mankind i appalled with a bitter horoscope , with spasms of terror for balm of <name> .
then by better thought i lead bards to speak what nations need ; so i folded me in fears , and <name> searched the triple spheres , <unk> nature at his <name> , so shaped , so coloured , swift or still , and , <unk> , his large design <unk> on alp and <unk> .
<unk> in mists of <unk> , taught by <unk> 's <unk> power , england 's genius filled all measure of heart and soul , of strength and pleasure , gave to the mind its emperor , and life was larger than before : nor <unk> centuries could hit orbit and sum of shakspeare 's wit .
the men who lived with him became poets , for the air was fame .
far in the north , where polar night holds in check the frolic light , in trance <unk> past mortal goal the swede <name> leads the soul .
through snows above , mines underground , the <unk> of <unk> he found ; rehearsed to men the damned wails on which the seraph music sails , in <unk> he trod alone , but walked the earth unmarked , unknown .
the near <unk> caught no sound ,  yet they who listened far aloof heard <unk> of the <unk> roof , and felt , beneath , the quaking ground ; and his <unk> , unheeded words , in the next age , are flaming swords .
in newer days of war and trade , romance forgot , and <name> decayed , when science armed and guided war , and clerks the <unk> <unk> , when <name> , where poet never grew , <unk> and dealt the globe anew , goethe , raised o'er <name> and strife , <name> the firm lines of fate and life , and brought <unk> wisdom down to court and mart , to gown and town , stooping , his finger wrote in <name> the open secret of to-day .
so bloom the <unk> petals five , and verses that all verse outlive .
nature and life .
nature .
i. winters know easily to shed the snow , and the untaught spring is wise in cowslips and <unk> .
nature , hating <name> and pains , <unk> and <unk> plotting brains ; <unk> and surprise are the apples of her eyes ; but she dearly loves the poor , and , by <name> of her own , strikes the loud <unk> down .
for nature listens in the rose , and <unk> in the <name> 's <name> , to help her friends , to plague her foes , and like wise god she judges well .
yet doth much her love excel to the souls that never fell , to <unk> that live in happiness , and do well because they please , who walk in ways that are <unk> , and feats achieve before they 're named .
nature .
ii .
she is <unk> and good , but of <unk> mood ,  no dreary <unk> now and again , she <name> be all things to all men .
she who is old , but nowise feeble , pours her power into the people , <name> and manifold without bar , makes and moulds them what they are , and what they call their city way is not their way , but hers , and what they say they made to-day , they learned of the oaks and firs .
she <unk> men as <unk> fresh , hero and maiden , flesh of her flesh ; she drugs her water and her wheat with the <unk> she finds meet , and gives them what to drink and eat ; and having thus their bread and growth , they do her bidding , nothing loath .
what 's most theirs is not their own , but borrowed in atoms from iron and stone , and in their <unk> works of <name> the <unk> is still her part .
the <unk> girl .
the sun goes down , and with him takes the coarseness of my poor attire ; the fair moon mounts , and aye the flame of <unk> beauty blazes higher .
pale northern girls !
you scorn our race ; you captives of your <unk> halls , wear out <unk> your sickly days , but leave us the horizon walls .
and if i take you , dames , to task , and say it frankly without <unk> , then you are gypsies in a mask , and i the <name> all the while .
if , on the <name> , below the moon , i court and play with paler blood , me false to mine dare whisper none ,  one sallow horseman knows me good .
go , keep your cheek 's rose from the rain , for teeth and hair with <unk> deal ; my swarthy tint is in the grain , the rocks and forest know it real .
the wild air <unk> in our lungs , the keen stars twinkle in our eyes , the birds gave us our wily tongues , the panther in our dances flies .
you doubt we read the stars on high , <unk> we read your fortunes true ; the stars may hide in the upper sky , but without glass we fathom you .
days .
damsels of time , the <unk> days , muffled and dumb like barefoot <unk> , and marching single in an endless file , bring <unk> and fagots in their hands .
to each they offer gifts after his <name> , bread , kingdoms , stars , and sky that holds them all .
i , in my <unk> garden , watched the pomp , forgot my morning wishes , hastily took a few herbs and apples , and the day turned and departed silent .
i , too late , under her solemn <unk> saw the scorn .
the <unk> 's complaint .
day !
hast thou two faces , making one place two places ?
one , by humble farmer seen , chill and wet , unlighted , mean , useful only , <unk> and damp , serving for a <unk> 's lamp ?
have the same mists another side , to be the <unk> of pride , <unk> the <name> man 's wood and lake , his park where <name> mornings break , and treacherously bright to show his planted isle where roses glow ?
o day !
and is your <unk> a <unk> to <unk> success ?
<name> the sweet sky and ocean broad be fine accomplices to fraud ?
o sun !
i curse thy cruel <name> : back , back to chaos , harlot day !
my garden .
if i could put my woods in song , and tell what 's there enjoyed , all men would to my gardens throng , and leave the cities void .
in my plot no tulips blow ,  <unk> pines and oaks instead ; and rank the savage maples grow from spring 's faint flush to autumn red .
my garden is a forest ledge which older forests bound ; the banks slope down to the blue <unk> , then plunge to depths profound .
here once the deluge ploughed , laid the terraces , one by one ; ebbing later whence it flowed , they <unk> and dry in the sun .
the <unk> made haste to depart ,  the wind and the birds which sowed it ; not for fame , nor by rules of <name> , planted these , and tempests flowed it .
waters that wash my garden side play not in nature 's lawful web , they heed not moon or solar tide ,  five years elapse from flood to ebb .
hither <unk> , in old time , jove , and every god ,  none did refuse ; and be sure at last came love , and after love , the muse .
keen ears can catch a syllable , as if one spake to another , in the hemlocks tall , <unk> , and what the whispering grasses smother .
<unk> <unk> in the pine ring with the song of the fates ; infant <unk> in the vine ,  far distant yet his chorus waits .
cast thou copy in verse one chime of the <unk> 's peal and cry , write in a book the morning 's prime , or match with words that tender sky ?
wonderful verse of the gods , of one import , of varied tone ; they chant the bliss of their abodes to man imprisoned in his own .
ever the words of the gods resound ; but the porches of man 's ear seldom in this low life 's round are <unk> , that he may hear .
wandering voices in the air , and murmurs in the <unk> , speak what i can not declare , yet can not all withhold .
when the shadow fell on the lake , the whirlwind in ripples wrote <unk> of fortune that shine and break , and omens above thought .
but the meanings cleave to the lake , can not be carried in book or urn ; go thy ways now , come later back , on waves and hedges still they burn .
these the fates of men forecast , of better men than live to-day ; if who can read them comes at last , he <name> spell in the sculpture , <unk> ! '
the <unk> .
you shall not be <unk> when you deal with arctic cold , as late i found my <unk> blood chilled wading in the <unk> wood .
how should i fight ?
my <unk> fine has million arms to one of mine : east , west , for aid i looked in vain , east , west , north , south , are his domain .
miles off , three dangerous miles , is home ; must borrow his winds who there would come .
up and away for life !
be fleet !  the <unk> ties my fumbling feet , sings in my ears , my hands are stones , <unk> the blood to the marble bones , tugs at the <unk> , <unk> the sense , and <unk> in life with narrowing fence .
well , in this broad bed lie and sleep , the punctual stars <name> vigil keep , embalmed by purifying cold , the winds shall sing their <unk> old , the snow is no ignoble shroud , the moon thy mourner , and the cloud .
softly ,  but this way fate was pointing , 't was coming fast to such <unk> , when piped a <name> voice hard by , <name> and polite a cheerful cry , <unk> !
saucy note out of sound heart and <name> throat , as if it said , 'good day , good sir !
fine afternoon , old passenger !
happy to meet you in these places , where <name> brings few faces . '
this poet , though he live apart , moved by his hospitable heart , sped , when i passed his sylvan fort , to do the honours of his court , as fits a feathered lord of land ; flew near , with soft wing grazed my hand , hopped on the bough , then , darting low , prints his small impress on the snow , shows feats of his gymnastic play , head downward , clinging to the spray .
here was this atom in full breath , hurling defiance at vast death ; this scrap of <unk> just for play fronts the <unk> in waistcoat gray , as if to shame my weak behaviour ; i greeted loud my little saviour , 'you pet !
what dost here ?
and what for ?
in these woods , thy small labrador , at this pinch , wee san <name> !
what fire burns in that little chest so frolic , stout , and <unk> ?
henceforth i wear no stripe but thine ; ashes and jet all hues <unk> .
why are not diamonds black and gray , to ape thy <unk> array ?
and i affirm , the spacious north exists to draw thy virtue forth .
i think no virtue goes with size ; the reason of all cowardice is , that men are overgrown , and , to be valiant , must come down to the <unk> <unk> . '
't is good-will makes intelligence , and i began to catch the sense of my bird 's song : <unk> out of doors , in the great woods , on prairie floors .
i dine in the sun ; when he sinks in the sea , i too have a hole in a hollow tree ; and i like less when summer beats with stifling beams on these retreats , than <unk> <unk> which snow makes with tempest of the blinding flakes .
for well the soul , if stout within , can arm <unk> the skin ; and polar frost my frame defied , made of the air that blows outside . '
with glad remembrance of my debt , i homeward turn ; farewell , my pet !
when here again thy pilgrim comes , he shall bring store of seeds and crumbs .
doubt not , so long as earth has bread , thou first and foremost shalt be fed ; the providence that is most large takes hearts like thine in special charge , helps who for their own need are strong , and the sky <unk> on cheerful song .
henceforth i prize thy wiry chant o'er all that mass and minster <unk> ; for men <unk> thy call in spring , as 't would accost some frivolous wing ; crying out of the <name> <unk> , <unk> !
and , in <name> , <unk> !
i think old caesar must have heard in northern gaul my dauntless bird , and , echoed in some frosty <unk> , borrowed thy <unk> bold .
and i <name> write our annals new , and thank thee for a better clew , i , who dreamed not when i came here to find the <unk> of fear , now hear thee say in <name> key , <unk> !
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
sea-shore .
i heard or seemed to hear the <unk> sea say , pilgrim , why so late and slow to come ?
am i not always here , thy summer home ?
is not my voice thy music , morn and <name> ?
my breath thy healthful climate in the heats , my touch thy <unk> , my bay thy bath ?
was ever building like my terraces ?
was ever couch magnificent as mine ?
lie on the warm <unk> , and there learn a little hut suffices like a town .
i make your sculptured architecture vain , vain beside mine .
i drive my wedges home , and carve the coastwise mountain into caves .
lo !
here is rome , and nineveh , and thebes , <unk> , and pyramid , and giant 's stairs , half piled or prostrate ; and my newest slab older than all thy race .
behold the sea , the <unk> , the plentiful and strong , yet beautiful as is the rose in <name> , fresh as the trickling rainbow of july ; sea full of food , the <unk> of kinds , <unk> of earth , and medicine of men ; creating a sweet climate by my breath , washing out harms and griefs from memory , and , in my <unk> ebb and flow , giving a hint of that which changes not .
<name> are the <unk> :  who gives gifts but they ?
they grope the sea for pearls , but more than pearls : they pluck force thence , and give it to the wise .
for every wave is wealth to <unk> , wealth to the cunning artist who can work this matchless strength .
where shall he find , o waves !
a load your atlas shoulders can not lift ?
i with my hammer pounding evermore the <name> coast , smite andes into dust , <unk> my bed , and , in another age , rebuild a continent of better men .
then i <unk> the doors : my paths lead out the exodus of nations : i disperse men to all shores that front the hoary main .
i too have arts and <unk> ; illusion dwells forever with the wave .
i know what spells are laid .
leave me to deal with <unk> and imaginative man ; for , though he scoop my water in his palm , a few rods off he <unk> it gems and clouds .
planting strange fruits and <name> on the shore , i make some coast alluring , some lone isle , to distant men , who must go there , or die .
song of nature .
mine are the night and morning , the pits of air , the gulf of space , the <unk> sun , the <unk> moon , the innumerable days .
i hide in the solar <name> , i am dumb in the <unk> song , i rest on the pitch of the torrent , in slumber i am strong .
no <name> have counted my <unk> , no tribes my house can fill , i sit by the shining <unk> of life , and pour the deluge still ; and ever by delicate powers gathering along the centuries from race on race the rarest flowers , my wreath shall nothing miss .
and many a thousand summers my apples ripened well , and light from <unk> stars with firmer <name> fell .
i wrote the past in characters of rock and fire the scroll , the building in the <name> sea , the planting of the coal .
and thefts from satellites and rings and broken stars i <name> , and out of spent and aged things i formed the world anew ; what time the gods kept carnival , tricked out in <name> and flower , and in cramp <unk> and <unk> forms they <unk> their too much power .
time and thought were my <unk> , they laid their courses well , they boiled the sea , and baked the layers of granite , marl , and shell .
but he , the man-child glorious ,  where <unk> he the while ?
the rainbow shines his <unk> , the sunset gleams his smile .
my <unk> lights leap upward , <unk> my planets roll , and still the man-child is not born , the summit of the whole .
must time and tide for ever run ?
<name> never my winds go sleep in the west ?
<name> never my wheels which whirl the sun and satellites have rest ?
too much of donning and <unk> , too slow the rainbow fades , i weary of my robe of snow , my leaves and my cascades ; i tire of globes and races , too long the game is played ; what without him is summer 's pomp , or <name> 's frozen shade ?
i <unk> in pain for him , my creatures <unk> and wait ; his couriers come by squadrons , he comes not to the gate .
twice i have moulded an image , and thrice outstretched my hand , made one of day , and one of night , and one of the salt <unk> .
one in a <unk> manger , and one by <unk> stream , one over against the mouths of nile , and one in the <unk> .
i moulded kings and <unk> , and bards o'er kings to rule ;  but fell the starry influence short , the cup was never full .
yet whirl the glowing wheels once more , and mix the bowl again ; <unk> , fate !
the ancient elements , heat , cold , wet , dry , and peace , and pain .
let war and trade and creeds and song blend , ripen race on race , the <unk> world a man shall breed of all the zones , and countless days .
no <name> is dimmed , no atom worn , my oldest force is good as new , and the fresh rose on yonder thorn gives back the bending heavens in dew .
two rivers .
thy summer voice , <unk> , repeats the music of the rain ; but sweeter rivers pulsing flit through thee , as thou through concord plain .
thou in thy narrow banks are pent : the stream i love unbounded goes through flood and sea and firmament ; through light , through life , it forward flows .
i see the inundation sweet , i hear the spending of the stream through years , through men , through nature fleet , through passion , thought , through power and dream .
<unk> , a goblin strong , of <unk> and flint makes jewels <name> ; they lose their grief who hear his song , and where he winds is the day of day .
so forth and brighter fares my stream ,  who drinks it shall not thirst again ; no darkness stains its equal gleam , and ages drop in it like rain .
<unk> .
i do not count the hours i spend in wandering by the sea ; the forest is my loyal friend , like god it <unk> me .
in plains that room for shadows make of skirting hills to lie , bound in by streams which give and take their colours from the sky ; or on the <unk> sublime , or down the oaken glade , o what have i to do with time ?
for this the day was made .
cities of mortals woe begone fantastic care <unk> , but in the serious landscape lone stern benefit abides .
sheen <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> , and <name> is only a mask of sad , but , sober on a fund of <name> , the woods at heart are glad .
there the great planter plants of fruitful worlds the grain , and with a million spells <unk> the souls that walk in pain .
still on the seeds of all he made the rose of beauty burns ; through times that wear , and forms that fade , immortal youth returns .
the black ducks mounting from the lake , the pigeon in the pines , the <unk> 's boom , a desert make which no false <name> <unk> .
down in <name> watery nook , where bearded mists divide , the gray old gods whom chaos knew , the <unk> of nature , hide .
aloft , in secret veins of air , blows the sweet breath of song , o , few to scale those uplands dare , though they to all belong !
see thou bring not to field or stone the fancies found in books ; leave authors ' eyes , and fetch your own , to brave the landscape 's looks .
and if , amid this dear delight , my thoughts did home <unk> , i well might reckon it a slight to the high cheer i found .
oblivion here thy wisdom is , thy thrift , the sleep of cares ; for a proud idleness like this crowns all thy mean affairs .
terminus .
it is time to be old , to take in sail :  the god of bounds , who sets to seas a shore , came to me in his fatal rounds , and said : 'no more !
no farther spread thy broad ambitious branches , and thy root .
fancy departs : no more invent , contract thy firmament to compass of a tent .
there 's not enough for this and that , make thy <unk> which of two ; <unk> the failing river , not the less revere the giver , leave the many and hold the few .
timely wise accept the terms , soften the fall with wary foot ; a little while still plan and smile , and , fault of novel germs , mature the <unk> fruit .
curse , if thou wilt , thy <unk> , bad husbands of their fires , who , when they gave thee breath , failed to <unk> the needful sinew stark as once , the <unk> marrow to thy bones , but left a legacy of ebbing veins , inconstant heat and <unk> reins ,  amid the muses , left thee deaf and dumb , amid the gladiators , halt and numb . '
as the bird <unk> her to the <name> , i trim myself to the storm of time , i man the rudder , reef the sail , obey the voice at <name> obeyed at prime : <unk> faithful , banish fear , right onward drive unarmed ; the port , well worth the cruise , is near , and every wave is charmed . '
the past .
the debt is paid , the verdict said , the furies laid , the plague is stayed , all fortunes made ; turn the key and bolt the door , sweet is death forevermore .
nor haughty <name> , nor <unk> chagrin , nor murdering hate , can enter in .
all is now secure and fast ; not the gods can shake the past ; flies to the <unk> door bolted down forevermore .
none can <unk> there , no thief so politic , no satan with a <name> trick steal in by window , chink , or hole , to bind or <unk> , add what lacked , insert a leaf , or forge a name , <unk> or finish what is packed , alter or mend eternal fact .
the last farewell .
lines written by the author 's brother , <name> bliss <name> , whilst sailing out of boston harbour , bound for the island of porto <name> , in 1832 .
farewell , ye lofty spires that cheered the holy light !
farewell , domestic fires that broke the gloom of night !
too soon those spires are lost , too fast we leave the bay , too soon by ocean <unk> from hearth and home away , far away , far away .
farewell the busy town , the wealthy and the wise , kind smile and honest frown from bright , familiar eyes .
all these are fading now ; our brig <unk> on her way , her <unk> prow is leaping o'er the sea , far away , far away .
farewell , my mother fond , too kind , too good to me ; nor <name> nor <name> would pay my debt to thee .
but even thy kiss denies upon my cheek to stay ; the winged vessel flies , and billows round her play , far away , far away .
farewell , my brothers true , my betters , yet my peers ; how desert without you my few and evil years !
but though aye one in heart , together sad or <name> , rude ocean doth us part ; we separate to-day , far away , far away .
farewell i breathe again to dim new england 's shore ; my heart shall beat not when i pant for thee no more .
in <name> green <unk> isle , beneath the tropic <name> , i murmur never while for thee and thine i pray ; far away , far away .
in <unk> .
e. b. e. i mourn upon this battle-field , but not for those who perished here .
behold the river-bank whither the angry farmers came , in <unk> dress and broken rank , nor thought of fame .
their deed of blood all mankind praise ; even the serene reason says , it was well done .
the wise and simple have one glance to greet <name> stern <unk> , which more of pride than pity gave to <name> the briton 's friendless grave .
yet it is a stately tomb ; the grand return of <name> and morn , the year 's fresh bloom , the silver cloud , might <name> the dust that is most proud .
yet not of these i muse in this ancestral place , but of a kindred face that never <name> or <name> shall here diffuse .
ah , brother of the brief but blazing <name> !
what hast thou to do with these haunting this bank 's historic trees ?
thou born for noblest life , for action 's field , for <name> 's car , thou living champion of the right ?
to these their penalty belonged : i grudge not these their bed of death , but thine to thee , who never wronged the poorest that <name> breath .
all inborn power that could consist with homage to the good flamed from his martial eye ; he who seemed a soldier born , he should have the helmet worn , all friends to fend , all foes defy , fronting foes of god and man , frowning down the <unk> , battling for the weak and poor .
his from youth the leader 's look gave the law which others took , and never poor beseeching glance shamed that sculptured countenance .
there is no record left on earth , save in tablets of the heart , of the <name> inherent worth , of the <name> that on him shone , of eloquent lips , of joyful wit ; he could not frame a word unfit , an act unworthy to be done ; honour prompted every glance , honour came and sat beside him , in lowly cot or painful road , and evermore the cruel god cried , " onward ! "
and the <unk> showed .
born for success he seemed , with <name> to win , with heart to hold , with shining gifts that took all eyes , with budding power in <unk> , as pledged in coming days to forge weapons to guard the state , or scourge tyrants despite their guards or walls .
on his young promise beauty smiled , <name> his free homage <unk> , and prosperous age held out his hand , and richly his large future planned , and troops of friends enjoyed the tide ,  all , all was given , and only health denied .
i see him with superior smile hunted by sorrow 's grisly train in lands remote , in toil and pain , with <name> <name> labour on , with the high port he wore <unk> , when , foremost of the youthful band , the prizes in all lists he won ; nor bate one jot of heart or <name> , and , least of all , the loyal tie which holds to home 'neath every sky , the <name> and pride the pilgrim feels in hearts which round the hearth at home keep pulse for pulse with those who roam .
what generous beliefs console the brave whom fate denies the goal !
if others reach it , is content ; to heaven 's high <name> his <name> is bent .
firm on his heart relied , what lot <unk> betide , work of his hand he nor <unk> nor grieves , <unk> for itself the fact , as <unk> nature leaves her every act .
fell the bolt on the branching oak ; the rainbow of his <name> was broke ; no craven cry , no secret tear ,  he told no pang , he knew no fear ; its peace sublime his aspect kept , his purpose woke , his features slept ; and yet between the spasms of pain his genius beamed with <name> again .
o'er thy <name> dust the endless smile of nature in thy spanish isle hints never loss or cruel break and sacrifice for love 's dear sake , nor mourn the unalterable days that genius goes and folly stays .
what matters how , or from what ground , the freed soul its creator found ?
alike thy memory <unk> that <unk> , that isle of palms , and these loved banks , whose <unk> bold root in the blood of heroes old .
elements .
experience .
the lords of life , the lords of life ,  i saw them pass , in their own guise , like and unlike , portly and grim ,  use and surprise , surface and dream , succession swift and spectral wrong , temperament without a tongue , and the inventor of the game <unk> without name ;  some to see , some to be guessed , they march from east to west : little man , least of all , among the legs of his guardians tall , walked about with puzzled look .
him by the hand dear nature took , dearest nature , strong and kind , whispered , <unk> , never mind !
to-morrow they <name> wear another face , the founder thou ; these are thy race ! '
compensation .
ii .
the wings of time are black and white , pied with morning and with night .
mountain tall and ocean deep trembling balance duly keep .
in changing moon and tidal wave glows the feud of want and have .
gauge of more and less through space , electric <name> or pencil plays , the lonely earth amid the balls that hurry through the eternal halls , a <unk> flying to the void , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> spark , shoots across the neutral dark .
iii .
man 's the elm , and wealth the vine ; staunch and strong the tendrils twine : though the frail ringlets thee deceive , none from its stock that vine can <unk> .
fear not , then , thou child infirm , there 's no god dare wrong a worm ; <name> crowns cleave to deserts , and power to him who power exerts .
hast not thy share ?
on winged feet , lo !
it rushes thee to meet ; and all that nature made thy own , floating in air or pent in stone , <name> rive the hills and swim the sea , and , like thy shadow , follow thee .
politics .
gold and iron are good to buy iron and gold ; all earth 's fleece and food for their like are sold .
hinted <name> wise , proved <name> great , nor kind nor <unk> buys aught above its rate .
fear , craft , and avarice can not rear a state .
out of dust to build what is more than dust ,  walls <unk> piled <unk> <unk> must .
when the muses nine when the virtues meet , find to their design an atlantic seat , by green orchard boughs <unk> from the heat , where the statesman ploughs furrow for the wheat ,  when the church is social worth , when the state-house is the hearth , then the perfect state is come , the republican at home .
heroism .
<name> wine is drunk by knaves , sugar spends to <unk> slaves , rose and <unk> deck <unk> ; <unk> are jove 's <unk> , drooping oft in wreaths of dread , <unk> round his head ; the hero is not fed on sweets , daily his own heart he eats ; chambers of the great are jails , and <unk> right for <name> sails .
character .
the sun set , but set not his <name> : stars rose ; his <name> was earlier up : fixed on the enormous galaxy , deeper and older seemed his eye ; and matched his sufferance sublime the <unk> of time .
he spoke , and words more soft than rain brought the age of gold again : his action won such reverence sweet as hid all measure of the feat .
culture .
can rules or <unk> educate the <unk> whom we await ?
he must be musical , tremulous , <unk> , alive to gentle influence of landscape and of sky , and tender to the <unk> of man 's or maiden 's eye : but , to his native centre fast , shall into future fuse the past , and the world 's flowing fates in his own mould <unk> .
friendship .
a ruddy drop of manly blood the surging sea <unk> , the world uncertain comes and goes , the lover rooted stays .
i fancied he was fled ,  and , after many a year , glowed <unk> kindliness , like daily sunrise there .
my careful heart was free again , o friend , my bosom said , through thee alone the sky is arched , through thee the rose is red ; all things through thee take nobler form , and look beyond the earth , the <unk> of our fate appears a <unk> in thy worth .
me too thy nobleness has taught to master my despair ; the fountains of my hidden life are through thy friendship fair .
beauty .
was never form and never face so sweet to <unk> as only <name> which did not slumber like a stone , but hovered gleaming and was gone .
beauty chased he everywhere , in flame , in storm , in clouds of air .
he smote the lake to feed his eye with the <name> beam of the broken wave ; he flung in pebbles well to hear the moment 's music which they gave .
oft <unk> for him a lofty tone from nodding pole and <unk> zone .
he heard a voice none else could hear from centred and from <unk> sphere .
the quaking earth did quake in rhyme , seas ebbed and flowed in epic chime .
in dens of passion , and pits of woe , he saw strong eros struggling through , to sun the dark and solve the curse , and beam to the bounds of the universe .
while thus to love he gave his days in loyal worship , <unk> praise , how spread their <unk> for him in vain <unk> ambition and <unk> gain !
he thought it happier to be dead , to die for beauty , than live for bread .
manners .
<name> , beauty , and <name> build this golden portal ; graceful women , chosen men , dazzle every mortal .
their sweet and lofty countenance his enchanted food ; he need not go to them , their forms beset his solitude .
he <unk> seldom in their face , his eyes explore the ground ,  the green grass is a looking-glass whereon their traits are found .
little and less he says to them , so dances his heart in his breast ; their tranquil mien <unk> him of wit , of words , of rest .
