( <unk> ) the <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> body of a few score persons , controls the planet .
transportation is civilisation , our motto runs .
theoretically we do what we please , so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies .
practically , the <unk> .
confirms or <unk> all international arrangements , and , to judge from its last report , finds our tolerant , humorous , lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders .
'with the night mail [ 1 ] . '
[ footnote 1 : actions and reactions . ]
is n't it almost time that our planet took some interest in the proceedings of the <unk> board of control ?
one knows that easy communications nowadays , and lack of privacy in the past , have killed all curiosity among mankind , but as the board 's official reporter i am bound to tell my tale .
at <unk> a.m. , <name> 26 , a.d. <unk> , the board , sitting in london , was informed by de forest that the district of northern illinois had <unk> cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected till the board should take over and administer it direct .
every northern illinois freight and passenger tower was , he reported , out of action ; all district main , local , and guiding lights had been extinguished ; all general communications were dumb , and through traffic had been diverted .
no reason had been given , but he gathered unofficially from the mayor of chicago that the district complained of <unk> and invasion of privacy . '
as a matter of fact , it is of no importance whether northern illinois stay in or out of <unk> circuit ; as a matter of policy , any complaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation , lest worse follow .
by <unk> a.m. de forest , dragomiroff ( russia ) , takahira ( japan ) , and pirolo ( italy ) were <unk> to visit illinois and 'to take such steps as might be necessary for the <unk> of traffic and all that that implies .
' by 10 a.m. the hall was empty , and the four members and i were aboard what pirolo insisted on calling 'my leetle <unk> '  that is to say , the new <name> pirolo .
our planet prefers to know <name> pirolo as a gentle , <unk> enthusiast who spends his time near <unk> , inventing or creating new breeds of <unk> <unk> ; but there is another side to his nature  the manufacture of quaint inventions , of which the <name> pirolo is , perhaps , not the least surprising .
she and a few score <unk> of the same type embody his latest ideas .
but she is not comfortable .
an <unk> .
boat does not take the air with the <unk> lift of a liner , but shoots up <unk> like the <unk> ' of our ancestors , and makes her height at <unk> from the first .
that is why i found myself sitting suddenly on the large lap of <unk> arnott , who commands the <unk> .
fleet .
one knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a fleet somewhere on the planet , and that , theoretically , it exists for the purposes of what used to be known as <unk> . '
only a week before , while visiting a glacier <unk> behind <unk> , i had seen some squadrons making false <unk> far to the north while they <unk> round the pole ; but , naturally , it had never occurred to me that the things could be used in <name> .
said arnott to de forest as i staggered to a seat on the <unk> <unk> : 'we 're tremendously grateful to 'em in illinois .
we 've never had a chance of exercising all the fleet together .
i 've turned in a general call , and i expect we 'll have at least two hundred keels aloft this evening . '
'well aloft ? '
de forest asked .
'of course , sir .
out of sight till they 're called for . '
arnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent <unk> where the map of the <unk> atlantic slid along , degree by degree , in exact answer to our progress .
our dial already showed 320 <unk> .
and we were two thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines .
'now , where is this illinois district of yours ? '
said dragomiroff .
'one travels so much , one sees so little .
oh , i remember !
it is in north <name> . '
de forest , whose business it is to know the out districts , told us that it lay at the foot of lake michigan , on a road to nowhere in particular , was about half an hour 's run from end to end , and , except in one corner , as flat as the sea .
like most flat countries nowadays , it was heavily guarded against invasion of privacy by forced timber  <unk> spruce and <unk> , grown in five years .
the population was close on two millions , largely migratory between <name> and california , with a backbone of small farms ( they call a thousand acres a farm in illinois ) whose owners come into chicago for amusements and society during the <name> .
they were , he said , <unk> kind , quiet folk , but a little exacting , as all flat countries must be , in their notions of privacy .
there had , for instance , been no printed <unk> in illinois for twenty-seven years .
chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner or later developed into engines for invasion of privacy , which in turn might bring the old terror of crowds and blackmail back to the planet .
so <unk> were not .
'and that 's illinois , ' de forest concluded .
'you see , in the old days , she was in the <unk> of what they used to call " progress , " and chicago  ' <unk> ? '
said takahira .
'that 's the little place where there is <unk> 's statue of the nigger in flames ?
a fine bit of old work . '
'when did you see it ? '
asked de forest quickly .
'they only <unk> it once a year . '
'i know .
at thanksgiving .
it was then , ' said takahira , with a shudder .
'and they sang <unk> 's song , too . '
<unk> ! '
de forest whistled .
'i did not know that !
i wish you 'd told me before .
<unk> 's song may have had its uses when it was composed , but it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind . '
'it 's protective instinct , my dear fellows , ' said pirolo , rolling a cigarette .
'the planet , she has had her dose of popular government .
she suffers from inherited <unk> .
she has no  ah  use for crowds . '
dragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light .
'certainly , ' said the <unk> russian , 'the planet has taken all precautions against crowds for the past hundred years .
what is our total population to-day ?
six hundred million , we <name> ; five hundred , we think ; but  but if next year 's census shows more than four hundred and fifty , i myself <name> eat all the extra little babies .
we have cut the <unk> out  right out !
for a long time we have said to almighty god , " thank you , sir , but we do not much like your game of life , so we <name> not play . " '
<unk> , ' said arnott defiantly , 'men live a century apiece on the average now . '
'oh , that is quite well !
i am <name>  you are <name>  we are all <name> and happy because we are so few and we live so long .
only i think almighty god he <name> remember what the planet was like in the time of crowds and the plague .
perhaps he <name> send us nerves .
eh , pirolo ? '
the italian blinked into space .
'perhaps , ' he said , 'he has sent them already .
anyhow , you can not argue with the planet .
she does not forget the old days , and  what can you do ? '
'for sure we ca n't <unk> the world . '
de forest glanced at the map flowing smoothly across the table from west to east .
'we ought to be over our ground by nine to-night .
there wo n't be much sleep afterwards . '
on which hint we dispersed , and i slept till takahira waked me for dinner .
our ancestors thought nine hours ' sleep ample for their little lives .
we , living thirty years longer , feel ourselves defrauded with less than eleven out of the twenty-four .
by ten o'clock we were over lake michigan .
the west shore was <unk> , except for a dull <unk> at chicago , and a single <unk> light  its leading beam pointing north  at <unk> on our starboard bow .
none of the lake villages gave any sign of life ; and inland , westward , so far as we could see , blackness lay unbroken on the level earth .
we swooped down and skimmed low across the dark , throwing calls county by county .
now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of a <unk> , or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played across the fields , but northern illinois as a whole was one inky , apparently uninhabited , waste of high , forced woods .
only our illuminated map , with its little pointer switching from county to county as we wheeled and twisted , gave us any idea of our position .
our calls , urgent , pleading , coaxing or commanding , through the general <unk> brought no answer . '
illinois strictly maintained her own privacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose .
'oh , this is absurd ! '
said de forest .
'we 're like an owl trying to work a <unk> .
is this bureau creek ?
let 's land , arnott , and get hold of some one . '
we brushed over a belt of forced woodland  <unk> <name> sixty feet high  grounded on a private <unk> , none too big , where we moored to our own <unk> , and hurried out through the warm dark night towards a light in a verandah .
as we neared the garden gate i could have sworn we had stepped knee-deep in quicksand , for we could scarcely drag our feet against the <unk> currents that clogged them .
after five paces we stopped , wiping our foreheads , as hopelessly stuck on dry smooth turf as so many cows in a bog .
<unk> ! '
cried pirolo angrily .
'we are <unk> .
and it is my own system of <unk> too !
i know the pull . '
'good evening , ' said a girl 's voice from the verandah .
'oh , i 'm sorry !
we 've locked up .
wait a minute . '
we heard the click of a switch , and almost fell forward as the currents round our knees were withdrawn .
the girl laughed , and laid aside her knitting .
an old-fashioned <unk> stood at her elbow , which she reversed from time to time , and we could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile away , behind the guardian woods .
'come in and sit down , ' she said .
'i 'm only playing a plough .
<unk> gone to chicago to  ah !
then it was your call i heard just now ! '
she had caught sight of arnott 's board uniform , leaped to the switch , and turned it full on .
we were checked , gasping , <unk> in current this time , three yards from the verandah .
'we only want to know what 's the matter with illinois , ' said de forest placidly .
'then had n't you better go to chicago and find out ? '
she answered .
'there 's nothing wrong here .
we own ourselves . '
'how can we go anywhere if you wo n't loose us ? '
de forest went on , while arnott scowled .
admirals of fleets are still quite human when their dignity is touched .
'stop a minute  you do n't know how funny you look ! '
she put her hands on her hips and laughed mercilessly .
'do n't worry about that , ' said arnott , and whistled .
a voice answered from the <name> pirolo in the meadow .
'only a <unk> <unk> ! '
arnott called .
<unk> it out gently , please . '
we heard the <name> of a breaking lamp ; a fuse blew out somewhere in the verandah roof , frightening a <unk> of birds .
the <unk> was open .
we stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles .
'how rude  how very rude of you ! '
the maiden cried .
<unk> , but we have n't time to look funny , ' said arnott .
'we 've got to go to chicago ; and if i were you , young <name> , i 'd go into the cellars for the next two hours , and take mother with me . '
off he strode , with us at his heels , muttering indignantly , till the humour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot of the <unk> ladder .
'the board has n't shown what you might call a fat spark on this occasion , ' said de forest , wiping his eyes .
'i <name> i did n't look as big a fool as you did , arnott !
hullo !
what on earth is that ?
dad coming home from chicago ? '
there was a rattle and a rush , and a <unk> cultivator , blades in air like so many teeth , trundled itself at us round the edge of the timber , fuming and <unk> furiously .
<unk> ! '
said arnott , as we bundled ourselves through the <unk> door .
'never mind about shutting it .
up ! '
the <name> pirolo lifted like a bubble , and the vicious machine shot just underneath us , clawing high as it passed .
'there 's a nice little <unk> for you ! '
said arnott , dusting his knees .
'we ask her a civil question .
first she <unk> us and then she plays a cultivator at us ! '
'and then we fly , ' said dragomiroff .
'if i were forty years more young , i would go back and kiss her .
ho !
ho ! '
'i , ' said pirolo , 'would smack her !
my pet ship has been chased by a dirty plough ; a  how do you say ?  agricultural implement . '
'oh , that is illinois all over , ' said de forest .
'they do n't content themselves with talking about privacy .
they arrange to have it .
and now , where 's your alleged fleet , arnott ?
we must assert ourselves against this wench . '
arnott pointed to the black heavens .
<unk> on  up there , ' said he .
'shall i give them the whole installation , sir ? '
'oh , i do n't think the young <name> is quite worth that , ' said de forest .
'get over chicago , and perhaps we 'll see something . '
in a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong block of <unk> in the centre of the little town .
'that looks like the old city hall .
yes , there 's <unk> 's statue in front of it , ' said takahira .
'but what on earth are they doing to the place ?
i thought they used it for a market nowadays !
drop a little , please . '
we could hear the <unk> and crackle of <unk> machines  the cheap western type which fuse stone and rubbish into <unk> ribbed glass for their rough country roads .
three or four <unk> worked on each side of a square of ruins .
the brick and stone wreckage crumbled , slid forward , and presently spread out into white-hot pools of sticky slag , which the <unk> smoothed more or less flat .
already a third of the big block had been so treated , and was cooling to dull red before our astonished eyes .
'it is the old market , ' said de forest .
'well , there 's nothing to prevent illinois from making a road through a market .
it doesn't interfere with traffic , that i can see . '
<unk> ! '
said arnott , gripping me by the shoulder .
'listen !
they're singing .
why on the earth are they singing ? '
we dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the edge of that glowing square .
at first they only roared against the roar of the <unk> and <unk> .
then the words came up clearly  the words of the forbidden song that all men knew , and none let pass their lips  poor <name> <unk> 's song , made in the days of the crowds and the plague  every silly word of it loaded to <unk> with the planet 's inherited memories of horror , panic , fear and cruelty .
and chicago  innocent , contented little chicago  was singing it aloud to the infernal tune that carried riot , pestilence and lunacy round our planet a few generations ago !
'once there was the people  terror gave it birth ; once there was the people , and it made a hell of earth ! '
( then the stamp and pause ) : <unk> arose and crushed it .
listen , oh , ye slain !
once there was the people  it shall never be again ! '
the <unk> thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed itself again , again and again , louder than the crash of the melting walls .
de forest frowned .
'i do n't like that , ' he said .
'they 've broken back to the old days !
they 'll be killing somebody soon .
i think we 'd better divert 'em , arnott . '
'ay , ay , sir . '
arnott 's hand went to his cap , and we heard the hull of the <name> pirolo ring to the command : <unk> !
both watches stand by !
lamps !
lamps !
lamps ! '
'keep still ! '
takahira whispered to me .
<unk> , please , quartermaster . '
'it 's all right  all right ! '
said pirolo from behind , and to my horror slipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap .
i could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes , but i stood in absolute darkness .
'to save the sight , ' he explained , and pushed me on to the <unk> <unk> .
'you <name> see in a minute . '
as he spoke i became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light , let down from heaven at an immense distance  one vertical <unk> of frozen lightning .
'those are our <unk> ships , ' said arnott at my elbow .
'that one is over <unk> .
look south  that other one 's over <unk> .
vincennes is behind us , and north yonder is winthrop woods .
the fleet 's in position , sir '  this to de forest .
'as soon as you give the word . '
'ah no !
no ! '
cried dragomiroff at my side .
i could feel the old man tremble .
'i do not know all that you can do , but be kind !
i ask you to be a little kind to them below !
this is horrible  horrible ! '
'when a woman kills a chicken , <unk> and empires <unk> , ' takahira quoted .
'it is too late to be gentle now . '
'then take off my helmet !
take off my helmet ! '
dragomiroff began hysterically .
pirolo must have put his arm round him .
<unk> , ' he said , 'i am here .
it is all right , <name> , my dear fellow . '
'i 'll just send our little girl in bureau county a warning , ' said arnott .
'she do n't deserve it , but we 'll allow her a minute or two to take mamma to the cellar . '
in the utter hush that followed the growling spark after arnott had linked up his service <unk> with the invisible fleet , we heard <unk> 's song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to position .
then i clapped my hand before my mask lenses , for it was as though the floor of heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable blaze of suns in the making was poured through the <unk> .
'you need n't count , ' said arnott .
i had had no thought of such a thing .
'there are two hundred and fifty keels up there , five miles apart .
full power , please , for another twelve seconds . '
the firmament , as far as eye could reach , stood on pillars of white fire .
one fell on the glowing square at chicago , and turned it black .
'oh !
oh !
oh !
can men be allowed to do such things ? '
dragomiroff cried , and fell across our knees .
<unk> of water , please , ' said takahira to a <unk> shape that leaped forward .
'he is a little faint . '
the lights switched off , and the darkness stunned like an avalanche .
we could hear dragomiroff 's teeth on the glass edge .
pirolo was comforting him .
'all right , all <unk> , ' he repeated .
'come and lie down .
come below and take off your mask .
i give you my word , old friend , it is all right .
they are my <unk> .
little <name> pirolo 's leetle lights .
you know me !
i do not hurt people . '
<unk> ! '
dragomiroff moaned .
'i have never seen death .
i have never seen the board take action .
shall we go down and burn them alive , or is that already done ? '
'oh , hush , ' said pirolo , and i think he rocked him in his arms .
'do we repeat , sir ? '
arnott asked de forest .
'give 'em a minute 's break , ' de forest replied .
'they may need it . '
we waited a minute , and then <unk> 's song , broken but defiant , rose from <unk> chicago .
'they seem fond of that tune , ' said de forest .
'i should let 'em have it , arnott . '
'very good , sir , ' said arnott , and felt his way to the <unk> keys .
no lights broke forth , but the hollow of the skies made herself the mouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the <name> .
men hear such sounds in delirium , advancing like tides from horizons beyond the ruled <unk> of space .
'that 's our <unk> , ' said arnott .
'we may be a bit ragged .
i've never conducted two hundred and fifty performers before . '
he pulled out the <unk> , and struck a full chord on the service <unk> .
the beams of light leaped down again , and danced , solemnly and awfully , a <unk> , sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each <unk> kick , while the darkness delivered itself  there is no scale to measure against that utterance  of the tune to which they kept time .
certain notes  one learnt to expect them with terror  cut through one 's marrow , but , after three minutes , thought and emotion passed in indescribable agony .
we saw , we heard , but i think we were in some sort <unk> .
the two hundred and fifty beams shifted , <unk> , <unk> and split , narrowed , widened , rippled in ribbons , broke into a thousand white-hot parallel lines , melted and revolved in <unk> rings like old-fashioned <unk> , flung up to the zenith , made as if to descend and renew the torment , halted at the last instant , <unk> <unk> round the horizon , and vanished , to bring back for the hundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed light over all illinois .
then the tune and lights ceased together , and we heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a rubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl .
'ah , that is my new siren , ' said pirolo .
'you can break an iceberg in half , if you find the proper pitch .
they <name> whistle by squadrons now .
it is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows . '
i had collapsed beside dragomiroff , broken and <unk> feebly , because i had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of judgment day , and the archangels of the resurrection were hailing me naked across the universe to the sound of the music of the spheres .
then i saw de forest smacking arnott 's helmet with his open hand .
the wailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us , and returned to her place above the lower clouds .
'i hate to interrupt a specialist when he 's enjoying himself , ' said de forest .
'but , as a matter of fact , all illinois has been asking us to stop for these last fifteen seconds . '
'what a pity . '
arnott slipped off his mask .
'i wanted you to hear us really hum .
our lower c can lift <unk> . '
'it is hell  hell ! '
cried dragomiroff , and sobbed aloud .
arnott looked away as he answered : 'it 's a few thousand <unk> ahead of the old <unk> game , but i should scarcely call it that .
what shall i tell the fleet , sir ? '
'tell 'em we 're very pleased and impressed .
i do n't think they need wait on any longer .
there is n't a spark left down there . '
de forest pointed .
'they 'll be deaf and blind . '
'oh , i think not , sir .
the demonstration lasted less than ten minutes . '
<unk> ! '
takahira sighed .
'i should have said it was half a night .
now , shall we go down and pick up the pieces ? '
'but first a small drink , ' said pirolo .
'the board must not arrive weeping at its own works . '
'i am an old fool  an old fool ! '
dragomiroff began piteously .
'i did not know what would happen .
it is all new to me .
we reason with them in little russia . '
chicago north <unk> was unlighted , and arnott worked his ship into the <unk> by her own lights .
as soon as these broke out we heard <unk> of horror and appeal from many people below .
'all right , ' shouted arnott into the darkness .
'we are n't beginning again ! '
we descended by the stairs , to find ourselves knee-deep in a <unk> crowd , some crying that they were blind , others beseeching us not to make any more noises , but the greater part writhing face downward , their hands or their caps before their eyes .
it was pirolo who came to our rescue .
he climbed the side of a <unk> , and there , gesticulating as though they could see , made oration to those afflicted people of illinois .
'you <unk> ! '
he began .
'there is nothing to fuss for .
of course , your eyes <name> smart and be red to-morrow .
you <name> look as if you and your wives had drunk too much , but in a little while you <name> see again as well as before .
i tell you this , and i  i am pirolo .
<name> pirolo ! '
the crowd with one accord shuddered , for many legends attach to <name> pirolo of <unk> , deep in the secrets of god .
<unk> ? '
an unsteady voice lifted itself .
'then tell us was there anything except light in those lights of yours just now ? '
the question was repeated from every corner of the darkness .
pirolo laughed .
'no ! '
he thundered .
( why have small men such large voices ? )
'i give you my word and the board 's word that there was nothing except light  just light !
you <unk> !
your <unk> is too low already as it is .
some day i must invent something to send it up , but send it down  never ! '
'is that true ?  we thought  somebody said  ' one could feel the tension relax all round .
'you too big fools , ' pirolo cried .
'you could have sent us a call and we would have told you . '
<unk> you a call ! '
a deep voice shouted .
'i wish you had been at our end of the wire . '
'i 'm glad i was n't , ' said de forest .
'it was bad enough from behind the lamps .
never mind !
it 's over now .
is there any one here i can talk business with ?
i 'm de forest  for the board . '
'you might begin with me , for one  i 'm mayor , ' the bass voice replied .
a big man rose unsteadily from the street , and staggered towards us where we sat on the broad <unk> , in front of the garden fences .
'i ought to be the first on my feet .
am i ? '
said he .
'yes , ' said de forest , and steadied him as he dropped down beside us .
<unk> , <name> .
is that you ? '
a voice called .
<unk> me , ' said the mayor ; 'that sounds like my chief of police , <unk> ! '
<unk> it is ; and here 's <unk> and <unk>  on their feet . '
<unk> 'em up please , <unk> .
we 're supposed to be the four in charge of this hamlet .
what we says , goes .
and , de forest , what do you say ? '
'nothing  yet , ' de forest answered , as we made room for the panting , reeling men .
<unk> cut out of system .
well ? '
'tell the steward to send down drinks , please , ' arnott whispered to an orderly at his side .
'good ! '
said the mayor , smacking his dry lips .
'now i suppose we can take it , de forest , that henceforward the board <name> administer us direct ? '
'not if the board can avoid it , ' de forest laughed .
'the <unk> .
is responsible for the <unk> traffic only . '
<unk> all that that implies . '
the big four who ran chicago chanted their magna <unk> like children at school .
'well , get on , ' said de forest wearily .
'what is your silly trouble anyway ? '
'too much dam ' democracy , ' said the mayor , laying his hand on de forest 's knee .
'so ?
i thought illinois had had her dose of that . '
'she has .
that 's why .
<unk> , what did you do with our prisoners last night ? '
<unk> 'em in the <unk> to prevent the women killing 'em , ' the chief of police replied .
'i 'm too blind to move just yet , but  ' <unk> , send some of your people , please , and fetch 'em along , ' said de forest .
'they 're <unk> , ' the mayor called .
'you 'll have to blow out three fuses . '
he turned to de forest , his large outline just visible in the paling darkness .
'i hate to throw any more work on the board .
i 'm an administrator myself , but we 've had a little fuss with our serviles .
what ?
in a big city there 's bound to be a few men and women who can't live without listening to themselves , and who prefer drinking out of pipes they do n't own both ends of .
they inhabit flats and hotels all the year round .
they say it saves 'em trouble .
anyway , it gives 'em more time to make trouble for their neighbours .
we call 'em serviles locally .
and they are apt to be <unk> . '
'just so ! '
said the man called <unk> .
transportation is civilisation .
democracy is disease .
i 've proved it by the <unk> , every time . '
<unk> 's our health officer , and a <unk> man , ' said the mayor , laughing .
'but it 's true that most serviles have n't much control .
they <name> talk ; and when people take to talking as a business , anything may arrive  may n't it , de forest ? '
<unk>  except the facts of the case , ' said de forest , laughing .
'i 'll give you those in a minute , ' said the mayor .
'our serviles got to talking  first in their houses and then on the streets , telling men and women how to manage their own affairs .
( you ca n't teach a servile not to finger his neighbour 's soul . )
that 's invasion of privacy , of course , but in chicago we 'll suffer anything sooner than make crowds .
nobody took much notice , and so i let 'em alone .
my fault !
i was warned there would be trouble , but there has n't been a crowd or murder in illinois for nineteen years . '
<unk> , ' said his chief of police .
<unk> .
anyway , we 'd forgot such things .
so , from talking in the houses and on the streets , our serviles go to calling a meeting at the old market yonder . '
he nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings heaved up grey in the <unk> behind the <unk> statue of the negro in flames .
'there 's nothing to prevent any one calling meetings except that it 's against human nature to stand in a crowd , besides being bad for the health .
i ought to have known by the way our men and women attended that first meeting that trouble was brewing .
there were as many as a thousand in the market-place , touching each other .
touching !
then the serviles turned in all <unk> and talked , and we  ' 'what did they talk about ? '
said takahira .
'first , how badly things were managed in the city .
that pleased us four  we were on the platform  because we hoped to catch one or two good men for city work .
you know how rare executive capacity is .
even if we did n't it 's  it 's refreshing to find any one interested enough in our job to damn our eyes .
you do n't know what it means to work , year in , year out , without a spark of difference with a living soul . '
'oh , do n't we ! '
said de forest .
'there are times on the board when we'd give our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things themselves . '
'but they wo n't , ' said the mayor ruefully .
'i assure you , sir , we four have done things in chicago , in the <name> of rousing people , that would have discredited nero .
but what do they say ?
" very good , <name> .
have it your own way .
anything 's better than a crowd .
i 'll go back to my land . "
you can't do anything with folk who can go where they please , and do n't want anything on god 's earth except their own way .
there is n't a kick or a <unk> left on the planet . '
'then i suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself ? '
said de forest .
we could see the bare and still smoking ruins , and hear the <unk> crackle as they hardened and set .
'oh , that 's only amusement .
'tell you later .
as i was saying , our serviles held the meeting , and pretty soon we had to <unk> the platform to save 'em from being killed .
and that did n't make our people any more pacific . '
'how d'you mean ? '
i ventured to ask .
'if you 've ever been <unk> , ' said the mayor , 'you 'll know it do n't improve any man 's temper to be held up straining against nothing .
no , sir !
eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies in <unk> for two hours , while a pack of perfectly safe serviles <unk> their mental and spiritual privacy , may be amusing to watch , but they are not pleasant to handle afterwards . '
pirolo chuckled .
'our folk own themselves .
they were of opinion things were going too far and too fiery .
i warned the serviles ; but they 're born <unk> .
unless a fact hits 'em on the head they can not see it .
would you believe me , they went on to talk of what they called " popular government " ?
they did !
they wanted us to go back to the old <unk> of voting with papers and wooden boxes , and <unk> people and printed <unk> , and <unk> !
they said they practised it among themselves about what they 'd have to eat in their flats and hotels .
yes , sir !
they stood up behind <unk> 's doubled <unk> , and they said that , in this present year of <name> , to <unk> men and women , on that very spot !
then they finished '  he lowered his voice cautiously  'by talking about " the people . "
and then <unk> he had to sit up all night in charge of the <unk> because he could n't trust his men to keep 'em shut . '
'it was trying 'em too high , ' the chief of police broke in .
'but we could n't hold the crowd <unk> for ever .
i gathered in all the serviles on charge of <unk> , and put 'em in the <unk> , and then i let things cut loose .
i had to !
the district lit like a <unk> <unk> ! '
'the news was out over seven degrees of country , ' the mayor continued ; 'and when once it 's a question of invasion of privacy , good-bye to right and reason in illinois !
they began turning out <unk> and locking up <unk> on thursday night .
friday , they stopped all traffic and asked for the board to take over .
then they wanted to clean chicago off the side of the lake and rebuild elsewhere  just for a souvenir of " the people " that the serviles talked about .
i suggested that they should slag the old market where the meeting was held , while i turned in a call to you all on the board .
that kept 'em quiet till you came along .
and  and now you can take hold of the situation . '
'any chance of their <unk> down ? '
de forest asked .
'you can try , ' said the mayor .
de forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving crowd that had edged in towards us .
day was come .
'do n't you think this business can be arranged ? '
he began .
but there was a roar of angry voices : 'we 've finished with crowds !
we are n't going back to the old days !
take us over !
take the serviles away !
administer direct or we 'll kill 'em !
down with the people ! '
an attempt was made to begin <unk> 's song .
it got no further than the first line , for the <name> pirolo sent down a warning drone on one stopped horn .
a wrecked <unk> of the old market tottered and fell inwards on the <unk> .
none spoke or moved till the last of the dust had settled down again , turning the steel case of salad 's statue ashy grey .
'you see you 'll just have to take us over , ' the mayor whispered .
de forest shrugged his shoulders .
'you talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like so much <unk> .
ca n't you manage yourselves on any terms ? '
he said .
'we can , if you say so .
it <name> only cost those few lives to begin with , ' the mayor pointed across the square , where arnott 's men guided a stumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and halted them under the statue .
'now i think , ' said takahira under his breath , 'there <name> be trouble . '
the mass in front of us growled like beasts .
at that moment the sun rose clear , and revealed the blinking assembly to itself .
as soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of horror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the <unk> flaws shot across the lake outside .
nothing was said , and , being half blind , of course it moved slowly .
yet in less than fifteen minutes most of that vast multitude  three thousand at the lowest count  melted away like frost on south eaves .
the remnant stretched themselves on the grass , where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd .
'these mean business , ' the mayor whispered to takahira .
'there are a <unk> few women there who 've borne children .
i do n't like it . '
the morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise of a hot day ; the sun reflected itself <unk> on the <unk> covering of <unk> 's statue ; cocks crew in the gardens , and we could hear <unk> clicking in the distance as people <unk> <unk> their homes .
'i 'm afraid there wo n't be any morning <unk> , ' said de forest .
'we rather upset things in the country last night . '
'that makes no odds , ' the mayor returned .
'we 're all <unk> for six months .
we take no chances . '
nor , when you come to think of it , does any one else .
it must be three-quarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food <unk> .
yet is there house or city on the planet to-day that has not half a year 's provisions laid in ?
we are like the shipwrecked seamen in the old books , who , having once nearly starved to death , ever afterwards hide away bits of food and biscuit .
truly we trust no crowds , nor system based on crowds !
de forest waited till the last footstep had died away .
meantime the prisoners at the base of the statue shuffled , <unk> , and fidgeted , with the <unk> of quite little children .
none of them were more than six feet high , and many of them were as <unk> as the ravaged , harassed heads of old pictures .
they huddled together in actual touch , while the crowd , <unk> at large intervals , looked at them with <unk> eyes .
suddenly a man among them began to talk .
the mayor had not in the least exaggerated .
it appeared that our planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the heel of the <unk> board of control .
the orator urged us to arise in our might , burst our prison doors and break our fetters ( all his metaphors , by the way , were of the most <unk> ) .
next he demanded that every matter of daily life , including most of the physical functions , should be submitted for decision at any time of the week , month , or year to , i gathered , anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a certain radius , and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns to settle the matter , first by <unk> , next by talking to the crowds made , and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper , which rubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and oaths .
out of this amazing play , he assured us , would automatically arise a higher , nobler , and kinder world , based  he demonstrated this with the awful <unk> of the insane  based on the sanctity of the crowd and the villainy of the single person .
in conclusion , he called loudly upon god to testify to his personal merits and integrity .
when the flow ceased , i turned bewildered to takahira , who was nodding solemnly .
<unk> correct , ' said he .
'it is all in the old books .
he has left nothing out , not even the <unk> . '
'but i do n't see how this stuff can upset a child , much less a district , ' i replied .
'ah , you are too young , ' said dragomiroff .
'for another thing , you are not a mamma .
please look at the <unk> . '
ten or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the silent men , and were drawing in towards the prisoners .
it reminded one of the stealthy encircling , before the rush in at the quarry , of wolves round <unk> in the north .
the prisoners saw , and <name> together more closely .
the mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant .
de forest , bareheaded , stepped forward between the prisoners , and the slowly , stiffly moving line .
'that 's all very interesting , ' he said to the <unk> orator .
'but the point seems that you 've been making crowds and invading privacy . '
a woman stepped forward , and would have spoken , but there was a quick <unk> murmur from the men , who realised that de forest was trying to pull the situation down to <unk> .
'yes !
yes ! '
they cried .
'we cut out because they made crowds and invaded privacy !
stick to that !
keep on that switch !
lift the serviles out of this !
the board 's in charge !
hsh ! '
'yes , the board 's in charge , ' said de forest .
'i 'll take formal evidence of <unk> if you like , but the members of the board can testify to it .
<name> that do ? '
the women had closed in another pace , with hands that clenched and <unk> at their sides .
'good !
good enough ! '
the men cried .
'we 're content .
only take them away quickly . '
'come along up ! '
said de forest to the captives , <unk> is quite ready . '
it appeared , however , that they did not wish to go .
they intended to remain in chicago and make crowds .
they pointed out that de <unk> proposal was gross invasion of privacy .
'my dear fellow , ' said pirolo to the most <unk> of the leaders , 'you hurry , or your crowd that ca n't be wrong <name> kill you ! '
'but that would be murder , ' answered the believer in crowds ; and there was a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis had broken .
a woman stepped forward from the line of women , laughing , i protest , as merrily as any of the company .
one hand , of course , shaded her eyes , the other was at her throat .
'oh , they need n't be afraid of being killed ! '
she called .
'not in the least , ' said de forest .
'but do n't you think that , now the board 's in charge , you might go home while we get these people away ? '
'i shall be home long before that .
it  it has been rather a trying day . '
she stood up to her full height , <unk> even de <unk> <unk> , and smiled , with eyes closed against the fierce light .
'yes , rather , ' said de forest .
'i 'm afraid you feel the glare a little .
we 'll have the ship down . '
he motioned to the pirolo to drop between us and the sun , and at the same time to <unk> the prisoners , who were a trifle unsteady .
we saw them stiffen to the current where they stood .
the woman 's voice went on , sweet and deep and unshaken : 'i do n't suppose you men realise how much this  this sort of thing means to a woman .
i 've borne three .
we women do n't want our children given to crowds .
it must be an inherited instinct .
crowds make trouble .
they bring back the old days .
hate , fear , blackmail , publicity , " the people "  that !
that !
that ! '
she pointed to the statue , and the crowd growled once more .
'yes , if they are allowed to go on , ' said de forest .
'but this little affair  ' 'it means so much to us women that this  this little affair should never happen again .
of course , never 's a big word , but one feels so strongly that it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning .
those creatures '  she pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like seaweed in a <unk> as the circuit pulled them  'those people have friends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere .
one doesn't want anything done to them , you know .
it 's terrible to force a human being out of fifty or sixty years of good life .
i 'm only forty myself .
i know .
but , at the same time , one feels that an example should be made , because no price is too heavy to pay if  if these people and all that they imply can be put an end to .
do you quite understand , or would you be kind enough to tell your men to take the <unk> off the statue ?
it 's worth looking at . '
'i understand perfectly .
but i do n't think anybody here wants to see the statue on an empty stomach .
excuse me one moment . '
de forest called up to the ship , 'a flying loop ready on the port side , if you please . '
then to the woman he said with some <unk> , 'you might leave us a little discretion in the matter . '
'oh , of course .
thank you for being so patient .
i know my arguments are silly , but  ' she half turned away and went on in a changed voice , 'perhaps this <name> help you to decide . '
she threw out her right arm with a knife in it .
before the blade could be returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip , <unk> as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above , and fell flashing in the <name> at the foot of the statue fifty yards away .
the <unk> arm was arrested , rigid as a bar for an instant , till the releasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side .
the other women shrank back silent among the men .
pirolo rubbed his hands , and takahira nodded .
'that was clever of you , de forest , ' said he .
'what a glorious pose ! '
dragomiroff murmured , for the frightened woman was on the edge of tears .
'why did you stop me ?
i would have done it ! '
she cried .
'i have no doubt you would , ' said de forest .
'but we ca n't waste a life like yours on these people .
i <name> the arrest did n't sprain your wrist ; it 's so hard to regulate a flying loop .
but i think you are quite right about those persons ' women and children .
we 'll take them all away with us if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself . '
'i promise  i promise . '
she controlled herself with an effort .
'but it is so important to us women .
we know what it means ; and i thought if you saw i was in <name>  ' 'i saw you were , and you 've gained your point .
i shall take all your serviles away with me at once .
the mayor <name> make lists of their friends and families in the city and the district , and he 'll ship them after us this afternoon . '
'sure , ' said the mayor , rising to his feet .
<unk> , if you can see , had n't you better finish <unk> off the old market ?
it do n't look <unk> the way it is now , and we <name> n't use it for crowds any more . '
'i think you had better wipe out that statue as well , mr. mayor , ' said de forest .
'i do n't question its merits as a work of <name> , but i believe it 's a shade morbid . '
'certainly , sir .
oh , <unk> !
slag the nigger before you go on to fuse the market .
i 'll get to the <unk> and tell the district that the board is in charge .
are you making any special appointments , sir ? '
'none .
we have n't men to waste on these <unk> .
<name> on as before , but under the board .
arnott , run your serviles aboard , please .
ground ship and pass them through the <unk> .
we 'll wait till we've finished with this work of <name> . '
the prisoners trailed past him , talking fluently , but unable to <unk> in the drag of the current .
then the <unk> rolled up , two on each side of the statue .
with one accord the spectators looked elsewhere , but there was no need .
<unk> turned on full power , and the thing simply melted within its case .
all i saw was a surge of white-hot metal pouring over the <unk> , a glimpse of salad 's inscription , 'to the eternal memory of the justice of the people , ' ere the stone base itself cracked and powdered into finest lime .
the crowd cheered .
'thank you , ' said de forest ; 'but we want our <unk> , and i expect you do too .
good-bye , mr. mayor !
delighted to see you at any time , but i <name> i <name> n't have to , officially , for the next thirty years .
good-bye , madam .
yes .
we 're all given to nerves nowadays .
i suffer from them myself .
good-bye , gentlemen all !
you 're under the <unk> heel of the board from this moment , but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters you 've only to let us know .
this is no treat to us .
good luck ! '
we embarked amid shouts , and did not check our lift till they had dwindled into whispers .
then de forest flung himself on the <unk> <unk> and mopped his forehead .
'i do n't mind men , ' he panted , 'but women are the devil ! '
<unk> the devil , ' said pirolo cheerfully .
'that one would have <unk> . '
'i know it .
that was why i signalled for the flying loop to be clapped on her .
i owe you an apology for that , arnott .
i had n't time to catch your eye , and you were busy with our <unk> .
by the way , who actually answered my signal ?
it was a smart piece of work . '
<unk> , ' said arnott ; 'but he <unk> the wave .
it may be pretty <unk> to knock a knife out of a <name> 's hand , but did n't you notice how she rubbed 'em ?
he scorched her fingers .
slovenly , i call it . '
<unk> be it from me to interfere with fleet discipline , but do n't be too hard on the boy .
if that woman had killed herself they would have killed every servile and everything related to a servile throughout the district by nightfall . '
'that was what she was playing for , ' takahira said .
'and with our fleet gone we could have done nothing to hold them . '
'i may be ass enough to walk into a <unk> , ' said arnott , 'but i do n't dismiss my fleet till i 'm reasonably sure that trouble is over .
they 're in position still , and i intend to keep 'em there till the serviles are shipped out of the district .
that last little crowd meant murder , my friends . '
<unk> !
all nerves ! '
said pirolo .
'you can not argue with <unk> . '
'and it is not as if they had seen much dead  or is it ? '
said takahira .
'in all my ninety years i have never seen death . '
dragomiroff spoke as one who would excuse himself .
'perhaps that was why  last night  ' then it came out as we sat over breakfast , that , with the exception of arnott and pirolo , none of us had ever seen a corpse , or knew in what manner the spirit passes .
'we 're a nice lot to flap about governing the planet , ' de forest laughed .
'i confess , now it 's all over , that my main fear was i <unk> be able to pull it off without losing a life . '
'i thought of that too , ' said arnott ; 'but there 's no death reported , and i 've inquired everywhere .
what are we supposed to do with our passengers ?
i 've fed 'em . '
'we 're between two <unk> , ' de forest drawled .
'if we drop them in any place that is n't under the board the natives <name> make their presence an excuse for cutting out , same as illinois did , and forcing the board to take over .
if we drop them in any place under the board 's control they 'll be killed as soon as our backs are turned . '
'if you say so , ' said pirolo thoughtfully , 'i can guarantee that they <name> become extinct in process of time , quite happily .
what is their <unk> now ? '
'go down and ask 'em , ' said de forest .
'i think they might become nervous and tear me to bits , ' the philosopher of <unk> replied .
'not really ?
well ? '
<unk> the <unk> , ' said takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb .
<unk>  after all the trouble we 've taken to save 'em , ' said de forest .
<unk> london , ' arnott suggested .
'you could turn satan himself loose there , and they 'd only ask him to dinner . '
'good man !
you 've given me an idea .
<name> !
oh , <name> ! '
he threw the general <unk> open so that we could all hear , and in a few minutes the <unk> filled with the <name> , <unk> voice of leopold <name> , who has <unk> all london her choicest amusements for the last thirty years .
we answered with expectant grins , as though we were actually in the stalls of , say , the combination on a first night .
'we 've picked up something in your line , ' de forest began .
'that 's good , dear man .
if it 's old enough .
there 's nothing to beat the old things for business purposes .
have you seen london , chatham , and dover at <name> 's court ?
no ?
i thought i missed you there .
immense !
i've had the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the iron rails cast specially by hand .
cloth cushions in the carriages , too !
immense !
and paper railway tickets .
and <name> <name> . '
<unk> <name> back again ! '
said arnott rapturously .
<unk> me two stalls for to-morrow night .
what 's she singing now , bless her ? '
'the old songs .
nothing comes up to the old touch .
listen to this , dear men . '
<name> <unk> with flourishes : oh , cruel lamps of london , if tears your light could drown , your victims ' eyes would weep them , oh , lights of london town !
'then they weep . '
'you see ? '
pirolo waved his hands at us .
'the old world always <unk> when it saw crowds together .
it did not know why , but it <unk> .
we know why , but we do not weep , except when we pay to be made to by fat , wicked old <name> . '
'old , yourself ! '
<name> laughed .
'i 'm a public benefactor , i keep the world soft and united . '
'and i 'm de forest of the board , ' said de forest <unk> , <unk> to get a little business done .
as i was saying , i 've picked up a few people in chicago . '
'i cut out .
chicago is  ' 'do listen !
they 're perfectly unique . '
'do they build houses of baked <unk> while you wait  eh ?
that 's an old contact . '
'they 're an untouched primitive community , with all the old ideas . '
<unk> and <unk> ?
cooking on <unk> stoves , lighting pipes with matches , and driving horses ?
<unk> tried that last year .
an absolute blow-out ! '
de forest plugged him wrathfully , and poured out the story of our doings for the last twenty-four hours on the <unk> .
'and they do it all in public , ' he concluded .
'you ca n't stop 'em .
the more public , the better they are pleased .
they 'll talk for hours  like you !
now you can come in again ! '
'do you really mean they know how to vote ? '
said <name> .
'can they act it ? '
<unk> ?
it 's their life to 'em !
and you never saw such faces !
scarred like volcanoes .
envy , hatred , and malice in plain sight .
wonderfully flexible voices .
they weep , too . '
<unk> ?
in public ? '
'i guarantee .
not a spark of shame or <unk> in the entire installation .
it 's the chance of your career . '
'd'you say you 've brought their voting props along  those papers and <unk> things ? '
'no , confound you !
i 'm not a <unk> .
apply direct to the mayor of chicago .
he 'll forward you everything .
well ? '
'wait a minute .
did chicago want to kill 'em ?
that 'ud look well on the <unk> . '
'yes !
they were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mob  if you know what that is . '
'but i do n't , ' answered the great <name> simply .
'well then , they 'll tell you themselves .
they can make speeches hours long . '
'how many are there ? '
'by the time we ship 'em all over they 'll be perhaps a hundred , counting children .
an old world in miniature .
ca n't you see it ? '
<unk> ; but i 've got to pay for it if it 's a blow-out , dear man . '
'they can sing the old war songs in the streets .
they can get <unk> , and make crowds , and invade privacy in the genuine old-fashioned way ; and they 'll do the voting trick as often as you ask 'em a question . '
'too good ! '
said <name> .
'you <unk> jew !
i 've got a dozen head aboard here .
i 'll put you through direct .
sample 'em yourself . '
he lifted the switch and we listened .
our passengers on the lower deck at once , but not less than five at a time , explained themselves to <name> .
they had been taken from the bosom of their families , stripped of their possessions , given food without <unk> , and cast into captivity in a <unk> dungeon .
'but look here , ' said arnott aghast ; 'they 're saying what is n't true .
my lower deck is n't <unk> , and i saw to the <unk> myself . '
'my people talk like that sometimes in little russia , ' said dragomiroff .
'we reason with them .
we never kill .
no ! '
'but it 's not true , ' arnott insisted .
'what can you do with people who do n't tell facts ?
they 're mad ! '
<unk> ! '
said pirolo , his hand to his ear .
'it is such a little time since all the planet told lies . '
we heard <name> <unk> sympathetic .
would they , he asked , repeat their assertions in public  before a vast public ?
only let <name> give them a chance , and the planet , they vowed , should ring with their wrongs .
their aim in life  two women and a man explained it together  was to reform the world .
oddly enough , this also had been <name> 's <unk> .
he offered them an arena in which to explain , and by their living example to raise the planet to loftier levels .
he was eloquent on the moral uplift of a simple , <unk> life presented in its <unk> to a <unk> civilisation .
could they  would they  for three months certain , devote themselves under his auspices , as missionaries , to the elevation of mankind at a place called <name> 's court , which he said , with some truth , was one of the intellectual centres of the planet ?
they thanked him , and demanded ( we could hear his chuckle of delight ) time to discuss and to vote on the matter .
the vote , solemnly managed by counting heads  one head , one vote  was favourable .
his offer , therefore , was accepted , and they moved a vote of thanks to him in two speeches  one by what they called the <unk> ' and the other by the <unk> . '
<name> threw over to us , his voice shaking with gratitude : 'i 've got 'em !
did you hear those speeches ?
that 's nature , dear men .
<name> ca n't teach <unk> and they voted as easily as lying .
i 've never had a <unk> of natural liars before .
bless you , dear men !
remember , you 're on my free lists for ever , anywhere  all of you .
oh , <unk> <name> be sick  sick ! '
'then you think they 'll do ? '
said de forest .
'do ?
the little village 'll go crazy !
i 'll knock up a series of <unk> plays for 'em .
their voices <name> make you laugh and cry .
my god , dear men , where do you suppose they picked up all their misery from , on this sweet earth ?
i 'll have a pageant of the world 's beginnings , and <unk> shall do the music .
i 'll  ' 'go and knock up a village for 'em by to-night .
we 'll meet you at no .
15 west landing tower , ' said de forest .
'remember the rest <name> be coming along to-morrow . '
'let 'em all come ! '
said <name> .
'you do n't know how hard it is nowadays even for me , to find something that really gets under the public 's damned <unk> hide .
but i 've got it at last .
good-bye ! '
'well , ' said de forest when we had finished laughing , 'if any one understood corruption in london i might have played off <name> against <unk> , and sold my captives at enormous prices .
as it is , i shall have to be their legal adviser to-night when the contracts are signed .
and they wo n't exactly press any commission on me , either . '
<unk> , ' said takahira , 'we can not , of course , confine members of leopold <name> 's <unk> company .
chairs for the ladies , please , arnott . '
'then i go to bed , ' said de forest .
'i ca n't face any more women ! '
and he vanished .
when our passengers were released and given another meal ( <unk> came first this time ) they told us what they thought of us and the board ; and , like <name> , we all marvelled how they had contrived to extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out of the good life god gives us .
they raged , they stormed , they <unk> , flushed and exhausted their poor , torn nerves , panted themselves into silence , and renewed the senseless , shameless attacks .
'but ca n't you understand , ' said pirolo pathetically to a shrieking woman , 'that if we 'd left you in chicago you 'd have been killed ? '
'no , we should n't .
you were bound to save us from being murdered . '
'then we should have had to kill a lot of other people . '
'that does n't matter .
we were preaching the truth .
you ca n't stop us .
we shall go on preaching in london ; and then you 'll see ! '
'you can see now , ' said pirolo , and opened a lower shutter .
we were closing on the little village , with her three million people spread out at ease inside her ring of <unk> <unk> lights  those eight fixed beams at chatham , <unk> , <unk> , dorking , <unk> , st. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
leopold <name> 's new company looked , with small pale faces , at the silence , the size , and the separated houses .
then some began to weep aloud , shamelessly  always without shame .
<unk> 's song whether the state can loose and bind in heaven as well as on earth : if it be wiser to kill mankind before or after the birth  these are matters of high concern where <unk> <unk> are ; but holy state ( we have lived to learn ) <unk> in holy war .
whether the people be led by the lord , or lured by the loudest throat : if it be quicker to die by the sword or cheaper to die by vote  these are the things we have dealt with once , ( and they <name> not rise from their grave ) for holy people , however it runs , <unk> in wholly slave .
whatsoever , for any cause , <unk> to take or give , power above or beyond the laws , suffer it not to live !
holy state or holy king  or holy people 's <name>  have no truck with the senseless thing .
order the guns and kill !
saying  after  me :   once there was the people  terror gave it birth ; once there was the people and it made a hell of earth .
earth arose and crushed it .
listen , o ye slain !
once there was the people  it shall never be again !  friendly <name> ( march 1914 ) the valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a <unk> length across a field .
every blade , twig , <unk> , and <unk> carried water , and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches and <unk> , all delivering to the <name> below .
a week 's november rain on <unk> land had gorged her to full flood , and she proclaimed it aloud .
two men in sackcloth aprons were considering an <unk> hedge that ran down the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those <unk> .
they stood back and took stock of the neglected growth , tapped an elbow of <unk> here , a <unk> <unk> there , swayed a <unk> ash back and forth , and looked at each other .
'i reckon she 's about two <name> thick , ' said jabez the younger , 'an ' she has n't felt iron since  when has she , <name> ? '
'call it twenty-five year , jabez , an ' you wo n't be far out . '
<unk> ! '
jabez rubbed his wet <unk> on his <unk> <unk> .
'she ai n't a hedge .
she 's all manner o ' trees .
we 'll just about have to  ' he paused , as professional etiquette required .
'just about have to side her up an ' see what she 'll bear .
but had n't we best  ? '
<name> paused in his turn , both men being artists and equals .
'get some kind o ' line to go by . '
jabez ranged up and down till he found a thinner place , and with clean <unk> of the <unk> revealed the original face of the fence .
<name> took over the dripping stuff as it fell forward , and , with a grasp and a kick , made it to lie orderly on the bank till it should be <unk> .
by noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a <unk> barrier , tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred <name> which no woodman touches without orders .
'now we 've a <unk> to go by ! '
said <name> at last .
'she wo n't be as easy as this all along , ' jabez answered .
'she 'll need plenty stakes and <unk> when we come to the <name> . '
'well , ai n't we plenty ? '
<name> pointed to the ragged perspective ahead of them that plunged downhill into the fog .
'i lay there 's a cord an ' a half o ' firewood , let alone <unk> , 'fore we get anywheres <unk> the <name> . '
'the <name> 's got up a piece since morning , ' said jabez .
<unk> <unk> if she was over <unk> 's <unk> . '
<name> listened , too .
there was a growl in the <name> 's roar as though she worried something hard .
'yes .
she 's over <unk> 's <unk> , ' he replied .
'now she 'll flood acrost <unk> bay an ' that 'll ease her . '
'she wo n't ease <name> <unk> 's hay none if she do , ' jabez grunted .
'i told <name> he 'd set that liddle <unk> o ' his too low down in the <unk> .
i told him so when he was <unk> ' the bottom for it . '
'i told him so , too , ' said <name> .
'i told him 'fore ever you did .
i told him when the county council tarred the roads up along . '
he pointed uphill , where unseen automobiles and <unk> <unk> past continually .
'a tarred road , she shoots every drop o ' water into a valley same 's a slate roof .
't is n't as 't was in the old days , when the waters soaked in and soaked out in the way o ' nature .
it <unk> off they tarred roads all of a lump , and naturally every drop is bound to descend into the valley .
and there 's tar roads both two sides this valley for ten mile .
that 's what i told <name> <unk> when they tarred the roads last year .
but he 's a <unk> .
he do n't hardly ever journey uphill . '
'what did he say when you told him that ? '
jabez demanded , with a little change of voice .
'why ?
what did he say to you when you told him ? '
was the answer .
'what he said to you , i reckon , <name> . '
'then , you do n't need me to say it over again , jabez . '
'well , let be how 'twill , what was he gettin ' after when he said what he said to me ? '
jabez insisted .
'i dunno ; unless you tell me what manner o ' words he said to you . '
jabez <name> back from the hedge  all hedges are nests of treachery and <unk>  and moved to an open <unk> in the centre of the field .
'no need to go <unk> ' around , ' said <name> .
'none ca n't see us here 'fore we see them . '
'what was <name> <unk> gettin ' at when i said he 'd set his stack too near <unk> the <name> ? '
jabez dropped his voice .
'he was in his mind . '
'he ai n't never been out of it yet to my knowledge , ' <name> drawled , and <unk> his <unk> .
'but then <name> says : " i ai n't goin ' to shift my stack a yard , " he says .
" the <name> 's been good friends to me , and if she be minded , " he says , " to take a snatch at my hay , i ai n't settin ' out to withstand her . "
that 's what <name> <unk> says to me last  last <unk> 't was , ' said jabez .
<unk> he has n't shifted his stack , neither , ' <name> replied .
'an ' if there 's more rain , the <name> she 'll shift it for him . '
'no need tell me !
but i want to know what <name> was gettin ' at ? '
jabez opened his <unk> very deliberately ; <name> as carefully opened his .
they unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners , coiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages , and sat down on the edge of the lodge manger .
the rain began to fall again through the fog , and the <name> 's voice rose .
* * * * * 'but i always allowed <name> was his lawful child , like , ' said jabez , after <name> had spoken for a while .
<unk> n't so ... . <name> <unk> 's woman she never made nothing .
she come out o ' lewes with her <unk> 's round her heels , an ' she never made nor mended aught till she died .
he had to light fire an ' get breakfast every mornin ' except sundays , while she sowed it abed .
then she took an' died , sixteen , seventeen , year back ; but she never had no <unk> . '
'they was <unk> , ' said jabez apologetically .
'i 'd no call to go in among 'em , but i always allowed <name>  ' 'no .
<name> come out o ' one o ' those lunnon <unk> societies .
after his woman died , <name> got his mother back from his sister over to <unk> , which she 'd gone to house with when <name> married .
his mother kept house for <name> after his woman died .
they do say 't was his mother led him on toward <unk> ' of <name>  to furnish out the house with a child , like , and to keep him off of gettin ' a noo woman .
he mostly done what his mother contrived .
<unk> , <unk> 'em , they asked for a child from one o ' those lunnon societies  same as it might <name> ' been these <unk> children  an ' <name> was sent down to 'em , in a <unk> , i 've heard . '
'then <name> is <unk> .
i never knowed that , ' said jabez .
<unk> i must <name> ' heard it some time or other ... ' 'no .
she ai n't .
'twould <name> ' been better for some folk if she had been .
she come to <name> in a <unk> with all the proper papers  lawful child o ' some couple in lunnon somewheres  mother dead , father drinkin ' .
and there was that lunnon society 's five shillin 's a week for her .
<name> 's mother she would n't despise week-end money , but i never heard <name> was much of a <unk> .
let be how 'twill , they two <unk> up <name> no bounds , till it looked at last like they 'd forgot she was n't their own flesh an ' blood .
yes , i reckon they forgot <name> was n't <unk> by rights . '
'that 's no new thing , ' said jabez .
'there 's more'n one or two in this parish would n't surrender back their <unk> .
you ask <name> copley an' his woman an ' that <unk> <unk> o ' theirs . '
'maybe they need the five shillin ' , ' <name> suggested .
'it 's handy , ' said jabez .
'but the child 's more .
" <unk> " he says , an' " <unk> " he says , with his great rollin ' <unk> all <unk> up in that iron collar .
he wo n't live long  his backbone 's rotten , like .
but they <unk> do just about set store by him  five <name> or no five <name> . '
<unk> way with <name> an ' his mother , ' <name> went on .
'there was talk betwixt 'em after a few years o ' not takin ' any more week-end money for <name> ; but let alone she never passed a <unk> in the mire 'thout <unk> 's , <name> did n't care , like , to push himself forward into the society 's remembrance .
so <unk> came of it .
the week-end money would ha' made no odds to <name>  not after his uncle willed him they four cottages at <unk> an' money in the bank . '
'that was true , too , then ?
i heard something in a <unk> <unk> way , ' said jabez .
'i 'll answer for the house property , because <name> he requested my signed name at the foot o ' some papers <unk> ' it .
<unk> ' the money in the bank , he <unk> would n't like such things talked about all round the parish , so he took strangers for witnesses . '
'then 'twill make <name> worth <unk> ' after ? '
'she 'll need it .
her maker ai n't done much for her outside nor yet in . '
'that ai n't no odds . '
jabez shook his head till the water showered off his <unk> .
'if <name> has money , she 'll be wed before any likely pore maid .
she 's cause to be grateful to <name> . '
'she hides it middlin ' close , then , ' said <name> .
'it do n't sometimes look to me as if <name> has her natural rightful feelin 's .
she do n't put on an apron o ' <unk> 'thout being <unk> to it  in the kitchen or the hen-house .
she 's <unk> ' to be a school-teacher .
she 'll make a beauty !
i never knowed her show any sort o ' kindness to nobody  not even when <name> 's mother was took dumb .
no !
<unk> n't no stroke .
it stifled the old <name> in the throat here .
first she could n't shape her words no shape ; then she <unk> , like , an ' lastly she could n't more than suck down <unk> an ' hold her peace .
<name> took her to doctor <unk> , an' <unk> he bundled her off to brighton hospital on a ticket , but they could n't make no stay to her <unk> there ; and she was bundled off to lunnon , an ' they lit a great old lamp inside her , and <name> told me they could n't make out nothing in no sort there ; and , along o ' one thing an ' another , an ' all their <unk> 's and <unk> 's , she come back a hem sight worse than when she started .
<name> said he 'd have no more <unk> ' , so he give her a slate , which she tied to her <unk> , and what she was minded to say she writ on it . '
'now , i never knowed that !
but they 're <unk> , ' jabez repeated .
<unk> n't particular noticeable , for she was n't a talkin ' woman any time o ' her days .
<name> had all three 's tongue ... . well , then , two years this summer , come what i 'm tellin ' you .
<name> 's lunnon father , which they'd put clean out o ' their minds , arrived down from lunnon with the law on his side , sayin ' he 'd take his daughter back to lunnon , after all .
i was working for mus ' <unk> at pounds farm that summer , but i was <unk> <name> that evenin ' <unk> ' out his <unk> .
i seed a stranger come <unk> ' over the bridge agin ' <unk> 's <unk> .
<unk> n't the new county council bridge with the <unk> .
they had n't given it in for a public right o ' way then .
't was just a bit o ' <unk> old plank which <name> had throwed acrost the <name> for his own conveniences .
the man was n't drunk  only a little concerned in liquor , like  an ' his back was a mask where he 'd slipped in the muck comin ' along .
he went up the bricks past <name> 's mother , which was <unk> ' the ducks , an ' set himself down at the table inside  <name> was just changin ' his socks  an ' the man let <name> know all his rights and aims <unk> ' <name> .
then there just about was a <unk> ?
<name> 's fust mind was to pitch him forth , but he 'd done that once in his young days , and got six months up to lewes jail along o ' the man fallin ' on his head .
so he swallowed his <unk> an ' let him talk .
the law about <name> was on the man 's side from fust to last , for he showed us all the papers .
then <name> come downstairs  she 'd been <unk> ' for an examination  an ' the man tells her who he was , an ' she says he had ought to have took proper care of his own flesh and blood while he had it by him , an ' not to think he could <unk> it when it suited .
he says somethin ' or other , but she looks him up an ' down , front an ' <unk> , an ' she just tongues him <unk> ' out o ' doors , and he went away <unk> ' all the papers back into his hat , talkin ' most <unk> .
then she come back an ' freed her mind against <name> an ' his mother for not havin ' warned her of her <unk> 's , which it come out she had n't ever been told .
they didn't say <unk> to her .
they never did .
i'd <name> ' packed her off with any man that would <name> ' took her  an ' god 's pity on him ! '
<unk> ! '
said jabez , and sucked his pipe .
'so then , that was the beginnin . '
the man come back again next week or so , an ' he catched <name> alone , 'thout his mother this time , an ' he fair <unk> him with his papers an ' his talk  for the law was on his side  till <name> went down into his <unk> an ' give him ten shillings <unk>  he told me  to withdraw away for a bit an ' leave <name> with 'em . '
'but that 's no way to get rid o ' man or woman , ' jabez said .
'no more 't is .
i told <name> so .
" what can i do ? "
<name> says .
" the <unk> with the man .
i walk about <unk> thinkin ' o ' it till i <unk> my <unk> <unk> ' , an ' i lie abed nights thinkin ' o ' it till i <unk> my sheets all of a <unk> .
't is n't as if i was a young man , " he says , " nor yet as if i was a pore man .
maybe he 'll drink hisself to death . "
i e'en <unk> told him outright what foolishness he was <unk> into , but he knowed it  he knowed it  because he said next time the man come 'twould be fifteen shillin 's .
an ' next time 't was .
just fifteen shillin 's ! '
'an ' was the man her father ? '
asked jabez .
'he had the proofs an ' the papers .
<name> showed me what that lunnon <unk> 's society had answered when <name> writ up to 'em an ' taxed 'em with it .
i lay she had n't been proper polite in her letters to 'em , for they answered middlin ' short .
they said the matter was out o ' their hands , but  let 's see if i remember  oh , yes ,  they <unk> there had been an oversight .
i reckon they had sent <name> out in the <unk> as a orphan instead o ' havin ' a father .
terrible awkward !
then , when he 'd <unk> up the money , the man come again  in his <unk>  an ' he kept <unk> ' on and <unk> ' on about his duty to his pore dear wife , an ' what he 'd do for his dear daughter in lunnon , till the tears <unk> down his two dirty cheeks an ' he come away with more money .
<name> used to slip it into his hand behind the door ; but his mother she heard the chink .
she did n't hold with <unk> .
she 'd write out all her <unk> on the slate , an ' <name> 'ud be settin ' up half the night <unk> ' back an ' showing that the man had the law with him . '
'had n't that man no trade nor business , then ? '
'he told me he was a printer .
i reckon , though , he lived on the rates like the rest of 'em up there in lunnon . '
'an ' how did <name> take it ? '
'she said she 'd sooner go into service than go with the man .
i reckon a mistress 'ud be middlin ' put to it for a maid 'fore she put <name> into cap an ' gown .
she was <unk> ' to be a <unk> .
a beauty she 'll make ! ...
well , that was how things went that fall .
<name> 's lunnon father kep ' comin ' an ' comin ' <unk> as he 'd <unk> out the money <name> gave him ; an ' each time he 'd put-up his price for not takin ' <name> away .
<name> 's mother , she did n't like <unk> ' with no money , an ' bein ' obliged to write her feelin 's on the slate instead o ' givin ' 'em vent by mouth , she was just about mad .
just about she was mad !
'come november , i lodged with <name> in the outside room over 'gainst his hen-house .
i paid her my rent .
i was workin ' for <unk> at pounds  gettin ' <unk> out o ' <name> shaw .
just such weather as this be  rain atop o ' rain after a wet october .
( an ' i remember it ended in dry <unk> right away up to christmas . )
<unk> he 'd sent up to <name> shaw for me  no , he comes <unk> ' up to me himself  because a big <unk> o ' the bank had slipped into the <name> where she makes that <unk> at the bottom o ' the seventeen acre , an ' all the <unk> alders an ' sallies which he ought to have cut out when he took the farm , they 'd slipped with the slip , an ' the <name> was comin ' <unk> ' down atop of 'em , an ' they 'd just about back an ' spill the waters over his <name> wheat .
the water was lyin ' in the flats already .
" <unk> <unk> , <name> ! "
he <unk> out at me , " get that rubbish away all manners you can .
do n't stop for no <unk> ' , but give the <name> play or my <unk> past salvation .
i ca n't lend you no help , " he says , " but work an' i 'll pay ye . " '
'you had him there , ' jabez chuckled .
'yes .
i reckon i had ought to have drove my bargain , but the <name> was <unk> ' up on good <unk> .
so <unk> , i laid into the mess of it , workin ' off the bank where the trees was <unk> ' themselves <unk> in the <unk>  just such weather as this  an ' the <name> <unk> ' up on me all the time .
'long toward noon , <name> comes <unk> ' along with his <unk> ' axe over his shoulder .
' " be you minded for an extra hand at your job ? "
he says .
' " be you minded to turn to ? "
i ses , an '  no more talk to it  <name> laid in alongside o ' me .
he 's no hunger with a <unk> ' axe . '
'maybe , but i 've seed him at a job o ' <unk> ' in the woods , an ' he did n't seem to make out no shape , ' said jabez .
'he have n't got the shoulders , nor yet the judgment  my opinion  when he 's <unk> ' with <unk> timber .
he do n't rightly make up his mind where he 's goin ' to throw her . '
'we was n't <unk> ' nothin ' .
we was <unk> ' out they soft alders , an' <unk> ' 'em up the bank 'fore they could back the waters on the wheat .
<name> did n't say much , 'less it was that he 'd had a <unk> from mary's lunnon father , night before , sayin ' he was comin ' down that mornin ' .
<name> , he 'd sweated all night , an ' he did n't reckon hisself equal to the talkin ' an ' the swearin ' an ' the cryin ' , an ' his mother <unk> ' him afterwards on the slate .
" it <unk> my day to think of it , " he ses , when we was <unk> ' our pieces .
" so i 've fair cried <unk> an ' run .
mother 'll have to tackle him by herself .
i lay she wo n't give him no <unk> , " he ses .
" i lay he 'll be surprised by the time he 's done with her , " he ses .
an ' that was e'en <unk> all the talk we had <unk> ' it .
but he 's no hunger with the <unk> ' axe .
'the <name> she 'd <unk> ' up an ' up on us , an ' she kep ' <unk> ' upon us till we was workin ' knee-deep in the <unk> , <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' an' <unk> ' what we could get to o ' the rubbish .
there was a middlin ' lot comin ' down-stream , too  <unk> , an ' <unk> and <unk> bats , all <unk> ' down together ; but they <unk> round the <unk> good shape by the time we 'd backed out they drowned trees .
come four o'clock we reckoned we 'd done a proper day 's work , an ' she 'd take no harm if we left her .
we could n't puddle about there in the dark an ' wet to no more advantage .
<name> he was <unk> ' the water out of his boots  no , i was doin ' that .
<name> was <unk> ' to <unk> his'n .
" damn it all , <name> , " he ses , standin ' up ; " the flood must be over my <unk> at home , for here comes my old <unk> <unk> ! " '
'yes .
i allus heard he paints his <unk> , ' jabez put in .
'i dunno paint do n't <unk> bees more'n it keeps em ' dry . '
' " i 'll have a pook at it , " he ses , an ' he <unk> at it as it comes round the <unk> .
the <unk> nigh jerked the <unk> out of his <unk> , an' he calls to me , an ' i come runnin ' barefoot .
then we pulled on the <unk> , an ' it reared up on <unk> in the <unk> , an ' we guessed what 'twas .
<unk> we pulled it in into a <unk> , an ' it rolled a piece , an ' a great old stiff man 's arm nigh hit me in the face .
then we was sure .
" 't is a man , " ses <name> .
but the face was all a mask .
" i reckon it's <name> 's lunnon father , " he ses presently .
" lend me a match and i 'll make sure . "
he never used <unk> .
we lit three matches one by another , <unk> we could in the rain , an ' he cleaned off some o ' the <unk> with a <unk> o ' grass .
" yes , " he ses .
" it 's <name> 's lunnon father .
he wo n't <unk> us no more .
d'you want him , <name> ? "
he ses .
' " no , " i ses .
" if this was <unk> beach like , he 'd be <unk> apiece to us 'fore the coroner ; but now we 'd only lose a day havin ' to <unk> the inquest .
i lay he fell into the <name> . "
' " i lay he did , " ses <name> .
" i wonder if he saw mother . "
he turns him over , an ' opens his coat and puts his fingers in the waistcoat pocket an ' starts laughin ' .
" he 's seen mother , right enough , " he ses .
" an ' he's got the best of her , too .
she wo n't be able to crow no more over me 'bout givin ' him money .
i never give him more than a sovereign .
she's give him two ! "
an ' he trousers 'em , laughin ' all the time .
" an ' now we 'll pook him back again , for i 've done with him , " he ses .
'so we <unk> him back into the middle of the <name> , an ' we saw he went round the <unk> 'thout <unk> ' , an ' we walked quite a piece beside of him to set him on his ways .
when we could n't see no more , we went home by the high road , because we knowed the <name> <unk> 'd be out acrost the <unk> , an ' we was n't goin ' to hunt for <name> 's little rotten old bridge in that dark  an ' <unk> ' heavens ' hard , too .
i was middlin ' pleased to see light an ' vittles again when we got home .
<name> he pressed me to come insides for a drink .
he do n't drink in a generality , but he was rid of all his troubles that evenin ' , d 'ye see ?
" mother , " he ses so soon as the door <unk> 'd , " have you seen him ? "
she whips out her slate an ' writes down  " no . "
" oh , no , " ses <name> .
" you do n't get out of it that way , mother .
i lay you have seen him , an ' i lay he 's <unk> you for all your talk , same as he <unk> me .
make a clean breast of it , mother , " he ses .
" he got round you too . "
she was goin ' for the slate again , but he stops her .
" it 's all right , mother , " he ses .
" i 've seen him sense you have , an ' he wo n't trouble us no more . "
the old <name> looks up quick as a <name> , an ' she writes , " did he say so ? "
" no , " ses <name> , laughin ' .
" he did n't say so .
that 's how i know .
but he <unk> you , mother .
you can't have it in at me for bein ' <unk> .
you 're twice as <unk> as what i be .
look ! "
he ses , an ' he shows her the two sovereigns .
" put 'em away where they belong , " he ses .
" he wo n't never come for no more ; an ' now we 'll have our drink , " he ses , " for we've earned it . "
<unk> they were n't goin ' to let me see where they kep ' their <unk> .
she went upstairs with it  for the whisky . '
'i never knowed <name> was a drinkin ' man  in his own house , like , ' said jabez .
'no more he is n't ; but what he takes he likes good .
he wo n't tech no publican 's <unk> acrost the bar .
four shillin 's he paid for that bottle o ' whisky .
i know , because when the old <name> brought it down there was n't more'n jest a liddle few <unk> 's an ' <unk> in it .
<unk> to set before neighbours , i do assure you . '
' " why , 't was half full last week , mother , " he ses .
" you do n't mean , " he ses , " you 've given him all that as well ?
it 's two shillin 's worth , " he ses .
( that 's how i knowed he paid four . )
" well , well , mother , you be too <unk> to live .
but i do n't grudge it to him , " he ses .
" i don't grudge him nothin ' he can keep . "
so , <unk> , we <unk> up what little sup was left . '
'an ' what come to <name> 's lunnon father ? '
said jabez after a full minute 's silence .
'i be too tired to go <unk> ' papers of evenin 's ; but <unk> he told me , that very week , i think , that they 'd <unk> on a man down at <unk> which had poked and poked up agin ' so many bridges an' banks , like , they could n't make <unk> out of him . '
'an ' what did <name> say to all these doin 's ? '
'the old <name> bundled her off to the village 'fore her lunnon father come , to buy week-end stuff ( an ' she forgot the half o ' it ) .
when we come in she was upstairs <unk> ' to be a school-teacher .
none told her <unk> about it .
<unk> n't girls ' affairs . '
<unk> she knowed ? '
jabez went on .
'she ?
she must have guessed it middlin ' close when she saw her money come back .
but she never mentioned it in writing so far 's i know .
she were more <unk> that night on account of <unk> her chickens bein ' drowned , for the flood had <unk> their old hen-house round on her <unk> .
i <unk> her up next mornin ' when the <name> <unk> . '
'an ' where did you find the bridge ?
some fur down-stream , did n't ye ? '
'just where she allus was .
she had n't shifted but very little .
the <name> had <unk> out the bank a piece under one <unk> o ' the plank , so 's she was liable to tilt ye sideways if you was n't careful .
but i <unk> <unk> bricks under her , an ' she was all plumb again . '
'well , i dunno how it looks like , but let be how 'twill , ' said jabez , 'he had n't no business to come down from lunnon <unk> ' people , an' <unk> ' to take away children which they 'd <unk> up for their lawful own  even if 't was <name> <unk> . '
'he had the business right enough , an ' he had the law with him  no gettin ' over that , ' said <name> .
'but he had the drink with him , too , an' that was where he failed , like . '
'well , well !
let be how 'twill , the <name> was a good friend to <name> .
i see it now .
i allus did wonder what he was gettin ' at when he said that , when i talked to him about <unk> ' the stack .
" you dunno <unk> ' , " he ses .
" the <name> 's been a good friend to me , " he ses , " an ' if she 's minded to have a snatch at my hay , i ai n't settin ' out to withstand her . " '
'i reckon she 's about shifted it , too , by now , ' <name> chuckled .
<unk> !
that ai n't any slip off the bank which she 's got hold of . '
the <name> had changed her note again .
it sounded as though she were mumbling something soft .
the land when <name> fabricius , <unk> of the weald , in the days of <unk> owned our lower <unk> , he called to him <unk>  a briton of the <name> , saying : 'what about that <unk> for layin ' in to hay ? '
and the aged hobden answered : 'i remember as a lad my father told your father that she wanted <unk> ' bad .
an ' the more that you <unk> her the less you 'll get her clean .
have it jest as you 've a mind to , but , if i was you , i 'd <unk> . '
so they drained it long and crossways in the lavish <name> style .
still we find among the <unk> their flakes of ancient tile , and in <unk> middle <name> , when the bones of meadows show , we can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago .
then <name> fabricius died as even prefects do , and after certain centuries , imperial rome died too .
then did robbers enter britain from across the northern main and our lower <unk> was won by <unk> the <name> .
well could <unk> work his <unk>  well could <unk> wield his brand  much he knew of foaming waters  not so much of farming land .
so he called to him a hobden of the old unaltered blood .
saying : 'what about that <unk> , she does n't look no good ? '
and that aged hobden answered : <unk> n't for me to interfere , but i 've known that bit o ' meadow now for five and fifty year .
have it jest as you 've a mind to , but i 've proved it time on time , if you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime ! '
<unk> sent his <unk> to lewes , twenty hours ' solemn walk , and <name> back great abundance of the cool , grey , healing chalk .
and old hobden spread it <unk> , never heeding what was i n't ; which is why in cleaning ditches , now and then we find a flint .
<unk> died .
his sons grew english .
anglo-saxon was their name , till out of blossomed normandy another pirate came ; for duke <name> conquered england and divided with his men , and our lower <unk> he gave to <name> of <unk> .
but the <name> ( you know her habit ) rose one rainy autumn night and tore down sodden <unk> of the bank to left and right .
so , said <name> to his bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds : <unk> , what about that <unk>  the <name> 's got up no bounds ? '
and that aged hobden answered : <unk> n't my business to advise , but ye might <name> ' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies .
when ye ca n't hold back the water you must try and save the <unk> .
hev it jest as you 've a mind to , but , if i was you , i 'd <unk> ! '
they <unk> along the water-course with trunks of <unk> and planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees .
and when the <unk> of autumn whirl the <unk> away you can see their faithful fragments <unk> in iron <name> .
* * * * * <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , i , who own the <unk> , am fortified with <unk> , attested , signed and sealed , <unk> me , my assigns , my <unk> and heirs all sorts of powers and profits which  are neither mine nor theirs .
i have rights of <name> and <name> , as my dignity requires .
i can fish  but hobden <unk> .
i can shoot  but hobden wires .
i repair , but he <unk> , certain gaps which , men <unk> , have been used by every hobden since a hobden <unk> a hedge .
shall i dog his morning progress o'er the <unk> dew ?
demand his <unk> into which my pheasant flew ?
confiscate his evening <unk> into which the <unk> ran , and summons him to judgment ?
i would sooner summons pan .
his dead are in the churchyard  thirty generations laid .
their names went down in domesday book when domesday book was made .
and the passion and the piety and prowess of his line have <unk> , rooted , <unk> in some land the law calls mine .
not for any beast that burrows , not for any bird that flies , would i lose his large sound council , miss his keen <unk> eyes .
he is bailiff , woodman , wheelwright , <unk> , engineer , and if <unk> a <unk>  'tai n't for me to interfere .
<unk> , what about that <unk> ? '
i turn to him again with fabricius and <unk> and <name> of <unk> .
<unk> it jest as you 've a mind to , but '  and so he takes command .
for whoever pays the taxes old mus ' hobden owns the land .
in the same boat ( <unk> ) 'a throbbing vein , ' said dr. <name> soothingly , 'is the mother of delusion . '
'then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due ? '
<unk> voice rose almost to a break .
'of course , but you should have consulted a doctor before using  <unk> . '
'it was driving me mad .
and now i ca n't give them up . '
<unk> so bad as that !
one does n't form fatal habits at twenty-five .
think again .
were you ever frightened as a child ? '
'i do n't remember .
it began when i was a boy . '
'with or without the spasm ?
by the way , do you mind describing the spasm again ? '
'well , ' said conroy , twisting in the chair , 'i 'm no musician , but suppose you were a <unk>  vibrating  and some one put his finger on you ?
as if a finger were put on the naked soul !
awful ! '
'so 's indigestion  so 's nightmare  while it lasts . '
'but the horror afterwards knocks me out for days .
and the waiting for it ... and then this drug habit !
it ca n't go on ! '
he shook as he spoke , and the chair creaked .
'my dear fellow , ' said the doctor , 'when you 're older you 'll know what burdens the best of us <name> .
a fox to every spartan . '
'that does n't help me .
i ca n't !
i ca n't ! '
cried conroy , and burst into tears .
'do n't apologise , ' said <name> , when the paroxysm ended .
'i 'm used to people coming a little  <unk> in this room . '
'it 's those <unk> ! '
conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his nose .
'they 've knocked me out .
i used to be fit once .
oh , i 've tried exercise and everything .
but  if one sits down for a minute when it's due  even at four in the morning  it runs up behind one . '
<unk> .
many things come in the quiet of the morning .
you always know when the visitation is due ? '
'what would i give not to be sure ! '
he sobbed .
'we 'll put that aside for the moment .
i 'm thinking of a case where what we 'll call <unk> of the <name> was masked ( i do n't say cured ) by vibration .
he could n't sleep , or thought he could n't , but a steamer voyage and the thump of the screw  ' 'a steamer ?
after what i 've told you ! '
conroy almost shrieked .
<unk> sooner ... ' 'of course not a steamer in your case , but a long railway journey the next time you think it <name> trouble you .
it sounds absurd , but  ' 'i 'd try anything .
i nearly have , ' conroy sighed .
<unk> !
i 've given you a tonic that <name> clear that notion from your head .
give the train a chance , and do n't begin the journey by <unk> yourself up with <unk> .
take them along , but hold them in reserve  in reserve . '
'd'you think i 've self-control enough , after what you 've heard ? '
said conroy .
dr. <name> smiled .
'yes .
after what i 've seen , ' he glanced round the room , 'i have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much self-control as many other people .
i 'll write you later about your journey .
meantime , the tonic , ' and he gave some general directions before conroy left .
an hour later dr. <name> hurried to the links , where the others of his regular week-end game awaited him .
it was a rigid round , played as usual at the trot , for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two king's counsels and sir <name> chartres as on <name> .
the lawyers were old enemies of the admiralty court , and sir <name> of the frosty eyebrows and <unk> manner was <unk> with , but before , <unk> <name> among <unk> .
at the <unk> afterwards the lawyers renewed their <unk> over a tangled collision case , and the doctors as naturally compared professional matters .
<unk>  all lies , ' said sir <name> , when <name> had told him <unk> trouble .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the man or woman who drugs is <unk> <unk> a liar .
you 've no imagination . '
<unk> you have n't a little  occasionally . '
'i have believed a certain type of patient in my time .
it 's always the same .
for reasons not given in the <unk> they take to the drug .
certain symptoms follow .
they <name> swear to you , and believe it , that they took the drug to mask the symptoms .
what does your man use ?
<unk> ?
i thought so .
i had practically the duplicate of your case last thursday .
same old <unk>  same old lie . '
'tell me the symptoms , and i 'll draw my own inferences , <name> . '
<unk> !
the girl was rank poisoned with <unk> .
<unk> , stamping possession .
gad , i thought she 'd have the chandelier down . '
<unk> came <unk> too , and he has the physique of a bull , ' said <name> .
'what delusions had yours ? '
<unk>  faces with mildew on them .
in any other walk of life we 'd call it the horrors .
she told me , of course , she took the drugs to mask the faces .
post <unk> , <unk> <unk> again .
all liars ! '
'what 's that ? '
said the senior <unk> .
quickly .
<unk> professional . '
'go away !
not for you , <name> . '
sir <name> turned a shoulder against him and walked with <name> in the chill evening .
to conroy in his chambers came , one week later , this letter : dear mr. conroy  if your plan of a night 's trip on the 17th still holds good , and you have no particular destination in view , you could do me a kindness .
a miss henschil , in whom i am interested , goes down to the west by the <unk> from waterloo ( number 3 platform ) on that night .
she is not exactly an invalid , but , like so many of us , a little shaken in her nerves .
her maid , of course , accompanies her , but if i knew you were in the same train it would be an additional source of strength .
<name> you please write and let me know whether the <unk> from waterloo , number 3 platform , on the 17th , suits you , and i <name> meet you there ?
do n't forget my caution , and keep up the <unk>  yours sincerely , l. <unk> <name> .
'he knows i 'm scarcely fit to look after myself , ' was conroy 's thought .
'and he wants me to look after a woman ! '
yet , at the end of half an hour 's <unk> , he accepted .
now conroy 's trouble , which had lasted for years , was this : on a certain night , while he lay between sleep and wake , he would be overtaken by a long shuddering sigh , which he learned to know was the sign that his <name> had once more conceived its horror , and in time  in due time  would bring it forth .
drugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse than as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams ; but over the return of the event drugs had no control .
once that sigh had passed his lips the thing was inevitable , and through the days granted before its rebirth he walked in torment .
for the first two years he had striven to fend it off by <unk> , but neither exercise nor drink availed .
then he had come to the <unk> of the excellent m. <unk> .
these guarantee , on the label , <unk> and absolutely natural sleep to the <unk> . '
they are carried in a case with a spring which presses one scented <unk> to the end of the tube , whence it can be <unk> off in stroking the moustache or adjusting the veil .
three years of m. <unk> 's preparations do not fit a man for many careers .
his friends , who knew he did not drink , assumed that conroy had strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises , and conroy had with some care invented an imaginary doctor , symptoms , and <unk> , which he discussed with them and with his mother in <unk> .
she maintained that he would grow out of it , and recommended <unk> <unk> .
when at last conroy faced a real doctor , it was , he hoped , to be saved from suicide by a <unk> .
yet dr. <name> had but given him more drugs  a tonic , for instance , that would couple railway <unk>  and had advised a night in the train .
not alone the horrors of a railway journey ( for which a man who dare keep no servant must e'en pack , label , and address his own bag ) , but the necessity for holding himself in hand before a stranger 'a little shaken in her nerves . '
he spent a long forenoon packing , because when he assembled and counted things his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before his night , and he found himself counting minutes aloud .
at such times the injustice of his fate would drive him to <unk> which no servant should witness , but on this evening dr. <name> 's tonic held him fairly calm while he put up his patent razors .
waterloo station shook him into real life .
the change for his ticket needed concentration , if only to prevent shillings and pence turning into minutes at the <unk> ; and he spoke quickly to a <name> about the disposition of his bag .
the old <unk> from waterloo to the west was an <unk> caravan that halted , in the interests of the milk traffic , at almost every station .
dr. <name> stood by the door of the one composite <unk> ; an older and <unk> man behind him .
'so glad you 're here ! '
he cried .
'let me get your ticket . '
'certainly not , ' conroy answered .
'i got it myself  long ago .
my <unk> in too , ' he added proudly .
'i beg your pardon .
miss henschil 's here .
i 'll introduce you . '
'but  but , ' he stammered  'think of the state i 'm in .
if anything happens i shall collapse . '
'not you .
you 'd rise to the occasion like a bird .
and as for the self-control you were talking of the other day '  <name> swung him round  'look ! '
a young man in an ulster over a <unk> frock-coat stood by the carriage window , weeping shamelessly .
'oh , but that 's only drink , ' conroy said .
'i have n't had one of my  my things since lunch . '
<unk> ! '
said <name> .
'i knew i could depend on you .
come along .
wait for a minute , chartres . '
a tall woman , veiled , sat by the far window .
she bowed her head as the doctor murmured conroy knew not what .
then he disappeared and the inspector came for tickets .
'my maid  next compartment , ' she said slowly .
conroy showed his ticket , but in returning it to the <unk> of his ulster the little silver <unk> case slipped from his glove and fell to the floor .
he snatched it up as the moving train flung him into his seat .
'how nice ! '
said the woman .
she leisurely lifted her veil , <unk> the first button of her left glove , and pressed out from its palm a <unk> .
'do n't ! '
said conroy , not <unk> he had spoken .
'i beg your pardon . '
the deep voice was measured , even , and low .
conroy knew what made it so .
'i said " do n't " !
he would n't like you to do it ! '
'no , he would not . '
she held the tube with its <unk> <unk> between finger and thumb .
'but are n't you one of the  ah  " <unk> " too ? '
'that 's why .
oh , please do n't !
not at first .
i  i have n't had one since morning .
you  you 'll set me off ! '
'you ?
are you so far gone as that ? '
he nodded , pressing his palms together .
the train jolted through vauxhall points , and was welcomed with the clang of empty <unk> for the west .
after long silence she lifted her great eyes , and , with an innocence that would have deceived any sound man , asked conroy to call her maid to bring her a forgotten book .
conroy shook his head .
'no .
our sort ca n't read .
do n't ! '
'were you sent to watch me ? '
the voice never changed .
'me ?
i need a keeper myself much more  this night of all ! '
'this night ?
have you a night , then ?
they <unk> me when i told them of mine . '
she leaned back and laughed , always slowly .
<unk> doctors <unk> ?
they do n't know . '
she leaned her elbow on her knee , lifted her veil that had fallen , and , <name> in hand , stared at him .
he looked at her  till his eyes were blurred with tears .
'have i been there , think you ? '
she said .
'surely  surely , ' conroy answered , for he had well seen the fear and the horror that lived behind the <unk> eyes , the fine tracing on the broad forehead , and the guard set about the desirable mouth .
'then  suppose we have one  just one apiece ?
i 've gone without since this afternoon . '
he put up his hand , and would have shouted , but his voice broke .
'do n't !
ca n't you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off ?
don't let 's both go down together . '
'but i want one .
it 's a poor heart that never rejoices .
just one .
it's my night . '
'it 's mine  too .
my <unk> , fifth , sixth , seventh . '
he shut his lips firmly against the tide of <unk> <name> that threatened to <name> him along .
'ah , it 's only my <unk> . '
she paused as he had done .
'i wonder if i shall last into the <unk> ... . talk to me or i shall go crazy .
you're a man .
you 're the stronger vessel .
tell me when you went to pieces . '
'one , two , three , four , five , six , seven  eight  i beg your pardon . '
'not in the least .
i always pretend i 've dropped a stitch of my knitting .
i count the days till the last day , then the hours , then the minutes .
do you ? '
'i do n't think i 've done very much else for the last  ' said conroy , shivering , for the night was cold , with a chill he recognised .
'oh , how comforting to find some one who can talk sense !
it 's not always the same date , is it ? '
'what difference would that make ? '
he <unk> his ulster with a jerk .
'you 're a sane woman .
ca n't you see the wicked  wicked  wicked ' ( dust flew from the padded <unk> as he struck it ) <unk> of it ?
what have i done ? '
she laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly .
'if you begin to think over that , ' she said , 'you 'll go to pieces and be ashamed .
tell me yours , and i 'll tell you mine .
only be quiet  be quiet , lad , or you 'll set me off ! '
she made shift to soothe him , though her <name> trembled .
'well , ' said he at last , picking at the <unk> between them , <unk> nothing much , of course . '
'do n't be a fool !
that 's for doctors  and mothers . '
'it 's hell , ' conroy muttered .
'it begins on a steamer  on a stifling hot night .
i come out of my cabin .
i pass through the saloon where the stewards have rolled up the carpets , and the boards are bare and hot and <unk> . '
'i 've travelled too , ' she said .
'ah !
i come on deck .
i walk down a covered alleyway .
butcher 's meat , bananas , oil , that sort of smell . '
again she nodded .
'it 's a <unk> steamer , and the sea 's <unk> .
perfectly smooth sea  perfectly still ship , except for the engines running , and her waves going off in lines and lines and lines  dull grey .
all this time i know something 's going to happen . '
'i know .
something going to happen , ' she whispered .
'then i hear a thud in the engine-room .
then the noise of machinery falling down  like <unk>  and then two most awful yells .
they're more like <unk> , and i know  i know while i listen  that it means that two men have died as they hooted .
it was their last breath hooting out of them  in most awful pain .
do you understand ? '
'i ought to .
go on . '
'that 's the first part .
then i hear bare feet running along the alleyway .
one of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite distinctly , " my friend !
all is lost ! "
then he taps me on the shoulder and i hear him drop down dead . '
he panted and wiped his forehead .
'so that is your night ? '
she said .
'that is my night .
it comes every few weeks  so many days after i get what i call sentence .
then i begin to count . '
'get sentence ?
d'you mean this ? '
she half closed her eyes , <name> a deep breath , and shuddered .
' " notice " i call it .
sir <name> thought it was all lies . '
she had <unk> her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite , showing the immense mass of her black hair , rolled low in the nape of the columnar neck and looped over the left ear .
but conroy had no eyes except for her grave eyes .
'listen now ! '
said she .
'i walk down a road , a white <name> road near the sea .
there are broken fences on either side , and men come and look at me over them . '
'just men ?
do they speak ? '
'they try to .
their faces are all <unk>  eaten away , ' and she hid her face for an instant with her left hand .
'it 's the faces  the faces ! '
'yes .
like my two <unk> .
i know . '
'ah !
but the place itself  the <unk>  and the glitter and the salt smells , and the wind blowing the sand !
the men run after me and i run ... .
i know what 's coming too .
one of them touches me . '
'yes !
what comes then ?
we 've both shirked that . '
'one awful shock  not <unk> , but shock , shock , shock ! '
'as though your soul were being stopped  as you 'd stop a <unk> humming ? '
he said .
'just that , ' she answered .
'one 's very soul  the soul that one lives by  stopped .
so ! '
she drove her thumb deep into the <unk> .
'and now , ' she whined to him , 'now that we 've stirred each other up this way , might n't we have just one ? '
'no , ' said conroy , shaking .
'let 's hold on .
we 're past '  he peered out of the black windows  <unk> .
there 's the <unk> .
how long till <name> ? '
'oh , cruel long yet .
if one <unk> for a minute , it catches one . '
'and how d'you find that this '  he tapped the palm of his glove  <unk> you ? '
'it covers up the thing from being too real  if one takes enough  you know .
only  only  one loses everything else .
i 've been no more than a <unk> for two years .
what would you give to be real again ?
this lying 's such a nuisance . '
'one must protect oneself  and there 's one 's mother to think of , ' he answered .
'true .
i <name> allowances are made for us somewhere .
our burden  can you hear ?  our burden is heavy enough . '
she rose , towering into the roof of the carriage .
conroy 's <unk> grip pulled her back .
'now you are foolish .
sit down , ' said he .
'but the cruelty of it !
ca n't you see it ?
do n't you feel it ?
let 's take one now  before i  ' 'sit down ! '
cried conroy , and the sweat stood again on his forehead .
he had fought through a few nights , and had been defeated on more , and he knew the rebellion that <unk> beyond control to exhaustion .
she smoothed her hair and dropped back , but for a while her head and throat moved with the sickening motion of a captured <unk> .
'once , ' she said , spreading out her hands , 'i ripped my <unk> from end to end .
that takes strength .
i had it then .
i 've little now .
" all <unk> , " as my little niece says .
and you , lad ? '
' " all <unk> " !
let me keep your case for you till the morning . '
'but the cold feeling is beginning . '
<unk> it me , then . '
'and the drag down my right side .
i <name> n't be able to move in a minute . '
'i can scarcely lift my arm myself , ' said conroy .
'we 're in for it . '
'then why are you so foolish ?
you know it 'll be easier if we have only one  only one apiece . '
she was lifting the case to her mouth .
with tremendous effort conroy caught it .
the two moved like jointed dolls , and when their hands met it was as wood on wood .
'you must  not ! '
said conroy .
his jaws stiffened , and the cold climbed from his feet up .
'why  must  i  not ? '
she repeated the words <unk> .
conroy could only shake his head , while he bore down on the hand and the case in it .
her speech went from her altogether .
the wonderful lips rested half over the even teeth , the breath was in the nostrils only , the eyes dulled , the face set grey , and through the glove the hand struck like ice .
presently her soul came back and stood behind her eyes  only thing that had life in all that place  stood and looked for conroy 's soul .
he too was fettered in every limb , but somewhere at an immense distance he heard his heart going about its work as the engine-room carries on through and beneath the all but overwhelming wave .
his one <name> , he knew , was not to lose the eyes that clung to his , because there was an evil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a <unk> .
the rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while cymbals clashed .
( beyond <unk> the <unk> rolls out many empty <unk> at every halt . )
then a body came to life with intolerable <unk> .
limb by limb , after agonies of terror , that body returned to him , steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long day 's rowing .
he saw the heavy lids droop over her eyes  the watcher behind them departed  and , his soul sinking into assured peace , conroy slept .
light on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock .
her hand still held his .
she slept , forehead down upon it , but the movement of his waking waked her too , and she sneezed like a child .
'i  i think it 's morning , ' said conroy .
'and nothing has happened !
did you see your men ?
i did n't see my faces .
does it mean we 've escaped ?
did  did you take any after i went to sleep ?
i 'll swear i did n't , ' she stammered .
'no , there was n't any need .
we 've slept through it . '
'no need !
thank god !
there was no need !
oh , look ! '
the train was running under red cliffs along a <unk> washed by waves that were colourless in the early light .
southward the sun rose <unk> upon the channel .
she leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs , while the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below her waist .
'well ! '
she said with splendid eyes .
'are n't you still waiting for something to happen ? '
'no .
not till next time .
we 've been let off , ' conroy answered , breathing as deeply as she .
'then we ought to say our prayers . '
'what nonsense !
some one <name> see us . '
'we need n't kneel .
stand up and say " our father . "
we must ! '
it was the first time since childhood that conroy had prayed .
they laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an <unk> .
'now for breakfast ! '
she cried .
'my maid  nurse blaber  has the basket and things .
it 'll be ready in twenty minutes .
oh !
look at my hair ! '
and she went out laughing .
conroy 's first discovery , made without fumbling or counting letters on taps , was that the london and south western 's allowance of <unk> is inadequate .
he used every drop , rioting in the cold tingle on neck and arms .
to shave in a moving train balked him , but the next halt gave him a chance , which , to his own surprise , he took .
as he stared at himself in the mirror he smiled and nodded .
there were points about this person with the clear , if sunken , eye and the almost <unk> mouth .
but when he bore his bag back to his compartment , the weight of it on a limp arm humbled that new pride .
'my friend , ' he said , half aloud , 'you go into training .
you 're putty . '
she met him in the spare compartment , where her maid had laid breakfast .
'by jove ! '
he said , halting at the doorway , 'i had n't realised how beautiful you were ! '
'the same to you , lad .
sit down .
i could eat a horse . '
'i should n't , ' said the maid quietly .
'the less you eat the better . '
she was a small , freckled woman , with light fluffy hair and pale-blue eyes that looked through all veils .
'this is miss blaber , ' said miss henschil .
'he 's one of the <unk> too , <unk> . '
'i know it .
but when one has just given it up a full meal does n't agree .
that 's why i 've only brought you bread and butter . '
she went out quietly , and conroy reddened .
'we 're still children , you see , ' said miss henschil .
'but i 'm well enough to feel some shame of it .
d'you take sugar ? '
they starved together <unk> , and nurse blaber was good enough to signify approval when she came to clear away .
<unk> ? '
miss henschil <unk> , and flushed .
'do you smoke ? '
said the nurse coolly to conroy .
'i have n't in years .
now you mention it , i think i 'd like a cigarette  or something . '
'i used to .
d'you think it would keep me quiet ? '
miss henschil said .
'perhaps .
try these . '
the nurse handed them her <unk> .
'do n't take anything else , ' she commanded , and went away with the <unk> .
'good ! '
grunted conroy , between <unk> of tobacco .
'better than nothing , ' said miss henschil ; but for a while they felt ashamed , yet with the comfort of children punished together .
'now , ' she whispered , 'who were you when you were a man ? '
conroy told her , and in return she gave him her history .
it delighted them both to deal once more in worldly concerns  families , names , places , and dates  with a person of understanding .
she came , she said , of <unk> folk  wealthy <unk> , who still kept the broadened a and <unk> <unk> of the old stock .
she lived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of lancaster gate , where people in society gave parties at a mecca called the <unk> hotel .
she herself had been launched into society there , and the flowers at the ball had cost <unk> pounds ; but , being reckoned peculiar , she had made few friends among her own sex .
she had attracted many men , for she was a beauty  the beauty , in fact , of society , she said .
she spoke utterly without shame or <unk> , as a <unk> tells his past to a <unk> ; and conroy nodded across the <unk> .
'do you remember when you got into the carriage ? '
she asked .
' ( oh , i wish i had some knitting ! )
did you notice aught , lad ? '
conroy thought back .
it was ages since .
'was n't there some one outside the door  crying ? '
he asked .
'he 's  he 's the little man i was engaged to , ' she said .
'but i made him break it off .
i told him 't was no good .
but he wo n't , yo ' see . '
<unk> fellow ?
why , he does n't come up to your shoulder . '
'that 's naught to do with it .
i think all the world of him .
i 'm a foolish wench '  her speech wandered as she settled herself <unk> , one elbow on the <unk> .
'we 'd been engaged  i could n't help that  and he worships the ground i tread on .
but it 's no use .
i 'm not responsible , you see .
his two sisters are against it , though i 've the money .
they're right , but they think it 's the <unk> , ' she drawled .
<unk> <unk>  the <unk> .
you see , their grandfather that started the <unk> mills , he died o ' the <unk> . '
'i see , ' said conroy .
the grave face before him under the lifted veil was troubled .
<unk> skinner . '
she breathed it softly .
'i 'd make him a good wife , by god 's <unk>  if i could .
but it 's no use .
i 'm not responsible .
but he 'll not take " no " for an answer .
i used to call him " <unk> . "
he 's of no consequence , yo ' see . '
'that 's in dickens , ' said conroy , quite quickly .
'i have n't thought of <unk> for years .
he was at doctor <unk> 's . '
'and so  that 's my trouble , ' she concluded , ever so slightly wringing her hands .
'but i  do n't you think  there 's <name> now ? '
<unk> ? '
said conroy .
'oh yes !
this is the first time i 've turned my corner without help .
with your help , i should say . '
'it 'll come back , though . '
'then shall we meet it in the same way ?
here 's my card .
write me your train , and we 'll go together . '
'yes .
we must do that .
but between times  when we want  ' she looked at her palm , the four fingers working on it .
'it 's hard to give 'em up . '
'but think what we have gained already , and let me have the case to keep . '
she shook her head , and threw her cigarette out of the window .
'not yet . '
'then let 's lend our cases to nurse , and we 'll get through to-day on cigarettes .
i 'll call her while we feel strong . '
she hesitated , but yielded at last , and nurse accepted the offerings with a smile .
<unk> be all right , ' she said to miss henschil .
'but if i were you '  to conroy  'i 'd take strong exercise . '
when they reached their destination conroy set himself to obey nurse blaber .
he had no remembrance of that day , except one streak of blue sea to his left , <unk> to his right , and , before him , a <unk> track marked with <unk> stones that he counted up to the far thousands .
as he returned to the little town he saw miss henschil on the beach below the cliffs .
she kneeled at nurse blaber 's feet , weeping and pleading .
* * * * * twenty-five days later a telegram came to conroy 's rooms : <unk> given .
waterloo again .
<unk> .
' that same evening he was wakened by the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth .
yet he reflected on his pillow that he had , in spite of lapses , snatched something like three weeks of life , which included several rides on a horse before breakfast  the hour one most <unk> <unk> ; five consecutive evenings on the river at <unk> in a tub where he had well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at ; a game of <unk> at his club ; three dinners , one small dance , and one human flirtation with a human woman .
more notable still , he had settled his month 's accounts , only once confusing petty cash with the days of <name> allowed him .
next morning he rode his hired beast in the park <unk> .
he saw miss henschil on <unk> near lancaster gate , talking to a young man at the railings .
she wheeled and cantered toward him .
'by jove !
how well you look ! '
he cried , without salutation .
'i didn't know you rode . '
'i used to once , ' she replied .
'i 'm all soft now . '
they swept off together down the ride .
'your beast pulls , ' he said .
<unk> him to .
<unk> me something to think of .
how 've you been ? '
she panted .
'i wish <unk> ' shops had n't red lights . '
'have you slipped out and bought some , then ? '
'you do n't know <unk> .
eh , but it 's good to be on a horse again !
this chap cost me two hundred . '
'then you 've been swindled , ' said conroy .
'i know it , but it 's no odds .
i must go back to <unk> and send him away .
he 's neglecting his work for me . '
she swung her <unk> animal on his none too sound <unk> .
<unk> come , lad ? '
'yes .
but i 'm not minding it so much this time . '
<unk> , then  and god help us ! '
she thundered back to the little <unk> figure that waited faithfully near the gate .
conroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home .
that evening he went out with a man in a pair oar , and was rowed to a standstill .
but the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five minutes longer .
* * * * * he carried his bag all down number 3 platform at waterloo , and hove it with one hand into the rack .
'well done ! '
said nurse blaber , in the corridor .
'we 've improved too . '
dr. <name> and an older man came out of the next compartment .
<unk> ! '
said <name> .
'why have n't you been to see me , mr. conroy ?
come under the lamp .
take off your hat .
no  no .
sit , you young giant .
<unk> good .
look here a minute , <name> . '
a little , <unk> , <unk> person glared at him .
<unk> was right about the beauty of the beast , ' he muttered .
'd'you keep it in your glove now ? '
he went on , and punched conroy in the short ribs .
'no , ' said conroy meekly , but without coughing .
<unk>  on my honour !
i 've chucked it for good . '
'wait till you are a sound man before you say that , mr .
conroy . '
sir <name> chartres stumped out , saying to <name> in the corridor , 'it 's all very fine , but the question is shall i or we " sir <unk> of <name> become , " eh ?
we 're bound to think of the children . '
'have you been <unk> ? '
said miss henschil , a few minutes after the train started .
'may i sit with you ?
i  i do n't trust myself yet .
i can't give up as easily as you can , seemingly . '
'ca n't you ?
i never saw any one so improved in a month . '
'look here ! '
she reached across to the rack , single-handed lifted conroy 's bag , and held it at arm 's length .
'i counted ten slowly .
and i did n't think of hours or minutes , ' she boasted .
'do n't remind me , ' he cried .
'ah !
now i 've reminded myself .
i wish i had n't .
do you think it 'll be easier for us to-night ? '
'oh , do n't . '
the smell of the carriage had brought back all his last trip to him , and conroy moved uneasily .
'i 'm sorry .
i 've brought some games , ' she went on .
<unk> and cards  but they all mean counting .
i wish i 'd brought chess , but i can't play chess .
what can we do ?
talk about something . '
'well , how 's <unk> , to begin with ? '
said conroy .
'why ?
did you see him on the platform ? '
'no .
was he there ?
i did n't notice . '
'oh yes .
he does n't understand .
he 's desperately jealous .
i told him it does n't matter .
<name> you please let me hold your hand ?
i believe i'm beginning to get the chill . '
<unk> ought to envy me , ' said conroy .
'he does .
he paid you a high compliment the other night .
he 's taken to calling again  in spite of all they say . '
conroy inclined his head .
he felt cold , and knew surely he would be colder .
'he said , ' she yawned .
' ( beg your pardon . )
he said he could n't see how i could help falling in love with a man like you ; and he called himself a damned little rat , and he beat his head on the piano last night . '
'the piano ?
you play , then ? '
'only to him .
he thinks the world of my accomplishments .
then i told him i would n't have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only the <unk>  not with a million in each stocking . '
'no , not with a million in each stocking , ' said conroy vehemently .
'is n't that odd ? '
'i suppose so  to any one who does n't know .
well , where was i ?
oh , <name> as good as told me i was deceiving him , and he wanted to go away without saying good-night .
he hates standing <unk> , but he must if i wo n't sit down . '
conroy would have smiled , but the chill that <unk> the coming of the <unk> was upon him , and his hand closed warningly on hers .
'and  and so  ' she was trying to say , when her hour also overtook her , leaving alive only the <unk> eyes that turned to conroy .
hand froze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the blackness that heralded it .
yet through the worst conroy saw , at an <unk> distance , one minute glint of light in his night .
thither would he go and escape his fear ; and behold , that light was the light in the watch-tower of her eyes , where her locked soul signalled to his soul : 'look at me ! '
in time , from him and from her , the thing sheered aside , that each soul might step down and resume its own concerns .
he thought confusedly of people on the skirts of a thunderstorm , withdrawing from windows where the torn night is , to their known and furnished beds .
then he dozed , till in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand .
'that 's all .
the faces have n't come , ' he heard her say .
'all  thank god !
i do n't feel even i need what <unk> promised me .
do you ? '
'no . '
he rubbed his eyes .
'but do n't make too sure . '
'certainly not .
we shall have to try again next month .
i 'm afraid it <name> be an awful nuisance for you . '
'not to me , i assure you , ' said conroy , and they leaned back and laughed at the flatness of the words , after the hells through which they had just risen .
'and now , ' she said , strict eyes on conroy , <unk> would n't you take me  not with a million in each stocking ? '
'i do n't know .
that 's what i 've been puzzling over . '
'so have i .
we 're as handsome a couple as i 've ever seen .
are you well off , lad ? '
'they call me so , ' said conroy , smiling .
'that 's north country . '
she laughed again .
setting aside my good looks and yours , i 've four thousand a year of my own , and the rents should make it six .
that 's a match some old cats would lap tea all night to <unk> up . '
'it is .
lucky <unk> ! '
said conroy .
'ay , ' she answered , 'he 'll be the <unk> lad in london if i win through .
who 's yours ? '
'no  no one , dear .
i 've been in hell for years .
i only want to get out and be alive and  so on .
is n't that reason enough ? '
'maybe , for a man .
but i never minded things much till <name> came .
i was all <unk> like . '
'so was i , but now i think i can live .
it ought to be less next month , ought n't it ? '
he said .
'i <name> so .
ye-es .
there 's nothing much for a maid except to be married , and i ask no more .
whoever yours is , when you 've found her , she shall have a wedding present from mrs. <name> skinner that  ' 'but she would n't understand it any more than <unk> . '
'he does n't matter  except to me .
i ca n't keep my eyes open , thank god !
good-night , lad . '
conroy followed her with his eyes .
beauty there was , <name> there was , strength , and enough of the rest to drive better men than <name> skinner to beat their heads on <unk>  but for the new-found life of him conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to <unk> .
he put up his feet and fell asleep , dreaming of a joyous , normal world recovered  with interest on arrears .
there were many things in it , but no one face of any one woman .
* * * * * thrice afterward they took the same train , and each time their trouble shrank and weakened .
miss henschil talked of <unk> , his multiplied calls , the things he had said to his sisters , the much worse things his sisters had replied ; of the late ( he seemed very dead to them ) m. <unk> 's gifts for the <unk> ; of shopping , of house rents , and the cost of really artistic furniture and linen .
conroy explained the exercises in which he delighted  mighty labours of play undertaken against other mighty men , till he sweated and , having bathed , slept .
he had visited his mother , too , in <unk> , and he talked something of her and of the <unk> , which his body , cut out of all clean life for five years , innocently and deeply enjoyed .
nurse blaber was a little interested in conroy 's mother , but , as a rule , she smoked her cigarette and read her <unk> novels in her own compartment .
on their last trip she volunteered to sit with them , and buried herself in the <unk> and the hearth while they whispered together .
on that occasion ( it was near salisbury ) at two in the morning , when the <unk> brushed them with his wing , it meant no more than that they should cease talk for the instant , and for the instant hold hands , as even utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot .
'but still , ' said nurse blaber , not looking up , 'i think your mr. skinner might feel jealous of all this . '
'it would be difficult to explain , ' said conroy .
'then you 'd better not be at my wedding , ' miss henschil laughed .
'after all we 've gone through , too .
but i suppose you ought to leave me out .
is the day fixed ? '
he cried .
<unk> of <name>  in spite of both his sisters .
i can risk it now . '
her face was glorious as she flushed .
'my dear chap ! '
he shook hands unreservedly , and she gave back his grip without <unk> .
'i ca n't tell you how pleased i am ! '
<unk> heavens ! '
said nurse blaber , in a new voice .
'oh , i beg your pardon .
i forgot i was n't paid to be surprised . '
'what at ?
oh , i see ! '
miss henschil explained to conroy .
'she expected you were going to kiss me , or i was going to kiss you , or something . '
'after all you 've gone through , as mr. conroy said , ' 'but i could n't , could you ? '
said miss henschil , with a disgust as <name> as that on conroy 's face .
'it would be horrible  horrible .
and yet , of course , you 're wonderfully handsome .
how d'you account for it , <unk> ? '
nurse blaber shook her head .
'i was hired to cure you of a habit , dear .
when you 're cured i shall go on to the next case  that <unk> one at <unk> i told you about . '
'and i shall be left alone with <name> !
but suppose it is n't cured , ' said miss henschil of a sudden .
suppose it comes back again .
what can i do ?
i ca n't send for him in this way when i 'm a married woman ! '
she pointed like an infant .
'i 'd come , of course , ' conroy answered .
'but , seriously , that is a consideration . '
they looked at each other , alarmed and anxious , and then toward nurse blaber , who closed her book , marked the place , and turned to face them .
'have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me ? '
she said .
'no .
i might have spoken to dad  but mother 's different .
what d'you mean ? '
'and you 've never talked to your mother either , mr .
conroy ? '
'not till i took <unk> .
then i told her it was my heart .
there 's no need to say anything , now that i 'm practically over it , is there ? '
'not if it does n't come back , but  ' she beckoned with a stumpy , triumphant linger that <name> their heads close together .
'you know i always go in and read a chapter to mother at tea , child . '
'i know you do .
you 're an <name> , ' miss henschil patted the blue shoulder next her .
<unk> 's church of england now , ' she explained .
'but she 'll have her bible with her <unk> at tea every night like the <unk> . '
'it was <unk> and <unk> last tuesday that gave me a clue .
i said i'd never seen a case of <unk> , and your mother said she 'd seen too many . '
'where ?
she never told me , ' miss henschil began .
'a few months before you were born  on her trip to australia  at <unk> or <unk> something or other .
it took me three evenings to get it all out . '
'ay  mother 's suspicious of questions , ' said miss henschil to conroy .
'she 'll lock the door of every room she 's in , if it 's but for five minutes .
she was a <unk> from <unk> way , yo ' see . '
'she described your men to the life  men with faces all eaten away , staring at her over the fence of a <unk> ' hospital in this <unk> island .
they begged from her , and she ran , she told me , all down the street , back to the pier .
one touched her and she nearly fainted .
she 's ashamed of that still . '
'my men ?
the sand and the fences ? '
miss henschil muttered .
'yes .
you know how tidy she is and how she hates wind .
she remembered that the fences were broken  she remembered the wind blowing .
sand  sun  salt wind  fences  faces  i got it all out of her , bit by bit .
you do n't know what i know !
and it all happened three or four months before you were born .
there ! '
nurse blaber slapped her knee with her little hand triumphantly .
'would that account for it ? '
miss henschil shook from head to foot .
<unk> .
i do n't care who you ask !
you never imagined the thing .
it was laid on you .
it happened on earth to you !
quick , mr. conroy , she 's too heavy for me !
i 'll get the flask . '
miss henschil leaned forward and collapsed , as conroy told her afterwards , like a factory chimney .
she came out of her swoon with teeth that chattered on the cup .
'no  no , ' she said , <unk> .
'it 's not hysterics .
yo ' see i 've no call to hev 'em any more .
no call  no reason whatever .
god be praised !
can't yo ' feel i 'm a right woman now ? '
'stop hugging me ! '
said nurse blaber .
'you do n't know your strength .
finish the <name> and water .
it 's perfectly reasonable , and i 'll lay long odds mr. conroy 's case is something of the same .
i 've been thinking  ' 'i wonder  ' said conroy , and pushed the girl back as she swayed again .
nurse blaber smoothed her pale hair .
'yes .
your trouble , or something like it , happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you .
ask her , child .
ask her and be done with it once for all . '
'i <name> , ' said conroy ... . 'there ought to be  ' he opened his bag and hunted breathlessly .
<unk> you !
oh , god bless you , <unk> ! '
miss henschil was sobbing .
'you do n't know what this means to me .
it takes it all off  from the beginning . '
'but does n't it make any difference to you now ? '
the nurse asked curiously .
'now that you 're rightfully a woman ? '
conroy , busy with his bag , had not heard .
miss henschil stared across , and her beauty , freed from the shadow of any fear , blazed up within her .
'i see what you mean , ' she said .
'but it has n't changed anything .
i want <unk> .
he has never been out of his mind in his life  except over silly me . '
'it 's all right , ' said conroy , stooping under the lamp , bradshaw in hand .
'if i change at <unk>  for bristol ( bristol  <unk>  yes )  i can be with mother for breakfast in her room and find out . '
<unk> , then , ' said nurse blaber .
'we 've passed <unk> quite a while .
you 'd better take some of our sandwiches . '
she went out to get them .
conroy and miss henschil would have danced , but there is no room for giants in a south-western compartment .
'good-bye , good luck , lad .
eh , but you 've changed already  like me .
send a wire to our hotel as soon as you 're sure , ' said miss henschil .
'what should i have done without you ? '
'or i ? '
said conroy .
'but it 's nurse that 's saving us really . '
'then thank her , ' said miss henschil , looking straight at him .
'yes , i would .
she 'd like it . '
when nurse blaber came back after the parting at <unk> her nose and her eyelids were red , but , for all that , her face reflected a great light even while she sniffed over the <unk> and the hearth .
miss henschil , deep in a house <unk> 's catalogue , did not speak for twenty minutes .
then she said , between adding <unk> of best , guest , and servants ' sheets , 'but why should our times have been the same , <unk> ? '
'because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock , ' nurse blaber answered .
'and besides that , you probably set each other off by talking and thinking about it .
you should n't , you know . '
'ay , but you 've never been in hell , ' said miss henschil .
the telegram handed in at <unk> at <unk> and delivered to miss henschil on the beach of a certain village at <unk> ran thus : ' " absolutely confirmed .
she says she remembers hearing noise of accident in engine-room returning from <name> <unk> " ' 'he means the year , not the thermometer , ' said nurse blaber , throwing pebbles at the cold sea .
' " and two men scalded thus explaining my <unk> " ( the idea of telling me that ! )
" subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up behind her calling for joke , <unk> , all is lost , ' thus accounting very <unk> " ' nurse blaber purred audibly .
' " she says only remembers being upset minute or two .
unspeakable relief .
best love <unk> , who is <name> .
get out of her what she would like <unk> " oh , i ought n't to have read that , ' said miss henschil .
'it does n't matter .
i do n't want anything , ' said nurse blaber , 'and if i did i should n't get it . '
<unk> all <unk> there was darkness under heaven for an hour 's space  darkness that we knew was given us for special <name> .
sun and moon and stars were hid , god had left his throne , when <name> came to me , she did , <name> all alone !
side by side ( because our fate damned us ere our birth ) we stole out of <unk> gate looking for the earth .
hand in pulling hand amid fear no dreams have known , <name> ran with me , she did , <name> all alone !
when the horror passing speech hunted us along , each laid hold on each , and each found the other strong .
in the teeth of things forbid and reason overthrown , <name> stood by me , she did , <name> all alone !
when , at last , we heard the fires dull and die away , when , at last , our linked desires dragged us up to day , when , at last , our souls were rid of what that night had shown , <name> passed from me , she did , <name> all alone !
let her go and find a mate , as i <name> find a bride , knowing naught of <unk> gate or who are penned inside .
there is knowledge god forbid more than one should own .
so <name> went from me , she did , oh my soul , be glad she did !
<name> all alone !
the honours of war ( <unk> ) a hooded motor had followed mine from the <unk> road up the drive to the infant 's ancestral hall , and had turned off to the stables .
'we 're having a quiet evening together .
stalky 's upstairs changing .
dinner 's at <unk> sharp , because we 're hungry .
his room 's next to yours , ' said the infant , nursing a <unk> bottle of burgundy .
then i found lieutenant-colonel <unk> .
corkran , <unk> , who borrowed a <unk> and told me about the east and his sikh regiment .
'and are your subalterns as good as ever ? '
i asked .
<unk> '  simply amazin ' !
all i 've got to do is to find 'em jobs .
they keep <unk> ' their caps to me and askin ' for more work .
'come at me with their tongues hangin ' out .
i used to run the other way at their age . '
'and when they err ? '
said i .
'i suppose they do sometimes ? '
'then they run to me again to weep with remorse over their virgin <unk> .
i never <unk> my colonel when i was in trouble .
lambs  positive lambs ! '
'and what do you say to 'em ? '
<unk> to 'em like a papa .
tell 'em how i ca n't understand it , an ' how shocked i am , and how grieved their parents 'll be ; and throw in a little about the army regulations and the ten commandments .
<unk> one feel rather a sweep when one thinks of what one used to do at their age .
d'you remember  ' we remembered together till close on seven o'clock .
as we went out into the gallery that runs round the big hall , we saw the infant , below , talking to two deferential <unk> lads whom i had known , on and off , in the holidays , any time for the last ten years .
one of them had a bruised cheek , and the other a weeping left eye .
'yes , that 's the style , ' said stalky below his breath .
'they 're brought up on <unk> and <unk> text-books .
i say , the girls we knew must have been much better than they pretended they were ; for i 'll swear it is n't the fathers . '
'but why on earth did you do it ? '
the infant was shouting .
'you know what it means nowadays . '
'well , sir , ' said <name> <unk> , the taller of the two , <unk> talks too much , for one thing .
he did n't join till he was twenty-three , and , besides that , he used to lecture on tactics in the ante-room .
he said <unk> was the only <unk> , and he illustrated his theories with <unk> .
he was that sort of chap , sir . '
'and he did n't much care whose <unk> they were , ' said eames , who was shorter and <unk> .
'and then he would talk about the <unk> , ' said <name> .
'he got a degree there .
and he told us we were n't intellectual .
he told the adjutant so , sir .
he was just that kind of chap , sir , if you understand . '
stalky and i backed behind a tall japanese jar of <unk> and listened more intently .
'was all the mess in it , or only you two ? '
the infant demanded , chewing his moustache .
'the adjutant went to bed , of course , sir , and the senior subaltern said he was n't going to risk his commission  they 're awfully down on <unk> nowadays in the service  but the rest of us  er  attended to him , ' said <name> .
<unk> ? '
the infant asked .
the boys smiled <unk> .
'not in the ante-room , sir , ' said eames .
'then he called us silly children , and went to bed , and we sat up <unk> ' , and i suppose we got a bit above ourselves , and we  er  ' <unk> to his quarters and <name> him ? '
the infant suggested .
'well , we only asked him to get out of bed , and we put his helmet and <unk> on for him , and we <name> him bits out of the blue <name> book  the <unk> on army organisation .
oh yes , and then we asked him to drink old <unk> 's health , as a <unk> , in <unk> and worcester sauce , and so on .
we had to help him a little there .
he bites .
there was n't much else that time ; but , you know , the war office is severe on <unk> these days . '
<name> stopped with a <unk> smile .
'and then , ' eames went on , 'then wontner said we 'd done several <unk> worth of damage to his furniture . '
'oh , ' said the infant , 'he 's that kind of man , is he ?
does he brush his teeth ? '
'oh yes , he 's quite clean all over ! '
said <unk> ; 'but his father 's a wealthy barrister . '
<unk> , ' eames corrected , 'and so this mister wontner is out for our blood .
he 's going to make a first-class row about it  appeal to the war office  court of inquiry  <unk> bits in the papers , and songs in the <unk> .
he told us so . '
'that 's the sort of chap he is , ' said <unk> .
'and that means old <unk> , our colonel , 'll be put on <unk> , same as that case in the <unk> ' mess ; and our adjutant 'll have to exchange , like it was with that fellow in the <unk> dragoons , and there 'll be misery all round .
he means making it too hot for us , and his papa 'll back him . '
'yes , that 's all very fine , ' said the infant ; 'but i left the service about the time you were born , <name> .
what 's it got to do with me ? '
<unk> told me i was always to go to you when i was in trouble , and you 've been awfully good to me since he ... ' 'better stay to dinner . '
the infant mopped his forehead .
'thank you very much , but the fact is  ' <unk> halted .
'this afternoon , about four , to be exact  ' eames broke in .
'we went over to wontner 's quarters to talk things over .
the row only happened last night , and we found him writing letters as hard as he could to his father  getting up his case for the war office , you know .
he read us some of 'em , but i 'm not a good judge of style .
we tried to ride him off quietly  apologies and so forth  but it was the <unk> and <unk> that defeated us . '
'yes , he was n't taking anything except pure revenge , ' said eames .
'he said he 'd make an example of the regiment , and he was particularly glad that he 'd landed our colonel .
he told us so .
old <unk> don't sympathise with wontner 's <unk> lectures .
he says wontner ought to learn manners first , but we thought  ' <unk> turned to eames , who was less a son of the house than himself , eames 's father being still alive .
'then , ' eames went on , 'he became rather <unk> , and we thought we might as well <unk> the correspondence '  he wrinkled his swelled left eye  'and after that , we got him to take a seat in my car . '
'he was in a sack , you know , ' <unk> explained .
'he would n't go any other way .
but we did n't hurt him . '
'oh no !
his head 's sticking out quite clear , and '  eames rushed the fence  'we 've put him in your garage  er <unk> <unk> . '
'my garage ! '
infant 's voice nearly broke with horror .
'well , father always told me if i was in trouble , uncle <name>  ' <name> 's sentence died away as the infant collapsed on a <unk> and said no more than , 'your commissions ! '
there was a long , long silence .
'what price your <unk> <unk> subaltern ? '
i whispered to stalky behind my hand .
his nostrils expanded , and he drummed on the edge of the japanese jar with his knuckles .
<unk> your father , <name> ! '
the infant groaned .
<unk> 's a criminal offence these days .
it is n't as if  ' 'come on , ' said stalky .
'that was my old line battalion in egypt .
they nearly slung old <unk> and me out of the service in <unk> for <unk> . '
he descended the stairs and the infant rolled appealing eyes at him .
'i heard what you youngsters have confessed , ' he began ; and in his <unk> voice , which is almost as musical as his singing one , he <unk> those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a revelation to listen to .
till then they had known him almost as a relative  we were all brevet , deputy , or acting uncles to the <unk> friends ' brood  a sympathetic elder brother , sound on finance .
they had never met colonel <unk> .
corkran in the chair of justice .
and while he flayed and rent and blistered , and wiped the floor with them , and while they looked for hiding-places and found none on that floor , i remembered ( 1 ) the <unk> of <unk> ' <unk> at dalhousie , which came <unk> near a court-martial on <unk> corkran ; ( 2 ) the burning of captain <unk> 's <unk> on a hot indian <name> , when the captain slept in his garden , and lieutenant corkran , smoking , rode by after a successful whist night at the club ; ( 3 ) the introduction of an ekka pony , with ekka attached , into a brother captain 's tent on a frosty night in peshawur , and the removal of tent , pole , cot , and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas ; ( 4 ) the bath that was given to <unk> on his own verandah  his <unk> saw it and broke off the engagement , which was what the mess intended , she being an eurasian  and the <unk> all over of <unk> with flour and turmeric from the bazaar .
when he took breath i realised how only satan can rebuke sin .
the good do n't know enough .
'now , ' said stalky , 'get out !
no , not out of the house .
go to your rooms . '
'i 'll send your dinner , <name> , ' said the infant .
<unk> ! '
nothing had ever been known to astonish ipps , the butler .
he entered and withdrew with his charges .
after all , he had suffered from <name> since <name> 's twelfth year .
'they 've done everything they could , short of murder , ' said the infant .
'you know what this 'll mean for the regiment .
it is n't as if we were dealing with sahibs nowadays . '
<unk> so . '
stalky turned on me .
'go and release the <unk> , ' he said .
"tis n't my garage , ' i pleaded .
'i 'm company .
besides , he 'll probably slay me .
he 's been in the sack for hours . '
'look here , ' stalky thundered  the years had fallen from us both  'is your  am i <unk> ' or are you ?
we 've got to pull this thing off somehow or other .
cut over to the garage , make much of him , and bring him over .
he 's dining with us .
be quick , you <unk> ass ! '
i was quick enough ; but as i ran through the shrubbery i wondered how one <unk> the subaltern of the present day from a sack without hurting his feelings .
anciently , one slit the end open , taking off his boots first , and then fled .
imagine a <unk> garage , <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> silk <unk> and a <unk> , cheap , hooded <unk> .
in the back seat of this last , conceive a fiery chestnut head emerging from a long <unk> ; an implacable white face , with blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the string that was drawn round its neck .
the effect , under the electrics , was that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon .
'good evening ! '
i said genially .
'let me help you out of that . '
the head glared .
'we 've got 'em , ' i went on .
'they came to quite the wrong shop for this sort of game  quite the wrong shop . '
<unk> ! '
said the head .
'we 'll see about that .
let me out . '
it was not a promising voice for one so young , and , as usual , i had no knife .
'you 've chewed the string so i ca n't find the knot , ' i said as i worked with trembling fingers at the <unk> 's throat .
something untied itself , and mr. wontner wriggled out , <unk> , <unk> , his coat split half down his back , his waistcoat <unk> , his watch-chain snapped , his trousers <unk> well above the knees .
'where , ' he said grimly , as he pulled them down , 'are master <unk> and master eames ? '
<unk> arrested , of course , ' i replied .
'sir <name> '  i gave the <unk> full title as a <unk>  'is a justice of the peace .
he 'd be very pleased if you dined with us .
there 's a room ready for you . '
i picked up the sack .
'd'you know , ' said mr. wontner through his teeth  but the car 's bonnet was between us , 'that this looks to me like  i wo n't say conspiracy yet , but uncommonly like a confederacy . '
when injured souls begin to distinguish and <unk> , danger is over .
so i grew bold .
<unk> you take it that way , ' i said .
'you come here in trouble  ' 'my good fool , ' he interrupted , with a <unk> snort , 'let me assure you that the trouble <name> recoil on the other men ! '
'as you please , ' i went on .
<unk> , the chaps who got you into trouble are arrested , and the magistrate who arrested 'em asks you to dinner .
shall i tell him you 're walking back to <unk> ? '
he picked some fluff off his waistcoat .
'i 'm in no position to dictate terms yet , ' he said .
'that <name> come later .
i must <unk> into this a little further .
in the meantime , i accept your invitation without prejudice  if you understand what that means . '
i understood and began to be happy again .
<unk> without prejudices were quite new to me .
'all right , ' i replied ; 'if you 'll go up to the house , i 'll turn out the lights . '
he walked off stiffly , while i searched the sack and the car for the <unk> correspondence that <name> had talked of .
i found nothing except , as the police reports say , the trace of a struggle .
he had kicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat , and had bitten the leather <unk> where he could reach it .
evidently a <unk> and <unk> young gentleman .
'well done ! '
said stalky at the door .
'so he did n't slay you .
stop laughing .
he 's talking to the infant now about <unk> .
look here , you 're nearest his size .
cut up to your rooms and give ipps your dinner things and a clean shirt for him . '
'but i have n't got another suit , ' i said .
'you !
i 'm not thinking of you !
we 've got to conciliate him .
he 's in filthy rags and a filthy temper , and he wo n't feel decent till he's dressed .
you 're the sacrifice .
be quick !
and clean socks , remember ! '
once more i trotted up to my room , changed into <unk> <unk> grey <unk> , put studs into a clean shirt , dug out fresh socks , handed the whole <unk> over to ipps , and returned to the hall just in time to hear stalky say , 'i 'm a <unk> , but i have the honour to hold his majesty 's commission in a territorial battalion . '
then i felt as though i might be beginning to be repaid .
'i have a very high opinion of the <unk> myself , ' said mr. wontner above a glass of <name> .
( infant never lets us put <unk> into anything above twenty years old . )
'but if you had any experience of the service , you would find that the average army man  ' here the infant suggested changing , and ipps , before whom no human passion can assert itself , led mr. wontner away .
'why the devil did you tell him i was on the bench ? '
said infant wrathfully to me .
'you know i ai n't now .
why did n't he stay in his father 's office ?
he 's a raging blight ! '
'not a bit of it , ' said stalky cheerfully .
'he 's a little shaken and excited .
probably beetle annoyed him in the garage , but we must overlook that .
we 've contained him so far , and i 'm going to nibble round his outposts at dinner .
all you 've got to do , infant , is to remember you're a gentleman in your own house .
do n't hop !
you 'll find it pretty difficult before dinner 's over .
i do n't want to hear anything at all from you , beetle . '
'but i 'm just beginning to like him , ' i said .
'do let me play ! '
'not till i ask you .
you 'll <unk> it .
poor old <unk> !
a scandal 'ud break him up ! '
'but as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it , it 's bound to rag , ' infant began .
'why  why , they varnished me when i joined ! '
he squirmed at the thought of it .
'do n't be owls !
we ai n't discussing principles !
we 've got to save the court of inquiry if we can , ' said stalky .
five minutes later  at <unk> to be precise  we four sat down to such a dinner as , i hold , only the infant 's cook can produce , with wines worthy of <unk> banquets .
a man in the extremity of rage and injured dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient .
he asks no questions , accepts what is put before him , and <unk> in one key  very often of trifles .
but food and drink are the very best of drugs .
i think it was <unk> dry <unk> <unk>  stalky as usual stuck to burgundy  that began to unlock mr. wontner 's heart behind my <unk> .
me he snubbed throughout , after the oxford manner , because i had seen him in the sack , and he did not intend me to presume ; but to stalky and the infant , while i admired the set of my <unk> across his shoulders , he made his plans of revenge very clear indeed .
he had even sketched out some of the paragraphs that were to appear in the papers , and if stalky had allowed me to speak , i would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased .
'you ought to be able to get <unk> ' damages out of 'em , into the bargain , ' said stalky , after mr. wontner had outlined his position legally .
'my <unk> sir , ' mr. wontner applied himself to his glass , 'it is n't a matter that gentlemen usually discuss , but , i assure you , we <unk> '  he waved a well-kept hand  'do not stand in any need of filthy <unk> . '
in the next three minutes , we learned exactly what his father was worth , which , as he pointed out , was a trifle no man of the world dwelt on .
stalky envied aloud , and i delivered my first kick at the infant 's ankle .
thence we drifted to education , and the average army man , and the desolating <unk>  i remember these words  of army society , notably among its <unk> .
it appeared there was some sort of narrow convention in the army against mentioning a woman 's name at mess .
we were much surprised at this  stalky would not let me express my surprise  but we took it from mr. wontner , who said we might , that it was so .
next he touched on colonels of the old school , and their <unk> of tactics .
not that he himself pretended to any skill in tactics , but after three years at the <unk>  none of us had had a <unk> education  a man insensibly contracted the habit of clear thinking .
at least , he could automatically <unk> his ideas , and the jealousy of these <unk> colonels was inconceivable .
we would understand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his colonel , who had been in the conspiracy against him ; to make his adjutant resign or exchange ; and to give the half-dozen childish subalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in other corps  west african ones , he hoped .
for himself , after the case was decided , he proposed to go on living in the regiment , just to prove  for he bore no malice  that times had changed , <unk> <unk> in <unk>  if we knew what that meant .
infant had curled his legs out of reach , so i was quite free to return thanks yet once more to allah for the diversity of his creatures in his adorable world .
and so , by way of an <unk> <unk> <name> , to tactics and the great general <unk> , unknown to the average army man .
here the infant , at a whisper from ipps  whose face had darkened like a mulberry while he waited  excused himself and went away , but stalky , colonel of <unk> , wanted some tips on tactics .
he got them <unk> for ten minutes  wontner and <unk> mixed , but wontner in a film of priceless <unk> distinctly on top .
when the infant came back , he renewed his <unk> demand that infant should take his <unk> .
i supposed this to be a family trait of the <unk> , whom i had been <unk> for some time past even to the third generation .
'but , <name> it all , they 're both asleep ! '
said infant , scowling at me .
<unk> let 'em have the <unk> port . '
<unk> ! '
said stalky , rising at once .
'i do n't see that makes any difference .
as a matter of form , you 'd better identify them .
i 'll show you the way . '
we followed up the white stone <unk> that leads to the bachelors ' wing .
mr. wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in the <unk> .
'oh , a chap 's assumed to be innocent until he 's proved guilty , ' said stalky , mounting step by step .
'how did they get you into the sack , mr .
wontner ? '
<unk> on me from behind  two to one , ' said mr. wontner briefly .
'i think i handed each of them something first , but they roped my arms and legs . '
'and did they photograph you in the sack ? '
'good heavens , no ! '
mr. wontner shuddered .
'that 's lucky .
awful thing to live down  a photograph , is n't it ? '
said stalky to me as we reached the landing .
'i 'm thinking of the newspapers , of course . '
'oh , but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from accounts supplied by <unk> , ' i said .
mr. wontner turned him round .
it was the first time he had honoured me by his notice since our talk in the garage .
'ah , ' said he , 'do you pretend to any special knowledge in these matters ? '
'i 'm a journalist by profession , ' i answered simply but nobly .
'as soon as you 're at <name> , i 'd like to have your account of the affair . '
now i thought he would have loved me for this , but he only replied in an uncomfortable , <unk> voice , 'oh , you would , would you ? '
'not if it 's any trouble , of course , ' i said .
'i can always get their version from the <unk> .
do either of 'em draw or sketch at all , mr. wontner ?
or perhaps your father might  ' then he said quite hotly , 'i wish you to understand very clearly , my good man , that a gentleman 's name ca n't be dragged through the gutter to <unk> up the circulation of your wretched sheet , whatever it may be . '
'it is   ' i named a journal of enormous sales which <unk> in <unk> , military , and other <unk> .
'i do n't know yet what it ca n't do , mr .
wontner . '
'i did n't know that i was dealing with a reporter ' said mr. wontner .
we were all halted outside a shut door .
ipps had followed us .
'but surely you want it in the papers , do n't you ? '
i urged .
'with a scandal like this , one could n't , in justice to the democracy , be exclusive .
we 'd syndicate it here and in the united states .
i helped you out of the sack , if you remember . '
'i wish to goodness you 'd stop talking ! '
he snapped , and sat down on a chair .
stalky 's hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action , but i felt that my fire had not been <unk> .
'i 'll answer for him , ' said stalky to wontner , in an undertone that dropped to a whisper .
i caught  'not without my leave  dependent on me for <unk> , ' and other gratifying <unk> to my integrity .
still mr. wontner sat in his chair , and still we waited on him .
the infant 's face showed worry and heavy grief ; stalky 's , a bright and <unk> interest ; mine was hidden behind his shoulders , but on the face of ipps were written emotions that no butler should <name> towards any guest .
contempt and wrath were the least of them .
and mr. wontner was looking full at ipps , as ipps was looking at him .
mr. <unk> father , i understood , kept a butler and two footmen .
'd'you suppose they 're <unk> , in order to get off ? '
he said at last .
ipps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open .
the boys had finished their dinner and were fast asleep  one on a sofa , one in a long chair  their faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood .
they had had a <unk> night , a hard day , that ended with a <unk> from an artist , and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life .
what else should youth do , then , but eat , and drink <unk> port , and remember their sorrows no more ?
mr. wontner looked at them severely , ipps within easy reach , his hands quite ready .
<unk> , ' said mr. wontner at last .
<unk> but necessary .
er  have you such a thing as a rope on the premises , and a sack  two sacks and two ropes ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't resist the temptation .
that man understands , does n't he , that this is a private matter ? '
'that man , ' who was me , was off to the basement like one of infant 's own <unk> .
the stables gave me what i wanted , and coming back with it through a dark passage , i ran squarely into ipps .
'go on ! '
he grunted .
'the minute he lays hands on master <name> , master <name> 's saved .
but that person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted .
it was <unk> with me all the time from the soup down , i assure you . '
i arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes .
'they were two to one with me , ' said mr. wontner , as he took them .
'if they wake  ' 'we 'll stand by , ' stalky replied .
'two to one is quite fair . '
but the boys hardly grunted as mr. wontner roped first one and then the other .
even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled , with rolling heads , through sticky lips , and snored on .
<unk> ? '
said mr. wontner <unk> .
<unk> exhaustion .
they are n't much more than kids , after all .
what's next ? '
said stalky .
'i want to take 'em away with me , please . '
stalky looked at him with respect .
'i 'll have my car round in five minutes , ' said the infant .
<unk> 'll help <name> 'em downstairs , ' and he shook mr. wontner by the hand .
we were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a <unk> in the hall , and the boys waked and began to realise what had happened .
<unk> ! '
said mr. wontner , with the simplicity of twelve years old .
<unk> scored now ? '
and he sat upon them .
the tension broke in a storm of laughter , led , i think , by ipps .
<unk>  absolutely <unk> ! '
said mr. wontner , with folded arms from his lively chair .
but he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it all with quite a <unk> grin , as we rolled and stamped round him , and wiped the tears from our cheeks .
<unk> it ! '
said <name> <unk> .
'we 're defeated ! '
'by tactics , too , ' said eames .
'i did n't think you knew 'em , <unk> .
it 's a fair score .
what are you going to do with us ? '
'take you back to mess , ' said mr. wontner .
'not like this ? '
'oh no .
worse  much worse !
i have n't begun with you yet .
and you thought you 'd scored !
yah ! '
they had scored beyond their wildest dream .
the man in whose hands it lay to shame them , their colonel , their adjutant , their regiment , and their service , had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake of a common or <unk> rag  such a rag as if it came to the ears of the authorities , would cost him his commission .
they were saved , and their saviour was their equal and their brother .
so they chaffed and reviled him as such till he again <unk> the breath out of them , and we others laughed louder than they .
<unk> in ! '
said stalky when the <unk> came round .
'this is the score of the century .
i would n't miss it for a brigade !
we <name> n't be long , infant ! '
i hurried into a coat .
'is there any necessity for that <unk> to come too ? '
said mr. wontner in an unguarded whisper .
'he is n't dressed for one thing . '
<name> and eames wriggled round to look at the reporter , began a joyous bellow , and suddenly stopped .
'what 's the matter ? '
said wontner with suspicion .
'nothing , ' said <name> .
'i die happy , <unk> .
take me up tenderly . '
we packed into the car , bearing our sheaves with us , and for half an hour , as the cool <unk> fanned his thoughtful brow , mr. wontner was quite abreast of himself .
though he said nothing unworthy , he triumphed and trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks .
i sat between them on the back seat , and applauded him <unk> till he reminded me that what i had seen and what he had said was not for publication .
i hinted , while the boys plunged with <name> inside their trappings , that this might be a matter for arrangement .
'then a sovereign <name> n't part us , ' said mr. wontner cheerily , and both boys fell into lively hysterics .
'i do n't see where the joke comes in for you , ' said mr. wontner .
'i thought it was my little <unk> to-night . '
'no , <unk> , ' gasped <name> .
'some is , but not all .
i 'll be good now .
i 'll give you my parole till we get to mess .
i would n't be out of this for a fiver . '
<unk> me , ' said eames , and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or evasion .
'now , i suppose , ' said mr. wontner largely to stalky , as we neared the suburbs of ash , 'you have a good deal of practical joking on the stock exchange , have n't you ? '
'and when were you on the stock exchange , uncle <name> ? '
piped <name> , while eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder .
'i 'm sorry , ' said stalky , 'but the fact is , i command a regiment myself when i 'm at home .
your colonel knows me , i think . '
he gave his name .
mr. wontner seemed to have heard of it .
we had to pick eames off the floor , where he had cast himself from excess of delight .
'oh , heavens ! '
said mr. wontner after a long pause .
'what have i done ?
what have n't i done ? '
we felt the temperature in the car rise as he blushed .
'you did n't talk tactics , <unk> ? '
said <name> .
'oh , say it wasn't tactics , darling ! '
'it was , ' said wontner .
eames was all among our feet again , crying , 'if you do n't let me get my arms up , i 'll be sick .
let 's hear what you said .
tell us . '
but mr. wontner turned to stalky .
'it 's no good my begging your pardon , sir , i suppose , ' he said .
'do n't you notice 'em , ' said stalky .
'it was a fair rag all round , and anyhow , you two youngsters have n't any right to talk tactics .
you've been rolled up , horse , foot , and guns . '
'i 'll make a treaty .
if you 'll let us go and change presently , ' said <name> , 'i 'll promise we wo n't tell about you , <unk> .
you talked tactics to uncle <name> ?
old <unk> <name> like that .
he do n't love you , claus . '
'if i 've made one ass of myself , i shall take extra care to make asses of you ! '
said wontner .
'i want to stop , please , at the next <unk> shop on the right .
it ought to be close here . '
he evidently knew the country even in the dark , for the car stopped at a <unk> <unk> establishment , where  it was saturday evening  a young <name> was clearing up the counter .
i followed him , as a good reporter should .
'have you got  ' he began .
'ah , those 'll do ! '
he pointed to two hairy plush <unk> bonnets , one <unk> , the other a conscientious electric blue .
'how much , please ?
i 'll take them both , and that bunch of peacock feathers , and that red feather thing . '
it was a brilliant <unk> pigeon 's wing .
'now i want some yards of muslin with a nice , fierce pattern , please . '
he got it  yellow with black tulips  and returned heavily laden .
'sorry to have kept you , ' said he .
'now we 'll go to my quarters to change and <unk> . '
we came to them  opposite a dun waste of parade-ground that might have been mian mir  and bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set <unk> echoing .
we hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs , while wontner changed into uniform , but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket .
'what on earth 's that for ? '
said he .
'because you 've been wearing my evening things , ' i said .
'i want to get into 'em again , if you do n't mind . '
'then you are n't a reporter ? '
he said .
'no , ' i said , 'but that <name> n't part us . '
'oh , hurry ! '
cried eames in desperate convulsions .
'we ca n't stand this much longer .
't is n't fair on the young . '
'i 'll attend to you in good time , ' said wontner ; and when he had made careful toilet , he <unk> the bonnets , put the peacock 's feather into the <unk> one , pinned the crimson wing on the blue one , set them daintily on the boys ' heads , and bade them admire the effect in his <unk> while he ripped the muslin into lengths , bound it first , and draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees .
he finished off with a gigantic <unk> , <unk> fashion .
<unk> skirts , ' he explained to stalky , who nodded approval .
next he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk , but with very short steps .
'i ought to have got you white satin slippers , ' he murmured , 'and i 'm sorry there 's no rouge . '
'do n't worry on our account , old man  you 're doing us proud , ' said <name> from under his hat .
'this beats <unk> and <unk> . '
'oh , why did n't we think of these things when we had him at our <name> ? '
eames wailed .
'never mind  we 'll try it on the next chap .
you 've a mind , claus . '
'now we 'll call on 'em at mess , ' said wontner , as they <unk> towards the door .
'i think i 'll call on your colonel , ' said stalky .
'he ought n't to miss this .
your first attempt ?
i assure you i could n't have done it better myself .
thank you ! '
he held out his hand .
'thank you , sir ! '
said wontner , shaking it .
'i 'm more grateful to you than i can say , and  and i 'd like you to believe some time that i 'm not quite as big a  ' 'not in the least , ' stalky interrupted .
'if i were writing a confidential report on you , i should put you down as rather adequate .
look after your <unk> , or they 'll fall ! '
we watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the mess verandah .
there was a noise .
then telephone bells rang , a sergeant and a mess waiter charged out , and the noise grew , till at last the mess was a little noisy .
we came back , ten minutes later , with colonel <unk> , who had been taking his sorrows to bed with him .
the ante-room was quite full and visitors were still arriving , but it was possible to hear oneself speak occasionally .
<unk> and eames , in sack and sash , sat side by side on a table , their hats at a <unk> <name> , <unk> <unk> their tied feet .
in the intervals of singing 'put me among the girls , ' they <unk> <unk> held to their lips by , i regret to say , a <name> .
public opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their costume till they should have danced in it .
wontner , lying more or less gracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns , was lecturing on tactics and imploring to be let down , which he was with a run when they realised that the colonel was there .
then he picked himself up from the sofa and said : 'i want to apologise , sir , to you and the mess for having been such an ass ever since i joined ! '
this was when the noise began .
seeing the night promised to be wet , stalky and i went home again in the infant 's car .
it was some time since we had tasted the hot air that lies between the cornice and the ceiling of crowded rooms .
after half an hour 's silence , stalky said to me : 'i do n't know what you 've been doing , but i believe i 've been <unk> ' .
would you put that down to burgundy or <unk> decay ? '
the children these were our children who died for our lands : they were dear in our sight .
we have only the memory left of their <unk> sayings and laughter .
the price of our loss shall be paid to our hands , not another 's hereafter .
neither the alien nor priest shall decide on it .
that is our right .
but who shall return us the children ?
at the hour the barbarian chose to disclose his <unk> , and raged against man , they engaged , on the breasts that they bared for us , the first <unk> of the sword he had <unk> prepared for us  their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences .
they bought us anew with their blood , forbearing to blame us , those hours which we had not made good when the judgment <unk> us .
they believed us and perished for it .
our <unk> , our learning .
delivered them bound to the pit and alive to the burning whither they <unk> hastened as jostling for honour .
not since her birth has our earth seen such worth loosed upon her .
nor was their agony brief , or once only imposed on them .
the wounded , the <unk> , the sick received no <unk> : being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption , hopeless themselves of relief , till death , marvelling , closed on them .
that flesh we had nursed from the first in all <unk> was given to corruption <unk> and assailed by the malice of heaven  by the <unk> jests of decay where it lolled on the wires  to be blanched or <unk> by fumes  to be <unk> by fires  to be <unk> tossed and <unk> in stale mutilation from crater to crater .
for this we shall take <unk> .
but who shall return us our children ?
the dog <unk> ( <name> 1914 ) my friend attley , who would give away his own head if you told him you had lost yours , was giving away a <unk> litter of <unk> <unk> , and half-a-dozen women were in <unk> at the show on <unk> lawn .
we picked by lot .
mrs. godfrey <name> first choice ; her married daughter , second .
i was third , but <unk> my right because i was already owned by malachi , <name> 's full brother , whom i had brought over in the car to visit his nephews and <unk> , and he would have slain them all if i had taken home one .
<name> , mrs. godfrey 's younger daughter , pounced on my rejection with squeals of delight , and attley turned to a dark , <unk> , <unk> girl , who had come over for tennis , and invited her to pick .
she put on a <unk> that made her look like a camel , knelt clumsily , for she was long from the hip to the knee , breathed hard , and considered the last couple .
'i think i 'd like that <unk> one , ' she said .
'oh , not him , miss sichliffe ! '
attley cried .
'he was overlaid or had sunstroke or something .
they call him the <unk> in the <unk> .
besides , he <unk> . '
'i think that 's rather fetching , ' she answered .
neither malachi nor i had ever seen a <unk> dog before .
'that 's <unk>  st. <unk> 's dance , ' mrs. godfrey put in .
'he ought to have been drowned . '
'but i like his cast of countenance , ' the girl persisted .
'he does n't look a good life , ' i said , 'but perhaps he can be patched up . '
miss sichliffe turned crimson ; i saw mrs. godfrey exchange a glance with her married daughter , and knew i had said something which would have to be lived down .
'yes , ' miss sichliffe went on , her voice shaking , 'he is n't a good life , but perhaps i can  patch him up .
come here , sir . '
the <unk> beast lurched toward her , <unk> down his own nose till he fell over his own toes .
then , luckily , <name> ran across the lawn and reminded malachi of their <unk> .
all that family are as queer as dick's <unk> , and fight like man and wife .
i had to separate them , and mrs. godfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it out in silence .
'd'you know what that girl 's father was ? '
mrs. godfrey asked .
'no , ' i replied .
'i <unk> her for her own sake .
she breathes through her mouth . '
'he was a retired doctor , ' she explained .
'he used to pick up <name> young men in the repentant stage , take them home , and patch them up till they were sound enough to be insured .
then he insured them heavily , and let them out into the world again  with an appetite .
of course , no one knew him while he was alive , but he left pots of money to his daughter . '
<unk> legitimate  highly respectable , ' i said .
'but what a life for the daughter ! '
'must n't it have been !
now d'you realise what you said just now ? '
<unk> ; and now you 've made me quite happy , shall we go back to the house ? '
when we reached it they were all inside , sitting in committee on names .
'what shall you call yours ? '
i heard <name> ask miss sichliffe .
<unk> , ' she replied  <unk> 's sauce , you know .
he 's going to be quite saucy when i 've '  she saw mrs. godfrey and me coming through the french window  'when he 's stronger . '
attley , the well-meaning man , to make me feel at ease , asked what i thought of the name .
'oh , splendid , ' i said at random .
'h with an a , a with an r , r with a  ' 'but that 's little <unk> , ' some one said , and they all laughed .
miss sichliffe , her hands joined across her long knees , drawled , 'you ought always to verify your quotations . '
it was not a kindly thrust , but something in the word <unk> ' set the automatic side of my <name> at work on some shadow of a word or phrase that kept itself out of memory 's reach as a cat sits just beyond a dog 's jump .
when i was going home , miss sichliffe came up to me in the twilight , the pup on a <unk> , swinging her big shoes at the end of her <unk> .
<unk> , ' she said in her thick <unk> voice .
'i 'm sorry for what i said to you about <unk> quotations .
i did n't know you well enough and  anyhow , i ought n't to have . '
'but you were quite right about little <unk> , ' i answered .
'the spelling ought to have reminded me . '
'yes , of course .
it 's the spelling , ' she said , and slouched off with the pup sliding after her .
once again my <name> began to worry after something that would have meant something if it had been properly spelled .
i confided my trouble to malachi on the way home , but <name> had bitten him in four places , and he was busy .
weeks later , attley came over to see me , and before his car stopped malachi let me know that <name> was sitting beside the chauffeur .
he greeted her by the <unk> of the neck as she hopped down ; and i greeted mrs. godfrey , attley , and a big basket .
'you 've got to help me , ' said attley <unk> .
we took the basket into the garden , and there staggered out the angular shadow of a <unk> , <unk> terrier , with one imbecile and one delirious ear , and two most hideous <unk> .
<name> and malachi , already at <unk> on the lawn , saw him , let go , and fled in opposite directions .
'why have you brought that fetid hound here ? '
i demanded .
<unk> ?
for you to take care of , ' said attley .
'he 's had distemper , but i 'm going abroad . '
'take him with you .
i wo n't have him .
he 's mentally afflicted . '
'look here , ' attley almost shouted , 'do i strike you as a fool ? '
<unk> , ' said i .
'well , then , if you say so , and <name> says so , that proves i ought to go abroad . '
'will 's wrong , quite wrong , ' mrs. godfrey interrupted ; 'but you must take the pup . '
'my dear boy , my dear boy , do n't you ever give anything to a woman , ' attley snorted .
bit by bit i got the story out of them in the quiet garden ( never a sign from <name> and malachi ) , while <name> stared me out of countenance , first with one <unk> eye and then with the other .
it appeared that , a month after miss sichliffe took him , the dog <name> developed distemper .
miss sichliffe had nursed him herself for some time ; then she carried him in her arms the two miles to <unk> , and wept  actually wept  at attley 's feet , saying that <name> was all she had or expected to have in this world , and attley must cure him .
attley , being by wealth , position , and temperament guardian to all lame dogs , had put everything aside for this <unk> job , and , he asserted , miss sichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since .
'she went home at night , of course , ' he exploded , 'but the rest of the time she simply infested the premises .
goodness knows , i 'm not particular , but it was a scandal .
even the servants ! ...
three and four times a day , and notes in between , to know how the beast was .
<name> it all , do n't laugh !
and wanting to send me flowers and goldfish .
do i look as if i wanted goldfish ?
ca n't you two stop for a minute ? '
( mrs. godfrey and i were clinging to each other for support . )
'and it is n't as if i was  was so alluring a personality , is it ? '
attley commands more trust , goodwill , and affection than most men , for he is that rare <name> , an absolutely unselfish bachelor , content to be run by contending <unk> of zealous friends .
his situation seemed desperate , and i told him so .
<unk> flight is your only remedy , ' was my verdict .
i 'll take care of both your cars while you 're away , and you can send me over all the greenhouse fruit . '
'but why should i be chased out of my house by a <unk> ? '
he wailed .
'oh , stop !
stop ! '
mrs. godfrey sobbed .
'you 're both wrong .
i admit you 're right , but i know you 're wrong . '
'three and four times a day , ' said attley , with an awful countenance .
'i 'm not a vain man , but  look here , <name> , i 'm not sensitive , i <name> , but if you persist in making a joke of it  ' 'oh , be quiet ! '
she almost shrieked .
'd'you imagine for one instant that your friends would ever let <unk> pass out of their hands ?
i quite agree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to <unk> at all hours of the day and night  ' 'i told you she went home o ' nights , ' attley growled .
'specially if she goes home o ' nights .
oh , but think of the life she must have led , <name> ! '
'i 'm not interfering with it ; only she must leave me alone . '
'she may want to patch you up and insure you , ' i suggested .
'd'you know what you are ? '
mrs. godfrey turned on me with the smile i have feared for the last quarter of a century .
'you 're the nice , kind , wise , <unk> friend .
you do n't know how wise and nice you are supposed to be .
<name> has sent <name> to you to complete the poor <unk> convalescence .
you know all about dogs , or <name> would n't have done it .
he 's written her that .
you 're too far off for her to make daily calls on you .
<unk> she 'll drop in two or three times a week , and write on other days .
but it does n't matter what she does , because you do n't own <unk> , do n't you see ? '
i told her i saw most clearly .
'oh , you 'll get over that in a few days , ' mrs. godfrey <unk> .
'you 're the sporting , responsible , <unk> friend who  ' 'he used to look at me like that at first , ' said attley , with a visible shudder , 'but he gave it up after a bit .
it 's only because you 're new to him . '
'but , confound you !
he 's a ghoul  ' i began .
'and when he gets quite well , you 'll send him back to her direct with your love , and she 'll give you some pretty <unk> goldfish , ' said mrs. godfrey , rising .
'that 's all settled .
car , please .
we 're going to brighton to lunch together . '
they ran before i could get into my stride , so i told the dog <name> what i thought of them and his mistress .
he never shifted his position , but stared at me , an intense , <unk> stare , eye after eye .
malachi came along when he had seen his sister off , and from a distance <unk> me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again .
but the dog <name> never even cocked his <unk> ear .
and so it continued as long as he was with me .
where i sat , he sat and stared ; where i walked , he walked beside , head stiffly <unk> over one shoulder in <unk> contemplation of me .
he never gave tongue , never closed in for a caress , seldom let me stir a step alone .
and , to my amazement , malachi , who suffered no stranger to live within our gates , saw this gaunt , growing , <unk> devil wipe him out of my service and company without a whimper .
indeed , one would have said the situation interested him , for he would meet us returning from grim walks together , and look alternately at <name> and at me with the same quivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a <unk> .
outside these <unk> , malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a woman can .
miss sichliffe came over after a few days ( luckily i was out ) with some elaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood .
she sent me a note of thanks next day .
i was reading it when <name> and malachi entered and disposed themselves as usual , <name> close up to stare at me , malachi half under the sofa , watching us both .
out of curiosity i returned <name> 's stare , then pulled his <unk> head on to my knee , and took his eye for several minutes .
now , in malachi 's eye i can see at any hour all that there is of the normal decent dog , flecked here and there with that strained <unk> which man 's love and association have added to his nature .
but with <name> the eye was perplexed , as a tortured man 's .
only by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the proper animal , <unk> and cowering beneath some unfair burden .
leggatt , my chauffeur , came in for orders .
'how d'you think <name> 's coming on ? '
i said , as i rubbed the <unk> <unk> neck .
the <unk> had warned me of the possibilities of spinal trouble following distemper .
'he ai n't my fancy , ' was the reply .
'but i do n't question his <unk> and goings so long as i 'ave n't to sit alone in a room with him . '
'why ?
he 's as meek as <name> , ' i said .
'he fair gives me the creeps .
<unk> he 'll go out in fits . '
but <name> , as i wrote his mistress from time to time , throve , and when he grew better , would play by himself grisly games of spying , walking up , hailing , and chasing another dog .
from these he would break off of a sudden and return to his normal stiff gait , with the air of one who had forgotten some matter of life and death , which could be reached only by staring at me .
i left him one evening <unk> with the unseen on the lawn , and went inside to finish some letters for the post .
i must have been at work nearly an hour , for i was going to turn on the lights , when i felt there was somebody in the room whom , the short hairs at the back of my neck warned me , i was not in the least anxious to face .
there was a mirror on the wall .
as i lifted my eyes to it i saw the dog <name> reflected near the shadow by the closed door .
he had reared himself <unk> on his hind legs , his head a little one side to clear a sofa between us , and he was looking at me .
the face , with its knitted brows and drawn lips , was the face of a dog , but the look , for the fraction of time that i caught it , was human  wholly and horribly human .
when the blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor , and was merely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion .
next day i returned him to miss sichliffe .
i would not have kept him another day for the wealth of <name> , or even <name> godfrey 's approval .
miss sichliffe 's house i discovered to be a <unk> mansion of peculiar villainy even for its period , surrounded by gardens of conflicting colours , all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on ironwork .
striped blinds , for it was a blazing autumn morning , covered most of the windows , and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten song of <name> <unk> 's  methought that the stars were blinking bright , and the old brig 's sails <unk>  down came the loud <unk> , and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a bed of <unk> consuming in their own fires  when i said i <name> sail to my love this night on the other side of the world .
i have no music , but the voice <name> .
i waited till the end : oh , maid most dear , i am not here i have no place apart  no dwelling more on sea or shore , but only in thy heart .
it seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven o'clock of a tuesday forenoon .
then miss sichliffe suddenly lumbered through a french window in clumsy haste , her brows contracted against the light .
'well ? '
she said , delivering the word like a <unk> , with the full weight of a body behind it .
'i 've brought <name> back at last , ' i replied .
'here he is . '
but it was at me she looked , not at the dog who had cast himself at her feet  looked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on the instant .
<unk>  what did you think of him ?
what did you make of him ? '
she panted .
i was too taken aback for the moment to reply .
her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees .
'o <name> , <name> !
you utterly worthless old devil ! '
she cried , and the dog <unk> and <unk> himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon .
i made to go .
'oh , but please , you must n't ! '
she tugged at the car 's side .
<unk> you like some flowers or some orchids ?
we 've really splendid orchids , and '  she clasped her hands  'there are japanese goldfish  real japanese goldfish , with four tails .
if you do n't care for 'em , perhaps your friends or somebody  oh , please ! '
<name> had recovered himself , and i realised that this woman beyond the <unk> was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her .
'certainly , ' i said , ashamed to meet her eye .
'i 'm lunching at <unk> , but  ' 'there 's plenty of time , ' she entreated .
'what do you think of <name> ? '
'he 's a queer beast , ' i said , getting out .
'he does nothing but stare at me . '
'does he stare at you all the time he 's with you ? '
<unk> .
he 's doing it now .
look ! '
we had halted .
<name> had sat down , and was staring from one to the other with a weaving motion of the head .
'he 'll do that all day , ' i said .
'what is it , <name> ? '
'yes , what is it , <name> ? '
she echoed .
the dog 's throat twitched , his body stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit .
then he came back with a visible wrench to his <unk> watch .
<unk> so ? '
she whispered .
<unk> , ' i replied , and told her something of his life with me .
she nodded once or twice , and in the end led me into the house .
there were <unk> <unk> doors of gothic design in it ; there were inlaid marble <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; there were stupendous <unk> , and octagonal , <unk> wedgwood <unk> , and <unk> austrian images holding <unk> , with every other refinement that <name> had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and 1878 .
and everything reeked of varnish .
'now ! '
she opened a <unk> door , and pointed down a long corridor flanked with more gothic doors .
'this was where we used to  to patch 'em up .
you 've heard of us .
mrs. godfrey told you in the garden the day i got <name> given me .
i '  she <name> in her breath  'i live here by myself , and i have a very large income .
come back , <name> . '
he had tiptoed down the corridor , as rigid as ever , and was sitting outside one of the shut doors .
'look here ! '
she said , and planted herself squarely in front of me .
'i tell you this because you  you've patched up <name> , too .
now , i want you to remember that my name is <name> .
mother calls me <name> because it 's more refined ; but my real name is <name> , and i am in my <unk> year . '
'very good , ' i said .
'i 'll remember all that . '
'thank you . '
then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed boy  <unk> if i have n't said the proper things .
you see  there's <name> looking at us again .
oh , i want to say  if ever you want anything in the way of orchids or goldfish or  or anything else that would be useful to you , you 've only to come to me for it .
under the <name> i'm perfectly independent , and we 're a long-lived family , worse luck ! '
she looked at me , and her face worked like glass behind driven flame .
'i may reasonably expect to live another fifty years , ' she said .
'thank you , miss sichliffe , ' i replied .
'if i want anything , you may be sure i 'll come to you for it . '
she nodded .
'now i must get over to <unk> , ' i said .
'mr .
attley <name> ask you all about this . '
for the first time she laughed aloud .
'i 'm afraid i frightened him nearly out of the county .
i didn't think , of course .
but i dare say he knows by this time he was wrong .
say good-bye to <name> . '
'good-bye , old man , ' i said .
'give me a farewell stare , so we shall know each other when we meet again . '
the dog looked up , then moved slowly toward me , and stood , head bowed to the floor , shaking in every muscle as i patted him ; and when i turned , i saw him crawl back to her feet .
that was not a good preparation for the rampant <unk> lunch at <unk> , which , as usual , i found in possession of everybody except the owner .
'but what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back ? '
attley demanded .
'the usual polite things , ' i replied .
'i 'm <unk> as the nice <unk> friend nowadays . '
'i do n't envy you .
she 's never darkened my doors , thank goodness , since i left <name> at your place .
i suppose she 'll run about the county now swearing you cured him .
that 's a woman 's idea of gratitude . '
attley seemed rather hurt , and mrs. godfrey laughed .
'that proves you were right about miss sichliffe , <name> , ' i said .
'she had no designs on anybody . '
'i 'm always right in these matters .
but did n't she even offer you a goldfish ? '
'not a thing , ' said i .
'you know what an old maid 's like where her precious dog 's concerned . '
and though i have tried vainly to lie to <name> godfrey for many years , i believe that in this case i succeeded .
when i turned into our drive that evening , leggatt observed half aloud : 'i 'm glad <unk> 's back where he belongs .
it 's time our <name> had a look in . '
sure enough , there was malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh , but still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from <name> .
* * * * * it was in <name> that attley wrote me that mrs. godfrey , <unk> in madeira with <name> , her unmarried daughter , had been attacked with something like <unk> ; that the hotel , anxious for its good name , had thrust them both out into a cottage <unk> ; that he was off with a nurse , and that i was not to leave england till i heard from him again .
in a week he wired that <name> was down as well , and that i must bring out two more nurses , with suitable delicacies .
within seventeen hours i had got them all aboard the cape boat , and had seen the women safely collapsed into <unk> .
the next few weeks were for me , as for the invalids , a low delirium , clouded with fantastic memories of portuguese officials trying to tax <unk> jelly ; <unk> doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island ; nurses who had to be exercised , taken out of themselves , and returned on the tick of change of guard ; night slides down glassy , <unk> streets , smelling of sewage and flowers , between walls whose every stone and patch attley and i knew ; <unk> in <unk> verandahs , watching the curve and descent of great stars or drawing <unk> from the break of <name> ; insane <unk> of gambling at the local <unk> , where we won heaps of <unk> silver ; blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the roads ; help offered by total strangers , grabbed at or thrust aside ; the long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a <unk> trellis , where attley sat hugging a nurse , while the others danced a noiseless , <unk> breakdown never learned at the <unk> hospital .
at last , as the tension came out all over us in aches and <unk> that we put down to the country wine , a vision of mrs. godfrey , her grey hair turned to <unk> , but her eyes triumphant over the shadow of retreating death beneath them , with <name> , enormously grown , and clutching life back to her young breast , both stretched out on cane chairs , clamouring for food .
in this <unk> hour there imported himself into our life a <unk> middle-aged man of the name of <unk> , with a blurred face and <unk> eyes .
he said he had gambled with me at the <unk> , which was no recommendation , and i remember that he twice gave me a basket of champagne and <unk> <name> for the invalids , which a sailor in a <unk> cap carried up to the cottage for me at 3 <unk> .
he turned out to be the son of some merchant <name> in the oil and colour line , and the owner of a <unk> steam yacht , into which , at his gentle <unk> , we later shifted our camp , staff , and equipage , <name> weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage .
there we lay off <unk> for weeks , while <unk> did miracles of luxury and attendance through deputies , and never once asked how his guests were enjoying themselves .
indeed , for several days at a time we would see nothing of him .
he was , he said , subject to <unk> .
giving as they do with both hands , i knew that attley and mrs. godfrey could take nobly ; but i never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as <unk> did .
'tell us why you have been so <unk> kind to us gipsies , ' mrs. godfrey said to him one day on deck .
he looked up from a diagram of some <unk> shoals which he was explaining to me , and answered with his gentle smile : 'i <name> .
it 's because it makes me happy  it makes me more than happy  to be with you .
it makes me comfortable .
you know how selfish men are ?
if a man feels comfortable all over with certain people , he 'll bore them to death , just like a dog .
you always make me feel as if pleasant things were going to happen to me . '
'have n't any ever happened before ? '
<name> asked .
'this is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many years , ' he replied .
'i feel like the man in the bible , " it 's good for me to be here . "
generally , i do n't feel that it 's good for me to be anywhere in particular . '
then , as one begging a favour .
'you 'll let me come home with you  in the same boat , i mean ?
i 'd take you back in this thing of mine , and that would save you packing your trunks , but she's too lively for spring work across the bay . '
we booked our berths , and when the time came , he wafted us and ours aboard the southampton <unk> with the pomp of <unk> and the precision of the navy .
then he dismissed his yacht , and became an inconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine , on the port side .
we ran at once into early british spring weather , followed by <unk> gales .
mrs. godfrey , <name> , and the nurses disappeared .
attley stood it out , visibly <unk> , till the next meal , and followed suit , and <unk> and i had the little table all to ourselves .
i found him even more attractive when the women were away .
the natural sweetness of the man , his voice , and bearing all fascinated me , and his knowledge of practical <unk> ( he held an extra master 's certificate ) was a real <name> .
we sat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smoking-room , making dashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour .
it was on friday night , just as i was going to bed , that he came into my cabin , after cleaning his teeth , which he did half a dozen times a day .
'i say , ' he began hurriedly , 'do you mind if i come in here for a little ?
i 'm a bit <unk> . '
i must have shown surprise .
'i 'm ever so much better about liquor than i used to be , but  it 's the whisky in the suitcase that throws me .
for god 's sake , old man , do n't go back on me to-night !
look at my hands ! '
they were fairly jumping at the wrists .
he sat down on a trunk that had slid out with the roll .
we had reduced speed , and were surging in confused seas that pounded on the black <unk> .
the night promised to be a pleasant one !
'you understand , of course , do n't you ? '
he chattered .
'oh yes , ' i said cheerily ; 'but how about  ' 'no , no ; on no account the doctor .
'tell a doctor , tell the whole ship .
besides , i 've only got a touch of 'em .
you 'd never have guessed it , would you ?
the <unk> does the trick .
i 'll give you the prescription . '
i 'll send a note to the doctor for a prescription , shall i ? '
i suggested .
<unk> !
i put myself unreservedly in your hands .
<unk> is , i always did .
i said to myself  'sure i do n't bore you ?  the minute i saw you , i said , " thou <name> the man . " '
he repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees .
'all the same , you can take it from me that the <unk> business is a rotten bad one .
i do n't care how unfaithful the shepherd may be .
drunk or sober , 't is n't cricket . '
a surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered my <name> .
i wrote my requisition to the doctor while <unk> was struggling to his feet .
'what 's wrong ? '
he began .
'oh , i know .
we 're <unk> for soundings off <unk> .
it 's about time , too .
you 'd better ship the <unk> when you come back , <unk> .
it 'll save you waking us later .
this sea 's going to get up when the tide turns .
that 'll show you , ' he said as the man left , 'that i am to be trusted .
you  you 'll stop me if i say anything i should n't , wo n't you ? '
<unk> away , ' i replied , 'if it makes you feel better . '
'that 's it ; you 've hit it exactly .
you always make me feel better .
i can rely on you .
it 's awkward soundings but you 'll see me through it .
we'll defeat him yet ... .
i may be an utterly worthless devil , but i 'm not a <unk> ... .
i told him so at breakfast .
i said , " doctor , i detest brawling , but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as <unk> insulted her , i <name> break your neck with my own hands . "
you think i was right ? '
<unk> , ' i agreed .
'then we need n't discuss the matter any further .
that man was a murderer in intention  outside the law , you understand , as it was then .
they've changed it since  but he never deceived me .
i told him so .
i said to him at the time , " i do n't know what price you 're going to put on my head , but if ever you allow <unk> to insult her again , you 'll never live to claim it . " '
'and what did he do ? '
i asked , to <name> on the conversation , for <unk> entered with the <unk> .
'oh , crumpled up at once .
<unk> still going , <unk> ? '
'i 'ave n't 'eard , ' said that faithful servant of the <unk> company .
<unk> right .
never alarm the passengers .
ship the <unk> , <name> you ? '
<unk> shipped it , for we were rolling very heavily .
there were <unk> and <unk> cries from on deck .
<unk> looked at me with a mariner 's eye .
'that 's nothing , ' he said <unk> .
'oh , it 's all right for you , ' i said , jumping at the idea .
'_i haven't an extra master 's certificate .
i 'm only a passenger .
i confess it <unk> me . '
instantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal .
'my dear fellow , it 's as simple as houses .
we 're hunting for sixty-five fathom water .
anything short of sixty , with a <unk> wind means  but i 'll get my channel pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea .
i 'm only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease . '
and so , perhaps , for another hour  he declined the drink  channel pilot in hand , he <unk> us round <unk> , and at my request <unk> to southampton , light by light , with explanations and reminiscences .
i professed myself soothed at last , and suggested bed .
'in a second , ' said he .
'now , you would n't think , would you '  he glanced off the book toward my wildly swaying dressing-gown on the door  'that i 've been seeing things for the last half-hour ?
<unk> is , i 'm just on the edge of 'em , skating on thin ice round the corner  <unk> as near as nothing  where that dog 's looking at me . '
'what 's the dog like ? '
i asked .
'ah , that is comforting of you !
most men walk through 'em to show me they are n't real .
as if i did n't know !
but you're different .
anybody could see that with half an eye . '
he stiffened and pointed .
<unk> it all !
the dog sees it too with half an  why , he knows you !
knows you perfectly .
d'you know him ? '
'how can i tell if he is n't real ? '
i insisted .
'but you can !
you're all right .
i saw that from the first .
do n't go back on me now or i shall go to pieces like the <unk> castle .
i beg your pardon , old man ; but , you see , you do know the dog .
i 'll prove it .
what 's that dog doing ?
come on !
you know . '
a tremor shook him , and he put his hand on my knee , and whispered with great meaning : <unk> letter or <unk> it with you .
there !
you begin . '
's , ' said i to humour him , for a dog would most likely be standing or sitting , or may be scratching or <unk> or staring .
<unk> , ' he went on , and i could feel the heat of his shaking hand .
<unk> , ' said i .
there was no other letter possible ; but i was shaking too .
'i . '
'n . '
<unk> , ' he ran out .
'there !
that proves it .
i knew you knew him .
you do n't know what a relief that is .
between ourselves , old man , he  he's been turning up lately a  a damn sight more often than i cared for .
and a <unk> dog  a dog that <unk> !
i mean that 's a bit too much .
eh ?
what ? '
he gulped and half rose , and i thought that the full tide of delirium would be on him in another sentence .
'not a bit of it , ' i said as a last chance , with my hand over the <unk> .
'why , you 've just proved that i know him ; so there are two of us in the game , anyhow . '
'by jove !
that is an idea !
of course there are .
i knew you 'd see me through .
we 'll defeat them yet .
hi , pup ! ...
he 's gone .
absolutely disappeared ! '
he sighed with relief , and i caught the lucky moment .
'good business !
i expect he only came to have a look at me , ' i said .
'now , get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk . '
he obeyed , protesting that he could not inconvenience me , and in the midst of apologies sank into a dead sleep .
i expected a wakeful night , having a certain amount to think over ; but no sooner had i scrambled into the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side of the world .
in the morning there were apologies , which we got over at breakfast before our party were about .
'i suppose  after this  well , i do n't blame you .
i 'm rather a lonely chap , though . '
his eyes lifted <unk> across the table .
<unk> , ' i replied , 'i 'm not running a <name> school .
you 're coming home with me in my car as soon as we land . '
'that is kind of you  kinder than you think . '
'that 's because you 're a little <unk> still .
now , i do n't want to mix up in your private affairs  ' 'but i 'd like you to , ' he interrupted .
'then , would you mind telling me the <name> name of a girl who was insulted by a man called <unk> ? '
<unk> , ' he whispered ; and just then mrs. godfrey and <name> came to table with their <unk> hats on .
we did not tie up till noon , but the faithful leggatt had <unk> his way down to the <unk> , and beside him sat malachi , wearing his collar of gold , or leggatt makes it look so , as eloquent as demosthenes .
<unk> flinched a little when he saw him .
we packed mrs. godfrey and <name> into attley 's car  they were going with him to <unk> , of course  and <name> clear across the railway lines to find england all lit and perfumed for spring .
<unk> sighed with happiness .
'd'you know , ' he said , 'if  if you 'd chucked me  i should have gone down to my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat .
and now  it 's like a dream  a good dream , you know . '
we lunched with the other three at <unk> .
then i sat in front for a little while to talk to my malachi .
when i looked back , <unk> was solidly asleep , and stayed so for the next two hours , while leggatt chased attley 's fat <unk> along the <unk> hedges .
he woke up when we said good-bye at <unk> , with promises to meet again very soon .
'and i <name> , ' said mrs. godfrey , 'that everything pleasant <name> happen to you . '
<unk> and heaps  all at once , ' cried long , weak <name> , waving her wet handkerchief .
'i 've just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire about a dog , ' i said , 'and then we <name> go home . '
'i used to know this part of the world , ' he replied , and said no more till leggatt shot past the lodge at the <unk> 's gate .
then i heard him gasp .
miss sichliffe , in a green waterproof , an orange jersey , and a pinkish leather hat , was working on a <unk> .
she straightened herself as the car stopped , and breathed hard .
<unk> got out and walked towards her .
they shook hands , turned round together , and went into the house .
then the dog <name> pranced out <unk> from under the <name> of a bench .
malachi , with one joyous swoop , fell on him as an enemy and an equal .
<name> , for his part , freed from all burden whatsoever except the obvious duty of a <unk> on his own ground , met malachi without reserve or remorse , and with six months ' additional growth to come and go on .
'do n't check 'em ! '
cried leggatt , dancing round the flurry .
<unk> both been saving up for each other all this time .
it 'll do 'em worlds of good . '
<unk> , ' i said , 'will you take mr. <unk> 's bag and suitcase up to the house and put them down just inside the door ?
then we <name> go on . '
so i enjoyed the finish alone .
it was a dead heat , and they licked each other 's jaws in amity till <name> , one imploring eye on me , leaped into the front seat , and malachi backed his appeal .
it was theft , but i took him , and we talked all the way home of <unk> and <unk> and bones and baths and the other <unk> facts of life .
that evening after dinner they slept before the fire , with their warm chins across the hollows of my ankles  to each <name> an ankle  till i kicked them upstairs to bed .
* * * * * i was not at <unk> when she came over to announce her engagement , but i heard of it when mrs. godfrey and attley came , forty miles an hour , over to me , and mrs. godfrey called me names of the worst for suppression of information .
'as long as it was n't me , i do n't care , ' said attley .
'i believe you knew it all along , ' mrs. godfrey repeated .
<unk> what made you drive that man literally into her arms ? '
'to ask after the dog <name> , ' i replied .
'then , what 's the beast doing here ? '
attley demanded , for malachi and the dog <name> were deep in a council of the family with <name> , who was being <unk> .
'oh , <name> seemed to think himself de <unk> where he was , ' i said .
'and she has n't sent after him .
you 'd better save <name> before they kill her . '
'there 's been enough lying about that dog , ' said mrs. godfrey to me .
'if he was n't born in lies , he was baptized in 'em .
d'you know why she called him <name> ?
it only occurred to me in those dreadful days when i was ill , and one ca n't keep from thinking , and thinks everything .
d'you know your <unk> ?
what did <name> say about <unk>  with an e ? '
'oh , that's it , is it ? '
i cried <unk> .
'that was why i ought to have verified my quotations .
the spelling defeated me .
wait a moment , and it <name> come back .
<name> said : " he was a vicious man , " ' i began .
' " but very kind to me , " ' mrs. godfrey prompted .
then , both together , ' " if you call a dog <unk> , i shall love him . " '
'so you were mixed up in it .
at any rate , you had your suspicions from the first ?
tell me , ' she said .
<unk> , ' i said , 'i do n't know anything rational or reasonable about any of it .
it was all  all <unk> , and it scared me horribly . '
'why ? '
she asked .
that was six years ago .
i have written this tale to let her know  wherever she may be .
the <unk> until thy feet have trod the road advise not wayside folk , nor till thy back has borne the load break in upon the broke .
<name> not with <unk> largesse of sympathy the heart which , knowing her own bitterness , <unk> to dwell apart .
employ not that glad hand to raise the <unk> head to heaven , and all the neighbours ' gaze  cover thy mouth instead .
the quivering <name> , the bitten lip , the cold and sweating brow , later may yearn for fellowship  not now , you ass , not now !
time , not thy ne'er so timely speech , life , not thy views thereon , shall furnish or deny to each his consolation .
or , if impelled to interfere , <unk> , uplift , advise , lend not a base , betraying ear to all the victim 's cries .
only the lord can understand when those first pangs begin , how much is reflex action and how much is really sin .
e'en from good words thyself refrain , and tremblingly admit there is no <unk> for pain except the shock of it .
so , when thine own dark hour shall fall , unchallenged canst thou say : 'i never worried you at all , for god 's sake go away ! '
the village that voted the earth was flat ( 1913 ) our drive till then had been quite a success .
the other men in the car were my friend woodhouse , young ollyett , a distant connection of his , and pallant , the m.p .
woodhouse 's business was the treatment and cure of sick journals .
he knew by instinct the precise moment in a <unk> life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it fetches up on the <unk> between slow and expensive collapse and the new start which can be given by gold <unk>  and genius .
he was wisely ignorant of journalism ; but when he stooped on a <unk> there was sure to be meat .
he had that week added a <unk> , <unk> evening paper to his collection , which consisted of a prosperous london daily , one provincial ditto , and a <unk> weekly of commercial <unk> .
he had also , that very hour , planted me with a large block of the evening paper 's common shares , and was explaining the whole <name> of <unk> to ollyett , a young man three years from oxford , with <unk> hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh experiences , who , i understood , was assisting in the new venture .
pallant , the long , wrinkled m.p. , whose voice is more like a <unk> than a peacock 's , took no shares , but gave us all advice .
'you 'll find it rather a <unk> 's yard , ' woodhouse was saying .
'yes , i know they call me the <unk> ; but it <name> pay inside a year .
all my papers do .
i 've only one motto : back your luck and back your staff .
it 'll come out all right . '
then the car stopped , and a policeman asked our names and addresses for exceeding the <unk> .
we pointed out that the road ran absolutely straight for half a mile ahead without even a <unk> .
'that 's just what we depend on , ' said the policeman unpleasantly .
'the usual swindle , ' said woodhouse under his breath .
'what 's the name of this place ? '
<unk> , ' said the policeman .
<unk> , ' and wrote something in his note-book at which young ollyett protested .
a large red man on a grey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge shouted an order we could not catch .
the policeman laid his hand on the rim of the right <unk> ( woodhouse carries his spare <unk> aft ) , and it closed on the button of the electric horn .
the grey horse at once bolted , and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape .
<unk> it , man , you 've got your silly fist on it !
take it off ! '
woodhouse shouted .
'ho ! '
said the constable , looking carefully at his fingers as though we had trapped them .
'that wo n't do you any good either , ' and he wrote once more in his note-book before he allowed us to go .
this was woodhouse 's first brush with motor law , and since i expected no ill consequences to myself , i pointed out that it was very serious .
i took the same view myself when in due time i found that i , too , was <unk> on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to <unk> traffic .
judgment was done in a little <unk> <unk> with a small , jubilee <unk> and a large <unk> .
woodhouse drove us there in his car .
pallant , who had not been included in the summons , came with us as moral support .
while we waited outside , the fat man on the grey horse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates .
he said to one of them  for i took the trouble to note it down  'it falls away from my <unk> , dead straight , three-quarters of a mile .
i 'd defy any one to resist it .
we <unk> seventy pounds out of 'em last month .
no car can resist the temptation .
you ought to have one your side the county , <name> .
they simply ca n't resist it . '
<unk> ! '
said woodhouse .
'we 're in for trouble .
do n't you say a word  or ollyett either !
i 'll pay the fines and we 'll get it over as soon as possible .
where 's pallant ? '
'at the back of the court somewhere , ' said ollyett .
'i saw him slip in just now . '
the fat man then took his seat on the bench , of which he was chairman , and i gathered from a <unk> that his name was sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , of <unk> park , huckley .
he began with an <unk> pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires .
evidence , when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause , was given in the pauses of the address .
they were all very proud of their sir <name> , and looked from him to us , wondering why we did not applaud too .
taking its time from the chairman , the bench <unk> with us for seventeen minutes .
sir <name> explained that he was sick and tired of processions of <unk> of our type , who would be better employed breaking stones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves or their ancestors .
this was after it had been proved that <unk> man had turned on the horn purposely to annoy sir <name> , who happened to be riding by ' !
there were other remarks too  primitive enough ,  but it was the unspeakable brutality of the tone , even more than the quality of the justice , or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out of all reason .
when we were dismissed  to the tune of twenty-three pounds , twelve shillings and sixpence  we waited for pallant to join us , while we listened to the next case  one of driving without a <unk> .
ollyett with an eye to his evening paper , had already taken very full notes of our own , but we did not wish to seem prejudiced .
'it 's all right , ' said the reporter of the local paper soothingly .
'we never report sir <name> in <unk> .
only the fines and charges . '
'oh , thank you , ' ollyett replied , and i heard him ask who every one in court might be .
the local reporter was very communicative .
the new victim , a large , <unk> man in somewhat striking clothes , to which sir <name> , now thoroughly warmed , <name> public attention , said that he had left his <unk> at home .
sir <name> asked him if he expected the police to go to his home address at jerusalem to find it for him ; and the court roared .
nor did sir <name> approve of the man 's name , but insisted on calling him 'mr .
<unk> , ' and every time he did so , all his people shouted .
evidently this was their established <unk> .
'he did n't summons me  because i 'm in the house , i suppose .
i think i shall have to ask a question , ' said pallant , <unk> at the close of the case .
'i think i shall have to give it a little publicity too , ' said woodhouse .
'we ca n't have this kind of thing going on , you know . '
his face was set and quite white .
pallant 's , on the other hand , was black , and i know that my very stomach had turned with rage .
ollyett was dum .
'well , let 's have lunch , ' woodhouse said at last .
'then we can get away before the show breaks up . '
we <name> ollyett from the arms of the local reporter , crossed the market square to the red lion and found sir <name> 's 'mr .
<unk> ' just sitting down to beer , beef and pickles .
'ah ! '
said he , in a large voice .
<unk> in misfortune .
wo n't you gentlemen join me ? '
<unk> , ' said woodhouse .
'what did you get ? '
'i have n't decided .
it might make a good turn , but  the public aren't educated up to it yet .
it 's beyond 'em .
if it was n't , that red dub on the bench would be worth fifty a week . '
'where ? '
said woodhouse .
the man looked at him with unaffected surprise .
'at any one of my places , ' he replied .
'but perhaps you live here ? '
'good heavens ! '
cried young ollyett suddenly .
'you are masquerier , then ?
i thought you were ! '
<unk> masquerier . '
he let the words fall with the weight of an international ultimatum .
'yes , that 's all i am .
but you have the advantage of me , gentlemen . '
for the moment , while we were introducing ourselves , i was puzzled .
then i recalled <unk> <unk> <unk>  of enormous <unk>  that had been the unnoticed background of my visits to london for years past .
<unk> of men and women , singers , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of every draped and <unk> brand , all moved on and off in london and the provinces by bat masquerier  with the long <unk> flourish following the final <unk> . '
'_i knew you at once , ' said pallant , the trained m.p. , and i promptly backed the lie .
woodhouse mumbled excuses .
bat masquerier was not moved for or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces .
'i always tell my people there 's a limit to the size of the <unk> , ' he said .
<unk> that and the <unk> does n't take it in .
<unk> ' is the most delicate of all the sciences . '
'there 's one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if i live for the next twenty-four hours , ' said woodhouse , and explained how this would come about .
masquerier stared at him <unk> with <unk> eyes .
'you mean it ? '
he drawled ; the voice was as magnetic as the look .
'_i do , ' said ollyett .
'that business of the horn alone ought to have him off the bench in three months . '
masquerier looked at him even longer than he had looked at woodhouse .
'he told me , ' he said suddenly , 'that my <unk> was jerusalem .
you heard that ? '
'but it was the tone  the tone , ' ollyett cried .
'you noticed that , too , did you ? '
said masquerier .
'that 's the artistic temperament .
you can do a lot with it .
and i 'm bat masquerier , ' he went on .
he dropped his <name> in his fists and scowled straight in front of him ... . 'i made the <unk>  i made the <unk> and the <unk> .
i made 'dal <unk> . '
here ollyett sat straight up , for in common with the youth of that year he worshipped miss <unk> <unk> of the <unk> immensely and unreservedly .
' " is that a dressing-gown or an ulster you 're supposed to be wearing ? "
you heard that ? ...
" and i suppose you had n't time to brush your hair either ? "
you heard that ? ...
now , you hear me ! '
his voice filled the <unk> , then dropped to a whisper as dreadful as a surgeon 's before an operation .
he spoke for several minutes .
pallant muttered 'hear !
hear ! '
i saw ollyett 's eye flash  it was to ollyett that masquerier addressed himself chiefly ,  and woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands .
'are you with me ? '
he went on , gathering us all up in one sweep of the arm .
'when i begin a thing i see it through , gentlemen .
what bat can't break , breaks him !
but i have n't struck that thing yet .
this is no <unk> <unk> show .
this is business to the dead finish .
are you with me , gentlemen ?
good !
now , we 'll pool our assets .
one london morning , and one provincial daily , did n't you say ?
one weekly commercial ditto and one m.p . '
'not much use , i 'm afraid , ' pallant <unk> .
'but privileged .
but privileged , ' he returned .
'and we have also my little team  london , <unk> , liverpool , leeds  i 'll tell you about manchester later  and me !
bat masquerier . '
he breathed the name reverently into his <unk> .
'gentlemen , when our combination has finished with sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , and everything else that is his , sodom and gomorrah <name> be a <unk> bit of <name> england beside 'em .
i must go back to town now , but i trust you gentlemen <name> give me the pleasure of your company at dinner to-night at the chop <unk>  the red <name> room  and we 'll block out the <unk> . '
he laid his hand on young ollyett 's shoulder and added : 'it 's your brains i want . '
then he left , in a good deal of <unk> collar and nickel-plated <unk> , and the place felt less crowded .
we ordered our car a few minutes later .
as woodhouse , ollyett and i were getting in , sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , came out of the hall of justice across the square and mounted his horse .
i have sometimes thought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been saved , but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and must needs shout : 'not off yet ?
you 'd better get away and you 'd better be careful . '
at that moment pallant , who had been buying <unk> , came out of the inn , took sir <name> 's eye and very leisurely entered the car .
it seemed to me that for one instant there was a shade of uneasiness on the <unk> 's <unk> face .
'i <name> , ' said woodhouse after several miles , 'i <name> he 's a widower . '
'yes , ' said pallant .
'for his poor , dear wife 's sake i <name> that , very much indeed .
i suppose he did n't see me in court .
oh , here 's the parish history of huckley written by the rector and here 's your share of the <unk> .
are we all dining with this mr. masquerier to-night ? '
'yes ! '
said we all .
* * * * * if woodhouse knew nothing of journalism , young ollyett , who had graduated in a hard school , knew a good deal .
our <unk> evening paper , which we <name> call the bun to distinguish her from her prosperous morning sister , the cake , was not only diseased but corrupt .
we found this out when a man brought us the <unk> of a new <unk> and demanded <unk> on its prosperity .
ollyett talked pure <unk> to him for three minutes .
otherwise he spoke and wrote <unk>  a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
but though the slang changes the game never alters , and ollyett and i and , in the end , some others enjoyed it immensely .
it was weeks ere we could see the wood for the trees , but so soon as the staff realised that they had proprietors who backed them right or wrong , and specially when they were wrong ( which is the sole secret of journalism ) , and that their fate did not <name> on any passing owner 's passing mood , they did miracles .
but we did not neglect huckley .
as ollyett said our first care was to create an <unk> atmosphere ' round it .
he used to visit the village of <unk> , on a <unk> with a <unk> ; for which reason i left the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract .
yet it was i who <name> first blood .
two inhabitants of huckley wrote to contradict a small , quite solid paragraph in the bun that a <unk> had been seen at huckley and had , 'of course , been shot by the local sportsmen . '
there was some heat in their letters , both of which we published .
our version of how the <unk> got his crest from king <name> was , i grieve to say , so inaccurate that the rector himself  no sportsman as he pointed out , but a lover of accuracy  wrote to us to correct it .
we gave his letter good space and thanked him .
'this priest is going to be useful , ' said ollyett .
'he has the impartial mind .
i shall <unk> him . '
forthwith he created <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of refined tastes who in the bun demanded to know whether this <unk> was the <unk> of his boyhood and whether , by any chance , the fell change of name had been wrought by collusion between a local <unk> and the railway , in the mistaken interests of <unk> refinement .
'for i knew it and loved it with the maidens of my day  <unk> ab <unk> !   as <unk> , ' wrote <unk> .
<unk> from <unk> .
though other papers scoffed , the bun was gravely sympathetic .
several people wrote to deny that huckley had been changed at birth .
only the rector  no philosopher as he pointed out , but a lover of accuracy  had his doubts , which he laid publicly before mr. <unk> .
<unk> who suggested , through the bun , that the little place might have begun life in anglo-saxon days as <unk> ' or among the normans as <unk> , ' on account of its much <name> .
the rector had his own ideas too ( he said it was mostly gravel ) , and <unk> .
<unk> had a fund of reminiscences .
oddly enough  which is seldom the case with free <unk>  our subscribers rather <unk> the correspondence , and contemporaries quoted freely .
'the secret of power , ' said ollyett , 'is not the big stick .
it 's the <unk> stick . '
( this means the <unk> ' quotation of six or seven lines . )
'did you see the <unk> had a middle on " rural <unk> " last week .
that was all huckley .
i 'm doing a " <unk> " on huckley next week . '
our <unk> ' were friday evening accounts of easy <unk> trips round london , illustrated ( we could never get that machine to work properly ) by <unk> maps .
ollyett wrote the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which i always ascribed to the <unk> .
his account of <unk> forest , for instance , was simply young love with its soul at its lips .
but his huckley <unk> ' would have sickened a <unk> .
it chemically combined loathsome familiarity , <unk> suggestion , slimy piety and <unk> <unk> service ' in one fuming <unk> that fairly lifted me off my feet .
'yes , ' said he , after compliments .
'it 's the most vital , arresting and dynamic bit of <unk> i 've done up to date .
non <unk> <name> !  i met sir <name> <unk> in his own park .
he talked to me again .
he inspired most of it . '
'which ?
the " <unk> native drawl , " or " the neglected <unk> of the village children " ? '
i demanded .
'oh , no !
that 's only to bring in the panel doctor .
it 's the last flight we  i 'm proudest of . '
this dealt with 'the <unk> <unk> spreading her dim limbs over the <unk> ' ; with <unk> rabbits ' ; with a herd of <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ; and with the <unk> , <unk> face of their <unk> , scholarly owner  as well known at the <name> agricultural shows as that of our late <unk> . '
' " <unk> " is good and so 's " <unk> , " ' said i , 'but the panel doctor <name> be annoyed about the <unk> . '
'not half as much as sir <name> <name> about his face , ' said ollyett .
'and if you only knew what i 've left out ! '
he was right .
the panel doctor spent his week-end ( this is the advantage of friday articles ) in overwhelming us with a professional <unk> of no interest whatever to our subscribers .
we told him so , and he , then and there , battered his way with it into the <unk> where they are keen on glands , and forgot us altogether .
but sir <name> <unk> was of sterner stuff .
he must have spent a happy week-end too .
the letter which we received from him on monday proved him to be a <unk> <unk> of upright life , for no woman , however remotely interested in a man would have let it pass the home <unk> .
he objected to our references to his own herd , to his own labours in his own village , which he said was a model village , and to our infernal insolence ; but he objected most to our <unk> of his features .
we wrote him <unk> to ask whether the letter was meant for publication .
he , remembering , i presume , the duke of wellington , wrote back , <unk> and be damned . '
'oh !
this is too easy , ' ollyett said as he began heading the letter .
'stop a minute , ' i said .
'the game is getting a little beyond us .
to-night 's the bat dinner . '
( i may have forgotten to tell you that our dinner with bat masquerier in the red <name> room of the chop <unk> had come to be a weekly affair . )
'hold it over till they 've all seen it . '
'perhaps you 're right , ' he said .
'you might waste it . '
at dinner , then , sir <name> 's letter was handed round .
bat seemed to be thinking of other matters , but pallant was very interested .
'i 've got an idea , ' he said presently .
'could you put something into the bun to-morrow about <unk> disease in that fellow 's herd ? '
'oh , plague if you like , ' ollyett replied .
'they 're only five measly shorthorns .
i saw one lying down in the park .
she 'll serve as a <unk> of fact . '
'then , do that ; and hold the letter over meanwhile .
i think i come in here , ' said pallant .
'why ? '
said i .
'because there 's something coming up in the house about <unk> , and because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined you .
<unk> ten days to think it over .
here you are , ' said pallant .
<unk> of commons paper , you see . '
we read : dear pallant  although in the past our paths have not lain much together , i am sure you <name> agree with me that on the floor of the house all members are on a footing of equality .
i make bold , therefore , to approach you in a matter which i think capable of a very different interpretation from that which perhaps was put upon it by your friends .
<name> you let them know that that was the case and that i was in no way swayed by animus in the exercise of my <unk> duties , which as you , as a brother magistrate , can imagine are frequently very distasteful to  yours very sincerely , t. <unk> .
<unk>  i have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in my district .
'what did you answer ? '
said ollyett , when all our opinions had been expressed .
'i told him i could n't do anything in the matter .
and i could n't  then .
but you 'll remember to put in that <unk> paragraph .
i want something to work upon . '
'it seems to me the bun has done all the work up to date , ' i suggested .
'when does the cake come in ? '
<unk> cake , ' said woodhouse , and i remembered afterwards that he spoke like a cabinet minister on the <name> of a budget , <unk> to itself the fullest right to deal with situations as they arise . '
<unk> ! '
bat masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts .
' " situations as they arise . "
i ai n't idle either .
but there 's no use fishing till the swim 's baited .
you '  he turned to ollyett  <unk> very good <unk> ... .
i always tell my people  what the deuce is that ? '
there was a burst of song from another private dining-room across the landing .
'it <unk> some ladies from the <unk> , ' the waiter began .
'oh , i know that .
what are they singing , though ? '
he rose and went out , to be greeted by shouts of applause from that <name> company .
then there was silence , such as one hears in the form-room after a master 's entry .
then a voice that we loved began again : 'here we go gathering nuts in may  nuts in may  nuts in may ! '
'it 's only 'dal  and some nuts , ' he explained when he returned .
'she says she 's coming in to dessert . '
he sat down , humming the old tune to himself , and till miss <unk> <unk> entered , he held us speechless with tales of the artistic temperament .
we obeyed pallant to the extent of slipping into the bun a wary paragraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth , which might be read either as an unkind libel or , in the hands of a capable lawyer , as a piece of faithful <unk> .
'and besides , ' said ollyett , 'we allude to " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
i am advised that no action can lie in respect of virgin shorthorns .
pallant wants us to come to the house to-night .
he 's got us places for the strangers ' gallery .
i 'm beginning to like pallant . '
<unk> seems to like you , ' i said .
'yes , but i 'm afraid of him , ' ollyett answered with perfect sincerity .
'i am .
he 's the absolutely <unk> soul .
i 've never met one yet . '
we went to the house together .
it happened to be an <name> afternoon , and as soon as i had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out , i gathered there were grievances in the air , but how many of them was beyond me .
'it 's all right , ' said ollyett of the trained ear .
'they 've shut their ports against  oh yes  export of <name> cattle !
<unk> disease at <unk> .
i see pallant 's idea ! '
the house was certainly all mouth for the moment , but , as i could feel , quite in <name> .
a minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to be <unk> off volleys of insults .
he reminded me somehow of a nervous huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds .
'it 's <unk> .
they 're asking questions , ' said ollyett .
'look !
pallant 's up . '
there was no mistaking it .
his voice , which his enemies said was his one parliamentary <unk> , silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere singing in the ears .
he said : <unk> out of that , may i ask if any special consideration has recently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease on this side of the channel ? '
he raised his hand ; it held a noon edition of the bun .
we had thought it best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones .
he would have continued , but something in a grey frock-coat roared and bounded on a bench opposite , and waved another bun .
it was sir <name> <unk> .
'as the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated  ' his voice was drowned in shouts of <unk> ! '
 the <name> leading .
'what 's wrong ? '
i asked ollyett .
'he 's got his hat on his head , hasn't he ? '
'yes , but his wrath should have been put as a question . '
<unk> out of that , mr. speaker , <unk> ! '
sir <name> bellowed through a lull , 'are you aware that  that all this is a conspiracy  part of a dastardly conspiracy to make huckley ridiculous  to make us ridiculous ?
part of a <unk> plot to make me ridiculous , mr. speaker , sir ! '
the man 's face showed almost black against his white whiskers , and he struck out <unk> with his arms .
his vehemence puzzled and held the house for an instant , and the speaker took advantage of it to lift his pack from ireland to a new scent .
he addressed sir <name> <unk> in tones of measured rebuke , meant also , i imagine , for the whole house , which lowered its hackles at the word .
then pallant , shocked and pained : 'i can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple question the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a personal attack .
if i have in any way offended  ' again the speaker intervened , for it appeared that he regulated these matters .
he , too , expressed surprise , and sir <name> sat back in a hush of <unk> that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it .
the empire 's work was resumed .
<unk> ! '
said i , and i felt hot and cold up my back .
'and now we 'll publish his letter , ' said ollyett .
we did  on the heels of his carefully reported outburst .
we made no comment .
with that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation which is the <name> of the anglo-saxon , all our contemporaries and , i should say , two-thirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person could be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be .
but beyond spelling his name <unk> , ' we alone refused to hit a man when he was down .
'there 's no need , ' said ollyett .
'the whole press is on the buckle from end to end . '
even woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had come about , and said as much .
<unk> ! '
said ollyett .
'we have n't really begun .
huckley is n't news yet . '
'what do you mean ? '
said woodhouse , who had grown to have great respect for his young but by no means distant connection .
<unk> ?
by the <name> of god , master ridley , i mean to have it so that when huckley turns over in its sleep , <unk> and the press association jump out of bed to cable . '
then he went off at score about certain <unk> in huckley church which , he said  and he seemed to spend his every week-end there  had been perpetrated by the <unk> predecessor , who had abolished a <unk> ' or a <unk> ( whatever these may be ) to institute a lavatory in the vestry .
it did not strike me as stuff for which <unk> or the press association would lose much sleep , and i left him <unk> to woodhouse about a <unk> font which , he said , he had unearthed in the <unk> <unk> .
my methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration .
an odd copy , in the <unk> <unk> library , of <unk> 's every-day book had revealed to me the existence of a village dance founded , like all village dances , on <unk> mysteries connected with the solar <unk> ( which is always <unk> ) and <unk> morning , which is dewy and refreshing to the london eye .
for this i take no credit  <unk> being a mine any one can work  but that i <unk> that dance , after i had revised it , 'the <unk> ' is my title to immortal fame .
it was still to be witnessed , i wrote , 'in all its poignant purity at huckley , that last home of significant <unk> <unk> ' ; and i fell so in love with my creation that i kept it back for days , <unk> and <unk> .
'you 's better put it in , ' said ollyett at last .
'it 's time we asserted ourselves again .
the other fellows are beginning to <unk> .
you saw that thing in the pinnacle about sir <name> 's model village ?
he must have got one of their chaps down to do it . '
<unk> like the wounds of a friend , ' i said .
'that account of the <unk> pub alone was  ' 'i liked the bit best about the <unk> <unk> and the fallen virgins who wash sir <name> 's dress shirts .
our side could n't come within a mile of that , you know .
we have n't the proper <unk> for sexual <unk> . '
'that 's what i 'm always saying , ' i retorted .
<unk> 'em alone .
the other fellows are doing our work for us now .
besides i want to touch up my " <unk> dance " a little more . '
'no .
you 'll spoil it .
let 's shove it in to-day .
for one thing it's literature .
i do n't go in for compliments as you know , but , etc .
etc . '
i had a healthy suspicion of young ollyett in every aspect , but though i knew that i should have to pay for it , i fell to his flattery , and my priceless article on the <unk> dance ' appeared .
next saturday he asked me to bring out the bun in his absence , which i naturally assumed would be connected with the little <unk> <unk> .
i was wrong .
on the following monday i glanced at the cake at <unk> to make sure , as usual , of her inferiority to my beloved but <unk> bun .
i opened on a heading : 'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
i read ...
i read that the <unk> society  a society devoted to the proposition that the earth is flat  had held its annual banquet and exercises at huckley on saturday , when after convincing addresses , amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm , huckley village had decided by an unanimous vote of 438 that the earth was flat .
i do not remember that i breathed again till i had finished the two columns of description that followed .
only one man could have written them .
they were flawless  crisp , nervous , austere yet human , poignant , vital , arresting  most distinctly arresting  dynamic enough to shift a city  and <unk> by whole sticks at a time .
and there was a leader , a grave and poised leader , which tore me in two with mirth , until i remembered that i had been left out  <unk> and <unk> dropped .
i went to ollyett 's rooms .
he was <unk> , and , to do him justice , looked <unk> .
'it was n't my fault , ' he began .
'it was bat masquerier .
i swear i would have asked you to come if  ' 'never mind that , ' i said .
'it 's the best bit of work you 've ever done or <name> do .
did any of it happen ? '
<unk> ?
heavens !
d'you think even i could have invented it ? '
'is it exclusive to the cake ? '
i cried .
'it cost bat masquerier two thousand , ' ollyett replied .
'd'you think he 'd let any one else in on that ?
but i give you my sacred word i knew nothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it .
he had huckley posted in three colours , " the <unk> ' annual banquet and exercises . "
yes , he invented " <unk> . "
he wanted huckley to think it meant <unk> .
yes , i know that there is a real society that thinks the world 's flat  they ought to be grateful for the lift  but bat made his own .
he did !
he created the whole show , i tell you .
he swept out half his halls for the job .
think of that  on a saturday !
they  we went down in motor <unk>  three of 'em  one pink , one primrose , and one <unk> blue  twenty people in each one and " the earth is flat " on each side and across the back .
i went with <name> <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> , and both the <unk> sisters , and  wait a minute !  the <unk> trio .
you know the every-day dramas trio at the <unk>  <name> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> , and little <unk> ?
them .
and there was <unk> <unk> , the <unk> chap in <unk> and <unk>  and there was <name> <unk> .
yes , you know him !
the north london <name> .
" i 'm the <unk> that got himself disliked at blackheath . "
that chap !
and there was <unk>  that one-eyed scotch fellow that all glasgow is crazy about .
talk of <unk> yourself for <name> 's sake !
<unk> was the <name> inquirer who got converted at the end of the meeting .
and there was quite a lot of girls i did n't know , and  oh , yes  there was 'dal !
'dal <unk> herself !
we sat together , going and coming .
she 's all the darling there ever was .
she sent you her love , and she told me to tell you that she wo n't forget about <name> <unk> .
she says you 've given her an ideal to work for .
she ?
oh , she was the <name> secretary to the <unk> , of course .
i forget who were in the other brakes  provincial stars mostly  but they played up gorgeously .
the <name> of the <unk> 's changed since your day .
they did n't <unk> it a bit .
you see , people who believe the earth is flat do n't dress quite like other people .
you may have noticed that i hinted at that in my account .
it 's a rather <unk> <unk> style  <unk> , except for the <unk> , 'dal told me ,  but 'dal looked heavenly in it !
so did little <unk> .
and there was a girl in the blue brake  she 's a provincial  but she 's coming to town this <name> and she 'll knock 'em  <name> <unk> .
remember that !
she told huckley how she had suffered for the cause as a governess in a <name> family where they believed that the world is round , and how she threw up her job sooner than teach immoral geography .
that was at the overflow meeting outside the baptist chapel .
she knocked 'em to sawdust !
we must look out for <name> ... .
but <unk> !
<unk> was beyond everything .
impact , personality  conviction  the whole bag o ' tricks !
he sweated conviction .
gad , he convinced me while he was speaking !
( him ?
he was president of the <unk> , of course .
have n't you read my account ? )
it is an <unk> plausible theory .
after all , no one has actually proved the earth is round , have they ? '
'never mind the earth .
what about huckley ? '
'oh , huckley got tight .
that 's the worst of these model villages if you let 'em smell <unk> .
there 's one <unk> pub in the place that sir <name> ca n't get rid of .
bat made it his base .
he sent down the banquet in two motor <unk>  dinner for five hundred and drinks for ten thousand .
huckley voted all right .
do n't you make any mistake about that .
no vote , no dinner .
a unanimous vote  exactly as i 've said .
at least , the rector and the doctor were the only <unk> .
we didn't count them .
oh yes , sir <name> was there .
he came and grinned at us through his park gates .
he 'll grin worse to-day .
there 's an <unk> dye that you rub through a <unk> that eats about a foot into any stone and wears good to the last .
bat had both the <unk> <unk> " the earth is flat ! "
and all the barns and walls they could get at ... . oh lord , but huckley was drunk !
we had to fill 'em up to make 'em forgive us for not being <unk> .
<unk> <unk> !
d'you realise that emperors could n't have commanded the talent bat <unk> on 'em ?
why , 'dal alone was ... . and by eight o'clock not even a bit of paper left !
the whole show packed up and gone , and huckley <unk> for the earth being flat . '
'very good , ' i began .
'i am , as you know , a one-third proprietor of the bun . '
'i did n't forget that , ' ollyett interrupted .
'that was uppermost in my mind all the time .
i 've got a special account for the bun to-day  it's an <unk>  and just to show how i thought of you , i told 'dal , coming home , about your <unk> dance , and she told <name> .
<name> came back in our <unk> .
after a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field .
it 's quite a dance the way we did it  and <unk> invented a sort of gorilla <unk> procession at the end .
bat had sent down a <unk> on the chance of getting something .
he was the son of a clergyman  a most dynamic personality .
he said there is n't anything for the <unk> in meetings <unk> meetings  they lack action .
films are a branch of <name> by themselves .
but he went wild over the <unk> .
he said it was like peter's vision at <unk> .
he took about a million feet of it .
then i <unk> it exclusive for the bun .
i 've sent 'em in already , only remember we must eliminate <name> 's left leg in the first figure .
it 's too arresting ... . and there you are !
but i tell you i 'm afraid of bat .
that man 's the personal devil .
he did it all .
he did n't even come down himself .
he said he 'd distract his people . '
'why did n't he ask me to come ? '
i persisted .
'because he said you 'd distract me .
he said he wanted my brains on ice .
he got 'em .
i believe it 's the best thing i 've ever done . '
he reached for the cake and <unk> it luxuriously .
'yes , out and away the best  supremely <unk> , ' he concluded , and  after another survey  'by god , what a genius i was yesterday ! '
i would have been angry , but i had not the time .
that morning , press agencies <unk> to me in the bun office for leave to use certain photos , which , they understood , i controlled , of a certain village dance .
when i had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears , my self-respect came back a little .
then there was the <unk> poster to get out .
<name> being elimination , i fined it down to two words ( one too many , as it proved )  'the <unk> ! '
in red , at which our manager protested ; but by five o'clock he told me that i was the <name> of fleet street .
ollyett 's account in the bun of the <unk> exercises and love feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in the cake , but it bruised more ; while the photos of 'the <unk> ' ( which , with <name> 's left leg , was why i had set the doubtful press to work so early ) were beyond praise and , next day , beyond price .
but even then i did not understand .
a week later , i think it was , bat masquerier telephoned to me to come to the <unk> .
'it 's your turn now , ' he said .
'i 'm not asking ollyett .
come to the <unk> . '
i went , and , as bat 's guest , was received as royalty is not .
we sat well back and looked out on the packed thousands .
it was <unk> and <unk> , that fluid and electric review which bat  though he gave <unk> the credit  really created .
<unk> , ' said bat dreamily , after <unk> had given 'the nasty jar ' to the forty thieves in their forty oil <unk> . '
'as you say , i've got 'em and i can hold 'em .
what a man does does n't matter much ; and how he does it do n't matter either .
it 's the when  the psychological moment .
<unk> ca n't make up for it ; money ca n't ; brains ca n't .
a <unk> luck , but all the rest is genius .
i 'm not speaking about my people now .
i 'm talking of myself . '
then 'dal  she was the only one who dared  knocked at the door and stood behind us all alive and panting as <unk> .
<unk> was carrying the <unk> scene , and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter .
'ah !
tell a fellow now , ' she asked me for the twentieth time , 'did you love <name> <unk> when you were young ? '
'did we love her ? '
i answered .
' " if the earth and the sky and the sea "  there were three million of us , 'dal , and we worshipped her . '
'how did she get it across ? '
<unk> went on .
'she was <name> .
the houses used to <unk> over her when she came on . '
'i 've had a good deal , but i 've never been cooed over yet , ' said 'dal wistfully .
'it is n't the how , it 's the when , ' bat repeated .
'ah ! '
he leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal <unk> .
'dal fled .
a sinuous and silent procession was filing into the <unk> to a scarcely audible accompaniment .
it was dressed  but the world and all its <unk> know how it was dressed .
it danced and it danced , and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in the leg for half a year , and it wound up with the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the house down in <unk> , sobbing and aching .
somebody in the gallery moaned , 'oh <unk> , the <unk> ! '
and we heard the word run like a shudder , for they had not a full breath left among them .
then 'dal came on , an electric <name> in her dark hair , the diamonds flashing in her <unk> heels  a vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds while the <unk> scene dissolved behind her into <unk> <unk> palace , and they recovered themselves .
the <name> on her forehead went out , and a soft light bathed her as she took  slowly , slowly to the <unk> of adoring strings  the eighteen paces forward .
we saw her first as a <name> alone ; next as a <name> for the first time conscious of her subjects , and at the end , when her hands fluttered , as a woman delighted , awed not a little , but transfigured and illuminated with sheer , compelling affection and goodwill .
i caught the broken mutter of welcome  the <unk> which is more than <unk> of applause .
it died and rose and died again lovingly .
'she 's got it across , ' bat whispered .
'i 've never seen her like this .
i told her to light up the <name> , but i was wrong , and she knew it .
she's an artist . '
<unk> , you darling ! '
some one spoke , not loudly but it carried through the house .
'thank you ! '
'dal answered , and in that broken tone one heard the last fetter riveted .
'good evening , boys !
i 've just come from  now  where the <unk> was it i have come from ? '
she turned to the impassive files of the <unk> dancers , and went on : 'ah , so good of you to remind me , you dear , <unk> things .
i 've just come from the village  the village that voted the earth was flat . '
she swept into that song with the full orchestra .
it <unk> the habitable earth for the next six months .
imagine , then , what its rage and pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth !
she only gave the chorus once .
at the end of the second verse , 'are you with me , boys ? '
she cried , and the house tore it clean away from her  <unk> was flat  earth was flat .
flat as my hat  flatter than that '  drowning all but the <unk> and <unk> that marked the word .
<unk> , ' i said to bat .
'and it 's only " nuts in may , " with variations . '
'yes  but i did the variations , ' he replied .
at the last verse she <unk> to <unk> the conductor , who threw her up his baton .
she caught it with a boy 's ease .
'are you with me ? '
she cried once more , and  the maddened house behind her  abolished all the instruments except the guttural <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> '  'the village that voted the earth was flat  earth was flat ! '
it was delirium .
then she picked up the <unk> dancers and led them in a clattering improvised <unk> thrice round the stage till her last kick sent her <unk> shoe <unk> to the <unk> .
i saw the forest of hands raised to catch it , heard the roaring and stamping pass through <unk> to full typhoon ; heard the song , pinned down by the faithful <unk> as the bull-dog pins down the bellowing bull , <unk> even those ; till at last the curtain fell and bat took me round to her dressing-room , where she lay spent after her seventh call .
still the song , through all those <unk> walls , shook the reinforced concrete of the <unk> as steam <unk> shake the flanks of a dock .
'i 'm all out  first time in my life .
ah !
tell a fellow now , did i get it across ? '
she whispered huskily .
'you know you did , ' i replied as she dipped her nose deep in a <unk> of <unk> .
'they cooed over you . '
bat nodded .
'and poor <name> 's dead  in africa , ai n't it ? '
'i <name> i 'll die before they stop cooing , ' said 'dal .
' " earth was flat  earth was flat ! " '
now it was more like <unk> in flood .
'they 'll have the house down if you do n't take another , ' some one called .
<unk> 'em ! '
said 'dal , and went out for her eighth , when in the face of that cataract she said yawning , 'i do n't know how you feel , children , but i 'm dead .
you be quiet . '
'hold a minute , ' said bat to me .
'i 've got to hear how it went in the provinces .
<name> <unk> had it in manchester , and <unk> at glasgow  and there are all the films too .
i had rather a heavy week-end . '
the <unk> presently reassured him .
'it 'll do , ' said he .
'and he said my home address was jerusalem . '
he left me humming the refrain of 'the holy city . '
like ollyett i found myself afraid of that man .
when i got out into the street and met the <unk> <unk> capering on the pavements and humming it ( for he had put the <unk> on with the films ) , and when i saw far to the south the red electrics flash <unk> ' across the thames , i feared more than ever .
* * * * * a few days passed which were like nothing except , perhaps , a suspense of fever in which the sick man perceives the <unk> of the world's assembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of wreckage  one only in all the black and <unk> sea .
then those beams focussed themselves .
earth as we knew it  the full circuit of our orb  laid the weight of its impersonal and <unk> curiosity on this huckley which had voted that it was flat .
it asked for news about huckley  where and what it might be , and how it talked  it knew how it danced  and how it thought in its wonderful soul .
and then , in all the zealous , merciless press , huckley was laid out for it to look at , as a drop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a <unk> show .
but huckley 's sheet was only <unk> with the use of type among mankind .
for the precise moment that was necessary , fate ruled it that there should be nothing of first importance in the world 's idle eye .
one atrocious murder , a political crisis , an <unk> or <unk> continental statesman , the mere <unk> of a king , would have wiped out the significance of our message , as a passing cloud <unk> the urgent <unk> .
but it was <unk> weather in every respect .
ollyett and i did not need to lift our little fingers any more than the alpine climber whose last sentence has <unk> the arch of the avalanche .
the thing roared and <unk> and swept beyond eyesight all by itself  all by itself .
and once well away , the fall of kingdoms could not have diverted it .
ours is , after all , a kindly earth .
while the song ran and <unk> it with the <unk> kick of <unk> , ' multiplied by the west african significance of <unk> 's doing it , ' plus twice the infernal <unk> of a certain tune in <name> et <unk> ; when for all practical purposes , literary , dramatic , artistic , social , municipal , political , commercial , and administrative , the earth was flat , the rector of huckley wrote to us  again as a lover of accuracy  to point out that the huckley vote on 'the alleged flatness of this scene of our labours here below ' was not unanimous ; he and the doctor having voted against it .
and the great baron <unk> himself ( i am sure it could have been none other ) flashed that letter in full to the front , back , and both wings of this scene of our labours .
for huckley was news .
the bun also contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake .
'we are a vital nation , ' said ollyett while we were discussing affairs at a bat dinner .
'only an englishman could have written that letter at this present juncture . '
'it reminded me of a tourist in the cave of the winds under niagara .
just one figure in a mackintosh .
but perhaps you saw our photo ? '
i said proudly .
'yes , ' bat replied .
'i 've been to niagara , too .
and how 's huckley taking it ? '
'they do n't quite understand , of course , ' said ollyett .
'but it's bringing pots of money into the place .
ever since the <unk> excursions were started  ' 'i did n't know they had been , ' said pallant .
'oh yes .
motor <unk>  uniformed guides and <unk> included .
they 're getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays , ' ollyett added .
'they play it under his windows , do n't they ? '
bat asked .
'he ca n't stop the right of way across his park . '
'he can not , ' ollyett answered .
'by the way , woodhouse , i 've bought that font for you from the sexton .
i paid fifteen pounds for it . '
'what am i supposed to do with it ? '
asked woodhouse .
'you give it to the <name> and <name> museum .
it is <unk> work all right .
you can trust me . '
'is it worth it  now ? '
said pallant .
'not that i 'm weakening , but merely as a matter of tactics ? '
'but this is true , ' said ollyett .
<unk> , it is my hobby , i always wanted to be an architect .
i 'll attend to it myself .
it 's too serious for the bun and miles too good for the cake . '
he broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly , which had never heard of huckley .
there was no passion in his statement , but mere fact backed by a wide range of authorities .
he established beyond doubt that the old font at huckley had been thrown out , on sir <unk> <unk> , twenty years ago , to make room for a new one of bath stone adorned with <unk> <unk> ; and that it had lain ever since in a corner of the sexton 's shed .
he proved , with learned men to support him , that there was only one other font in all england to compare with it .
so woodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful south kensington which said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the treasure to <unk> huckley .
bishops by the <unk> and most of the <name> academy , not to mention <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' wrote fervently to the papers .
punch based a political <unk> on it ; the times a third leader , 'the lust of newness ' ; and the spectator a scholarly and delightful middle , <unk> <unk> . '
the vast amused outside world said in all its tongues and types : 'of course !
this is just what huckley would do ! '
and neither sir <name> nor the rector nor the sexton nor any one else wrote to deny it .
'you see , ' said ollyett , 'this is much more of a blow to huckley than it looks  because every word of it 's true .
your <unk> dance was inspiration , i admit , but it had n't its roots in  ' 'two hemispheres and four continents so far , ' i pointed out .
<unk> roots in the hearts of huckley was what i was going to say .
why do n't you ever come down and look at the place ?
you 've never seen it since we were stopped there . '
'i 've only my <unk> free , ' i said , 'and you seem to spend yours there pretty regularly  with the <unk> .
i was afraid  ' 'oh , that's all right , ' he said cheerily .
'we 're quite an old engaged couple now .
as a matter of fact , it happened after " the <unk> <unk> <unk> " business .
come along this saturday .
woodhouse says he 'll run us down after lunch .
he wants to see huckley too . '
pallant could not accompany us , but bat took his place .
'it 's odd , ' said bat , 'that none of us except ollyett has ever set eyes on huckley since that time .
that 's what i always tell my people .
local colour is all right after you 've got your idea .
before that , it 's a mere nuisance . '
he <unk> us on the way down with <unk> views of the success  geographical and financial  of 'the <unk> ' and the song .
'by the way , ' said he , 'i 've assigned 'dal all the <unk> rights of " the earth . "
she 's a born artist .
'had n't sense enough to hit me for <unk> the morning after .
she 'd have taken it out in <unk> . '
<unk> her !
and what 'll she make out of the <unk> rights ? '
i asked .
<unk> knows ! '
he replied .
'i 've made fifty-four thousand my little end of the business , and it 's only just beginning .
hear that ! '
a <unk> <unk> roared up behind us to the music on a <unk> of 'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
in a few minutes we overtook another , in natural wood , whose occupants were singing it through their noses .
'i do n't know that agency .
it must be cook 's , ' said ollyett .
'they do suffer . '
we were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way to huckley .
though i knew it would be so , i was disappointed with the actual aspect of the spot we had  it is not too much to say  created in the face of the nations .
the <unk> pub ; the village green ; the baptist chapel ; the church ; the sexton 's shed ; the <unk> whence the <unk> letters had come ; sir <name> 's park <unk> still violently declaring 'the earth is flat , ' were as mean , as average , as ordinary as the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed .
ollyett , who , of course , knew the place specially well , made the most of it to us .
bat , who had employed it as a <unk> to one of his own dramas , dismissed it as a thing used and emptied , but woodhouse expressed my feelings when he said : 'is that all  after all we 've done ? '
'_i know , ' said ollyett soothingly .
' " like that strange song i heard apollo sing : when <unk> like a mist rose into towers . "
i 've felt the same sometimes , though it has been paradise for me .
but they do suffer . '
the fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into sir <unk> park to tell the hall that 'the earth was flat ' ; a knot of obviously american tourists were <unk> his <unk> ; while the <unk> opposite the <unk> was full of people buying <unk> of the old font as it had lain twenty years in the sexton 's shed .
we went to the <unk> pub and congratulated the proprietor .
'it 's bringin ' money to the place , ' said he .
'but in a sense you can buy money too dear .
it is n't doin ' us any good .
people are laughin ' at us .
that 's what they 're doin ' ... . now , with regard to that vote of ours you may have heard talk about ... <unk> 'for <unk> sake , <name> that <unk> ' business , ' cried an elderly man at the door .
<unk> ' or no <unk> ' , we 're fed up with it . '
'well , i do think , ' said the publican , shifting his ground , 'i do think sir <name> might <name> ' managed better in some things . '
'he tole me , '  the elderly man shouldered his way to the bar  'he tole me twenty years ago to take an ' lay that font in my <unk> .
he tole me so himself .
an ' now , after twenty years , me own wife makin ' me out little better than the common <unk> ! '
'that 's the sexton , ' the publican explained .
'his good <name> sells the <unk>  if you 'ave n't got some .
but we feel sir <name> might ha' done better . '
'what 's he got to do with it ? '
said woodhouse .
'there 's nothin ' we can trace 'ome to 'im in so many words , but we think he might 'ave saved us the font business .
now , in regard to that <unk> business  ' <unk> it !
oh , <name> it ! '
the sexton roared , 'or you 'll 'ave me <unk> my throat at <unk> .
'ere 's another parcel of <unk> ! '
a <unk> had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and women immediately descended .
we went out to look .
they bore rolled banners , a <unk> in three pieces , and , i specially noticed , a <unk> <unk> , such as is used on ships at sea .
<unk> army ? '
i said , though i saw no uniforms .
two of them <unk> a banner between poles which bore the legend : 'the earth is flat . '
woodhouse and i turned to bat .
he shook his head .
'no , no !
not me ... .
if i had only seen their costumes in advance ! '
'good lord ! '
said ollyett .
'it 's the genuine society ! '
the company advanced on the green with the precision of people well broke to these movements .
<unk> could not have been quicker with the <unk> rostrum , nor stewards with the <unk> .
almost before its <unk> had been kicked into their catches , certainly before the tourists by the <unk> had begun to move over , a woman sat down to it and struck up a hymn : hear ther truth our tongues are telling , spread ther light from shore to shore , god hath given man a dwelling flat and flat for evermore .
when ther primal dark retreated , when ther deeps were <unk> , he with rule and level <unk> habitation for mankind !
i saw sick envy on bat 's face .
<unk> nature , ' he muttered .
'she gets ahead of you every time .
to think i forgot hymns and a <unk> ! '
then came the chorus : hear ther truth our tongues are telling , spread ther light from shore to shore  oh , be faithful !
oh , be truthful !
earth is flat for evermore .
they sang several verses with the fervour of christians awaiting their lions .
then there were <unk> in the air .
the sexton , embraced by the landlord , <unk> out of the <unk> .
each was trying to <unk> the other .
<unk> in <unk> for what he says , ' the landlord shouted : 'you 'd better go away ' ( here the sexton began to speak words ) .
'this is n't the time nor yet the place for  for any more o ' this chat . '
the crowd thickened .
i saw the village <unk> come out of his cottage <unk> his belt .
'but surely , ' said the woman at the <unk> , 'there must be some mistake .
we are not <unk> . '
<unk> it !
they 'd be a change , ' cried the sexton .
'you get out of this !
do n't talk !
i ca n't stand it for one !
get right out , or we'll font you ! '
the crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the invitation .
the sergeant pushed forward .
a man beside the <unk> said : 'but surely we are among dear friends and <unk> .
listen to me for a moment . '
it was the moment that a passing <unk> chose to strike into the song .
the effect was instantaneous .
bat , ollyett , and i , who by divers roads have learned the psychology of crowds , retreated towards the tavern door .
woodhouse , the newspaper proprietor , anxious , i presume , to keep touch with the public , dived into the thick of it .
every one else told the society to go away at once .
when the <name> at the <unk> ( i began to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women ) pointed at the <unk> park pillars and called them 'the <unk> of our common <name> , ' there was a snarl and a rush .
the <unk> checked it , but advised the society to keep on going .
the society withdrew into the brake fighting , as it were , a rear-guard action of oratory up each step .
the collapsed <unk> was hauled in last , and with the perfect <unk> of crowds , they cheered it loudly , till the chauffeur slipped in his clutch and sped away .
then the crowd broke up , congratulating all concerned except the sexton , who was held to have disgraced his office by having sworn at ladies .
we strolled across the green towards woodhouse , who was talking to the <unk> near the <unk> .
we were not twenty yards from him when we saw sir <name> <unk> emerge from the lodge and rush furiously at woodhouse with an uplifted stick , at the same time shrieking : 'i 'll teach you to laugh , you  ' but ollyett has the record of the language .
by the time we reached them , sir <name> was on the ground ; woodhouse , very white , held the walking-stick and was saying to the sergeant : 'i give this person in charge for assault . '
'but , good lord ! '
said the sergeant , whiter than woodhouse .
'it 's sir <name> . '
<unk> it is , it is n't fit to be at large , ' said woodhouse .
the crowd suspecting something wrong began to <unk> , and all the english horror of a row in public moved us , headed by the sergeant , inside the lodge .
we shut both <unk> and <unk> .
'you saw the assault , sergeant , ' woodhouse went on .
'you can testify i used no more force than was necessary to protect myself .
you can testify that i have not even damaged this person 's property .
( here !
take your stick , you ! )
you heard the filthy language he used . '
'i  i ca n't say i did , ' the sergeant stammered .
'oh , but we did ! '
said ollyett , and repeated it , to the <unk> horror of the <unk> 's wife .
sir <name> on a hard kitchen chair began to talk .
he said he had <unk> enough of being photographed like a wild beast , ' and expressed loud regret that he had not killed 'that man , ' who was <unk> with the sergeant to laugh at him . '
<unk> you ever seen 'im before , sir <name> ? '
the sergeant asked .
'no !
but it 's time an example was made here .
i 've never seen the sweep in my life . '
i think it was bat masquerier 's magnetic eye that recalled the past to him , for his face changed and his jaw dropped .
'but i have ! '
he groaned .
'i remember now . '
here a writhing man entered by the back door .
he was , he said , the village solicitor .
i do not assert that he licked woodhouse 's boots , but we should have respected him more if he had and been done with it .
his notion was that the matter could be accommodated , arranged and compromised for gold , and yet more gold .
the sergeant thought so too .
woodhouse <unk> them both .
to the sergeant he said , 'will you or <name> you not enter the charge ? '
to the village solicitor he gave the name of his lawyers , at which the man wrung his hands and cried , 'oh , sir t. , sir t. ! '
in a miserable <unk> , for it was a bat masquerier of a firm .
they conferred together in tragic whispers .
'i do n't dive after dickens , ' said ollyett to bat and me by the window , 'but every time i get into a row i notice the <unk> always fills up with his characters . '
'i 've noticed that too , ' said bat .
'but the odd thing is you mustn't give the public straight dickens  not in my business .
i wonder why that is . '
then sir <name> got his second wind and cursed the day that he , or it may have been we , were born .
i feared that though he was a radical he might apologise and , since he was an m.p. , might lie his way out of the difficulty .
but he was utterly and truthfully beside himself .
he asked foolish questions  such as what we were doing in the village at all , and how much blackmail woodhouse expected to make out of him .
but neither woodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened .
the upshot of their talk , in the <unk> , was that sir <name> stood engaged to appear next monday before his brother magistrates on charges of assault , disorderly conduct , and language calculated , etc .
ollyett was specially careful about the language .
then we left .
the village looked very pretty in the late light  pretty and <unk> as a nest of <unk> .
'you 'll turn up on monday , i <name> , ' said woodhouse , when we reached town .
that was his only allusion to the affair .
so we turned up  through a world still singing that the earth was flat  at the little <unk> <unk> with the large corn exchange and the small jubilee memorial .
we had some difficulty in getting seats in the court .
woodhouse 's imported london lawyer was a man of commanding personality , with a voice trained to convey blasting <unk> by tone .
when the case was called , he rose and stated his client 's intention not to proceed with the charge .
his client , he went on to say , had not entertained , and , of course , in the circumstances could not have entertained , any suggestion of accepting on behalf of public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the part of sir <name> 's estate .
at the same time , no one acknowledged more sincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made by those entitled to make them .
but , as a matter of fact  here he became the man of the world <unk> with his equals  certain  er  details had come to his client 's knowledge since the lamentable outburst , which ...
he shrugged his shoulders .
nothing was served by going into them , but he ventured to say that , had those painful circumstances only been known earlier , his client would  again 'of course '  never have dreamed  a gesture concluded the sentence , and the <unk> bench looked at sir <name> with new and withdrawing eyes .
frankly , as they could see , it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with this  <unk> affair .
he asked leave , therefore , to withdraw the charge in <unk> , and at the same time to express his client 's deepest sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed , as his client had been , by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could , of course , again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of <unk> if , as he hoped he had made plain , certain facts had been before his client at the time when ... .
but he had said enough .
for his fee it seemed to me that he had .
heaven inspired sir <name> 's lawyer  all of a sweat lest his <unk> language should come out  to rise up and thank him .
then , sir <name>  not yet aware what <unk> had been laid upon him , but grateful to escape on any terms  followed suit .
he was heard in interested silence , and people <name> back a pace as <unk> passed forth .
'you hit hard , ' said bat to woodhouse afterwards .
'his own people think he 's mad . '
'you do n't say so ?
i 'll show you some of his letters to-night at dinner , ' he replied .
he brought them to the red <name> room of the chop <unk> .
we forgot to be amazed , as till then we had been amazed , over the song or 'the <unk> , ' or the full tide of fate that seemed to run only for our sakes .
it did not even interest ollyett that the verb 'to <unk> ' had passed into the english <unk> ' language .
we were studying the interior of a soul , <unk> to its <unk> corners by the dread of <unk> its position . '
'and then it thanked you , did n't it , for dropping the case ? '
said pallant .
'yes , and it sent me a telegram to confirm . '
woodhouse turned to bat .
'now d'you think i hit too hard ? '
he asked .
<unk> ! '
said bat .
'after all  i 'm talking of every one 's business now  one ca n't ever do anything in <name> that comes up to nature in any game in life .
just think how this thing has  ' 'just let me run through that little case of yours again , ' said pallant , and picked up the bun which had it set out in full .
'any chance of 'dal looking in on us to-night ? '
ollyett began .
'she 's occupied with her <name> too , ' bat answered bitterly .
'what 's the use of <name> ?
tell me , some one ! '
a <unk> outside promptly pointed out that the earth was flat .
'the <unk> 's killing street organs , but i let loose a <unk> of those <unk> twelve hours after the song , ' said bat .
'not counting the provinces . '
his face brightened a little .
'look here ! '
said pallant over the paper .
'i do n't suppose you or those <unk> <unk> 's knew it  but your lawyer ought to have known that you've all put your foot in it most <unk> over this assault case . '
'what 's the matter ? '
said woodhouse .
'it 's ludicrous .
it 's insane .
there is n't two <unk> of <unk> in the whole thing .
of course , you could have withdrawn the charge , but the way you went about it is childish  besides being illegal .
what on earth was the chief constable thinking of ? '
'oh , he was a friend of sir <name> 's .
they all were for that matter , ' i replied .
'he ought to be hanged .
so ought the chairman of the bench .
i 'm talking as a lawyer now . '
'why , what have we been guilty of ?
<unk> of treason or <unk> a felony  or what ? '
said ollyett .
'i 'll tell you later . '
pallant went back to the paper with knitted brows , smiling unpleasantly from time to time .
at last he laughed .
'thank you ! '
he said to woodhouse .
'it ought to be pretty useful  for us . '
'what d'you mean ? '
said ollyett .
'for our side .
they are all <unk> who are mixed up in this  from the chief constable down .
there must be a question .
there must be a question . '
'yes , but i wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way , ' woodhouse insisted .
'that 's nothing to do with the case .
it 's the <unk> of your silly methods .
you would n't understand if i talked till morning , ' he began to pace the room , his hands behind him .
'i wonder if i can get it through our whip 's thick head that it 's a chance ... . that comes of stuffing the bench with radical <unk> , ' he muttered .
'oh , sit down ! '
said woodhouse .
'where 's your lawyer to be found now ? '
he jerked out .
'at the <unk> , ' said bat promptly .
'i gave him the <unk> for to-night .
he 's an artist too . '
'then i 'm going to see him , ' said pallant .
<unk> handled this ought to be a <unk> for our side . '
he withdrew without apology .
'certainly , this thing keeps on opening up , and up , ' i remarked <unk> .
'it 's beyond me ! '
said bat .
'i do n't think if i 'd known i 'd have ever ...
yes , i would , though .
he said my home address was  ' 'it was his tone  his tone ! '
ollyett almost shouted .
woodhouse said nothing , but his face whitened as he brooded .
'well , any way , ' bat went on , 'i 'm glad i always believed in god and providence and all those things .
else i should lose my nerve .
we 've put it over the whole world  the full extent of the geographical globe .
we could n't stop it if we wanted to now .
it 's got to burn itself out .
i'm not in charge any more .
what d'you expect 'll happen next .
angels ? '
i expected nothing .
nothing that i expected approached what i got .
politics are not my concern , but , for the moment , since it seemed that they were going to <unk> ' with the rest , i took an interest in them .
they impressed me as a dog 's life without a dog 's <unk> , and i was confirmed in this when an unshaven and <unk> pallant called on me at ten o'clock one morning , begging for a bath and a couch .
<unk> too ? '
i asked .
he was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet in his head .
'no , ' he said hoarsely .
'all night sitting .
fifteen divisions .
<unk> to-night .
your place was nearer than mine , so  ' he began to undress in the hall .
when he awoke at one o'clock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said was history , but which was obviously collective hysteria .
there had been a political crisis .
he and his fellow m.p .
's had <unk> things '  i never quite got at the things  for eighteen hours on end , and the pitiless whips were even then at the <unk> to herd 'em up to another <unk> .
so he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have been resting .
'i 'm going to pitch in my question about that <unk> of justice at huckley this afternoon , if you care to listen to it , ' he said .
'it 'll be absolutely thrown away  in our present state .
i told 'em so ; but it 's my only chance for weeks .
p'raps woodhouse would like to come . '
'i 'm sure he would .
anything to do with huckley interests us , ' i said .
'it 'll miss fire , i 'm afraid .
both sides are absolutely cooked .
the present situation has been working up for some time .
you see the row was bound to come , etc .
etc. , ' and he flew off the handle once more .
i telephoned to woodhouse , and we went to the house together .
it was a dull , sticky afternoon with thunder in the air .
for some reason or other , each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the utmost .
i heard men snarling about it all round me .
'if they wo n't spare us , we 'll show 'em no <name> , ' <unk> the brutes up from the start .
they ca n't stand late hours . '
'come on !
no shirking !
i know you've had a turkish bath , ' were some of the sentences i caught on our way .
the house was packed already , and one could feel the negative electricity of a jaded crowd <unk> at one 's own nerves , and depressing the afternoon soul .
'this is bad ! '
woodhouse whispered .
'there 'll be a row before they've finished .
look at the front benches ! '
and he pointed out little personal signs by which i was to know that each man was on edge .
he might have spared himself .
the house was ready to snap before a bone had been thrown .
a sullen minister rose to reply to a <unk> question .
his supporters cheered defiantly .
'none o ' that !
none o ' that ! '
came from the back benches .
i saw the speaker 's face stiffen like the face of a helmsman as he humours a <unk> yacht after a sudden following sea .
the trouble was barely met in time .
there came a fresh , apparently <unk> gust a few minutes later  savage , threatening , but futile .
it died out  one could hear the sigh  in sudden <unk> <unk> of the dreary hours ahead , and the ship of state drifted on .
then pallant  and the raw house winced at the torture of his voice  rose .
it was a <unk> question , studded with legal technicalities .
the gist of it was that he wished to know whether the appropriate minister was aware that there had been a grave <unk> of justice on such and such a date , at such and such a place , before such and such <unk> of the peace , in regard to a case which arose  i heard one desperate , weary <unk> ! '
float up from the pit of that torment .
pallant sawed on  <unk> of certain events which occurred at the village of huckley . '
the house came to attention with a parting of the lips like a <unk> , and it flashed through my mind ... . pallant repeated , <unk> .
the village  ' 'that voted the earth was flat . '
a single voice from a back bench sang it once like a lone frog in a far pool .
<unk> was flat , ' croaked another voice opposite .
<unk> was flat . '
there were several .
then several more .
it was , you understand , the collective , <unk> nerve of the house , snapping , strand by strand to various notes , as the hawser parts from its moorings .
'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
the tune was beginning to shape itself .
more voices were raised and feet began to beat time .
even so it did not occur to me that the thing would  'the village that voted the earth was flat ! '
it was easier now to see who were not singing .
there were still a few .
of a sudden ( and this proves the fundamental instability of the <unk> mind ) a <unk> leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary <unk> with tremendous <unk> <unk> of the elbow .
the last strand parted .
the ship of state drifted out helpless on the rocking tide of <name> .
'the village that voted the earth was flat !
the village that voted the earth was flat ! '
the <name> first conceived the idea of using their <unk> as funnels wherewith to reach the correct <unk>  <unk> ' on <unk> . '
labour , always conservative and respectable at a crisis , stood out longer than any other section , but when it came in it was howling syndicalism .
then , without distinction of party , fear of constituents , <name> for office , or <name> of <unk> , the house sang at the tops and at the bottoms of their voices , swaying their stale bodies and <unk> beating with their swelled feet .
they sang 'the village that voted the earth was flat ' : first , because they wanted to , and secondly  which is the terror of that song  because they could not stop .
for no consideration could they stop .
pallant was still standing up .
some one pointed at him and they laughed .
others began to point , <unk> , as it were , in time with the tune .
at this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the speaker 's chair , and halted appalled .
one happened to be the prime minister and the other a messenger .
the house , with tears running down their cheeks , transferred their attention to the paralysed couple .
they pointed six hundred <unk> at them .
they rocked , they waved , and they rolled while they pointed , but still they sang .
when they weakened for an instant , ireland would yell : 'are ye with me , bhoys ? '
and they all renewed their strength like <unk> .
no man could say afterwards what happened in the press or the strangers ' gallery .
it was the house , the hysterical and abandoned house of commons that held all eyes , as it <unk> all ears .
i saw both front benches bend forward , some with their foreheads on their <unk> , the rest with their faces in their hands ; and their moving shoulders jolted the house out of its last rag of decency .
only the speaker remained unmoved .
the entire press of great britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head .
the <name> of the constitution , for vain was the help of man , foretold him the exact moment at which the house would have broken into 'the <unk> . '
he is reported to have said : 'i heard the <name> beginning to shuffle it .
so i adjourned . '
pallant 's version is that he added : 'and i was never so grateful to a private member in all my life as i was to mr .
pallant . '
he made no explanation .
he did not refer to orders or <unk> .
he simply adjourned the house till six that evening .
and the house adjourned  some of it nearly on all fours .
i was not correct when i said that the speaker was the only man who did not laugh .
woodhouse was beside me all the time .
his face was set and quite white  as white , they told me , as sir <name> <unk> 's when he went , by request , to a private interview with his chief whip .
the press the soldier may forget his sword the <unk> the sea , the <name> may forget the word and the priest his litany : the maid may forget both <name> and gem , and the bride her <unk>  but the jew shall forget jerusalem ere we forget the press !
who once hath stood through the loaded hour ere , roaring like the <name> , the <unk> and the hoe devour their <unk> paper bale , and has lit his pipe in the morning calm that follows the midnight stress  he hath sold his heart to the old black <name> we call the daily press .
who once hath dealt in the widest game that all of a man can play , no later love , no larger fame <name> lure him long away .
as the <unk> <unk> the battle afar , the entered soul , no less , he saith : <unk> !
<name> ! '
where the trumpets are and the thunders of the press .
canst thou number the days that we fulfil , or the times that we bring forth ?
canst thou send the lightnings to do thy <name> , and cause them reign on earth ?
hast thou given a peacock goodly wings to please his foolishness ?
sit down at the heart of men and things , companion of the press !
the pope may launch his <unk> , the union its decree , but the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked by us and such as we .
remember the battle and stand aside while thrones and powers confess that king over all the children of pride is the press  the press  the press !
in the presence ( <unk> ) 'so the matter , ' the regimental chaplain concluded , 'was correct ; in every way correct .
i am well pleased with rutton singh and <unk> singh .
they have gathered the fruit of their lives . '
he folded his arms and sat down on the verandah .
the hot day had ended , and there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines , where <unk> men went back and forth with leaf <unk> and <unk> .
the subadar-major , in extreme undress , sat on a chair , as befitted his rank ; the havildar-major , his nephew , leaning respectfully against the wall .
the regiment was at home and at ease in its own quarters in its own district which takes its name from the great muhammadan saint mian mir , revered by <unk> and beloved by guru har gobind , sixth of the great sikh <unk> .
<unk> correct , ' the regimental chaplain repeated .
no sikh <unk> his regimental chaplain who <unk> to him the holy book of the <unk> sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all the <unk> .
the subadar-major bowed his grey head .
the havildar-major coughed respectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak .
though he was the subadar-major 's nephew , and though his father held twice as much land as his uncle , he knew his place in the scheme of things .
the subadar-major shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist .
'was there by any chance any woman at the back of it ? '
the havildar-major murmured .
'i was not here when the thing happened . '
'yes !
yes !
yes !
we all know that thou wast in england eating and drinking with the sahibs .
we are all surprised that thou canst still speak punjabi . '
the subadar-major 's <unk> beard bristled .
'there was no woman , ' the regimental chaplain growled .
'it was land .
hear , you !
rutton singh and <unk> singh were the elder of four brothers .
these four held land in  what was the village 's name ?  oh , <unk> , near <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> state , where men can still recognise right behaviour when they see it .
the two younger brothers tilled the land , while rutton singh and <unk> singh took service with the regiment , according to the custom of the family . '
'true , true , ' said the havildar-major .
'there is the same arrangement in all good families . '
'then , listen again , ' the regimental chaplain went on .
<unk> kin on their mother 's side put great oppression and injustice upon the two younger brothers who stayed with the land in <unk> state .
their mother 's kin loosened beasts into the four brothers ' crops when the crops were green ; they cut the corn by force when it was ripe ; they broke down the <unk> ; they defiled the wells ; and they brought false charges in the law-courts against all four brothers .
they did not spare even the <unk> , as the saying is .
<unk> mother 's kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by weight of trouble , and further trouble and perpetual trouble , to quit their lands in <unk> village in <unk> <unk> in <unk> state .
if the young men ran away , the land would come whole to their mother 's kin .
i am not a regimental <unk> , but is it understood , child ? '
<unk> , ' said the havildar-major grimly .
<unk> is not the only place where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it .
but perhaps there was a woman among their mother 's kin ? '
'god knows ! '
said the regimental chaplain .
<unk> , or man , or law-courts , the young men would not be driven off the land which was their own by inheritance .
they made appeal to rutton singh and <unk> singh , their brethren who had taken service with us in the regiment , and so knew the world , to help them in their long war against their mother 's kin in <unk> .
for that reason , because their own land and the honour of their house was dear to them , rutton singh and <unk> singh needs must very often ask for leave to go to <unk> and attend to the <unk> and <unk> there .
'it was not , look you , as though they went back to their own village and sat , <unk> with <name> , in honour , upon chairs before the elders under the trees .
they went back always to perpetual trouble , either of <unk> , or theft , or strayed cattle ; and they sat on thorns . '
'i knew it , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> was bitter for them both .
but they were <unk> men .
it was not hard to get them their leave from the colonel sahib . '
'they spoke to me also , ' said the chaplain .
' " let him who desires the four great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men .
"  that is written .
often they showed me the papers of the false <unk> brought against them .
often they wept on account of the persecution put upon them by their mother 's kin .
men thought it was drugs when their eyes showed red . '
'they wept in my presence too , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> men of nine years ' service apiece .
rutton singh was <unk> , too . '
'they did all things correctly as sikhs should , ' said the regimental chaplain .
'when the persecution had endured seven years , <unk> singh took leave to <unk> once again ( that was the fourth time in that year only ) and he called his <unk> together before the village elders , and he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mother's blood to cease from their persecutions .
for he told them earnestly that he had marched to the boundaries of his <name> , and that there could be but one end to the matter .
'they gave him abuse .
they mocked him and his tears , which was the same as though they had mocked the regiment .
then <unk> singh returned to the regiment , and laid this last trouble before rutton singh , the eldest brother .
but rutton singh could not get leave all at once . '
'because he was <unk> and the recruits were to be drilled .
i myself told him so , ' said the subadar-major .
'he was a <unk> man .
he said he could wait . '
'but when permission was granted , those two took four days ' leave , ' the chaplain went on .
'i do not think <unk> singh should have taken <unk> sahib 's revolver .
he was <unk> sahib 's orderly , and all that sahib 's things were open to him .
it was , therefore , as i count it , shame to <unk> singh , ' said the subadar-major .
'all the words had been said .
there was need of arms , and how could soldiers use government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields ? '
the regimental chaplain replied .
<unk> , the revolver was sent back , together with a <unk> for the cartridges expended .
 " borrow not ; but if thou <unk> , pay back soon !
"  that is written in the hymns .
rutton singh took a sword , and he and <unk> singh went to <unk> and , after word given , the four brethren fell upon their <unk> in <unk> village and slew seventeen , wounding ten .
a revolver is better than a lawsuit .
i say that these four brethren , the two with us , and the two mere cultivators , slew and wounded twenty-seven  all their mother 's kin , male and female .
'then the four mounted to their <unk> , and <unk> singh , who was always one of the impetuous , said " my work is done , " and he made <unk> ( purification ) in all men 's sight , and he lent rutton singh <unk> sahib 's revolver , and rutton singh shot him in the head .
'so <unk> singh abandoned his body , as an insect <unk> a blade of grass .
but rutton singh , having more work to do , went down from the <unk> and sought an enemy whom he had forgotten  a <unk> man of this regiment who had sided with the <unk> .
when he overtook the man , rutton singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword . '
'but the man escaped and is now in the hospital here , ' said the subadar-major .
'the doctor says he <name> live in spite of all . '
'not rutton singh 's fault .
rutton singh left him for dead .
then rutton singh returned to the <unk> , and the three brothers together , <unk> singh being dead , sent word by a lad to the police station for an army to be dispatched against them that they might die with honours .
but none came .
and yet <unk> state is not under english law and they should know virtue there when they see it !
'so , on the third day , rutton singh also made <unk> , and the youngest of the brethren shot him also in the head , and he abandoned his body .
'thus was all correct .
there was neither heat , nor haste , nor abuse in the matter from end to end .
there remained alive not one man or woman of their mother 's kin which had oppressed them .
of the other villagers of <unk> , who had taken no part in the persecutions , not one was slain .
indeed , the villagers sent them food on the <unk> for those three days while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army .
'listen again !
i know that <unk> singh and rutton singh omitted no ceremony of the <unk> , and when all was done <unk> sahib's revolver was thrown down from the <unk> , together with three rupees twelve annas ; and order was given for its return by post . '
'and what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service ? '
the havildar-major asked .
<unk> they too are dead , but since they were not in the regiment their honour concerns themselves only .
so far as we were touched , see how correctly we came out of the matter !
i think the king should be told ; for where could you match such a tale except among us sikhs ?
<unk> wah guru <name> <unk> <unk> !
<unk> wah guru <name> <unk> <unk> !  ' said the regimental chaplain .
'would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges ? '
said the havildar-major .
<unk> singh knew the just price .
all <unk> sahib 's gear was in his charge .
they expended one tin box of fifty <unk> , lacking two which were returned .
as i said  as i say  the arrangement was made not with heat nor <unk> as a mussulman would have made it ; not with cries nor <unk> as an idolater would have made it ; but conformably to the ritual and doctrine of the sikhs .
hear you !
 " though hundreds of amusements are offered to a child it can not live without milk .
if a man be divorced from his soul and his soul 's <name> he certainly <name> not stop to play upon the road , but he <name> make haste with his pilgrimage . "
that is written .
i rejoice in my disciples . '
'true !
true !
correct !
correct ! '
said the subadar-major .
there was a long , easy silence .
one heard a <unk> creaking somewhere and the nearer sound of meal being ground in a <unk> .
'but he  ' the chaplain pointed a scornful <name> at the havildar-major  <unk> has been so long in england that  ' 'let the lad alone , ' said his uncle .
'he was but two months there , and he was chosen for good cause . '
theoretically , all sikhs are equal .
practically , there are differences , as none know better than well-born , <unk> folk , or <unk> <unk> from amritsar .
<unk> thou heard anything in england to match my tale ? '
the chaplain sneered .
'i saw more than i could understand , so i have locked up my stories in my own mouth , ' the havildar-major replied meekly .
<unk> ?
what stories ?
i know all the stories about england , ' said the chaplain .
'i know that <unk> run underneath their bazaars there , and as for their streets <unk> with <unk> <unk> , only this morning i was nearly killed by <unk> sahib 's <unk> .
that young man is a devil . '
'i expect <unk> , ' said the subadar-major , 'you and i grow too old to care for the <unk>  the bearer 's dance . '
he named one of the <unk> of the old-time <unk> , and smiled at his own pun .
then he turned to his nephew .
'when i was a lad and came back to my village on leave , i waited the convenient hour , and , the elders giving permission , i spoke of what i had seen elsewhere . '
'ay , my father , ' said the havildar-major , softly and affectionately .
he sat himself down with respect , as <unk> a mere lad of thirty with a bare half-dozen campaigns to his credit .
'there were four men in this affair also , ' he began , 'and it was an affair that touched the honour , not of one regiment , nor two , but of all the army in hind .
some part of it i saw ; some i heard ; but all the tale is true .
my father 's brother knows , and my priest knows , that i was in england on business with my colonel , when the king  the great queen's son  completed his life .
'first , there was a rumour that sickness was upon him .
next , we knew that he lay sick in the palace .
a very great multitude stood outside the palace by night and by day , in the rain as well as the sun , waiting for news .
'then came out one with a written paper , and set it upon a <unk>  the word of the king 's death  and they read , and groaned .
this i saw with my own eyes , because the office where my colonel sahib went daily to talk with colonel forsyth sahib was at the east end of the very gardens where the palace stood .
they are larger gardens than <unk> here '  he pointed with his <name> up the lines  'or <unk> across the river .
'next day there was a darkness in the streets , because all the <unk> multitude were clad in black garments , and they spoke as a man speaks in the presence of his dead  all those multitudes .
in the eyes , in the air , and in the heart , there was blackness .
i saw it .
but that is not my tale .
'after ceremonies had been accomplished , and word had gone out to the kings of the earth that they should come and mourn , the new king  the dead king 's son  gave commandment that his father 's body should be laid , <unk> , in a certain <name> which is near the river .
there are no idols in that <name> ; neither any carvings , nor paintings , nor <unk> .
it is all grey stone , of one colour as though it were cut out of the live rock .
it is larger than  yes , than the durbar sahib at amritsar , even though the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> were added .
how old it may be god knows .
it is the sahibs ' most sacred <name> .
'in that place , by the new king 's commandment , they made , as it were , a shrine for a saint , with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the dead , and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the night , until the dead king should be taken to the place of his fathers , which is at <unk> .
'when all was in order , the new king said , " give entrance to all people , " and the doors were opened , and o my uncle !
o my teacher !
all the world entered , walking through that <name> to take farewell of the dead .
there was neither distinction , nor price , nor ranking in the host , except an order that they should walk by fours .
'as they gathered in the streets without  very , very far off  so they entered the <name> , walking by fours : the child , the old man ; mother , virgin , harlot , trader , priest ; of all colours and faiths and customs under the firmament of god , from <name> till late at night .
i saw it .
my colonel gave me leave to go .
i stood in the line , many hours , one <unk> , two <unk> , distant from the <name> . '
'then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees ? '
asked the priest .
'because we were still between houses .
the city is many <unk> wide , ' the havildar-major resumed .
'i submitted myself to that <unk> river and thus  thus  a pace at a time  i made pilgrimage .
there were in my rank a woman , a cripple , and a lascar from the ships .
'when we entered the <name> , the coffin itself was as a shoal in the <unk> river , splitting the stream into two branches , one on either side of the dead ; and the watchers of the dead , who were soldiers , stood about it , moving no more than the still flame of the candles .
their heads were bowed ; their hands were clasped ; their eyes were cast upon the ground  thus .
they were not men , but images , and the multitude went past them in fours by day , and , except for a little while , by night also .
'no , there was no order that the people should come to pay respect .
it was a <unk> pilgrimage .
eight kings had been commanded to come  who obeyed  but upon his own sahibs the new king laid no commandment .
of themselves they came .
'i made pilgrimage twice : once for my salt 's sake , and once again for wonder and terror and worship .
but my mouth can not declare one thing of a hundred thousand things in this matter .
there were lakhs of lakhs , <unk> of <unk> of people .
i saw them . '
'more than at our great <unk> ? '
the regimental chaplain demanded .
'yes .
those are only cities and districts coming out to pray .
this was the world walking in grief .
and now , hear you !
it is the king 's custom that four swords of our armies in hind should stand always before the presence in case of need . '
'the king 's custom , our right , ' said the subadar-major curtly .
<unk> our right .
these honoured ones are changed after certain months or years , that the honour may be fairly spread .
now it chanced that when the old king  the <name> 's son  completed his days , the four that stood in the presence were goorkhas .
neither sikhs alas , nor pathans , rajputs , nor <unk> .
goorkhas , my father . '
<unk> , ' said the chaplain .
'but soldiers ; for i remember in the <unk>  ' the havildar-major began .
<unk> soldiers , for i remember fifteen campaigns .
go on , ' said the subadar-major .
'and it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in the presence by day and by night till it went out to burial .
there were no more than four all told  four old men to furnish that guard . '
'old ?
old ?
what talk is this of old men ? '
said the subadar-major .
'nay .
my fault !
your pardon ! '
the havildar-major spread a <unk> hand .
'they were strong , hot , valiant men , and the youngest was a lad of forty-five . '
'that is better , ' the subadar-major laughed .
'but for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food from the sahibs ' hands .
there was no cooking place in the <name> ; but a certain colonel forsyth sahib , who had understanding , made arrangement whereby they should receive at least a little <unk> parched grain ; also cold rice maybe , and water which was pure .
yet , at best , this was no more than a hen 's mouthful , snatched as each came off his guard .
they lived on grain and were thankful , as the saying is .
'one hour 's guard in every four was each man 's burden , for , as i have shown , they were but four all told ; and the honour of our armies in hind was on their heads .
the sahibs could draw upon all the armies in england for the other watchers  thousands upon thousands of fresh men  if they needed ; but these four were but four .
'the sahibs <name> upon the <unk> for the other watchers .
<unk> be very tall men under very tall <unk> , such as <unk> regiments wear in cold weather .
thus , when a <unk> bowed his head but a very little over his stock , the <unk> sloped and showed as though he grieved exceedingly .
now the goorkhas wear flat , green caps  ' 'i see , i see , ' said the subadar-major impatiently .
'they are <unk> , too ; and their stocks are hard , and when they bend deeply  deeply  to match the <unk>  they come nigh to choking themselves .
that was a handicap against them , when it came to the observance of ritual .
<unk> even with their tall , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> could not endure the full hour 's guard in the presence .
there was good cause , as i <name> show , why no man could endure that terrible hour .
so for them the hour 's guard was cut to one-half .
what did it matter to the sahibs ?
they could draw on ten thousand <unk> .
forsyth sahib , who had comprehension , put this choice also before the four , and they said , " no , ours is the honour of the armies of hind .
whatever the sahibs do , we <name> suffer the full hour . "
<unk> sahib , seeing that they were  knowing that they could neither sleep long nor eat much , said , " is it great suffering ? "
they said , " it is great honour .
we <name> endure . "
<unk> sahib , who loves us , said then to the eldest , " ho , father , tell me truly what manner of burden it is ; for the full hour 's watch breaks up our men like water . "
'the eldest answered , " sahib , the burden is the feet of the multitude that pass us on either side .
our eyes being lowered and fixed , we see those feet only from the knee down  a river of feet , sahib , that never  never  never stops .
it is not the standing without any motion ; it is not hunger ; nor is it the dead part before the <name> when maybe a single one comes here to weep .
it is the burden of the unendurable procession of feet from the knee down , that never  never  never stops ! "
<unk> sahib said , " by god , i had not considered that !
now i know why our men come trembling and twitching off that guard .
but at least , my father , ease the stock a little beneath the bent <name> for that one hour . "
'the eldest said , " we are in the presence .
moreover he knew every button and braid and hook of every uniform in all his armies . "
'then forsyth sahib said no more , except to speak about their parched grain , but indeed they could not eat much after their hour , nor could they sleep much because of <unk> and the renewed procession of the feet before the eyes .
yet they endured each his full hour  not half an hour  his one full hour in each four hours . '
<unk> !
correct ! '
said the subadar-major and the chaplain together .
'we come well out of this affair . '
'but seeing that they were old men , ' said the subadar-major reflectively , 'very old men , worn out by lack of food and sleep , could not arrangements have been made , or influence have been secured , or a petition presented , whereby a well-born sikh might have eased them of some portion of their great burden , even though his substantive rank  ' 'then they would most certainly have slain me , ' said the havildar-major with a smile .
'and they would have done correctly , ' said the chaplain .
'what befell the honourable ones later ? '
'this .
the kings of the earth and all the armies sent flowers and <unk> to the dead king 's palace at <unk> , where the funeral offerings were accepted .
there was no order given , but all the world made <unk> .
so the four took counsel  three at a time  and either they asked forsyth sahib to choose flowers , or themselves they went forth and bought flowers  i do not know ; but , however it was arranged , the flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great <unk> circle weighing half a <unk> .
<unk> sahib had said , " let the flowers be sent to <unk> with the other flowers which all the world is sending . "
but they said among themselves , " it is not fit that these flowers , which are the offerings of his armies in hind , should come to the palace of the presence by the hands of hirelings or messengers , or of any man not in his service . "
<unk> this , forsyth sahib , though he was much occupied with office-work , said , " give me the flowers , and i <name> steal a time and myself take them to <unk> . "
'the eldest said , " since when has forsyth sahib worn sword ? "
<unk> sahib said , " but always .
and i wear it in the presence when i put on uniform .
i am a colonel in the armies of hind . "
the eldest said , " of what regiment ? "
and forsyth sahib looked on the carpet and pulled the hair of his lip .
he saw the trap . '
<unk> sahib 's regiment was once the old <unk> pathans which was called  ' the subadar-major gave the almost forgotten title , adding that he had met them in such and such campaigns , when forsyth sahib was a young captain .
the havildar-major took up the tale , saying , 'the eldest knew that also , my father .
he laughed , and presently forsyth sahib laughed .
' " it is true , " said forsyth sahib .
" i have no regiment .
for twenty years i have been a clerk tied to a thick pen .
therefore i am the more fit to be your orderly and messenger in this business . "
'the eldest then said , " if it were a matter of my life or the honour of any of my household , it would be easy . "
and forsyth sahib joined his hands together , half laughing , though he was ready to weep , and he said , " enough !
i ask pardon .
which one of you goes with the offering ? "
'the eldest said , <unk> not to have heard , " nor must they be delivered by a single sword  as though we were pressed for men in his service , " and they saluted and went out . '
'were these things seen , or were they told thee ? '
said the subadar-major .
'i both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my colonel sahib consulted forsyth sahib upon the business that had brought my colonel sahib to england . '
'and what was that business ? '
the regimental chaplain asked of a sudden , looking full at the havildar-major , who returned the look without a quiver .
'that was not revealed to me , ' said the havildar-major .
'i heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of certain regiments , ' the chaplain insisted .
'the matter was not in any way open to my ears , ' said the havildar-major .
<unk> ! '
the chaplain <name> his hard <unk> feet under his robe .
'let us hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell , ' he said , and the havildar-major went on : 'so then the three , having returned to the <name> , called the fourth , who had only forty-five years , when he came off guard , and said , " we go to the palace at <unk> with the offerings .
remain thou in the presence , and take all our guards , one after the other , till we return . "
<unk> that next hour they hired a large and strong <unk> for the journey from the <name> to <unk> , which is twenty <unk> or more , and they promised expedition .
but he who took their guards said , " it is not seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste .
there are eighteen medals with eleven <unk> and three orders to consider .
go at leisure .
i can endure . "
'so the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half , and having delivered the offering at <unk> in the correct manner they returned and found the lad on guard , and they did not break his guard till his full hour was ended .
so he endured four hours in the presence , not stirring one hair , his eyes <unk> , and the river of feet , from the knee down , passing continually before his eyes .
when he was relieved , it was seen that his eyeballs worked like weavers ' <unk> .
'and so it was done  not in hot blood , not for a little while , nor yet with the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain , but in silence , for a very long time , rooted to one place before the presence among the most terrible feet of the multitude . '
<unk> ! '
the chaplain chuckled .
'but the goorkhas had the honour , ' said the subadar-major sadly .
<unk> was the honour of his armies in hind , and that was our honour , ' the nephew replied .
<unk> i would one sikh had been concerned in it  even one low-caste sikh .
and after ? '
'they endured the burden until the end  until it went out of the <name> to be laid among the older kings at <unk> .
when all was accomplished and it was withdrawn under the earth , forsyth sahib said to the four , " the king gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own cooks .
eat and take ease , my fathers . "
'so they loosed their belts and ate .
they had not eaten food except by snatches for some long time ; and when the meat had given them strength they slept for very many hours ; and it was told me that the procession of the unendurable feet ceased to pass before their eyes any more . '
he threw out one hand palm upward to show that the tale was ended .
'we came well and cleanly out of it , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> !
correct !
correct ! '
said the regimental chaplain .
'in an evil age it is good to hear such things , and there is certainly no doubt that this is a very evil age . '
<unk> 's amen <unk> be the english and all their ways and works .
cursed be the infidels , <unk> , and turks ! '
<unk> , ' quo ' <unk> , 'but where i used to lie was neither candle , <name> nor book to curse my brethren by : 'but a <unk> in full bearing , bowing down , bowing down , to a surf that drove <unk> at the <unk> town  <unk> in a <name> , <unk> in a dome  and a low moon out of africa said : " this way home ! " '
<unk> be the english and all that they profess .
cursed be the savages that prance in nakedness ! '
<unk> , ' quo ' <unk> , 'but where i used to lie was neither shirt nor pantaloons to catch my brethren by : 'but a <unk> slowly creaking , going round , going round , by a <unk> leaking over drowned , warm ground  parrots very busy in the <unk> <unk>  and a high sun over <name> shouting : " rise and shine ! " '

cursed be the infidels that bow to wood and stone ! '

" '

cursed be the <unk> who doubt that this is true ! '

'
regulus ( <unk> ) regulus , a <name> general , defeated the carthaginians 256 <unk> , but was next year defeated and taken prisoner by the carthaginians , who sent him to rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners .
regulus strongly advised the <name> senate to make no terms with the enemy .
he then returned to carthage and was put to death. the fifth form had been dragged several times in its collective life , from one end of the school <name> to the other .
those were the years when army <unk> gave thousands of marks for latin , and it was mr. king 's hated business to defeat them .
hear him , then , on a raw november morning at second lesson .
'aha ! '
he began , rubbing his hands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our portion to-day is the fifth ode of the third book , i believe  concerning one regulus , a gentleman .
and how often have we been through it ? '
<unk> , sir , ' said <unk> , head of the form .
mr. king shuddered .
'yes , twice , quite literally , ' he said .
<unk> , with an eye to your army <unk> examinations  ugh !  i shall exact somewhat freer and more <unk> <unk> .
with feeling and comprehension if that be possible .
i except '  here his eye swept the back benches  'our friend and companion beetle , from whom , now as always , i demand an absolutely literal translation . '
the form laughed <unk> .
<unk> his blushes !
beetle charms us first . '
beetle stood up , confident in the possession of a guaranteed <unk> , left behind by <unk> , who had that day gone into the <unk> with a cold .
yet he was too wary a hand to show confidence .
<unk> , we  believe  we have believed , ' he opened in hesitating slow time , <unk> <unk> , thundering jove  <unk> , to reign  <unk> , in heaven .
<name> , <name>  <unk> , <name> be held or considered  <unk> <unk> , a present god  <unk> <unk> , the britons being added  <unk> , to the empire  <unk> <unk> , with the heavy  er , stern persians . '
'what ? '
'the grave or stern persians . '
beetle pulled up with the <unk> ' air of <name> in the <unk> .
'i am quite aware , ' said king , 'that the first stanza is about the extent of your knowledge , but continue , sweet one , continue .
<unk> , by the way , is usually translated as " troublesome . " '
beetle <name> a long and tortured breath .
the second stanza ( which carries over to the third ) of that ode is what is technically called a <unk> . '
but <unk> had done him handsomely .
<unk> <unk> , had  has the soldier of <unk>  <unk> , lived  <unk> <unk> , a disgraceful husband  ' 'you <unk> the quantity of the word after <unk> , ' said king .
<unk> hear it . '
beetle guessed again , and for a wonder hit the correct quantity .
'er  a disgraceful husband  <unk> <name> , with a barbarous spouse . '
'why do you select that <unk> equivalent out of all the dictionary ? '
king snapped .
'is n't " wife " good enough for you ? '
'yes , sir .
but what do i do about this <unk> , sir ?
shall i take it now ? '
<unk> yourself at present to the soldier of <unk> . '
'yes , sir .
et , and  <unk> , has he grown old  in <unk> , in the  er  arms  <unk> <unk> , of his father-in-law 's enemies . '
'who ?
how ?
which ? '
<unk> of his enemies ' <unk> , sir . '
<unk> .
by the way , what meaning might you attach to in <unk> ? '
'oh , weapons  weapons of war , sir . '
there was a <unk> note in beetle 's voice as though he had been falsely accused of uttering <unk> .
'shall i take the <unk> now , sir ? '
'since it seems to be troubling you . '
<unk> <unk> , o for the senate house  <unk> <unk> , and manners upset  upside down . '
<unk> like your translation .
meantime , the soldier of <unk> ? '
<unk> <unk> <unk> , under a median king  <unk> et <unk> , he being a <unk> and an <unk> . '
'who ?
the median king ? '
'no , sir .
the soldier of <unk> .
<unk> agrees with <unk> <unk> , sir , ' volunteered <unk> beetle .
'does it ?
it does n't with me . '
<unk> , ' beetle corrected hastily , <unk>  <unk> , of the shields , or trophies  et <unk> , and the  his name  et <unk> , and the <unk>  <unk> <unk> , and eternal <name>  <unk> jove , jove being safe  et <unk> <name> , and the <name> city . '
with an air of hardly restrained zeal  'shall i go on , sir ? '
mr. king winced .
'no , thank you .
you have indeed given us a translation !
may i ask if it conveys any meaning whatever to your so-called mind ? '
'oh , i think so , sir . '
this with gentle toleration for <name> and all his works .
'we envy you .
sit down . '
beetle sat down relieved , well knowing that a reef of <unk> <unk> stretched ahead of him , on which in spite of <unk> <unk> he would infallibly have been wrecked .
rattray , who took up the task , steered neatly through them and came unscathed to port .
'here we require drama , ' said king .
<unk> himself is speaking now .
who shall represent the <unk> regulus ?
winton , <name> you kindly oblige ? '
winton of king 's house , a long , heavy , <unk> second fifteen forward , <unk> for his first fifteen colours , and in aspect like an <name> , elderly horse , rose up , and announced , among other things , that he had seen <unk> affixed to punic deluges . '
half the form shouted for <name> , and the other half for <name> that there was something to shout about .
mr. king opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , ' he gasped .
'so <unk> is " deluges " is it ?
winton , in all our dealings , have i ever suspected you of a jest ? '
'no , sir , ' said the rigid and angular winton , while the form rocked about him .
'and yet you assert <unk> means " deluges . "
whether i am a fit subject for such a <unk> is , of course , a matter of opinion , but ... . winton , you are normally conscientious .
may we assume you looked out <unk> ? '
'no , sir . '
winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all who stand before kings .
<unk> a shot at it then ? '
every line of winton 's body showed he had done nothing of the sort .
indeed , the very idea that <unk> ' winton ( and a boy is not called <unk> ' by companions for his frivolity ) would make a shot at anything was beyond belief .
but he replied , 'yes , ' and all the while worked with his right heel as though he were <unk> a ball at <unk> .
though none dared to boast of being a favourite with king , the <unk> , three-cornered winton stood high in his house-master 's opinion .
it seemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment , but the two were in some fashion sympathetic .
<unk> ! '
said king drily .
'i was going to say  <unk> <unk> <unk> , but i think  i think i see the process .
beetle , the translation of <unk> , please . '
beetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer : <unk> , sir . '
there was an impressive pause while king checked off crimes on his fingers .
then to beetle the <unk> man addressed winged words : <unk> , ' said he .
<unk> , beetle , as usual , from the look of <unk> that it bore some relation to <unk> or deluge , you imparted the result of your <unk> <unk> to winton who seems to have been lost enough to have accepted it .
observing next , your companion 's fall , from the presumed security of your <unk> position in the rear-guard , you took another <unk> .
the turbid chaos of your mind threw up some memory of the word " <unk> " which you have pitifully attempted to disguise under the <unk> of " ruins . " '
as this was precisely what beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving .
'we <name> attend to this later , ' said king .
'go on , winton , and retrieve yourself . '
<unk> happened to be the one word which winton had not looked out and had asked beetle for , when they were settling into their places .
he forged ahead with no further trouble .
only when he rendered <unk> as <unk> , ' king erupted .
<unk> , ' he said , 'was not a <unk> for the <name> press , nor , for that matter , was <name> .
regulus says : " the soldier <unk> by gold <name> come keener for the fight  <name> he by  by gum ! "
that's the meaning of <unk> .
it indicates contempt  bitter contempt .
" forsooth , " forsooth !
you 'll be talking about " speckled beauties " and " eventually <unk> " next .
<unk> , what do you make of that doubled " <unk> ego  ego <unk> " ?
it was n't put in to fill up the metre , you know . '
'is n't it <unk> , sir ? '
said <unk> , afflicted by a genuine interest in what he read .
<unk> was a bit in <name> about rome making no terms with carthage  and he wanted to let the romans understand it , did n't he , sir ? '
'less than your usual <name> , but the fact .
regulus was in <name> .
he was also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every word he uttered .
he knew carthage which ( your <unk> wo n't ask you this so you need n't take notes ) was a sort of <unk> nigger manchester .
regulus was not thinking about his own life .
he was telling rome the truth .
he was playing for his side .
those lines from the eighteenth to the <unk> ought to be written in blood .
yet there are things in human garments which <name> tell you that <name> was a <unk>  a man about town .
avoid such beings .
<name> knew a very great deal .
he knew !
<unk> <unk> <unk>  " <name> he be brave who once to faithless foes has knelt ? "
and again ( stop pawing with your hooves , <unk> ! )
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that means roughly  but i perceive i am ahead of my <unk> .
begin at <unk> <unk> , <name> , and let us see if you have the spirit of regulus . '
now no one expected fireworks from gentle paddy <name> , <unk> of hartopp 's house , but , as must often be the case with growing boys , his mind was in abeyance for the time being , and he said , all in a rush , on behalf of regulus : <unk> magna <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , o carthage , thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of italy . '
even beetle , most lenient of critics , was interested at this point , though he did not join the <unk> of <unk> from the wiser heads of the form .
<unk> do n't mind me , ' said king , and <name> very kindly did not .
he ploughed on thus : 'he ( regulus ) is related to have removed from himself the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the head , and , being stern , to have placed his <unk> visage on the ground . '
since king loved <unk> ' about as much as he did <unk> ' or <unk> the form looked up hopefully .
but jove thundered not .
<unk> , ' <name> continued , 'he should have confirmed the sliding fathers as being the author of counsel never given under an alias . '
he stopped , conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the typhoon 's centre .
king 's opening voice was sweeter than <name> .
'i am painfully aware by bitter experience that i can not give you any idea of the passion , the power , the  the essential guts of the lines which you have so <unk> outraged in our presence .
but  ' the note changed , 'so far as in me lies , i <name> strive to bring home to you , <name> , the fact that there exist in latin a few pitiful rules of grammar , of <unk> , nay , even of <unk> , which were not created for your <unk> sport  your <unk> diversion .
you <name> , therefore , <name> , write out and bring to me to-morrow a <unk> <unk> translation of the ode , together with a full list of all adjectives  an adjective is not a verb , <name> , as the lower third <name> tell you  all adjectives , their number , case , and <unk> .
even now i have n't begun to deal with you faithfully . '
'i  i 'm very sorry , sir , ' <name> stammered .
'you mistake the symptoms , <name> .
you are possibly discomfited by the <unk> , but sorrow <unk> some sort of mind , intellect , nous .
your rendering of <unk> alone stamps you as lower than the beasts of the field .
<name> some one take the taste out of our mouths ?
and  talking of tastes  ' he coughed .
there was a distinct flavour of chlorine gas in the air .
up went an eyebrow , though king knew perfectly well what it meant .
'mr .
hartopp 's st  science class next door , ' said <unk> .
'oh yes .
i had forgotten .
our newly established modern side , of course .
perowne , open the windows ; and winton , go on once more from <unk> <unk> . '
'and hastened away , ' said winton , <unk> by his mourning friends , into  into illustrious banishment .
but i got that out of <unk> , sir , ' he added in one conscientious breath .
'i am aware .
the master generally knows his ass 's crib , though i acquit you of any intention that way .
can you suggest anything for <unk> <unk> ?
only " <unk> exile " ?
i fear " <unk> " is a good word ruined .
no !
you ca n't in this case improve on <unk> .
now then for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the whole force of it lies in the <unk> . '
<unk> he knew , ' winton suggested .
<unk> than that , i think . '
'he who knew well , ' <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
" well though he knew . "
i do n't like <unk> 's " <unk> . "
it 's <unk> street . '
'well though he knew what the savage <unk> was  was getting ready for him , ' said winton .
<unk> .
had in store for him . '
<unk> he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people <unk> his return . '
<unk> ; but then how do you render <unk> ? '
'if it 's a free translation might n't <unk> and <unk> come to about the same thing , sir ? '
'nothing comes to " about the same thing " with <name> , winton .
as i have said , <name> was not a journalist .
no , i take it that his kinsmen bodily withstood his departure , whereas the crowd  <unk>  the democracy stood about <unk> pitying him and getting in the way .
now for that noblest of <unk>  <unk> si <unk> , ' and king ran off into the quotation : 'as though some tedious business o'er of clients ' court , his journey lay towards <unk> 's grassy floor or <unk> tarentum 's bay .
all right , winton .
beetle , when you 've quite finished dodging the fresh air yonder , give me the meaning of <unk>  and turn down your collar . '
'me , sir ?
<unk> , sir ?
oh !
stretching away in the direction of , sir . '
<unk> !
regulus was not a feature of the landscape .
he was a man , <unk> to death by torture .
<unk> , <unk>  knowing it  having achieved it for his country 's sake  ca n't you hear that <unk> cut like a knife ?  he moved off with some dignity .
that is why <name> out of the whole golden latin tongue chose the one word " <unk> "  which is utterly <unk> . '
the gross injustice of being asked to translate it , converted beetle into a young <name> martyr , till king buried his nose in his handkerchief again .
'i think they 've broken another <unk> next door , sir , ' said <unk> .
'they 're always doing it . '
the form coughed as more chlorine came in .
'well , i suppose we must be patient with the modern side , ' said king .
'but it is almost insupportable for this side .
<name> , what are you grinning at ? '
<name> 's mind had returned to him glowing and inspired .
he chuckled as he <unk> his <name> .
'it appears to amuse you , ' said king .
'let us participate .
what is it ? '
'the last two lines of the tenth ode , in this book , sir , ' was <unk> amazing reply .
'what ?
oh , i see .
non <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> aut <unk> <unk> <unk> latus [ 2 ] . '
king 's mouth twitched to hide a grin .
'was that done with intention ? '
[ footnote 2 : 'this side <name> not always be patient of rain and waiting on the threshold . ' ]
'i  i thought it fitted , sir . '
'it does .
it 's distinctly happy .
what put it into your thick head , paddy ? '
'i do n't know , sir , except we did the ode last term . '
'and you remembered ?
the same head that <unk> <unk> as a verb !
<name> , you are an enigma .
no !
this side <name> not always be patient of <unk> gases and waters .
i <name> make representations to our so-called <unk> .
meantime ( who shall say i am not just ? )
i <unk> you your <unk> pains and penalties in regard to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> .
i ought n't to do it , but this side is occasionally human .
by no means bad , paddy . '
'thank you , sir , ' said <name> , wondering how inspiration had visited him .
then king , with a few brisk remarks about science , headed them back to regulus , of whom and of <name> and rome and <unk> commercial carthage and of the democracy eternally futile , he explained , in all ages and climes , he spoke for ten minutes ; passing thence to the next ode  <unk> <unk>  where he fetched up , <unk> , upon  <unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ( thou <unk> because thou <unk> thyself as lower than the gods )  making it a text for a discourse on manners , morals , and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases , which lasted till the <name> rang .
then beetle , <unk> his books , observed to winton , 'when king 's really on tap he 's an interestin ' dog .
hartopp 's chlorine <unk> him . '
'yes ; but why did you tell me <unk> was " deluges , " you silly ass ? '
said winton .
'well , that <unk> him too .
look out , you <unk> old owl ! '
winton had cleared for action as the form poured out like puppies at play and was <unk> beetle .
stalky from behind collared winton low .
the three fell in confusion .
<unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' quoth stalky , <unk> <unk> <unk> locks .
'must n't <unk> with number five study .
do n't be too virtuous .
do n't brood over it .
'two n't count against you in your future <unk> .
cheer up , pater . '
<unk> him off my  er  essential guts , <name> you ? '
said beetle from beneath .
'he 's <unk> ' 'em . '
they dispersed to their studies .
* * * * * no one , the owner least of all , can explain what is in a growing boy's mind .
it might have been the blind ferment of <unk> ; <unk> random remarks about virtue might have stirred him ; like his betters he might have sought popularity by way of <unk> ; or , as the head asserted years later , the only known jest of his serious life might have worked on him , as a <unk> man 's one love colours and <unk> all his after days .
but , at the next lesson , mechanical drawing with mr. <unk> who as <unk> had very limited powers of punishment , winton fell suddenly from <name> and let loose a live mouse in the form-room .
the whole form , shrieking and leaping high , threw at it all the plaster cones , pyramids , and fruit in high relief  not to mention <unk>  that they could lay hands on .
mr. <unk> reported at once to the head ; winton owned up to his crime , which , <unk> in the upper third , pardonable at a price in the lower fourth , was , of course , rank <unk> on the part of a fifth form boy ; and so , by graduated stages , he arrived at the head 's study just before lunch , penitent , <unk> , annoyed with himself and  as the head said to king in the corridor after the meal  more human than he had known him in seven years .
'you see , ' the head drawled on , <unk> 's only fault is a certain <unk> and <unk> virtue .
so this comes very happily . '
'i 've never noticed any sign of it , ' said king .
winton was in king's house , and though king as <unk> might , and did , <unk> oppress his own province , once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the hands of the imperial authority king fought for him to the very last steps of caesar 's throne .
'well , you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the occasion , ' the head answered .
'it was . '
mr. king did not love mr. <unk> .
'it should have been a rat .
but  but  i hate to plead it  it 's the lad 's first offence . '
'could you have damned him more completely , king ? '
<unk> .
what is the penalty ? '
said king , in retreat , but keeping up a rear-guard action .
'only my usual few lines of <name> to be shown up by tea-time . '
the head 's eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where mullins , captain of the games ( <unk> , ' 'old pot , ' or <unk> ' mullins ) , was pinning up the usual wednesday notice  <unk> , middle , and little side football  a to k , l to z , 3 to <unk> <unk> you can not write out the head 's usual few ( which means five hundred ) latin lines and play football for one hour and three-quarters between the hours of <unk> and 5 p.m. winton had evidently no intention of trying to do so , for he <name> about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy foot .
yet it was law in the school , compared with which that of the medes and persians was no more than a non-committal resolution , that any boy , outside the first fifteen , who missed his football for any reason whatever , and had not a written excuse , duly signed by competent authority to explain his absence , would receive not less than three strokes with a <unk> from the captain of the games , generally a youth between seventeen and eighteen years , rarely under eleven stone ( <unk> ' was nearer thirteen ) , and always in hard condition .
king knew without inquiry that the head had given winton no such excuse .
'but he is practically a member of the first fifteen .
he has played for it all this term , ' said king .
'i believe his cap should have arrived last week . '
'his cap has not been given him .
officially , therefore , he is naught .
i rely on old pot . '
'but mullins is winton 's <unk> , ' king persisted .
pot mullins and pater winton were cousins and rather close friends .
'that <name> make no difference to mullins  or winton , if i know 'em , ' said the head .
'but  but , ' king played his last card desperately , 'i was going to recommend winton for extra <unk> in my house , now <unk> has gone . '
'certainly , ' said the head .
'why not ?
he <name> be excellent by tea-time , i <name> . '
at that moment they saw mr. <unk> , tripping down the corridor , waylaid by winton .
'it 's about that <unk> at mechanical drawing , ' winton opened , swinging across his path .
'yes , yes , highly disgraceful , ' mr. <unk> panted .
'i know it was , ' said winton .
'it  it was a cad 's trick because  ' 'because you knew i could n't give you more than fifty lines , ' said mr. <unk> .
'well , anyhow i 've come to apologise for it . '
'certainly , ' said mr. <unk> , and added , for he was a kindly man , 'i think that shows quite right feeling .
i 'll tell the head at once i'm satisfied . '
'no  no ! '
the boy 's still <unk> voice jumped from the growl to the squeak .
'i did n't mean that !
i  i did it on principle .
please do n't  er  do anything of that kind . '
mr. <unk> looked him up and down and , being an artist , understood .
'thank you , winton , ' he said .
'this shall be between ourselves . '
'you heard ? '
said king , indecent pride in his voice .
'of course .
you thought he was going to get <unk> to beg him off the <unk> . '
king denied this with so much warmth that the head laughed and king went away in a <unk> .
'by the way , ' said the head , 'i 've told winton to do his lines in your form-room  not in his study . '
<unk> , ' said king over his shoulder , for the head 's orders had saved winton and mullins , who was doing extra army work in the study , from an embarrassing afternoon together .
an hour later , king wandered into his still form-room as though by accident .
winton was hard at work .
'aha ! '
said king , rubbing his hands .
'this does not look like games , winton .
do n't let me arrest your facile pen .
whence this sudden love for <name> ? '
<unk> from the head , sir , for that <unk> this morning . '
<unk> thereof have reached us .
that was a lapse on your part into lower <unk> which i do n't quite understand . '
the <unk> ' of the <unk> before the sides settled to games came through the open window .
winton , like his house-master , loved fresh air .
then they heard paddy <name> , <unk> on duty , calling the roll in the field and marking <unk> .
winton wrote steadily .
king curled himself up on a desk , hands round knees .
one would have said that the man was <unk> over the boy 's misfortune , but the boy understood .
<unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' king quoted presently .
'it is necessary to bear oneself as lower than the local gods  even than <unk> who are <unk> from effective retaliation .
i do wish you 'd tried that <unk> with me , pater . '
winton grinned ; then sobered 'it was a cad 's trick , sir , to play on mr .
<unk> . '
he peered forward at the <name> he was copying .
'well , " the sin i <unk> to each <unk> ghost "  ' king stopped himself .
'why do you <unk> like an owl ?
hand me the <unk> and i'll dictate .
no matter .
any <name> <unk> measures <name> serve .
i may peradventure recall a few . '
he began : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> memento <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> .
there you have it all , winton .
write that out twice and yet once again . '
for the next forty minutes , with never a glance at the book , king paid out the glorious <unk> ( and king could read latin as though it were alive ) , winton hauling them in and <unk> them away behind him as <unk> in a <unk> 's hold coil away deep-sea cable .
king broke from the <unk> to the <unk> and back again , pausing now and then to translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the <unk> texture of the ancient fabric .
he did not allude to the coming interview with mullins except at the last , when he said , 'i think at this juncture , pater , i need not ask you for the precise significance of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '
the ungrateful winton flushed angrily , and king loafed out to take five o'clock <unk> , after which he invited little hartopp to tea and a talk on <unk> .
hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam , and the two went up to king 's study about the same time as winton returned to the form-room beneath it to finish his lines .
then half a dozen of the second fifteen , who should have been washing , strolled in to <unk> with <unk> ' winton , whose misfortune and its consequences were common talk .
no one was more sincere than the long , red-headed , <unk> <unk> ' <name> , but , being a careless animal , he <unk> winton 's desk .
<unk> you for a silly ass ! '
said winton .
'do n't do that . '
no one is expected to be polite while under punishment , so <name> , sinking his <unk> , replied peacefully enough : 'well , do n't be <unk> , pater . '
'i 'm not , ' said winton .
'get out !
this ai n't your house form-room . '
<unk> do n't belong to you .
why do n't you go to your own study ? '
<name> replied .
'because mullins is there waitin ' for the victim , ' said stalky delicately , and they all laughed .
'you ought to have shaken that mouse out of your <unk> , pater .
that 's the way i did in my youth .
pater 's <unk> ' to his second childhood .
never mind , pater , we all respect you and your future <unk> . '
winton , still writhing , growled .
<name> leaning on the desk somehow shook it again .
then he laughed .
'what are you grinning at ? '
winton asked .
'i was only thinkin ' of you being sent up to take a lickin ' from pot .
i swear i do n't think it 's fair .
you 've never shirked a game in your life , and you 're as good as in the first fifteen already .
your cap ought to have been delivered last week , ought n't it ? '
it was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the privileges and <unk> of the first fifteen till the black <name> cap with the gold <unk> , made by <unk> exeter <unk> , had been actually set on his head .
ages ago , a <unk> and <unk> second fifteen had attempted to change this law , but the prefects of that age were still larger , and the lively experiment had never been repeated .
'will you , ' said winton very slowly , <unk> mind your own damned business , you cursed , clumsy , <unk> fool ? '
the form-room was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside .
<name> shifted his feet uneasily .
'well , i should n't like to take a lickin ' from pot , ' he said .
'would n't you ? '
winton asked , as he <unk> the sheets of lines with hands that shook .
'no , i should n't , ' said <name> , his <unk> growing more distinct on the bridge of his white nose .
'well , i 'm going to take it '  winton moved clear of the desk as he spoke .
'but you're going to take a lickin ' from me first . '
before any one realised it , he had flung himself neighing against <name> .
no <unk> were observed on either side , and the rest looked on amazed .
the two met confusedly , <name> trying to do what he could with his longer reach ; winton , insensible to blows , only concerned to drive his enemy into a corner and batter him to pulp .
this he managed over against the fire-place , where <name> dropped <unk> .
'now i 'm going to give you your lickin ' , ' said winton .
<unk> there till i get a <unk> and i 'll cut you to pieces .
if you move , i 'll <name> you out of the window . '
he wound his hands into the boy 's collar and <unk> , and had actually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one accord dropped on his head , shoulders , and legs .
he fought them <unk> in an awful hissing silence .
stalky 's sensitive nose was rubbed along the floor ; beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling and crowing against the wall ; perowne 's forehead was cut , and <unk> came out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through a whole week .
<unk> !
quite mad ! '
said stalky , and for the third time wriggled back to winton 's throat .
the door opened and king came in , hartopp 's little figure just behind him .
the mound on the floor panted and heaved but did not rise , for winton still squirmed <unk> .
'only a little play , sir , ' said perowne .
<unk> hit my head against a form . '
this was quite true .
'oh , ' said king .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , i presume , are the <unk> <unk> winton 's return to  mullins , eh ? '
'no , sir , ' said stalky behind his <unk> handkerchief .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> . '
'not bad !
you see , some of it sticks after all , ' king chuckled to hartopp , and the two masters left without further inquiries .
the boys sat still on the <unk> winton .
'well , ' said stalky at last , 'of all the putrid <unk> , pater , you are the  ' 'i 'm sorry .
i 'm awfully sorry , ' winton began , and they let him rise .
he held out his hand to the bruised and bewildered <name> .
'sorry , paddy .
i  i must have lost my temper .
i  i do n't know what 's the matter with me . '
<unk> lot of good that 'll do my face at tea , ' <name> grunted .
'why could n't you say there was something wrong with you instead of <unk> out like a lunatic ?
is my lip puffy ? '
'just a trifle .
look at my beak !
well , we got all these pretty marks at <unk>  <unk> ' to the zeal with which we played the game , ' said stalky , dusting himself .
'but d'you think you 're fit to be let loose again , pater ?
'sure you do n't want to kill another <unk> ?
i wish i was pot .
i 'd cut your <unk> young soul out . '
'i s'pose i ought to go to pot now , ' said winton .
'and let all the other asses see you lookin ' like this !
not much .
we'll all come up to number five study and wash off in hot water .
beetle , you are n't damaged .
go along and light the <unk> . '
'there 's a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere , ' perowne shouted after him .
<unk> round till you find it , and take it up . '
separately , by different roads , <name> 's jersey pulled half over his head , the boys repaired to number five study .
little hartopp and king , i am sorry to say , leaned over the <unk> of king 's landing and watched .
<unk> human , ' said little hartopp .
'your virtuous winton , having got himself into trouble , takes it out of my poor old paddy .
i wonder what precise lie paddy <name> tell about his face . '
'but surely you are n't going to embarrass him by asking ? '
said king .
<unk> boy won , ' said hartopp .
'to go back to what we were discussing , ' said king quickly , 'do you pretend that your modern system of <unk> unrelated facts about chlorine , for instance , all of which may be proved <unk> by the time the boys grow up , can have any real bearing on education  even the low type of it that <unk> expect ? '
'i maintain nothing .
but is it any worse than your chinese <unk> of <unk> syllables in a dead tongue ? '
<unk> , forsooth ! '
king fairly danced .
'the only living tongue on earth !
chinese !
on my word , hartopp ! '
'and at the end of seven years  how often have i said it ? '
hartopp went on ,  <unk> years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each , your victims go away with nothing , absolutely nothing , except , perhaps , if they 've been very attentive , a dozen  no , i 'll <name> you twenty  one score of totally unrelated latin <unk> which any child of twelve could have absorbed in two terms . '
'but  but ca n't you realise that if our system brings later  at any rate  at a pinch  a simple understanding  grammar and <unk> apart  a mere glimpse of the significance ( foul word ! )
of , we 'll say , one ode of <name> , one twenty lines of <name> , we 've got what we poor devils of ushers are striving after ? '
'and what might that be ? '
said hartopp .
<unk> , proportion , perspective  life .
your scientific man is the unrelated animal  the beast without background .
have n't you ever realised that in your atmosphere of stinks ? '
<unk> you make them lose life for the sake of living , eh ? '
<unk> again , hartopp !
i told you about paddy 's quotation this morning .
( but he made <unk> a verb , he did ! )
you yourself heard young corkran 's reference to <unk> <unk> .
it sticks  a little of it sticks among the barbarians . '
<unk> and essentially chinese , ' said little hartopp , who , alone of the common-room , refused to be <unk> by king .
'but i do n't yet understand how paddy came to be licked by winton .
paddy 's supposed to be something of a boxer . '
<unk> of vinegar made from <name> , ' king replied .
<unk> , like some other people , is patient and long-suffering , but he has his limits .
the head is <unk> him <unk> , too .
as i pointed out , the boy has practically been in the first fifteen since term began . '
'but , my dear fellow , i 've known you give a boy an <unk> and refuse him leave off games , again and again . '
'ah , but that was when there was real need to get at some <unk> who could n't be <unk> in any other way .
now , in our esteemed <unk> action i see nothing but  ' the conversation from this point does not concern us .
meantime winton , very penitent and especially polite towards <name> , was being cheered with cocoa in number five study .
they had some difficulty in <unk> the flood of his apologies .
he himself pointed out to <name> that he had attacked a <unk> for no reason whatever , and , therefore , deserved official punishment .
'i ca n't think what was the matter with me to-day , ' he mourned .
<unk> since that blasted <unk>  ' 'well , then , do n't think , ' said stalky .
'or do you want paddy to make a row about it before all the school ? '
here <name> was understood to say that he would see winton and all the school somewhere else .
'and if you imagine perowne and <unk> and me are goin ' to give evidence at a prefects ' meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience , you jolly well err , ' said beetle .
'i know what you did . '
'what ? '
croaked pater , out of the valley of his humiliation .
'you went <unk> .
i 've read all about it in <unk> . '
'what 's " going <unk> " ? '
winton asked .
'never you mind , ' was the reply .
'now , do n't you feel awfully weak and seedy ? '
'i am rather tired , ' said winton , sighing .
'that 's what you ought to be .
you 've gone <unk> and pretty soon you'll go to sleep .
but you 'll probably be liable to fits of it all your life , ' beetle concluded .
<unk> n't wonder if you murdered some one some day . '
<unk> up  you and your <unk> ! '
said stalky .
'go to mullins now and get it over , pater . '
'i call it filthy unjust of the head , ' said <name> .
<unk> , you've given me my lickin ' , old man .
i <name> pot 'll give you yours . '
'i 'm awfully sorry  awfully sorry , ' was winton 's last word .
it was the custom in that <unk> to deal with games ' <unk> between five o'clock <unk> and tea .
mullins , who was old enough to pity , did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the chill of the next morning for their punishments .
he was finishing off the last of the small fry and their excuses when winton arrived .
'but , please , mullins '  this was <unk> tertius , a dear little <unk> mother 's darling  'i had an awful hack on the knee .
i've been to the matron about it and she gave me some iodine .
i 've been rubbing it in all day .
i thought that would be an excuse off . '
'let 's have a look at it , ' said the impassive mullins .
'that 's a <unk>  about a week old .
touch your toes .
i 'll give you the iodine . '
<unk> yelled loudly as he had many times before .
the face of <unk> , aged eleven , a new boy that dark wet term , low in the house , low in the lower school , and lowest of all in his <unk> little mind turned white at the horror of the sight .
they could hear his working lips part <unk> as <unk> wailed his way out of hearing .
<unk> , <unk> !
what brings you here ? '
said mullins .
<unk> , sir , i went for a walk with <unk> tertius . '
'did you ?
then i bet you went to the <unk>  and you paid , didn't you ? '
a nod .
<unk> was too terrified to speak .
'of course , and i bet <unk> told you that old pot 'ud let you off because it was the first time . '
another nod with a ghost of a smile in it .
'all right . '
mullins picked <unk> up before he could guess what was coming , laid him on the table with one hand , with the other gave him three emphatic <unk> , then held him high in air .
'now you tell <unk> tertius that he 's got you a licking from me , and see you jolly well pay it back to him .
and when you 're prefect of games do n't you let any one shirk his <unk> without a written excuse .
where d'you play in your game ? '
<unk> , sir . '
'you can do better than that .
i 've seen you run like a young <unk> .
ask <unk> from me to try you as <unk> next game , <name> you ?
cut along . '
<unk> left , warm for the first time that day , enormously set up in his own esteem , and very hot against the deceitful <unk> .
mullins turned to winton .
'your name 's on the list , pater . '
winton nodded .
'i know it .
the head landed me with an <unk> for that <unk> at mechanical drawing .
no excuse . '
'he meant it then ? '
mullins jerked his head delicately towards the <unk> on the table .
'i heard something about it . '
winton nodded .
'a rotten thing to do , ' he said .
'ca n't think what i was doing ever to do it .
it counts against a fellow so ; and there 's some more too  ' 'all right , pater .
just stand clear of our <unk> , <name> you ? '
the little formality over , there was a pause .
winton swung round , yawned in pot 's astonished face and staggered towards the window-seat .
'what 's the matter with you , <name> ?
ill ? '
'no .
perfectly all right , thanks .
only  only a little sleepy . '
winton stretched himself out , and then and there fell deeply and placidly asleep .
'it is n't a faint , ' said the experienced mullins , 'or his pulse wouldn't act .
't is n't a fit or he 'd snort and twitch .
it ca n't be sunstroke , this term , and he has n't been <unk> for anything . '
he opened <unk> collar , packed a cushion under his head , threw a rug over him and sat down to listen to the regular breathing .
before long stalky arrived , on pretence of borrowing a book .
he looked at the window-seat .
<unk> anything wrong with winton lately ? '
said mullins .
<unk> anything wrong with my beak ? '
stalky replied .
<unk> went <unk> after <unk> , and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him about his <unk> .
you ought to see <unk> 's eye . '
'you mean that pater fought ? '
said mullins .
'like a devil .
then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now .
i expect he 'll be all right when he wakes up .
rummy business !
conscientious old <unk> .
you ought to have heard his apologies . '
'but pater ca n't fight one little bit , ' mullins repeated .
"twas n't fighting .
he just tried to murder every one . '
stalky described the affair , and when he left mullins went off to take counsel with the head , who , out of a cloud of blue smoke , told him that all would yet be well .
<unk> , ' said he , 'is a little stiff in his moral joints .
he 'll get over that .
if he asks you whether to-day 's doings <name> count against him in his  ' 'but you know it 's important to him , sir .
his people are n't  very well off , ' said mullins .
'that 's why i 'm taking all this trouble .
you must reassure him , pot .
i have <unk> him with new experiences .
oh , by the way , has his cap come ? '
'it came at dinner , sir . '
mullins laughed .
sure enough , when he waked at tea-time , winton proposed to take mullins all through every one of his day 's lapses from <name> , and 'do you think it <name> count against me ? '
said he .
'do n't you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career , ' said mullins .
'you 're all right .
and oh  here 's your first cap at last .
shove it up on the <unk> and come on to tea . '
they met king on their way , stepping statelily and rubbing his hands .
'i have applied , ' said he , 'for the services of an additional <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> absence .
your name , winton , seems to have found favour with the powers that be , and  and all things considered  i am disposed to give my support to the nomination .
you are therefore a <unk> . '
'then it did n't count against me , ' winton gasped as soon as they were out of hearing .
a captain of games can jest with a <unk> publicly .
'you utter ass ! '
said mullins , and caught him by the back of his stiff neck and ran him down to the hall where the <unk> , who sit below the salt , made him welcome with the economical <unk> of <unk> .
king and little hartopp were <unk> in the reverend <name> <unk> study at 10 p.m.  classical <unk> modern as usual .
<unk>  proportion  background , ' snarled king .
'that is the essence of the <unk> . '
<unk> of <unk> , ' little hartopp answered .
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> behind the soda-water .
'you men oppress me .
hartopp , what did you say to paddy in your dormitories to-night ?
even you could n't have overlooked his face . '
'but i did , ' said hartopp calmly .
'i was n't even humorous about it as some <unk> might have been .
i went straight through and said naught . '
'poor paddy !
now , for my part , ' said king , 'and you know i am not lavish in my praises , i consider winton a first-class type ; absolutely first-class . '
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> .
<unk> of the second class , i admit .
the very best type of second class but '  he shook his head  'it should have been a rat .
pater 'll never be anything more than a colonel of engineers . '
'what do you base that verdict on ? '
said king stiffly .
'he came to me after prayers  with all his conscience . '
'poor old pater .
was it the mouse ? '
said little hartopp .
'that , and what he called his uncontrollable temper , and his responsibilities as <unk> . '
'and you ? '
'if we had had what is <unk> called a <unk> he 'd have had hysterics .
so i recommended a dose of <unk> salts .
he 'll take it , too  conscientiously .
do n't eat me , king .
perhaps , he 'll be a <unk> . '
ten o'clock struck and the army class boys in the further studies coming to their houses after an hour 's extra work passed along the gravel path below .
some one was chanting , to the tune of <unk> sand and grey sand , ' dis te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
he stopped outside mullins ' study .
they heard mullins ' window slide up and then stalky 's voice : 'ah !
<unk> , mullins , my <unk> <unk> .
we 're the waits .
we have come to inquire after the local <unk> .
is he doin ' as well as can be expected in his new <unk> ? '
'better than you <name> , in a sec , stalky , ' mullins grunted .
<unk> of that .
we thought he 'd like to know that paddy has been carried to the <unk> in <unk> ' delirium .
they think it 's concussion of the <name> . '
'why , he was all right at prayers , ' winton began earnestly , and they heard a laugh in the background as mullins slammed down the window .
<unk> , regulus , ' stalky sang out , and the light footsteps went on .
'you see .
it sticks .
a little of it sticks among the barbarians , ' said king .
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> .
'go to bed . '
a translation <name> , <unk> .
v. ode 3 there are whose study is of smells , and to attentive schools rehearse how something mixed with something else makes something worse .
some cultivate in <unk> impure the clients of our body  these , increasing without <name> , cure , or cause , disease .
others the heated wheel <unk> , and all its offspring , whose concern is how to make it farthest roll and fastest turn .
me , much <unk> if the hour present , or to be paid for , brings me to <unk> by the power of wheels or wings ; me , in whose breast no flame hath burned life-long , save that by pindar lit , such <name> leaves cold : i am not turned aside to it more than when , sunk in thought profound of what the <unk> gods require , my steward ( friend but slave ) brings round logs for my fire .
the edge of the evening ( 1913 ) ah !
what avails the classic bent , and what the chosen word , against the <unk> incident that actually occurred ?
and what is <name> <unk> we press through paint and prose and rhyme  when nature in her nakedness defeats us every time ?
'hi !
hi !
hold your horses !
stop ! ...
well !
well ! '
a <name> man in a <unk> overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up pall mall .
'you do n't know me ?
you 're excusable .
i was n't wearing much of anything last time we met  in south africa . '
the scales fell from my eyes , and i saw him once more in a sky-blue army shirt , behind barbed wire , among dutch prisoners bathing at <unk> , more than a dozen years ago [ 3 ] .
'why , it 's zigler  <unk> o .
zigler ! '
i cried .
'well , i am glad to see you . '
[ footnote 3 : 'the captive ' : <unk> and discoveries . ]
'oh no !
you do n't work any of your english on me .
" so glad to see you , <unk> know  an ' <unk> ! "
do you reside in this village ? '
'no .
i 'm up here buying stores . '
'then you take my automobile .
where to ? ...
oh , i know them !
my lord <unk> is one of the directors .
<unk> , drive to the army and navy <unk> supply association limited , <name> street , <unk> . '
he settled himself on the deep <unk> <unk> cushions , and his smile was like the turning on of all the electrics .
his teeth were whiter than the <name> fittings .
he smelt of rare soap and cigarettes  such cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an automatic lighter .
on my side of the car was a <unk> mirror , card and <unk> case .
i looked at him inquiringly .
'yes , ' he nodded , 'two years after i quit the cape .
she 's not an ohio girl , though .
she 's in the country now .
is that right ?
she 's at our little place in the country .
we 'll go there as soon as you 're through with your <unk> .
engagements ?
the only engagement you 've got is to grab your grip  get your bag from your hotel , i mean  and come right along and meet her .
you are the captive of my bow and spear now . '
'i surrender , ' i said meekly .
'did the zigler automatic gun do all this ? '
i pointed to the car fittings .
<unk> !
think of your <unk> ' that !
well , no .
the zigler is a great gun  the greatest ever  but life 's too short , an ' too interestin ' , to squander on pushing her in military society .
i 've leased my rights in her to a <unk> citizen full of <unk> and moral uplift .
if those things weigh with the <unk> of europe , he <name> make good and  i shall be surprised .
excuse me ! '
he bared his head as we passed the statue of the great <name> outside buckingham palace .
'a very great <name> ! '
said he .
'i have enjoyed her hospitality .
she represents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world .
the next is the one we are going to .
mrs. zigler uses 'em , and they break her up every week on returned empties . '
'oh , you mean the stores ? '
i said .
<unk> .
zigler means it more .
they are quite <unk> in their outlook .
i guess i 'll wait outside and pray while you wrestle with 'em . '
my business at the stores finished , and my bag <unk> from the hotel , his moving palace slid us into the country .
'i owe it to you , ' zigler began as smoothly as the car , 'to tell you what i am now .
i represent the business end of the american invasion .
not the blame cars themselves  i would n't be found dead in one  but the tools that make 'em .
i am the zigler <unk> tool and <unk> trust .
the trust , sir , is entirely my own  in my own inventions .
i am the <unk> <unk> <unk>  the lightest <unk> on the market  one price , one power , one guarantee .
i am the <unk> <unk> , <unk> company for <unk> bodies ; and i am the rush <unk> for military <unk>  absolutely silent  which the continent <unk> under royalty .
with three exceptions , the british are n't wise to it yet .
that 's all i represent at present .
you saw me take off my hat to your late <name> ?
i owe every cent i have to that great an ' good <name> .
yes , sir , i came out of africa , after my eighteen months ' <unk> and <unk> treatment and <unk> , as her prisoner of war , like a giant refreshed .
there was n't anything could hold me , when i 'd got my hooks into it , after that experience .
and to you as a representative british citizen , i say here and now that i regard you as the founder of the family fortune  <name> 's and mine . '
'but i only gave you some papers and tobacco . '
'what more does any citizen need ?
the <unk> <name> would n't have helped me as much then ; an '  talking about south africa , tell me  ' we talked about south africa till the car stopped at the georgian lodge of a great park .
'we 'll get out here .
i want to show you a rather <unk> view , ' said zigler .
we walked , perhaps , half a mile , across <unk> turf , past a lake , entered a dark <unk> wood , ticking with the noise of pheasants ' feet , and came out suddenly , where five rides met , at a small classic <name> between <unk> <unk> statues which faced a circle of turf , several acres in extent .
<name> <unk> , of a size that i had never seen before , walled the <unk> circle like cliffs of riven obsidian , except at the lower end , where it gave on to a stretch of undulating bare ground ending in a <unk> slope <unk> away .
'that 's where the old <unk> <unk> used to be , ' said zigler .
'that <unk> is called <name> 's <name> .
<name> <unk> and mrs. siddons an ' <unk> an ' all that crowd used to act plays here for king <name> the third .
was n't it ?
well , <name> is the only king i play .
let it go at that .
this circle was the stage , i guess .
the kings an ' the nobility sat in <name> 's <name> .
i forget who <unk> these statues at the door .
they 're the comic and tragic muse .
but it 's a <unk> view , ai n't it ? '
the sunlight was leaving the park .
i caught a glint of silver to the southward beyond the wooded ridge .
'that 's the ocean  the channel , i mean , ' said zigler .
'it 's twenty-three miles as a man flies .
a <unk> view , ai n't it ? '
i looked at the severe <unk> , the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues , at the blue-green shadows on the <unk> grass , and at the still bright plain in front where some deer were feeding .
'it 's a most dramatic contrast , but i think it would be better on a summer 's day , ' i said , and we went on , up one of the noiseless rides , a quarter of a mile at least , till we came to the <unk> front of an enormous georgian pile .
four footmen revealed themselves in a hall <name> with pictures .
'i hired this off of my lord <unk> , ' zigler explained , while they helped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of <unk> and <unk> ancestors .
<unk> .
they always look at me too , as if i'd blown in from the gutter .
which , of course , i have .
that 's <name> , <name> <unk> .
old man <name> painted her .
do you see any likeness to my lord <unk> ?
why , have n't you ever met up with him ?
he was captain mankeltow  my <name> british artillery captain that blew up my gun in the war , an ' then tried to bury me against my religious principles [ 4 ] .
<unk> .
his father died and he got the lordship .
that was about all he got by the time that your british <unk> were through with him .
so he said i 'd oblige him by hiring his ranch .
it 's a hell an ' a half of a proposition to handle , but <name>  mrs. <unk>  understands it .
come right in to the parlour and be very welcome . '
[ footnote 4 : " the captive " : <unk> and discoveries . ]
he guided me , hand on shoulder , into a babble of high-pitched talk and laughter that filled a vast drawing-room .
he introduced me as the founder of the family fortunes to a little , lithe , <unk> woman whose speech and greeting were of the <unk> south .
she in turn presented me to her mother , a <unk> <unk> old <name> with a cap of priceless venetian point , hands that must have held many hearts in their time , and a dignity as unquestioned and <unk> as an empress .
she was , indeed , a <name> of <name> , who , on their own ground , <unk> the <unk> of <name> .
the rest of the company came from buffalo , cincinnati , <name> and chicago , with here and there a softening southern strain .
a party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece surmounted by a <unk> .
two portly men , half hidden by a cased harp , discussed , over sheaves of typewritten documents , the terms of some contract .
a knot of matrons talked servants  <name> <unk> <name>  across the grand piano .
a youth ravaged an old bookcase , while beside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves , dead three hundred years , but now leaping to life and warning under the shaded <unk> .
in a corner half-a-dozen girls examined the glazed tables that held the decorations  english and foreign  of the late lord <unk> .
'see heah !
would this be the <unk> of the <unk> ? '
one said , pointing .
'i <unk> likely .
no !
the garter has " <name> swore "  i know that much .
this is " <unk> <unk> " something . '
'oh , what 's that cunning little copper cross with " for <unk> " ? '
a third cried .
'say !
look at here ! '
said the young man at the bookcase .
'here 's a first edition of <unk> cross and a <unk> 's birds right next to it  just like so many best sellers .
look , <unk> ! '
the girl beneath the picture half turned her body but not her eyes .
'you do n't tell me ! '
she said slowly .
<unk> women amounted to something after all . '
'but woman 's scope , and outlook was <unk> <unk> in those days , ' one of the matrons put in , from the piano .
<unk> ?
for her ?
if they <unk> , i guess she was the <unk> .
who was she ?
peters , <unk> 's the <unk> ? '
a thin butler , in charge of two footmen removing the <unk> , slid to a table and handed her a <unk> book .
he was <unk> by one of the men behind the harp , who wished to get a telephone call through to edinburgh .
'the local office shuts at six , ' said peters .
'but i can get through to '  he named some town  'in ten minutes , sir . '
'that suits me .
you 'll find me here when you 've hitched up .
oh , say , peters !
we  mister <unk> an ' me  ai n't goin ' by that early morning train to-morrow  but the other one  on the other line  whatever they call it . '
'the nine twenty-seven , sir .
yes , sir .
early breakfast <name> be at half-past eight and the car <name> be at the door at nine . '
<unk> ! '
an imperious young voice called .
'what 's the <unk> with lord <unk> 's <unk> of the <unk> ?
we <unk> n't find it <unk> . '
'well , miss , i have heard that that order is usually returned to his majesty on the death of the holder .
yes , miss . '
then in a whisper to a footman , 'more butter for the <unk> in king <name> 's corner . '
he stopped behind my chair .
'your room is number eleven , sir .
may i trouble you for your keys ? '
he left the room with a <unk> maiden called <name> who had announced she would not go to bed <unk> <name> , <name> , <unk> takes me  so there ! '
he very kindly looked in on me for a moment as i was dressing for dinner .
'not at all , sir , ' he replied to some compliment i paid him .
'i <unk> the late lord <unk> for fifteen years .
he was very abrupt in his movements , sir .
as a rule i never received more than an <unk> notice of a journey .
we used to go to syria frequently .
i have been twice to babylon .
mr. and mrs. zigler 's requirements are , comparatively speaking , few . '
'but the guests ? '
'very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their <unk> .
extremely simple , if i may say so , sir . '
i had the privilege of taking mrs. <name> in to dinner , and was rewarded with an entirely new , and to me rather shocking view , of <name> <name> , who , she said , had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and fire , and had surrendered the remnant to aliens .
'my brother , suh , ' she said , <unk> at <unk> in order that <unk> should <unk> new england to-day .
if i took any interest in any <unk> outside of my son-in-law <unk> <unk> , i should say that my brother 's death had been amply avenged . '
the man at her right took up the challenge , and the war spread .
her eyes twinkled over the flames she had lit .
'do n't these folk , ' she said a little later , <unk> you of arabs <unk> under the pyramids ? '
'i 've never seen the pyramids , ' i replied .
<unk> !
i did n't know you were as english as all that . '
and when i laughed , 'are you ? '
<unk> .
it saves trouble . '
'now that 's just what i find so significant among the english '  this was <name> 's mother , i think , with one elbow well forward among the salted almonds .
'oh , i know how you feel , madam <name> , but a <unk> like myself  i 'm buffalo  even though we come over every year  notices the <name> for comfort in england .
there 's so little conflict or uplift in british society . '
'but we like being comfortable , ' i said .
'i know it .
it 's very characteristic .
but ai n't it a little , just a little , lacking in <unk> an ' imagination ? '
'they have n't any need for <unk> , ' madam <name> struck in .
'they have n't any <name> island standards to live up to . '
'but we can <unk> , ' the buffalo woman charged on .
'now you have done it ! '
i whispered to the old <name> as the blessed word <unk> ' woke up all the old arguments for and against .
there was not a dull moment in that dinner for me  nor afterwards when the boys and girls at the piano played the <unk> tunes of their own land , while their elders , <unk> interested , <unk> into the discussion of that land 's future , till there was talk of <unk> .
when all the company had been set to tables zigler led me into his <unk> study , where i noticed he kept his <unk> , and spoke simply as a child , gravely as a bishop , of the years that were past since our last meeting .
'that 's about all , i guess  up to date , ' he said when he had unrolled the bright map of his fortunes across three continents .
<unk> ' <name> suits me .
so does your country , sir .
my own country ?
you heard what that detroit man said at dinner .
" a government of the alien , by the alien , for the alien . "
mother 's right , too .
<name> killed us .
from the highest motives  but he killed us .
oh , say , that reminds me .
<unk> kill a man from the highest motives ? '
'not from any motive  as far as i remember . '
'well , i have .
it do n't weigh on my mind any , but it was interesting .
life is interesting for a <name>  for any  man in england .
<unk> !
life in england is like settin ' in the front row at the theatre and never knowin ' when the whole blame drama wo n't spill itself into your lap .
i did n't always know that .
i lie abed now , and i blush to think of some of the breaks i made in south africa .
about the british .
not your official method of doin ' business .
but the spirit .
i was 'way , 'way off on the spirit .
are you acquainted with any other country where you 'd have to kill a man or two to get at the national spirit ? '
'well , ' i answered , 'next to marrying one of its women , killing one of its men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country .
i take it you killed a british citizen . '
'why , no .
our syndicate confined its operations to aliens  <unk> aliens ... . <unk> know an english lord called lundie [ 5 ] ?
looks like a <unk> and soap advertisement .
i imagine he was in your supreme court before he came into his lordship . '
[ footnote 5 : 'the <unk> ' : actions and reactions . ]
'he is a lawyer  what we call a law lord  a judge of appeal  not a real hereditary lord . '
'that 's as much beyond me as this ! '
zigler slapped a fat <unk> on the table .
'but i <unk> this unreal law lord lundie is kind o ' real in his decisions ?
i judged so .
and  one more question .
<unk> meet a man called walen ? '
'd'you mean <unk> , the editor of  ? '
i mentioned the journal .
'that 's him .
<unk> like a tough , talks like a maxim , and trains with kings . '
'he does , ' i said .
<unk> knows all the crowned heads of europe intimately .
it 's his hobby . '
'well , there 's the whole outfit for you  <unk> ' my lord <unk> , <unk> mankeltow , an ' me .
all active murderers  specially the law lord  or accessories after the fact .
and what do they hand you out for that , in this country ? '
<unk> years , i believe , ' was my reply .
he reflected a moment .
<unk> , ' he said , and followed it with a <unk> .
<unk> months at the cape is my limit .
say , murder ai n't the <unk> ' event those <unk> in the magazines make out .
it develops naturally like any other proposition ... . say , <unk> play this golf game ?
it 's come up in the states from maine to california , an ' we 're <unk> ' all the champions in sight .
not a business man 's play , but interestin ' .
i 've got a <unk> in the park here that they tell me is the finest inland course ever .
i had to pay extra for that when i hired the <unk>  last year .
it was just before i signed the papers that our murder <unk> .
my lord <unk> he asked me down for the week-end to fix up something or other  about peters and the linen , i think 't was .
mrs. zigler took a holt of the proposition .
she understood peters from the word " go . "
there was n't any <unk> ; only fifteen or twenty folk .
a full house is thirty-two , <name> tells me .
'guess we must be near on that to-night .
in the smoking-room here , my lord <unk>  mankeltow that was  introduces me to this walen man with the nose .
he 'd been in the war too , from start to finish .
he knew all the columns and generals that i'd <unk> with in the days of my zigler gun .
we kinder fell into each other 's arms an ' let the harsh world go by for a while .
<unk> he introduces me to your lord lundie .
he was a new proposition to me .
if he had n't been a lawyer he 'd have made a lovely <unk> .
i thought i had played poker some .
another of my breaks .
<unk> !
it cost me eleven hundred dollars besides what <name> said when i retired .
i have no fault to find with your hereditary aristocracy , or your judiciary , or your press .
<unk> we all went to church across the park here ... . <unk> !
think o' your <unk> ' my religion !
i 've become an <unk> since i married .
<unk> ... . after lunch walen did his <unk> stunt in the <unk> here .
he was long on kings .
and continental crises .
i do not pretend to follow british domestic politics , but in the <unk> business a man has to know something of international possibilities .
at present , you british are settin ' in <unk> on dynamite <unk> .
walen 's talk put me wise on the location and size of some of the <unk> .
<unk> !
'after that , we four went out to look at those <unk> i was <unk> ' .
we each took a club .
mine '  he glanced at a great tan bag by the fire-place  'was the beginner 's friend  the <unk> .
well , sir , this golf proposition took a holt of me as quick as  quick as death .
they had to <unk> me off the greens when it got too dark to see , and then we went back to the house .
i was walkin ' ahead with my lord <unk> <unk> beginners ' golf .
( i was the man who ought to have been killed by rights . )
we cut 'cross lots through the woods to <name> 's <name>  that place i showed you this afternoon .
lundie and walen were , maybe , twenty or thirty <name> behind us in the dark .
<unk> and i stopped at the theatre to admire at the ancestral <unk> .
he took me right under the biggest  king somebody 's yew  and while i was <unk> ' it with my handkerchief , he says , " look heah ! "
just as if it was a rabbit  and down comes a <unk> into the theatre with no more noise than the dead .
my rush <unk> is the only one on the market that allows that sort of <unk> work ... . what ?
a <unk>  with two men in it .
both men jump out and start <unk> ' with the engines .
i was starting to tell mankeltow  i ca n't remember to call him <unk> any more  that it looked as if the <name> british flying corps had got on to my rush <unk> at last ; but he steps out from under the yew to these two stealthy <unk> and says , " what 's the trouble ?
can i be of any service ? "
he thought  so did i  't was some of the boys from <unk> or salisbury .
well , sir , from there on , the situation developed like a <unk> in hell .
the man on the nigh side of the machine whirls round , pulls his gun and fires into mankeltow 's face .
i laid him out with my <unk> automatically .
any one who shoots a friend of mine gets what 's comin ' to him if i 'm within reach .
he drops .
mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief .
the man the far side of the machine starts to run .
lundie down the ride , or it might have been walen , shouts , " what 's happened ? "
mankeltow says , " collar that chap . "
'the second man runs <unk> round the machine , one hand <unk> ' behind him .
mankeltow heads him off to me .
he breaks blind for walen and lundie , who are runnin ' up the ride .
there 's some sort of mix-up among 'em , which it 's too dark to see , and a thud .
walen says , " oh , well collared ! "
lundie says , " that 's the only thing i never learned at harrow ! " ...
mankeltow runs up to 'em , still <unk> ' his neck , and says , " he did n't fire at me .
it was the other chap .
where is he ? "
' " i 've stretched him alongside his machine , " i says .
' " are they <unk> ? "
says lundie .
' " no .
<unk> .
i ca n't make it out , " says mankeltow .
' " look at here , " says walen , kind of <unk> .
" this man ai n't <unk> at all .
did n't you hear somethin ' crack when he lit , lundie ? "
' " my god ! "
says lundie .
" did i ?
i thought it was my suspenders "  no , he said " braces . "
<unk> there i left them and sort o ' tiptoed back to my man , <unk> ' he'd revived and quit .
but he had n't .
that darned <unk> had hit him on the back of the neck just where his helmet stopped .
he 'd got his .
i knew it by the way the head rolled in my hands .
then the others came up the ride <unk> ' their load .
no <unk> ' that shuffle on grass .
d'you remember it  in south africa ?
<unk> .
' " hsh ! "
says lundie .
" do you know i 've broken this man 's neck ? "
' " same here , " i says .
' " what ?
both ? "
says mankeltow .
' " nonsense ! "
says lord lundie .
" who 'd have thought he was that out of training ?
a man ought n't to fly if he ai n't fit . "
' " what did they want here , anyway ? "
said walen ; and mankeltow says , " we ca n't leave them in the open .
some one 'll come .
<name> 'em to <name> 's <name> . "
we <unk> 'em again and laid 'em out on a stone bench .
they were still dead in spite of our best attentions .
we knew it , but we went through the motions till it was quite dark .
'wonder if all murderers do that ?
" we want a light on this , " says walen after a spell .
" there ought to be one in the machine .
why did n't they light it ? "
'we came out of <name> 's <name> , and shut the doors behind us .
some stars were showing then  same as when cain did his little act , i guess .
i climbed up and searched the machine .
she was very well equipped , i found two electric torches in <unk> alongside her <unk> by the rear seat .
' " what make is she ? "
says mankeltow .
' " continental <unk> , " i says .
" my engines and my rush <unk> . "
<unk> whistles .
" here  let me look , " he says , and <unk> the other torch .
she was sure well equipped .
we gathered up an armful of cameras an ' maps an ' <unk> an ' an album of mounted photographs which we took to <name> 's <name> and spread on a marble-topped table ( i 'll show you to-morrow ) which the king of naples had presented to grandfather <unk> .
walen starts to go through 'em .
we wanted to know why our friends had been so prejudiced against our society .
' " wait a minute , " says lord lundie .
" lend me a handkerchief . "
'he pulls out his own , and walen <unk> his <unk> bandanna , and lundie covers their faces .
" now , " he says , " we 'll go into the evidence . "
'there was n't any flaw in that evidence .
walen read out their last observations , and mankeltow asked questions , and lord lundie sort o' <unk> , and i looked at the photos in the album .
<unk> see a <unk> <unk> of england for military purposes ?
it's interestin ' but indecent  like turnin ' a man upside down .
none of those <unk> <unk> of forts could have been taken without my rush <unk> .
' " i wish we was as thorough as they are , " says mankeltow , when walen stopped <unk> ' .
' " we 've been thorough enough , " says lord lundie .
" the evidence against both accused is conclusive .
any other country would give 'em seven years in a fortress .
we should probably give 'em eighteen months as first-class <unk> .
but their case , " he says , " is out of our hands .
we must review our own .
mr. zigler , " he said , " <name> you tell us what steps you took to bring about the death of the first accused ? "
i told him .
he wanted to know specially whether i 'd stretched first accused before or after he had fired at mankeltow .
mankeltow testified he 'd been shot at , and exhibited his neck as evidence .
it was scorched .
' " now , mr. walen , " says lord lundie .
" <name> you kindly tell us what steps you took with regard to the second accused ? "
' " the man ran directly at me , me lord , " says walen .
" i said , 'oh no , you do n't , ' and hit him in the face . "
<unk> lundie lifts one hand and <unk> second accused 's face .
there was a bruise on one cheek and the <name> was all <unk> with grass .
he was a <unk> man .
' " what happened after that ? "
says lord lundie .
' " to the best of my remembrance he turned from me towards your lordship . "
'then lundie goes ahead .
" i stooped , and caught the man round the ankles , " he says .
" the sudden check threw him partially over my left shoulder .
i jerked him off that shoulder , still holding his ankles , and he fell heavily on , it would appear , the point of his <name> , death being instantaneous . "
' " death being instantaneous , " says walen .
<unk> lundie takes off his gown and wig  you could see him do it  and becomes our <unk> .
" that 's our case , " he says .
" i know how i should direct the jury , but it 's an undignified business for a lord of appeal to lift his hand to , and some of my learned brothers , " he says , " might be disposed to be facetious . "
'i guess i ca n't be properly <unk> .
any one who steered me out of that trouble might have had the laugh on me for generations .
but i'm only a millionaire .
i said we 'd better search second accused in case he 'd been carryin ' concealed weapons .
' " that certainly is a point , " says lord lundie .
" but the question for the jury would be whether i exercised more force than was necessary to prevent him from usin ' them . "
i did n't say anything .
he was n't <unk> my language .
second accused had his gun on him sure enough , but it had jammed in his <unk> .
he was too fleshy to reach behind for business purposes , and he did n't look a <unk> anyway .
both of 'em carried <unk> of private letters .
by the time walen had translated , we knew how many children the fat one had at home and when the thin one reckoned to be married .
too bad !
<unk> .
<unk> walen to me while we was <unk> ' their jackets ( they was not in uniform ) : " ever read a book called the <unk> , mr .
zigler ? "
' " not that i recall at the present moment , " i says .
' " well , do , " he says .
" you 'd appreciate it .
you 'd appreciate it now , i assure you . "
' " i 'll remember , " i says .
" but i do n't see how this song and dance helps us any .
here 's our corpses , here 's their machine , and <unk> bound to come . "
' " heavens !
that reminds me , " says lundie .
" what time 's dinner ? "
' " half-past eight , " says mankeltow .
" it 's half-past five now .
we knocked off golf at twenty to , and if they had n't been such silly asses , <unk> pistols like civilians , we 'd have had them to dinner .
why , they might be sitting with us in the smoking-room this very minute , " he says .
then he said that no man had a right to take his profession so seriously as these two <unk> .
' " how interestin ' ! "
says lundie .
" i 've noticed this impatient attitude toward their victim in a good many murderers .
i never understood it before .
of course , it 's the disposal of the body that <unk> 'em .
now , i wonder , " he says , " who our case <name> come up before ?
let 's run through it again . "
'then walen whirls in .
he 'd been <unk> ' his nails in a corner .
we was all nerved up by now ... . me ?
the worst of the bunch .
i had to think for <name> as well .
' " we can't be tried , " says walen .
" we mustn't be tried !
it 'll make an infernal international stink .
what did i tell you in the smoking-room after lunch ?
the tension 's at <unk> already .
this 'ud snap it .
ca n't you see that ? "
' " i was thinking of the legal aspect of the case , " says lundie .
" with a good jury we 'd likely be acquitted . "
' " acquitted ! "
says walen .
" who 'd dare acquit us in the face of what 'ud be demanded by  the other party ?
did you ever hear of the war of jenkins ' ear ?
<unk> hear of <name> and <unk> ?
<unk> hear of an ultimatum ?
you know who these two idiots are ; you know who we are  a lord of appeal , a viscount of the english peerage , and me  me knowing all i know , which the men who know dam ' well know that i do know !
it's our necks or <unk> .
which do you think this government would choose ?
we can't be tried ! "
he says .
' " then i expect i 'll have to resign me club , " lundie goes on .
" i don't think that 's ever been done before by an <unk> member .
i must ask the secretary . "
i guess he was kinder <unk> for the minute , or maybe 'twas the lordship comin ' out on him .
' " rot ! "
says mankeltow .
" walen 's right .
we ca n't afford to be tried .
we 'll have to bury them ; but my <unk> locks up all the tools at five o'clock . "
' " not on your life ! "
says lundie .
he was on deck again  as the <unk> lawyer .
" right or wrong , if we attempt concealment of the bodies we 're done for . "
" 'i 'm glad of that , " says mankeltow , " because , after all , it ain't cricket to bury 'em . "
<unk>  but i know i ai n't english  that consideration did n't worry me as it ought .
an ' besides , i was thinkin '  i had to  an ' i 'd begun to see a light 'way off  a little <unk> ' light o ' salvation .
' " then what are we to do ? "
says walen .
" zigler , what do you advise ?
your neck 's in it too . "
' " gentlemen , " i says , " something lord lundie let fall a while back gives me an idea .
i move that this committee <unk> big claus and little claus , who have elected to commit suicide in our midst , to leave the premises as they came .
i 'm asking you to take big chances , " i says , " but they 're all we 've got , " and then i broke for the <unk> .
'do n't tell me the english ca n't think as quick as the next man when it 's up to them !
they lifted 'em out o ' <name> 's <name>  reverent , but not <unk> ' time  whilst i found out what had brought her down .
one cylinder was <unk> ' .
i did n't stop to fix it .
my <unk> <name> hold up on six .
we 've proved that .
if her crew had relied on my <unk> , they 'd have been half-way home by then , instead of takin ' their seats with hangin ' heads like they was ashamed .
they ought to have been ashamed too , playin ' <unk> in a british peer 's park !
i took big chances <unk> ' her without controls , but 't was a dead still night an' a clear run  you saw it  across the theatre into the park , and i prayed she 'd rise before she hit high timber .
i set her all i dared for a quick lift .
i told mankeltow that if i gave her too much nose she 'd be liable to <unk> and flop .
he did n't want another inquest on his estate .
no , sir !
so i had to fix her up in the dark .
<unk> !
'i took big chances , too , while those other three held on to her and i worked her up to full power .
my <unk> 's no <unk> to pull against .
but i climbed out just in time .
i 'd hitched the <unk> ' lamp to her tail so 's we could track her .
otherwise , with my rush <unk> , we might 's well have <unk> an owl out of a barn .
she left just that way when we let her go .
no sound except the propellers  <unk> !
<unk> !  there was a dip in the ground ahead .
it hid her lamp for a second  but there 's no such thing as time in real life .
then that lamp travelled up the far slope slow  too slow .
then it kinder lifted , we judged .
then it sure was <unk> ' .
then it lifted good .
d'you know why ?
our four naked <unk> ' souls was out there underneath her , <unk> ' her heavens high .
yes , sir .
we did it ! ...
and that lamp kept <unk> ' and <unk> ' .
then she <unk> !
my god , she <unk> twice , which was what i 'd been afraid of all along !
then she straightened up , and went away <unk> ' to <name> , for that blessed <name> of our <name> got smaller and smaller till we could n't track it any more .
then we breathed .
we had n't breathed any since their arrival , but we did n't know it till we breathed that time  all together .
then we dug our <unk> out of our palms an ' came alive again  in <unk> .
<unk> spoke first .
" we therefore commit their bodies to the air , " he says , an ' puts his cap on .
' " the deep  the deep , " says walen .
" it 's just twenty-three miles to the channel . "
' " poor chaps !
poor chaps ! "
says mankeltow .
" we 'd have had 'em to dinner if they had n't lost their heads .
i ca n't tell you how this distresses me , <unk> . "
' " well , look at here , <name> , " i says .
" it 's only god 's own <name> you an ' me ai n't lyin ' in <name> 's <name> now , and if that fat man had known enough to fetch his gun around while he was runnin ' , lord lundie and walen would have been alongside us . "
' " i see that , " he says .
" but we 're alive and they 're dead , do n't ye know . "
' " i know it , " i says .
" that 's where the dead are always so damned unfair on the survivors . "
' " i see that too , " he says .
" but i 'd have given a good deal if it hadn't happened , poor chaps ! "
' " amen ! "
says lundie .
then ?
oh , then we <unk> walked back two an ' two to <name> 's <name> an ' lit matches to see we had n't left anything behind .
walen , he had confiscated the <unk> before they left .
there was the first man 's pistol which we 'd forgot to return him , lyin ' on the stone bench .
mankeltow puts his hand on it  he never touched the trigger  an ' , bein ' an automatic , of course the blame thing <name> off  spiteful as a <unk> !
' " look out !
they 'll have one of us yet , " says walen in the dark .
but they did n't  the lord had n't quit being our shepherd  and we heard the bullet <unk> across the veldt  quite like old times .
<unk> !
' " swine ! "
says mankeltow .
'after that i did n't hear any more " poor chap " talk ... . me ?
i never worried about killing my man .
i was too busy <unk> ' how a british jury might regard the proposition .
i guess lundie felt that way too .
'oh , but say !
we had an interestin ' time at dinner .
folks was expected whose auto had <name> up on the road .
they had n't wired , and peters had laid two extra places .
we noticed 'em as soon as we sat down .
i 'd hate to say how noticeable they were .
mankeltow with his neck bandaged ( he'd caught a relaxed throat <unk> ' ) sent for peters and told him to take those empty places away  if you please .
it takes something to rattle peters .
he was rattled that time .
nobody else noticed anything .
and now ... ' 'where did they come down ? '
i asked , as he rose .
'in the channel , i guess .
there was nothing in the papers about 'em .
shall we go into the <unk> , and see what these boys and girls are doin ? '
but say , ai n't life in england <unk> ' ?
rebirth if any god should say " i <name> restore the world her yesterday whole as before my judgment blasted it "  who would not lift heart , eye , and hand in passion o'er the gift ?
if any god should <name> to wipe from mind the memory of this ill which is mankind in soul and substance now  who would not bless even to tears his <unk> ?
if any god should give us leave to fly these present deaths we live , and safely die in those lost lives we lived ere we were born  what man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn ?
for we are what we are  so broke to blood and the strict works of war  so long subdued to sacrifice , that threadbare death commands hardly observance at our <unk> hands .
yet we were what we were , and , fashioned so , it pleases us to stare at the far show of unbelievable years and shapes that flit , in our own likeness , on the edge of it .
the horse marines ( <unk> ) the <unk> .
hon .
<unk> .
<unk> , secretary of state for war [ 6 ] , was questioned in the house of commons on <name> 8th about the <unk> which the war office is using for the purpose of teaching recruits to ride .
lord <unk> asked the war secretary if <unk> were to be supplied to all the cavalry regiments for teaching recruits to ride .
'the <name> lord , ' replied mr. <unk> , 'is doubtless alluding to certain dummy horses on <unk> which have been tested with very satisfactory results . ' ...
the mechanical steed is a wooden horse with an astonishing tail .
it is painted brown and mounted on swinging rails .
the recruit leaps into the saddle and pulls at the reins while the <unk> rocks the animal to and fro with his foot .
the <unk> are being made at <unk> .
they are quite cheap .
 daily paper .
[ footnote 6 : now viscount <unk> of <unk> . ]
my instructions to mr. leggatt , my engineer , had been accurately obeyed .
he was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul , from coventry via london , to southampton docks to await my arrival ; and very pretty she looked , under the steamer 's side among the railway lines , at six in the morning .
next to her new paint and varnish i was most impressed by her four brand-new <unk> .
'but i did n't order new <unk> , ' i said as we moved away .
'these are <unk> , too . '
<unk> , ' said leggatt .
<unk> <unk> . '
'then there has been a mistake . '
'oh no , sir ; they 're gratis . '
the number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of <unk> <unk> <unk> is so limited that i believe i asked leggatt for an explanation .
'i do n't know that i could very well explain , sir , ' was the answer .
'it 'ud come better from mr. pyecroft .
he 's on leaf at portsmouth  staying with his uncle .
his uncle 'ad the body all night .
i 'd defy you to find a scratch on her even with a microscope . '
'then we <name> go home by the portsmouth road , ' i said .
and we went at those speeds which are allowed before the <unk> begins or the police are thawed out .
we were blocked near portsmouth by a battalion of regulars on the move .
<unk> manoeuvres just ending , ' said leggatt .
'they 've had a fortnight in the downs . '
he said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind portsmouth town railway station , where he slowed at a <unk> shop .
the door was open , and a small old man sat on three <unk> swinging his feet over a stooping blue back .
'you call that <unk> ' 'em ? '
he piped .
'can you see your face in 'em yet ?
no !
then shine 'em , or i 'll give you a <unk> ' you 'll remember ! '
'if you stop <unk> ' me in the mouth perhaps i 'd do better , ' said pyecroft 's voice meekly .
we blew the horn .
pyecroft arose , put away the brushes , and received us not otherwise than as a king in his own country .
'are you going to leave me up here all day ? '
said the old man .
pyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room .
'it 's his <unk> , ' pyecroft explained .
'you ca n't shine <unk> feet  and he has n't had his breakfast . '
'i have n't had mine either , ' i said .
<unk> for two more , uncle , ' pyecroft sang out .
'go out an ' buy it then , ' was the answer , 'or else it 's <unk> . '
pyecroft turned to leggatt , gave him his <unk> orders , and despatched him with the coppers .
'i have got four new <unk> on my car , ' i began impressively .
'yes , ' said mr. pyecroft .
'you have , and i <name> say '  he patted my car 's bonnet  'you earned 'em . '
'i want to know why  , ' i went on .
<unk> justifiable .
you have n't noticed anything in the papers , have you ? '
'i 've only just landed .
i have n't seen a paper for weeks . '
'then you can lend me a virgin ear .
there 's been a scandal in the <name> service  the army , i believe they call 'em . '
a bag of <unk> pitched on the counter .
<unk> that , ' said the uncle from within .
pyecroft rigged a small <unk> , while i took down the shutters , and sold a young <name> in <unk> two bunches of mixed greens and one soft orange .
<unk> stuff to handle on an empty stomach , ai n't it ? '
said pyecroft .
'what about my new <unk> ? '
i insisted .
'oh , any amount .
but the question is '  he looked at me steadily  'is this what you might call a court-martial or a <unk> inquiry ? '
<unk> a <unk> , ' said i .
'that being so , ' said pyecroft , 'we can rapidly arrive at facts .
last thursday  the shutters go behind those baskets  last thursday at five bells in the forenoon watch , otherwise <unk> a.m. , your mr. leggatt was discovered on westminster bridge laying his course for the old <name> road . '
'but that does n't lead to southampton , ' i interrupted .
'then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses .
be that as it may , we found him in that latitude , simultaneous as <name> and me was <unk> route for waterloo to rejoin our respective ships  or navies i should say .
<name> was a <unk> , which meant being on leaf , same as me , from a french <unk> at portsmouth .
a party of her trusty and well-beloved petty officers 'ad been seeing london , <unk> by the <unk> .
chaplain .
<name> 'ad detached himself from the squadron and was <unk> ' on his own when i joined him , in company of copious <unk> .
but , <name> you , your mr. leggatt <name> the line at the girls .
loud and long he <name> it . '
'i 'm glad of that , ' i said .
'you may be .
he adopted the <unk> formation from the first .
" yes , " he said , when we was <unk> him at  but you would n't know the pub  " i am going to southampton , " he says , " and i 'll stretch a point to go via portsmouth ; but , " says he , " seeing what sort of one hell of a time invariably <unk> when we cruise together , mr. pyecroft , i do not feel myself justified towards my generous and long-suffering employer in takin ' on that kind of ballast as well . "
i assure you he considered your interests . '
'and the girls ? '
i asked .
'oh , i left that to <name> .
i 'm a <unk> by nature .
so we embarked strictly <unk> <unk> .
but i should tell you , in case he did n't , that your mr. leggatt 's care for your interests 'ad extended to <unk> the car in matting and <unk> to preserve her <unk> .
she was all <unk> up like an <unk> baby . '
'he is careful about his <unk> , ' i said .
'for a man with no service experience i should say he was fair <unk> on the subject .
if we 'd been marines he could n't have been more pointed in his allusions to our <unk> socks .
however , we reduced him to a <unk> condition , and embarked for portsmouth .
i 'd seldom rejoined my <unk> <unk> automobile , avec a fur coat and goggles .
nor 'ad <name> . '
'did <name> say much ? '
i asked , helplessly turning the handle of the <unk> .
'that 's where i pitied the pore beggar .
he 'ad n't the language , so to speak .
he was confined to <unk> and <unk> 's and copious <unk> jews !
the french are very badly fitted with <unk> .
and then our mr. leggatt drove .
he drove . '
'was he in a very <unk> condition ? '
'not him !
we recognised the value of his cargo from the outset .
he had n't a chance to get more than moist at the edges .
after which we went to sleep ; and now we 'll go to breakfast . '
we entered the back room where everything was in order , and a screeching canary made us welcome .
the uncle had added sausages and piles of buttered toast to the <unk> .
the coffee , cleared with a piece of <unk> , was a revelation .
leggatt , who seemed to know the premises , had run the car into the <name> <unk> where her <unk> back almost blocked up the windows .
he minded shop while we ate .
pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap in the door .
the uncle ordered him in , after breakfast , to wash up , and he jumped in his gaiters at the old man 's commands as he has never jumped to mine .
'to <unk> the <unk> , ' said pyecroft , lighting his pipe .
'my slumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve , and by vile language from your mr .
leggatt . '
'i  i  ' leggatt began , a <unk> duster in one hand and a cup in the other .
'when you 're wanted aft you 'll be sent for , mr. leggatt , ' said pyecroft <unk> .
'it 's clean mess decks for you now .
<unk> once more , we was on a lonely and desolate ocean near <unk> , surrounded by gorse bushes , and a boy scout was stirring my stomach with his little <unk> . '
' " you count ten , " he says .
' " very good , boy jones , " i says , " count 'em , " and i hauled him in over the gunnel , and ten i gave him with my large flat hand .
the remarks he passed , lying face down tryin ' to bite my leg , would have reflected credit on any service .
having finished i dropped him overboard again , which was my gross political error .
i ought to 'ave killed him ; because he began <unk>  rapid and accurate  in a <unk> direction .
few equatorial <unk> are to be apprehended when <unk> .
's little pets take to <unk> ' .
make a note o ' that !
three minutes later we were stopped and boarded by scouts  up our backs , down our necks , and in our boots !
the last i heard from your mr. leggatt as he went under , <unk> ' 'em off his cap , was thanking heaven he 'd covered up the new <unk> with mats .
an <unk> soul ! '
'not a scratch on her body , ' said leggatt , pouring out the <unk> .
'and <name> ? '
said i .
'oh , <name> thought the much advertised social revolution had begun , but his mackintosh hampered him .
'you told me to bring the mackintosh , ' leggatt whispered to me .
'and when i 'ad 'em half convinced he was a french vicomte coming down to visit the commander-in-chief at portsmouth , he tried to take it off .
seeing his uniform underneath , some sucking sherlock holmes of the pink eye patrol ( they called him <name> ) deduced that i was n't speaking the truth .
<name> said i was tryin ' to sneak into portsmouth unobserved  unobserved <name> you !  and join hands with the enemy .
it <unk> that the scouts was conducting a <unk> against <unk> forces , ably assisted by all branches of the service , and they was so afraid the car would n't count ten points to them in the fray , that they 'd have scalped us , but for the intervention of an umpire  also in short <unk> .
a fleshy sight ! '
here mr. pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded .
'that umpire , ' he said suddenly , 'was our mr. morshed  a gentleman whose acquaintance you have already made and profited by , if i mistake not [ 7 ] . '
[ footnote 7 : <unk> lawful occasions , ' <unk> and discoveries . ]
'oh , was the navy in it too ? '
i said ; for i had read of wild doings occasionally among the boy scouts on the portsmouth road , in which navy , army , and the world at large seemed to have taken part .
'the navy was in it .
i was the only one out of it  for several seconds .
our mr. morshed failed to recognise me in my fur <unk> , and my <unk> ' winks at 'im behind your goggles did n't arrive .
but when <name> darling had told his story , i saluted , which is difficult in furs , and i stated i was bringin ' him dispatches from the north .
my mr. morshed <unk> on the instant .
i 've never known his <unk> <unk> out of order yet .
" go and guard your blessed road , " he says to the <unk> orphan asylum standing at attention all round him , and , when they was removed  " pyecroft , " he says , still <unk> voce , " what in hong-kong are you doing with this dun-coloured <unk> ? "
'it was your mr. leggatt 's <unk> matting which caught his eye .
she did resemble a <unk> , especially about the <unk> .
at these remarks i naturally threw myself on 'is bosom , so far as service conditions permitted , and revealed him all , mentioning that the car was yours .
you know his way of working his lips like a rabbit ?
yes , he was quite pleased .
" his car ! "
he kept murmuring , working his lips like a rabbit .
" i owe 'im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me .
i'll keep the car . "
'your mr. leggatt now injected some <unk> remarks to the effect that he was your chauffeur in charge of your car , and , as such , capable of so acting .
mr. morshed threw him a <unk> .
it sufficed .
did n't it suffice , mr .
leggatt ? '
'i knew if something did n't happen , something worse would , ' said leggatt .
'it never fails when you 're aboard . '
'and <name> ? '
i demanded .
<unk> was , so to speak , <unk> in a <unk> flat through his unfortunate lack of language .
i had to introduce him as part of the <unk> <unk> , and he was put under arrest , too .
then we sat on the grass and smoked , while <name> and co. violently annoyed the traffic on the portsmouth road , till the umpires , all in short <unk> , conferred on the valuable lessons of the <unk> and added up points , same as at <unk> .
i did n't hear their conclusions , but our mr. morshed delivered a farewell address to <name> and co. , tellin ' 'em they ought to have deduced from a hundred signs about me , that i was a friendly bringin ' in dispatches from the north .
we left 'em tryin ' to find those signs in the scout book , and we reached mr. morshed 's hotel at portsmouth at <unk> p.m. <unk> automobile .
here <unk> the first chapter . '
<unk> the second , ' i said .
the uncle and leggatt had finished washing up and were seated , smoking , while the damp duster dried at the fire .
<unk> what time was it , ' said pyecroft to leggatt , 'when our mr. morshed began to talk about uncles ? '
'when he came back to the bar , after he 'd changed into those <unk> clothes , ' said leggatt .
'that 's right .
" pye , " said he , " have you an uncle ? "
" i have , " i says .
" here 's <unk> to him , " and i finished my <name> and <unk> to you , uncle . '
'that 's right , ' said pyecroft 's uncle sternly .
'if you had n't i 'd have belted you worth <unk> ' , <name> .
i had the body all night . '
pyecroft smiled affectionately .
'so you 'ad , uncle , an ' beautifully you looked after her .
but as i was saying , " i have an uncle , too , " says mr. morshed , dark and lowering .
" yet somehow i ca n't love him .
i want to <unk> the beggar .
volunteers to <unk> my uncle , one pace to the front . "
'i took <name> with me the regulation distance .
<name> was getting interested .
your mr. leggatt preserved a strictly <unk> attitude .
' " you 're a pressed man , " says our mr. morshed .
" i owe your late employer much , so to say .
the car <name> manoeuvre all night , as requisite . "
'mr .
leggatt come out <name> as your employee , and , by <unk> 's divine <name> , instead of arguing , he pleaded his new paint and varnish which was mr. morshed 's one vital spot ( he 's lootenant on one of the new <unk> 's now ) .
" true , " says he , " paint 's an <unk> thing .
i'll give you one hour to arrange a modus <unk> .
full bunkers and steam ready by 9 p.m. to-night , if you please . "
'even so , mr. leggatt was far from content .
i 'ad to arrange the details .
we run her into the yard here . '
pyecroft nodded through the window at my car 's glossy <unk> .
'we took off the body with its mats and put it in the stable , <unk> ( and that yard 's a tight fit for extensive repairs ) the body of uncle 's blue delivery cart .
it overhung a trifle , but after i 'd lashed it i knew it would n't fetch loose .
thus , in our composite cruiser , we repaired once more to the hotel , and was immediately dispatched to the <unk> in the high street where we took aboard one <unk> which was waiting for us . '
<unk> aboard what ? '
i cried .
'one <unk> <unk> <unk> , with pure green <unk> and <unk> tail , pair <unk> glass eyes , complete set <unk> grinnin ' teeth , and two <unk> nostrils which , protruding from the brown papers , produced the tout <unk> of a <unk> sacrifice in the <unk> campaign .
do i make myself comprehensible ? '
<unk> .
did you say anything ? '
i asked .
'only to <name> .
to him , i says , wishing to try him .
" <unk> à <unk> <unk> .
je say mon <unk> .
eel <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
to me , says he , " vous <unk> ate <unk> !
<unk> de la vee ! "
and i saw by his eye he'd taken on for the full term of the war .
<name> was a blue-eyed , <unk> beggar of a useful make and <unk> ' habits .
your mr. leggatt he only groaned . '
leggatt nodded .
'it was like <unk> , ' he said .
'it was like <unk> . '
'once more , then , ' pyecroft swept on , 'we returned to the hotel and partook of a sumptuous repast , under the able and genial <unk> of our mr. morshed , who laid his <unk> unreservedly before us .
" in the first place , " he says , opening out <unk> , " my uncle , who , i regret to say , is a <unk> , has sold his alleged soul to dicky <unk> for a feathery hat and a pair o ' gilt spurs .
<name> , <unk> <unk> ! "
so <name> , you 'll be glad to hear  ' 'one minute , pye , ' i said .
'who is dicky <unk> ? '
'i do n't usually mingle myself up with the <unk> of the <name> service , but it <unk> that he was secretary o ' state for civil war , an ' he 'd been issuing mechanical <unk> <unk> which doctors recommend for <unk>  to the british cavalry in loo of real meat horses , to learn to ride on .
do n't you remember there was quite a stir in the papers owing to the cavalry not <unk> ' 'em ?
but that 's a minor item .
the main point was that our uncle , in his capacity of <unk> , <name> you , had wrote to the papers highly <unk> ' o' dicky <unk> 's mechanical substitutes an 'ad thus obtained promotion  all same as a <unk> stoker <unk> ' <unk> up the service under a pious captain .
at that point of the narrative we caught a phosphorescent glimmer why the <unk> might have been issued ; but none the less the navigation was intricate .
omitting the fact it was dark and cloudy , our <unk> lay somewhere in the south downs with his brigade , which was <unk> ' at <unk> manoeuvres on a large scale  red army <unk> blue , et <unk> ; an ' all we 'ad to go by was those flapping <unk> and your mr. leggatt 's groans . '
'i was thinking what the downs mean after dark , ' said leggatt angrily .
'they was worth thinkin ' of , ' said pyecroft .
'when we had studied the map till it fair spun , we decided to <name> forth and creep for uncle by hand in the dark , dark night , an ' present 'im with the <unk> .
so we embarked at <unk> <unk> 'one minute again , please .
how much did <name> understand by that time ? '
i asked .
<unk> unto the day  or night , perhaps i should say .
he told our mr. morshed he 'd follow him more sang <unk> , which is french for dead , drunk , or damned .
barrin ' 'is <unk> o ' language , there was n't a blemish on <name> .
but what i wished to imply was , when we climbed into the back parts of the car , our lootenant morshed says to me , " i doubt if i 'd <unk> my <unk> about too lavish , mr. pyecroft .
we ought to be sitting on five pounds ' worth of selected fireworks , and i think the rockets are your end . "
not being able to smoke with my 'ead over the side i threw it away ; and then your mr. leggatt , <unk> been as nearly mutinous as it pays to be with my mr. morshed , arched his back and drove . '
'where did he drive to , please ? '
said i .
<unk> , in search of any or either or both armies ; <unk> , of course , in search of our <unk> .
not finding him on the road , we ran about the grass looking for him .
this took us to a great many places in a short time .
ow <unk> that lilac did smell on top of that first down  <unk> ' its <unk> ' little heart out ! '
'i 'ad n't <unk> to notice , ' said mr. leggatt .
'the downs were full o' <unk> , and we 'd no lights . '
'we 'ad the <unk> to look at the map by .
did n't you notice the old <name> at the window where we saw the man in the <unk> ?
i thought <unk> as <unk> ' rig was <unk> , so to speak . '
'i tell you i 'ad n't <unk> to notice , ' leggatt repeated .
'that 's odd .
then what might 'ave made you tell the sentry at the first camp we found that you was the daily express <unk> ? '
'you ca n't touch pitch without being defiled , ' leggatt answered .
<unk> told the officer in the bath we were umpires ? '
'well , he asked us .
that was when we found the territorial battalion <unk> ' in slow time .
it lay on the left flank o ' the blue army , and it <unk> as it lay , too .
but it gave us our position as regards the respective armies .
we wandered a little more , and at <unk> p.m. , not having had a road under us for twenty minutes , we scaled the heights of something or other  which are about six hundred feet high .
here we <unk> to tighten the lashings of the <unk> , and we smelt leather and horses three counties deep all round .
we was , as you might say , in the thick of it . '
' " ah ! "
says my mr. morshed .
" my <unk> has indeed broadened .
what a little thing is an uncle , mr. pyecroft , in the presence o ' these <unk> ' constellations !
simply ludicrous ! "
he says , " to waste a <unk> on an individual .
we must <unk> it .
but we must get their <unk> up first .
touch off one rocket , if you please . "
'i touched off a green <unk> which rose several thousand metres , and burst into gorgeous stars .
" reproduce the manoeuvre , " he says , " at the other end o ' this ridge  if it do n't end in another <name> . "
so we steamed down the ridge a mile and a half east , and then i let <name> touch off a pink rocket , or he 'd <name> ' kissed me .
that was his only way to express his emotions , so to speak .
their heads come up then all around us to the extent o ' thousands .
we hears bugles like cocks crowing below , and on the top of it a most impressive sound which i 'd never enjoyed before because <unk> i 'd always been an <unk> part of it , so to say  the noise of 'ole armies gettin ' under arms .
they must 'ave anticipated a night attack , i imagine .
most impressive .
then we 'eard a <unk> .
" <unk> !
<unk> !
this is childish ! "
says lootenant morshed .
" we ca n't wait till they 've finished cutting chaff for their horses .
we must make 'em understand we 're not to be trifled with .
<unk> 'em with another rocket , mr .
pyecroft . "
' " it 's barely possible , sir , " i remarks , " that that 's a searchlight <unk> ' up , " and by the time we backed into a providential chalk cutting ( which was where our first tyre went <unk> ) she broke out to the northward , and began searching the ridge .
a smart bit o ' work . '
"twas n't a <unk> .
the inner tube had nipped because we <unk> so , ' leggatt interrupted .
<unk> your mr. leggatt was <unk> ' repairs , another searchlight broke out to the southward , and the two of 'em swept our ridge on both sides .
right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a hill , so to speak , crowned with what looked like a little fort .
morshed saw it before the beams shut off .
" that 's the key of the position ! "
he says .
" occupy it at all hazards . "
' " i have n't half got occupation for the next twenty minutes , " says your mr. leggatt , <unk> ' and <unk> ' in the dark .
<name> , now , 'ow morshed changed his tactics to suit 'is environment .
" right ! "
says he .
" i 'll stand by the ship .
mr. pyecroft and <name> , oblige me by doubling along the ridge to the east with all the <unk> and crackers you can <name> without spilling .
read the directions careful for the <unk> , mr. pyecroft , and touch them off at <unk> intervals .
<name> represents musketry an ' maxim fire under your command .
remember , it 's death or salisbury <unk> !
<unk> both ! "
'by these means and some moderately 'ard runnin ' , we distracted 'em to the eastward .
<unk> , you may not be aware , are same as bombs , with the <unk> left out .
in confined spots like <unk> , they knock a <unk> silly .
but you should read the directions <unk> .
in the intervals of the slow but <unk> fire of my <unk> , <name> , who had found a <unk> in the dark a little lower down , gave what you might call a <unk> reproduction o ' <unk> musketry .
they was large size crackers , and he concluded with the dull , <unk> thud o ' blind shells <unk> ' on soft ground . '
'how did he manage that ? '
i said .
'you throw a lighted <unk> into water and you 'll see , ' said pyecroft .
'thus , then , we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the surrounding landscapes fair <unk> and <unk> at us .
the <unk> or service might 'ave 'ad their doubts about the rockets but they could n't overlook our <unk> .
both sides tumbled out full of initiative .
i told <name> no two <unk> 'ad any right to be as happy as us , and we went back along the ridge to the derelict , and there was our mr. morshed <unk> ' his <unk> over fifty square mile o ' country with " attend , all ye who list to hear ! "
out of the fifth reader .
he 'd got as far as " and roused the shepherds o ' stonehenge , the rangers o ' <unk> " when we come up , and he <name> our attention to its truth as well as its beauty .
that 's rare in poetry , i 'm told .
he went right on to  " the red glare on <unk> roused those beggars at carlisle "  which he pointed out was poetic license for leith hill .
this allowed your mr. leggatt time to finish <unk> ' up his <unk> .
i 'eard the sweat 'op off his nose . '
'you know what it is , sir , ' said poor leggatt to me .
'it <unk> across my mind , as i listened to what was <unk> ' , that it might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up , but such considerations weighed not with our valiant leader .
' " mr. pyecroft , " he says , " it ca n't have escaped your notice that we 'ave one angry and <unk> intelligent army in front of us , an ' another <unk> angry and equally intelligent army in our rear .
what 'ud you recommend ? "
'most men would have besought 'im to do a lateral glide while there was yet time , but all i said was : " the <unk> is n't expended yet , sir . "
'he laid his hand on my shoulder .
" pye , " says he , " there 's worse men than you in loftier places .
they shall 'ave it .
none the less , " he remarks , " the ice is <unk> packing . "
'i may 'ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large armies , both deprived of their night 's sleep , was awake , as you might say , and <unk> ' into each other 's arms .
here <unk> the second chapter . '
he filled his pipe slowly .
the uncle had fallen asleep .
leggatt lit another cigarette .
'we then proceeded <unk> automobile along the ridge in a westerly direction towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed by the searchlight , but which on inspection ( your mr. leggatt bumped into an <unk> ' reef of it ) proved to be a <unk> ; <unk> , a <unk> pile of about three million <unk> , brought up there for the sheep , i suppose .
on all sides , excep ' the one we 'd come by , the ground fell away moderately quick , and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an ' full of harsh words of command .
' " i said it was the key to the position , " lootenant morshed remarks .
" trot out <unk> ! "
which we rightly took to read , " <unk> the <unk> . "
' " <unk> la ! "
says <name> in a <unk> tone , an ' <unk> <unk> on the flank .
' " silence ! "
says the lootenant .
" this is the <name> navy , not newmarket " ; and we carried <unk> to the top of the <unk> clump as directed .
<unk> to the inequalities of the <unk> ( i do think your mr. leggatt might have had a <unk> in his <name> ) he would n't rock free on the <unk> , and while <unk> ' him , his <unk> tail fetched adrift .
our lootenant was quick to seize the advantage .
' " remove that transformation , " he says .
" substitute one <name> candle .
<unk> is superior to <name> <unk> . "
'so we substituted .
he arranged the <unk> de <unk> in the shape of large drums  not saucers , <name> you  drums of coloured fire , with printed instructions , at proper distances round <unk> .
there was a brief <unk> while we dug ourselves in among the <unk> by hand .
then he touched off the fires , not omitting the <name> candle , and , you may take it from me , all was visible .
<unk> shone out in his naked splendour , red to port , green to starboard , and one white light at his bows , as per board o ' trade regulations .
only he did n't so much rock , you might say , as shrug himself , in a manner of speaking , every time the candle went off .
one ca n't have everything .
but the rest surpassed our highest expectations .
i think <unk> was noblest on the starboard or green side  more like when a man thinks he 's seeing mackerel in hell , do n't you know ?
and yet i 'd be the last to <unk> the effect of the port light on his teeth , or that <unk> look in his left eye .
he knew there was something going on he did n't approve of .
he looked worried . '
'did you laugh ? '
i said .
'i 'm not much of a wag myself ; nor it was n't as if we 'ad time to allow the spectacle to sink in .
the coloured fires was supposed to burn ten minutes , whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the <name> service would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half .
they <unk> our <unk> allusion as soon as it was across the <unk> , so to speak .
they were quite chafed at it .
of course , 'ad we reflected , we might have known that <unk> ' illuminated <unk> to an army that was learnin ' to ride on 'em partook of the nature of a double <unk> , as the french say  same as <unk> the tiller lines at a man who 's had a hanging in the family .
i knew the cox of the <unk> galley 'arf killed for a similar <unk> but we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive .
that was why we shifted .
we could <unk> tear our <unk> ' officer away .
he put his head on one side , and kept <unk> ' .
the only thing he 'ad neglected to provide was a line of retreat ; but your mr. leggatt  an <unk> soul in the last stage of wet prostration  here took command of the van , or , rather , the rear-guard .
we walked downhill beside him , holding on to the <unk> to prevent her <unk> .
these technical details , <unk> , are beyond me . '
he waved his pipe towards leggatt .
'i saw there was two <unk> ruts <unk> ' down <unk> somewhere , ' said leggatt .
'that was when the soldiers stopped laughin ' , and begun to run uphill . '
<unk> , <unk> , stroll ! '
pyecroft corrected .
'the dervish rush took place later . '
'so i laid her in these ruts .
that was where she must 'ave scraped her <unk> a bit .
then they turned sharp right  the ruts did  and then she stopped <unk> in a <unk> , sir ; but i 'll swear it was all of a one in three <unk> .
i think it was a <unk> .
we waited there , ' said leggatt .
'but not for long , ' said pyecroft .
'the lights were towering out of the drums on the position we 'ad so valiantly abandoned ; and the <name> service was <unk> ' it en <unk> .
when numerous bodies of <unk> trained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite directions , each remarking briskly , " what the <unk> did you do that for ? "
<unk> , as you might say , is practically assured .
they didn't ask for extraneous aids .
if we 'd come out with sworn <unk> of what we 'd done they would n't 'ave believed us .
they wanted each other's company exclusive .
such was the effect of <unk> on their <unk> feelings .
<unk> , i call it !
events transpired with the utmost velocity and rapidly increasing pressures .
there was a few remarks about dicky <unk> and mechanical horses , and then some one was smacked  hard by the sound  in the middle of a remark . '
'that was the man who kept calling for the <unk> dragoons , ' said leggatt .
'he got as far as drag ... ' 'was it ? '
said pyecroft dreamily .
'well , he could n't say they didn't come .
they all came , and they all fell to <unk> ' whether the infantry should 'ave <unk> for a regimental pet or the cavalry should keep him for stud purposes .
hence the issue was soon clouded with <unk> .
our commander said we 'ad sowed the good seed , and it was bearing abundant fruit .
( they weigh between four and seven pounds apiece . )
seein ' the children 'ad got over their shyness , and 'ad really begun to play games , we backed out o ' the pit and went down , by steps , to the camp below , no man , as you might say , making us afraid .
here we enjoyed a front view of the battle , which rolled with renewed impetus , owing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute .
all arms were freely represented ; cavalry , on this occasion only , acting in concert with artillery .
they argued the relative merits of horses <unk> feet , so to say , but they did n't neglect <unk> .
the wounded rolling downhill with the <unk> informed us that he had long ago been <unk> , and the smallest souvenirs were worth a man 's life .
speaking broadly , the <name> service appeared to be a shade out of 'and , if i may venture so far .
they did not pay prompt and <unk> obedience to the " retires " or the " cease fires " or the " for <unk> 's sake come to bed , <unk> " of their officers , who , i regret to say , were <unk> <unk> at the heads of their respective units . '
'how did you find that out ? '
i asked .
'on account of lootenant morshed going to the mess tent to call on his uncle and raise a drink ; but all hands had gone to the front .
we thought we 'eard somebody bathing behind the tent , and we found an <unk> gentleman tryin ' to drown a boy in <unk> in a <unk> .
he kept him under with a bicycle , so to speak .
he 'ad nearly accomplished his fell design , when we frustrated him .
he was in a highly <unk> condition and full o ' juice de spree .
" <unk> not what i am , " he says .
" my wife 'll tell me that quite soon enough .
<unk> rather what i've been , " he says .
" i 've been <unk> ' here , " he says .
" i commanded 'em in the <unk> , " he says , " and , gawd forgive me , " he says , <unk> <unk> , " i 've spent this holy evening telling their colonel they was a set of educated <unk> .
hark to 'em ! "
we could , without <unk> ourselves ; but how he picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in that <unk> party up the hill i do n't know .
" they 've marched and fought thirty mile to-day , " he shouts , " and now they 're <unk> ' the intestines out of the cavalry up yonder !
they wo n't stop this side the gates o ' delhi , " he says .
" i commanded their ancestors .
there 's nothing wrong with the service , " he says , wringing out his trousers on his lap .
" <unk> pardon me for <unk> ' 'em !
same old game  same young beggars . "
'the boy in the <unk> , languishing on a chair , puts in a claim for one drink .
" let him go dry , " says our friend in <unk> .
" he 's a reporter .
he run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if i could furnish 'im with particulars about the mutiny in the army .
you <unk> <unk> <unk> , " he says , shakin ' his finger at 'im  for he was <unk> annoyed  " i 'll teach you to defile what you can't <unk> !
when my regiment 's in a state o ' mutiny , i 'll do myself the honour of informing you personally .
you particularly ignorant and very <unk> little man , " he says , " you 're no better than a <unk> 's donkey !
if there was n't dirty linen to wash , you 'd starve , " he says , " and why i have n't drowned you <name> be the <unk> ' regret of my life . "
'well , we sat with 'em and 'ad drinks for about half-an-hour in front of the mess tent .
he 'd <name> ' killed the reporter if there had n't been witnesses , and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle ; so we acted as <unk> <unk> , in a sense .
i do n't hold with the press mingling up with service matters .
they draw false conclusions .
now , <name> you , at a moderate estimate , there were seven thousand men in the fighting line , half of 'em hurt in their professional feelings , an ' the other half <unk> ' in the <unk> , as you might say .
all due to <unk> !
if you 'ad n't seen it you would n't 'ave believed it .
and yet , <name> you , not one single unit of 'em even resorted to his belt .
they confined themselves to natural <unk>  hands and the <unk> .
i thought <name> was havin ' fits , till it <unk> the same thought had impressed him in the french language .
he called it <unk> , i believe .
seven thousand men , with seven thousand rifles , belts , and bayonets , in a violently agitated condition , and not a <unk> blow struck from first to last .
the old gentleman <name> our attention to it as well .
it was quite noticeable .
<unk> of ammunition was the <unk> cause of the battle <unk> ' .
a <unk> came in , <unk> ' his nose on both cuffs , and sayin ' he 'ad 'ad snuff .
the <unk> followed .
he was , so to speak , <unk> ' .
we thought it best to shift our moorings without <unk> ' attention ; so we shifted .
they 'ad called the cows 'ome by then .
the <name> service was going to <unk> all round us , as happy as the ship 's monkey when he 's been playin ' with the paints , and lootenant morshed and <name> kept <unk> ' to port and starboard of the <unk> , <unk> ' the <unk> applause which the multitude would 'ave given 'em if they'd known the facts .
on the other 'and , as your mr. leggatt observed , they might 'ave killed us .
'that would have been about five bells in the middle watch , say half-past two .
a <unk> evening .
there was but little to be gained by entering portsmouth at that hour , so we turned off on the grass ( this was after we had found a road under us ) , and we cast anchors out at the stern and prayed for the day .
'but your mr. leggatt he had to make and mend <unk> all our watch below .
it <unk> she had been running on the rim o ' two or three wheels , which , very properly , he had n't reported till the close of the action .
and that 's the reason of your four new <unk> .
mr. morshed was of opinion you 'd earned 'em .
do you dissent ? '
i stretched out my hand , which pyecroft crushed to pulp .
'no , pye , ' i said , deeply moved , 'i agree entirely .
but what happened to <name> ? '
'we returned him to his own navy after breakfast .
he would n't have kept much longer without some one in his own language to tell it to .
i don't know any man i ever took more compassion on than <name> .
'is sufferings swelled him up <unk> , and all he could do on the hard was to kiss lootenant morshed and me , and your mr. leggatt .
he deserved that much .
a cordial beggar . '
pyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table , and the low <name> on my car 's back in the yard .
'too early to drink to him , ' he said .
'but i feel it just the same . '
the uncle , sunk in his chair , snored a little ; the canary answered with a shrill <unk> .
pyecroft picked up the duster , threw it over the cage , put his finger to his lips , and we tiptoed out into the shop , while leggatt brought the car round .
'i 'll look out for the news in the papers , ' i said , as i got in .
'oh , we <unk> that !
nothing <unk> excep ' a statement to the effect that some territorial battalions had played about with turnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres the <unk> do n't know all he gets for his money .
farewell ! '
we moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the station to <unk> for london .
<unk> your pardon , sir , ' said a sergeant in charge of the baggage , 'but would you mind <unk> ' a bit till we get the <unk> past ? '
'certainly , ' i said .
'you do n't happen to have a <unk> among your <name> , do you ? '
the rattle of our reverse drowned his answer , but i saw his eyes .
one of them was <unk> , about four days old .
the legend of mirth the four archangels , so the legends tell , <name> , <name> , <name> , <unk> , being first of those to whom the power was shown , stood first of all the host before the throne , and when the charges were allotted burst <unk> from out the assembly first .
zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed their own high judgment on their lightest deed .
zeal was their spur that , when relief was given , urged them unwearied to fresh toil in heaven ; for honour 's sake perfecting every task beyond what e'en perfection 's self could ask ... . and allah , who created zeal and pride , knows how the twain are <unk> allied .
it chanced on one of heaven 's <unk> days , the four and all the host having gone their ways each to his charge , the shining courts were void save for one seraph whom no charge employed , with <unk> wings and <unk> brow .
to whom the word : <unk> , what dost thou ? '
'by the permission , ' came the answer soft , 'little i do nor do that little oft .
as is the <name> in heaven so on earth where by the <name> i strive to make men mirth . '
he ceased and sped , hearing the word once more : <unk> , go thy way and greet the four . '
systems and <unk> <unk> , the seraph came upon the four , at last , guiding and guarding with devoted mind the tedious generations of mankind who lent at most unwilling ear and eye when they could not escape the ministry ... .
yet , patient , faithful , firm , persistent , just toward all that gross , indifferent , facile dust , the archangels laboured to discharge their trust by precept and example , prayer and law , advice , reproof , and rule , but , labouring , saw each in his fellow 's countenance confessed , the doubt that <unk> : 'have i done my best ? '
even as they sighed and turned to toil anew , the seraph hailed them with observance due ; and after some fit talk of higher things touched tentative on mundane happenings .
this they permitting , he , emboldened thus , <unk> of <unk> promiscuous .
and , since the large contention less avails than instances observed , he told them tales  tales of the shop , the bed , the court , the street , intimate , elemental , indiscreet : occasions where confusion <unk> swift piles jest on jest as <unk> pile the drift .
whence , one by one , beneath derisive skies , the victims bare , bewildered heads arise : tales of the passing of the spirit , graced with humour blinding as the doom it faced : stark tales of <unk> that broke aside to tears , by laughter swallowed ere they dried : tales to which neither <name> nor gain <unk> , but only ( allah be exalted ! )
true , and only , as the seraph showed that night , <unk> to the limits of delight .
these he rehearsed with artful pause and halt , and such pretence of memory at fault , that soon the four  so well the bait was thrown  came to his aid with memories of their own  matters dismissed long since as small or vain , whereof the high significance had lain hid , till the <unk> <unk> made it plain .
then as enlightenment came broad and fast , each marvelled at his own oblivious past until  the gates of laughter opened wide  the four , with that bland seraph at their side , while they recalled , compared , and <unk> , in utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride .
high over heaven the lamps of midnight burned ere , weak with merriment , the four returned , not in that order they were wont to keep  <unk> to <unk> answering , sweep for sweep , in awful <unk> heard afar , but <unk> adrift 'twixt <name> and <name> .
reeling a planet 's orbit left or right as laughter took them in the <unk> night ; or , by the point of some remembered jest , winged and brought helpless down through <unk> <unk> , where the blank worlds that gather to the birth leaped in the womb of darkness at their mirth , and e'en gehenna 's <unk> understood .
they were not damned from human brotherhood .
not first nor last of heaven 's high host , the four that night took place beneath the throne once more .
o lovelier than their morning majesty , the understanding light behind the eye !
o more compelling than their old command , the <unk> friendly gesture of the hand !
o sweeter than their zealous fellowship , the wise <unk> that passed from lip to lip !
o well and roundly , when command was given , they told their tale against themselves to heaven , and in the silence , waiting on the word , received the peace and pardon of the lord !
'my son 's <unk> ( 1913 ) he had suffered from the disease of the century since his early youth , and before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it .
he and a few friends had rearranged heaven very comfortably , but the <unk> of earth , which they called society , was even greater fun .
it demanded work in the shape of many <unk> daily ; hours of brilliant talk with brilliant talkers ; some sparkling correspondence ; a few silences ( but on the understanding that their own turn should come soon ) while other people expounded philosophies ; and a fair number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , theatres , <unk> , and <unk> shows ; the whole trimmed with <unk> to women whose hair smelt of <unk> .
such strong days sent <unk> midmore back to his flat assured that he and his friends had helped the world a step nearer the truth , the <name> , and the new order .
his temperament , he said , led him more towards concrete data than abstract ideas .
people who investigate detail are apt to be tired at the day 's end .
the same temperament , or it may have been a woman , made him early attach himself to the immoderate left of his cause in the capacity of an <unk> in social relations .
and since the immoderate left contains plenty of women anxious to help <name> <unk> with large independent incomes to arrive at <unk> of essentials , <unk> midmore 's lot was far from contemptible .
at that hour fate chose to play with him .
a widowed aunt , widely separated by nature , and more widely by marriage , from all that midmore 's mother had ever been or desired to be , died and left him possessions .
mrs. midmore , having that summer embraced a creed which denied the existence of death , naturally could not stoop to burial ; but midmore had to leave london for the dank country at a season when social regeneration works best through long , cushioned conferences , two by two , after tea .
there he faced the bracing ritual of the british funeral , and was wept at across the raw grave by an elderly <unk> female with a long nose , who called him <unk> <name> ' ; and there he was congratulated behind an echoing <unk> by a man he mistook for a mute , who turned out to be his aunt 's lawyer .
he wrote his mother next day , after a bright account of the funeral : 'so far as i can understand , she has left me between four and five hundred a year .
it all comes from ther land , as they call it down here .
the unspeakable attorney , sperrit , and a <unk> daughter , who <unk> to herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except " huntin ' , " insisted on taking me to see it .
ther land is brown and green in alternate slabs like chocolate and <unk> cakes , speckled with occasional peasants who do not utter .
in case it should not be wet enough there is a wet <name> in the middle of it .
ther house is by the <name> .
i shall look into it later .
if there should be any little memento of <name> that you care for , let me know .
did n't you tell me that <unk> furniture is coming into the market again ?
<name> 's old maid  it is called <name> <unk>  tells me that <name> promised it thirty pounds a year .
the <name> does not .
hence , i suppose , the tears at the funeral .
but that is close on ten per cent of the income .
i fancy <name> has destroyed all her private papers and records of her vie <unk> , if , indeed , life be possible in such a place .
the sperrit man told me that if i had means of my own i might come and live on ther land .
i did n't tell him how much i would pay not to !
i can not think it right that any human being should exercise mastery over others in the merciless fashion our <unk> social system permits ; so , as it is all mine , i intend to sell it whenever the unholy sperrit can find a purchaser . '
and he went to mr. sperrit with the idea next day , just before returning to town .
<unk> so , ' said the lawyer .
'i see your point , of course .
but the house itself is rather old-fashioned  hardly the type <unk> demand nowadays .
there 's no park , of course , and the bulk of the land is let to a <unk> , a mr. <name> .
as long as he pays his rent , he ca n't be turned out , and even if he did n't '  mr. sperrit 's face relaxed a shade  'you might have a difficulty . '
'the property brings four hundred a year , i understand , ' said midmore .
'well , hardly  <unk> .
<unk> land and income tax , <unk> , fire insurance , cost of collection and repairs of course , it returned two hundred and eighty-four pounds last year .
the repairs are rather a large item  owing to the <name> .
i call it <unk>  out of <name> , you know . '
midmore looked at his watch impatiently .
'i suppose you can find somebody to buy it ? '
he repeated .
'we <name> do our best , of course , if those are your instructions .
then , that is all except '  here midmore half rose , but mr. sperrit 's little grey eyes held his large brown ones firmly  <unk> about <name> <unk> , mrs. <unk> 's maid .
i may tell you that we did not draw up your <unk> last <name> .
she grew secretive towards the last  elderly people often do  and had it done in london .
i expect her memory failed her , or she mislaid her notes .
she used to put them in her <unk> ... . my motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station , mr. midmore ... but , as i was saying , whenever she made her <name> with us , mrs. <unk> always left <name> thirty pounds per annum .
<name> , the wills ! '
a clerk with a <unk> head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like cards , and breathed heavily behind midmore .
'it 's in no sense a legal obligation , of course , ' said mr. sperrit .
'ah , that one is dated <name> the 11th , eighteen <unk> . '
midmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good <name> : 'well , i suppose she 'd better have it  for the present at any rate . '
he escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fifty-four pounds a year was not exactly four hundred , and that <name> 's long nose annoyed him .
then he returned , first-class , to his own affairs .
of the two , perhaps three , experiments in social relations which he had then in hand , one interested him acutely .
it had run for some months and promised most variegated and interesting developments , on which he dwelt luxuriously all the way to town .
when he reached his flat he was not well prepared for a <unk> letter explaining , in the diction of the immoderate left which <unk> its i 's and <unk> its t 's , that the <name> had realised greater attractions in another soul .
she <unk> , rather than pleaded , the gospel of the immoderate left as her justification , and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to express herself in and on her own life , through which , she pointed out , she could pass but once .
she added that if , later , she should discover midmore was <unk> <unk> to her needs , ' she would tell him so .
that midmore had himself written much the same sort of epistle  barring the hint of return  to a woman of whom his needs for <unk> had caused him to weary three years before , did not assist him in the least .
he expressed himself to the <unk> in terms essential but not complimentary .
then he reflected on the detached criticism of his best friends and her best friends , male and female , with whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their <name> adventure was in flower .
he recalled , too  this must have been about midnight  her analysis from every <name> , remote and most intimate , of the mate to whom she had been <unk> under the base convention which is styled marriage .
later , at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a little , he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell appointed ; desolate , desiring , with no god to call upon .
about eleven o'clock next morning <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> called upon him 'for they had made appointment together ' to see how he took it ; but the janitor told them that job had gone  into the country , he believed .
midmore 's relief when he found his story was not written across his aching temples for mr. sperrit to read  the defeated lover , like the successful one , believes all earth privy to his soul  was put down by mr. sperrit to quite different causes .
he led him into a <unk> .
the rest of the house seemed to be full of people , singing to a loud piano idiotic songs about cows , and the hall smelt of damp cloaks .
'it 's our evening to take the <name> <unk> , ' mr. sperrit explained .
'it 's " high tide on the coast of <unk> . "
i hoped you 'd come back .
there are scores of little things to settle .
as for the house , of course , it stands ready for you at any time .
i could n't get <name> out of it  nor could <name> for that matter .
she 's the sister , is n't she , of the nurse who brought you down here when you were four , she says , to recover from measles ? '
'is she ?
was i ? '
said midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth .
'd'you suppose i could stay there the night ? '
thirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk>  <unk> ! '
mr. sperrit had to raise his voice above the din .
'well , if i asked you to stay here , i should never hear the last of it from <name> .
she 's a little cracked , of course , but the soul of devotion and capable of anything .
ne sit <unk> , you know . '
'thank you .
then i 'll go .
i 'll walk . '
he stumbled out dazed and sick into the <name> twilight , and sought the square house by the <name> .
it was not a dignified entry , because when the door was <unk> and <name> exclaimed , he took two valiant steps into the hall and then fainted  as men sometimes <name> after twenty-two hours of strong emotion and little food .
'i 'm sorry , ' he said when he could speak .
he was lying at the foot of the stairs , his head on <name> 's lap .
'your 'ome is your castle , sir , ' was the reply in his hair .
'i smelt it was n't drink .
you lay on the sofa till i get your supper . '
she settled him in a drawing-room <name> with yellow silk , heavy with the smell of dead leaves and oil lamp .
something murmured soothingly in the background and overcame the noises in his head .
he thought he heard horses ' feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks and grass .
it passed close to the shuttered <unk> .
but each <name> mourn his own , she saith , and sweeter woman ne'er <name> breath than my son 's wife , <name> ... <unk>  <unk>  <unk>  calling .
the hoofs broke into a canter as <name> entered with the tray .
'and then i 'll put you to bed , ' she said .
<unk> 's coming in the morning . '
midmore asked no questions .
he dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and would have pitied it all over again , but the food and warm <name> and water drugged him to instant sleep .
<name> 's voice wakened him , asking whether he would have <unk> , foot , or <unk> , ' which he understood were the baths of the establishment .
<unk> you try all three , ' she suggested .
'they 're all yours , you know , sir . '
he would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight , but her words struck him pleasantly .
everything his eyes opened upon was his very own to keep for ever .
the carved <unk> <unk> bed , obviously worth hundreds ; the wavy walnut <name> and <name> chairs  he had seen worse ones labelled twenty guineas apiece ; the oval <unk> mirror ; the delicate <unk> wire <unk> ; the heavy <unk> curtains were his  all his .
so , too , a great garden full of birds that faced him when he shaved ; a mulberry tree , a <unk> , and a dull , <unk> <name> that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away .
peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee that he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing , all set round with mysterious doors and <unk> prints .
he spent two hours after breakfast in exploring his new possessions .
his heart leaped up at such things as <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in a tiled passage , a <unk> malacca cane , boxes and boxes of unopened stationery , <unk> , bunches of keys , and at the bottom of a <unk> <unk> a little leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven shillings in silver .
'you used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after your measles , ' said <name> as he slipped the money into his pocket .
'now , this was your pore dear auntie 's <unk> . '
she opened a low door .
'oh , i forgot about mr. <name> !
there he is . '
an enormous old man with <unk> red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an empire chair , his cap in his hands .
<name> withdrew sniffing .
the man looked midmore over in silence , then jerked a thumb towards the door .
'i reckon she told you who i be , ' he began .
'i 'm the only farmer you 've got .
nothin ' goes off my place 'thout it walks on its own feet .
what about my <unk> ? '
'well , what about it ? '
said midmore .
'that 's just what i be come about .
the county councils are getting more particular .
did ye know there was swine fever at <unk> 's ?
there be .
it 'll 'ave to be in brick . '
'yes , ' said midmore politely .
'i 've bin at your aunt that was , plenty times about it .
i do n't say she was n't a just woman , but she did n't read the lease same way i did .
i be used to bein ' put upon , but there 's no doing any longer 'thout that <unk> . '
'when would you like it ? '
midmore asked .
it seemed the easiest road to take .
'any time or other suits me , i reckon .
he ai n't <unk> ' where he is , an ' i paid eighteen shillin ' for him . '
he crossed his hands on his stick and gave no further sign of life .
'is that all ? '
midmore stammered .
'all now  excep "  he glanced <unk> at the table beside him  <unk> my <unk> .
where 's that <name> ? '
midmore rang the <name> .
<name> came in with a bottle and a glass .
the old man helped himself to four stiff fingers , rose in one piece , and stumped out .
at the door he cried ferociously : 'do n't suppose it 's any odds to you whether i 'm drowned or not , but them <unk> want a wheel and winch , they do .
i be too old for <unk> ' 'em with the bar  my time o ' life . '
'good riddance if 'e was drowned , ' said <name> .
'but do n't you mind him .
he 's only <unk> ' himself .
your pore dear auntie used to give 'im 'is usual  't is n't the whisky you drink  an ' send 'im about 'is business . '
'i see .
now , is a <unk> the same thing as a <unk> ? '
<name> nodded .
<unk> needs one , too , but 'e ai n't entitled to it .
you look at 'is lease  third drawer on the left in that bombay <unk>  an ' next time 'e comes you ask 'im to read it .
that 'll choke 'im off , because 'e ca n't ! '
there was nothing in midmore 's past to teach him the message and significance of a <unk> lease of the late <unk> , but <name> interpreted .
'it do n't mean anything <unk> , ' was her cheerful conclusion , <unk> you must n't get rid of him anyhow , an ' 'e can do what 'e likes always .
lucky for us 'e do farm ; and if it was n't for 'is woman  ' 'oh , there 's a mrs. <name> , is there ? '
<unk> , no ! '
the <unk> do n't marry .
they keep .
that 's his fourth since  to my knowledge .
he was a takin ' man from the first . '
'any families ? '
'they 'd be grown up by now if there was , would n't they ?
but you can't spend all your days <unk> ' 'is interests .
that 's what gave your pore aunt 'er indigestion .
'ave you seen the <unk> ? '
midmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure .
but there was no denying that the late colonel <unk> 's <unk> <unk> were good at their filthy job .
he loaded one , took it out and pointed  merely pointed  it at a <unk> which rose out of a shrubbery behind the kitchen , and the flaming bird came down in a long slant on the lawn , stone dead .
<name> from the <unk> said it was a lovely shot , and told him lunch was ready .
he spent the afternoon gun in one hand , a map in the other , beating the bounds of his lands .
they lay altogether in a shallow , uninteresting valley , flanked with woods and bisected by a <name> .
up stream was his own house ; down stream , less than half a mile , a low red farm-house squatted in an old orchard , beside what looked like small <unk> on the thames .
there was no doubt as to ownership .
mr. <name> saw him while yet far off , and bellowed at him about <unk> and <unk> .
these last were two great sliding shutters of <unk> oak across the <name> , which were <unk> up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip of iron , and when <name> opened them they at once let out half the water .
midmore watched it shrink between its <unk> banks like some <unk> trick .
this , too , was his very own .
'i see , ' he said .
'how interesting !
now , what 's that <name> for ? '
he went on , pointing to an old ship 's <name> in a rude belfry at the end of an <unk> .
'was that a chapel once ? '
the <unk> giant seemed to have difficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely .
'yes , ' he said at last .
'my chapel .
when you 'ear that <name> ring you'll 'ear something .
nobody but me 'ud put up with it  but i reckon it don't make any odds to you . '
he slammed the gates down again , and the <name> rose behind them with a suck and a grunt .
midmore moved off , conscious that he might be safer with <name> to hold his conversational hand .
as he passed the front of the farm-house a smooth fat woman , with neatly parted grey hair under a widow 's cap , <unk> to him deferentially through the window .
by every teaching of the immoderate left she had a perfect right to express herself in any way she pleased , but the curtsey revolted him .
and on his way home he was hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his mouth , who <unk> and danced round him .
'what did that beast want ? '
he demanded of <name> at tea .
<unk> ?
he only wanted to know if you 'ad any telegrams to send .
<unk> go anywhere so long as 't is n't across running water .
that gives 'im 'is <unk> .
even talkin ' about it for fun like makes 'im shake . '
'but why is n't he where he can be properly looked after ? '
'what 'arm 's 'e doing ?
e 's a <unk> , but 'is family can pay for 'im .
if 'e was locked up 'e 'd die all off at once , like a wild rabbit .
won't you , please , look at the drive , sir ? '
midmore looked in the fading light .
the neat gravel was pitted with large <unk> holes , and there was a punch or two of the same sort on the lawn .
'that 's the <unk> comin ' 'ome , ' <name> explained .
'your pore dear auntie always let 'em use our drive for a short cut after the colonel died .
the colonel would n't so much because he preserved ; but your auntie was always an <unk> till 'er <unk> . '
'is n't there some one who can rake it over or  or something ? '
said midmore vaguely .
'oh yes .
you 'll never see it in the morning , but  you was out when they came 'ome an ' mister fisher  he 's the master  told me to tell you with 'is compliments that if you was n't <unk> ' and cared to 'old to the old understanding ' , is <unk> is at your service same as before .
'e thought , perhaps , you might n't know , and it 'ad slipped my mind to tell you .
it 's good gravel , mister fisher 's , and it binds beautiful on the drive .
we 'ave to draw it , o ' course , from the pit , but  ' midmore looked at her helplessly .
<unk> , ' said he , 'what am i supposed to do ? '
'oh , let 'em come through , ' she replied .
'you never know .
you may want to <unk> yourself some day . '
that evening it rained and his misery returned on him , the worse for having been diverted .
at last he was driven to paw over a few score books in a <unk> room called the library , and realised with horror what the late colonel <unk> 's mind must have been in its prime .
the volumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew .
he opened and thrust them back , one after another , till crude coloured illustrations of men on horses held his eye .
he began at random and read a little , moved into the drawing-room with the volume , and settled down by the fire still reading .
it was a foul world into which he peeped for the first time  a <unk> , <unk> hell of <unk> , swindlers , <unk> mothers , <unk> dependent virgins selling themselves <unk> for cash and lands : jews , tradesmen , and an <unk> spawn of <unk> characters ( i give midmore 's own criticism ) , but he read on , fascinated , and behold , from the pages leaped , as it were , the brother to the <unk> man of the <name> , bellowing at a landlord ( here midmore realised that he was that very animal ) for new barns ; and another man who , like himself again , objected to <unk> on gravel .
outrageous as thought and <name> were , the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation .
he dug out other volumes by the same author , till <name> came in with a silver candlestick .
<unk> , ' said he , 'did you ever hear about a character called <name> <unk>  and <unk> ? '
'why , o ' course , ' said she .
'the colonel used to come into the kitchen in 'is <unk> an ' read us all those <unk> . '
'oh , lord ! '
said midmore , and went to bed with a book called <unk> cross under his arm , and a <unk> <name> into a stranger world the <unk> moon never looked upon .
* * * * * here we omit much .
but midmore never denied that for the <unk> in sensation the urgent needs of an ancient house , as interpreted by <name> pointing to daylight through <unk> held in place by moss , gives an edge to the pleasure of social research elsewhere .
equally he found that the reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror if one knows one can at <name> bathe the soul in the society of <unk> ( all the <unk> had chronic <unk> ) , village idiots ( <name> had taken midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the <unk> ) , and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an <unk> outrage .
towards spring midmore filled his house with a few friends of the immoderate left .
it happened to be the day when , all things and <name> working together , a <unk> of bricks , another of sand , and some bags of lime had been despatched to build <name> his almost <unk> <unk> .
midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some idea of showing them <name> as a type of 'the peasantry . '
they hit the minute when <name> , hoarse with rage , was ordering <unk> , mate , carts and all off his premises .
the visitors disposed themselves to listen .
'you never give me no notice about changin ' the pig , ' <name> shouted .
the pig  at least eighteen inches long  reared on end in the old sty and smiled at the company .
'but , my good man  ' midmore opened .
'i ai n't !
for aught you know i be a dam ' sight worse than you be .
you ca n't come and <unk> <unk> with me .
you are <unk> ' <unk> !
all you men go clean away an ' do n't set foot on my land till i bid ye . '
'but you asked '  midmore felt his voice jump up  'to have the <unk> built . '
<unk> i did .
that 's no reason you should n't send me notice to change the pig .
<unk> ' down on me like this 'thout warnin ' !
that pig 's got to be got into the <unk> an ' all . '
'then open the door and let him run in , ' said midmore .
'do n't you <unk> <unk> with me !
take all your dam ' men 'ome off my land .
i wo n't be treated <unk> . '
the carts moved off without a word , and <name> went into the house and slammed the door .
'now , i hold that is enormously significant , ' said a visitor .
'here you have the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppression  the frenzy of fear . '
the company looked at midmore with grave pain .
'but he did worry my life out about his <unk> , ' was all midmore found to say .
others took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the gospels of the immoderate left the earth would soon be covered with <unk> little ' <unk> , built in the intervals of <unk> by 'the peasant ' himself .
midmore felt grateful when the door opened again and mr. <name> invited them all to retire to the road which , he pointed out , was public .
as they turned the corner of the house , a <unk> woman in a <unk> cap <unk> to each of them through the window .
instantly they <name> pictures of that woman 's lot , deprived of all vehicle for <unk>  'the set grey life and <unk> end , ' one quoted  and they discussed the tremendous significance of village theatricals .
even a month ago midmore would have told them all that he knew and <name> had dropped about <name> 's forms of <unk> .
now , for some strange reason , he was content to let the talk run on from village to metropolitan and world drama .
<name> advised him after the visitors left that 'if he wanted to do that again ' he had better go up to town .
'but we only sat on cushions on the floor , ' said her master .
'they 're too old for <unk> , ' she retorted , 'an ' it 's only the beginning of things .
i 've seen what i've seen .
besides , they talked and laughed in the passage going to their baths  such as took 'em . '
'do n't be a fool , <name> , ' said midmore .
no man  unless he has loved her  <name> casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head .
'very good , ' she snorted , 'but that cuts both ways .
an ' now , you go down to <name> 's this evenin ' and put him where he ought to be .
he was in his right about you givin ' 'im notice about changin ' the pig , but he <unk> any right to turn it up before your company .
no manners , no <unk> .
he 'll understand . '
midmore did his best to make him .
he found himself <unk> the old man in speech and with a <name> quite new in all his experience .
he wound up  it was a plagiarism from a <unk>  by telling mr. <name> that he looked like a turkey-cock , had the morals of a parish bull , and need never <name> for a new <unk> as long as he or midmore lived .
'very good , ' said the giant .
'i reckon you thought you 'ad something against me , and now you 've come down an ' told it me like man to man .
quite right .
i do n't bear malice .
now , you send along those bricks an' sand , an ' i 'll make a do to build the <unk> myself .
if you look at my lease you 'll find out you 're bound to provide me materials for the repairs .
only  only i thought there 'd be no 'arm in my askin ' you to do it throughout like . '
midmore fairly gasped .
'then , why the devil did you turn my carts back when  when i sent them up here to do it throughout for you ? '
mr. <name> sat down on the <unk> , his eyebrows knitted in thought .
'i 'll tell you , ' he said slowly .
"twas too dam ' like <unk> ' a <unk> baby .
my woman , she said so too . '
for a few seconds the teachings of the immoderate left , whose humour is all their own , wrestled with those of mother earth , who has her own humours .
then midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand .
in due time mr. <name> laughed too  crowing and wheezing <unk> till it broke from him in roars .
they shook hands , and midmore went home grateful that he had held his tongue among his companions .
when he reached his house he met three or four men and women on <unk> , very muddy indeed , coming down the drive .
feeling hungry himself , he asked them if they were hungry .
they said they were , and he bade them enter .
<name> took their horses , who seemed to know him .
<name> took their battered hats , led the women upstairs for <unk> , and presently fed them all with <unk> , <unk> eggs , <unk> toast , and drinks from a <unk> <unk> case which midmore had never known that he possessed .
'and i <name> say , ' said miss <name> sperrit , her spurred foot on the fender and a smoking <unk> in her whip hand , <unk> does one <unk> .
she always did since i was eight . '
<unk> , miss , was when you began to <unk> , ' said <name> , setting down more buttered toast .
'and so , ' the <unk> .
was saying to midmore , 'when he got to your brute <name> 's land , we had to whip 'em off .
it 's a regular <unk> for 'em .
they know it .
why '  he dropped his voice  'i do n't want to say anything against <name> as your tenant , of course , but i do believe the old scoundrel 's perfectly capable of putting down poison . '
<unk> 's capable of anything , ' said midmore with immense feeling ; but once again he held his tongue .
they were a queer community ; yet when they had stamped and jingled out to their horses again , the house felt hugely big and disconcerting .
this may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life .
it ran in odd channels that summer  a riding school , for instance , near hayes common and a shooting ground near <unk> <unk> .
a man who has been <unk> or <unk> for half the day is not at his london best of evenings ; and when the bills for his amusements come in he <unk> his expenses in other directions .
so a cloud settled on midmore 's name .
his london world talked of a <unk> of heart and a tightening of <unk> which signified <unk> to the cause .
one man , a confidant of the old expressive days , attacked him <unk> and demanded account of his soul 's progress .
it was not furnished , for midmore was calculating how much it would cost to <unk> stables so dilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting <unk> horses into them .
the man went away , and served up what he had heard of the <unk> episode as a little newspaper sketch , calculated to annoy .
midmore read it with an eye as practical as a woman 's , and since most of his experiences had been among women , at once sought out a woman to whom he might tell his sorrow at the <unk> of his own familiar friend .
she was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised heart  she knew all about it  had found <unk> , with a long o , in another quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be betrayed to other loyal friends .
as his hints pointed directly towards facile <unk> , and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse from a dealer , <unk> way , he felt he had done good work .
later , when his friend , the scribe , talked to him <unk> of <unk> gardens ' and those <unk> to which every man who follows the wider morality is entitled , midmore lent him a <unk> note which he had got back on the price of a <unk> bay <unk> .
so true it is , as he read in one of the late colonel <unk> 's books , that 'the young man of the present day would sooner lie under an <unk> against his morals than against his knowledge of <unk> . '
midmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to ride and , above all , to jump on a <unk> bay <unk> with black points and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences .
he did not wish many people except mr. <name> , who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind the <unk> , to be privy to the matter , which he rightly foresaw would take him to the autumn .
so he told such friends as hinted at country week-end visits that he had practically let his newly inherited house .
the rent , he said , was an object to him , for he had lately lost large sums through <unk> <unk> .
he would name no names , but they could guess .
and they guessed loyally all round the circle of his acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much .
there remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to <unk> .
they were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal , of course , but as curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted .
midmore met them in a suburban train , coming up to town , not twenty minutes after he had come off two hours ' advanced tuition ( one guinea an hour ) over <unk> in a hall .
he had , of course , changed his <name> , but his too heavy <unk> shook a little among the newspapers .
on the inspiration of the moment , which is your natural liar 's best hold , he told them that he was condemned to a <unk> .
he would lie in semi-darkness drinking milk , for weeks and weeks , cut off even from letters .
he was astonished and delighted at the ease with which the usual lie <unk> the unusual intellect .
they swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live on nuts and fruit ; but he saw in the woman 's eyes the exact reason she would set forth for his retirement .
after all , she had as much right to express herself as he purposed to take for himself ; and midmore believed strongly in the fullest equality of the sexes .
that retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world .
the <name> who had written the <unk> letter ten months before sent him another of eight pages , <unk> all the motives that were leading her back to him  should she come ?  now that he was ill and alone .
much might yet be <unk> , she said , out of the waste of jarring lives and piteous <unk> .
it needed only a hand .
but midmore needed two , next morning very early , for a <unk> diversion , among wet <unk> , called <unk> . '
'you have n't a bad seat , ' said miss sperrit through the <unk> .
'but you 're worrying him . '
'he pulls so , ' midmore grunted .
'let him alone , then .
look out for the branches , ' she shouted , as they whirled up a <unk> ride .
cubs were plentiful .
most of the hounds attached themselves to a <unk> youngster of education who scuttled out of the woods into the open fields below .
'hold on ! '
some one shouted .
<unk> 'em , midmore .
that 's your brute <name> 's land .
it 's all wire . '
'oh , <name> , stop ! '
mrs. sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a <unk> .
<unk> be damned !
i had it all out a fortnight ago .
come on ! '
this was midmore , <unk> into it a little lower down .
'_i knew that ! '
<name> cried over her shoulder , and she flitted across the open pasture , humming to herself .
'oh , of course !
if some people have private information , they can afford to thrust . '
this was a <unk> habit into which miss sperrit had <unk> down the ride .
'what !
<unk> got <name> to heel ?
you never did that , sperrit . '
this was mr. fisher , <unk> , enlarging the breach midmore had made .
'no , confound him ! '
said the father testily .
'go on , sir !
<unk> ter <unk>  you 've kicked half the ditch into my eye already . '
they killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him to make for  a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> to which the <unk> .
had been denied access for the last fifteen seasons .
he expressed his gratitude before all the field and mr. <name> , at mr. <unk> farm-house door .
'and if there should be any poultry claims  ' he went on .
'there wo n't be , ' said midmore .
'it 's too like cheating a sucking child , is n't it , mr .
<name> ? '
'you 've got me ! '
was all the reply .
'i be used to bein ' put upon , but you 've got me , mus ' midmore . '
midmore pointed to a new brick <unk> built in strict disregard of the terms of the <unk> 's lease .
the gesture told the tale to the few who did not know , and they shouted .
such pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings when men and women elsewhere are at their brightest .
but midmore preferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch , reading works of a <unk> vulgarity ; or , by invitation , to dine with the <unk> and savages of their kidney .
these did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing .
they lied , except about horses , <unk> and of necessity , not for <unk> sake ; and , men and women alike , they expressed themselves along their chosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals .
then midmore would go home and identify them , one by one , out of the <unk> books by mr. <unk> , on the table beside the sofa .
at first they looked upon him coolly , but when the tale of the removed wire and the <unk> gorse had gone the rounds , they accepted him for a person willing to play their games .
true , a faction suspended judgment for a while , because they shot , and hoped that midmore would serve the glorious <unk> of <unk> rather than the unkempt god of <unk> .
but after he had shown his choice , they did not ask by what intellectual process he had arrived at it .
he hunted three , sometimes four , times a week , which necessitated not only one bay <unk> ( <unk> : <unk> .
) , but a <unk> <unk> chestnut ( <unk> ) , and a black mare , rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk ( <unk> ) , who so evidently preferred to <name> a <name> that it would have been cruel to have <unk> her .
besides , with that handling she could be sold at a profit .
and besides , the hunt was a quiet , intimate , kindly little hunt , not anxious for strangers , of good report in the field , the servant of one <unk> , given to hospitality , riding well its own horses , and , with the exception of midmore , not <unk> .
but as miss sperrit observed , after the <unk> .
had said some things to him at a gate : 'it is a pity you do n't know as much as your horse , but you <name> in time .
it takes years and <unk> .
i 've been at it for fifteen and i 'm only just learning .
but you 've made a decent <unk> . '
so he kicked off in wind and wet and mud , wondering quite sincerely why the bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day , or what <unk> he could find on off days in chasing grooms and <unk> round <unk> .
to make sure he <unk> himself one week-end of heavy <unk> rain , and re-entered his lost world in the character of <unk> fresh from a <unk> .
they all agreed , with an eye over his shoulder for the next comer , that he was a different man ; but when they asked him for the symptoms of nervous strain , and led him all through their own , he realised he had lost much of his old skill in lying .
his three <unk> absence , too , had put him hopelessly behind the london field .
the movements , the allusions , the slang of the game had changed .
the couples had rearranged themselves or were <unk> in fresh triangles , whereby he put his foot in it badly .
only one great soul ( he who had written the account of the <unk> episode ) stood untouched by the vast flux of time , and midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity .
a woman took him , in the wet forenoon , to a <unk> on the <unk> of impulse in humanity , which struck him as a <unk> <unk> of mr. <name> 's domestic arrangements , plus a clarion call to <unk> civilisation into common-sense . '
'and you 'll come to tea with me to-morrow ? '
she asked , after lunch , nibbling <unk> nuts from a saucer .
midmore replied that there were great arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for so long .
'but you 've come back like a giant refreshed ... .
i <name> that <name> '  this was the <name> of the twelve and the <unk> letter  'will be with us too .
she has misunderstood herself , like so many of us , ' the woman murmured , 'but i think eventually ... ' she flung out her thin little hands .
<unk> , these are things that each lonely soul must adjust for itself . '
'indeed , yes , ' said midmore with a deep sigh .
the old tricks were <unk> in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a <unk> .
he passed into an abrupt reverie , shook his head , as though stung by tumultuous memories , and departed without any ceremony of farewell to  catch a <unk> express where a man meets associates who talk horse , and weather as it affects the horse , all the way down .
what worried him most was that he had missed a day with the hounds .
he met <name> 's keen old eyes without <unk> ; and the drawing-room looked very comfortable that wet evening at tea .
after all , his visit to town had not been wholly a failure .
he had burned quite a bushel of letters at his flat .
a flat  here he reached mechanically towards the worn volumes near the sofa  a flat was a consuming animal .
as for <name> ... he opened at random on the words : 'his lordship then did as desired and disclosed a <unk> of considerable strength and variety . '
midmore reflected : 'and i used to think ... .
but she was n't ... . we were all <unk> and <unk> together ... .
i did n't babble much  thank goodness  but i skirted . '
he turned the pages backward for more <unk> <unk> , and read : 'when at length they rose to go to bed it struck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs , that the man before him walked very <unk> . '
he laughed aloud at the fire .
'what about to-morrow ? '
<name> asked , entering with garments over her shoulder .
'it 's never stopped raining since you left .
you 'll be plastered out of sight an ' all in five minutes .
you 'd better wear your next best , 'ad n't you ?
i 'm afraid they 've shrank .
'ad n't you best try 'em on ? '
'here ? '
said midmore .
<unk> yourself .
i bathed you when you was n't larger than a leg o' lamb , ' said the <unk> .
<unk> , one of these days i shall get a valet , and a married butler . '
'there 's many a true word spoke in jest .
but nobody 's <unk> to-morrow . '
'why ?
have they <unk> the meet ? '
'they say it only means slipping and <unk> in the mud , and they all 'ad enough of that to-day .
<name> told me so just now . '
'oh ! '
it seemed that the word of mr. sperrit 's confidential clerk had weight .
<unk> came down to help mr. <name> lift the gates , ' <name> continued .
'the <unk> ?
they are perfectly easy to handle now .
i 've put in a wheel and a winch . '
'when the <name> 's really up they must be took clean out on account of the rubbish <unk> ' 'em .
that 's why <name> came down . '
midmore grunted impatiently .
<unk> has talked to me about that <name> ever since i came here .
it 's never done anything yet . '
'this 'as been a dry summer .
if you care to look now , sir , i 'll get you a lantern . '
she paddled out with him into a large wet night .
half-way down the lawn her light was reflected on shallow brown water , pricked through with grass blades at the edges .
beyond that light , the <name> was <unk> and kicking among hedges and tree-trunks .
'what on earth <name> happen to the big <unk> ? '
was midmore 's first word .
'it generally 'as to be <unk> after a flood .
ah ! '
she raised her lantern .
'there 's two <unk> <unk> ' against the <unk> .
now , that wo n't do the roses any good . '
'this is too absurd .
there ought to be some decently <unk> system  for  for dealing with this sort of thing . '
he peered into the rushing gloom .
there seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket .
in town he had noticed nothing .
'it ca n't be <unk> , ' said <name> .
'it 's just what it does do once in just so often .
we 'd better go back . '
all earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards the hoarse <name> .
somebody wailed from the house : <unk> o ' the water !
come 'ere !
'fraid o ' the water ! '
'that 's <name> .
wet always takes 'im that way , ' she explained .
the idiot charged into them , shaking with terror .
<unk> <name> !
how brave of <name> !
come into the hall .
what <name> got now ? '
she <unk> .
it was a sodden note which ran : 'dear <name>  mr. <unk> , with whom i rode home this afternoon , told me that if this wet keeps up , he 's afraid the <unk> he built last year , where <unk> old <unk> was , <name> go , as the dam did once before , he says .
if it does it 's bound to come down the <name> .
it may be all right , but perhaps you had better look out .
c.s . '
'if <unk> 's dam goes , that means ... .
i 'll 'ave the drawing-room carpet up at once to be on the safe side .
the <unk> is in the <unk> . '
'wait a minute .
<name> 's gates are out , you said ? '
<unk> .
he 'll need it if <unk> 's pond goes ... .
i 've seen it once . '
'i 'll just slip down and have a look at <name> .
light the lantern again , please , <name> . '
'you wo n't get him to stir .
he 's been there since he was born .
but she do n't know anything .
i 'll fetch your waterproof and some <unk> . '
<unk> o ' the water !
'fraid o ' the water ! '
<name> sobbed , pressed against a corner of the hall , his hands to his eyes .
'all right , <name> .
<name> can help play with the carpet , ' <name> answered , as midmore went forth into the darkness and the <unk> all round .
he had never seen such an utterly <unk> state of affairs .
there was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive .
'hi !
<name> !
did you get my note ?
i came down to make sure .
i thought , afterwards , <name> might funk the water ! '
'it 's me  miss sperrit , ' midmore cried .
'yes , we got it , thanks . '
'you 're back , then .
oh , good ! ...
is it bad down with you ? '
'i 'm going to <name> 's to have a look . '
'you wo n't get him out .
<unk> i met <name> <unk> .
i told him he hadn't any business <unk> water for his idiotic trout without <unk> the dam . '
'how far up is it ?
i 've only been there once . '
'not more than four miles as the water <name> come .
he says he 's opened all the <unk> . '
she had turned and fallen into step beside him , her hooded head bowed against the thinning rain .
as usual she was humming to herself .
'why on earth did you come out in this weather ? '
midmore asked .
'it was worse when you were in town .
the rain 's taking off now .
if it was n't for that pond , i would n't worry so much .
there 's <name> 's <name> .
come on ! '
she broke into a run .
a cracked <name> was <unk> feebly down the valley .
'keep on the road ! '
midmore shouted .
the ditches were snorting <unk> on either side , and towards the <unk> the fields were afloat and beginning to move in the darkness .
<unk> me going off it !
there 's his light burning all right . '
she halted <unk> at a little rise .
'but the flood 's in the orchard .
look ! '
she swung her lantern to show a front rank of old <unk> reflected in still , <unk> waters beyond the <unk> hedge .
they could hear above the <unk> of the gorged <unk> , shrieks in two keys as monotonous as a <unk> .
'the high one 's the pig . '
miss sperrit laughed .
'all right !
i 'll get her out .
you stay where you are , and i 'll see you home afterwards . '
'but the water 's only just over the road , ' she objected .
'never mind .
do n't you move .
promise ? '
'all right .
you take my stick , then , and feel for holes in case anything 's washed out anywhere .
this is a lark ! '
midmore took it , and stepped into the water that moved <unk> as yet across the farm road which ran to <name> 's front door from the raised and <unk> public road .
it was half way up to his knees when he knocked .
as he looked back miss sperrit 's lantern seemed to float in <unk> .
'you ca n't come in or the water 'll come with you .
i 've <unk> up all the cracks , ' mr. <name> shouted from within .
'who be ye ? '
'take me out !
take me out ! '
the woman shrieked , and the pig from his sty behind the house urgently seconded the motion .
'i 'm midmore !
<unk> 's old <unk> is likely to go , they say .
come out ! '
'i told 'em it would when they made a <unk> of it .
't was n't ever <unk> proper .
but it 's a middlin ' wide valley .
she 's got room to spread ... . keep still , or i 'll take and duck you in the cellar ! ...
you go 'ome , mus ' midmore , an ' take the law o ' mus ' <unk> soon 's you've changed your socks . '
<unk> you , are n't you coming out ? '
'to catch my death o ' cold ?
i 'm all right where i be .
i 've seen it before .
but you can take her .
she 's no sort o ' use or sense ... .
climb out through the window .
did n't i tell you i 'd plugged the <unk> , you fool 's daughter ? '
the parlour window opened , and the woman flung herself into midmore 's arms , nearly knocking him down .
mr. <name> leaned out of the window , pipe in mouth .
'take her 'ome , ' he said , and added <unk> : 'two women in one house , two cats an ' one mouse , two dogs an ' one bone  which i <name> leave alone .
i 've seen it before . '
then he shut and fastened the window .
'a trap !
a trap !
you had ought to have brought a trap for me .
i 'll be drowned in this wet , ' the woman cried .
'hold up !
you ca n't be any <unk> than you are .
come along ! '
midmore did not at all like the feel of the water over his <unk> .
<unk> !
come along ! '
miss sperrit 's lantern , not fifty yards away , waved cheerily .
the woman threshed towards it like a panic-stricken goose , fell on her knees , was jerked up again by midmore , and pushed on till she collapsed at miss sperrit 's feet .
'but you wo n't get <unk> if you go straight to mr. <unk> house , ' said the unsympathetic maiden .
'o gawd !
o gawd !
i wish our <unk> father 'ud forgive me my sins an' call me 'ome , ' the woman sobbed .
'but i wo n't go to 'is 'ouse !
i wo n't . '
'all right , then .
stay here .
now , if we run , ' miss sperrit whispered to midmore , 'she 'll follow us .
not too fast ! '
they set off at a considerable trot , and the woman lumbered behind them , bellowing , till they met a third lantern  <name> holding <name> 's hand .
she had got the carpet up , she said , and was escorting <name> past the water that he dreaded .
'that 's all right , ' miss sperrit pronounced .
'take mrs. <name> back with you , <name> , and put her to bed .
i 'll take <name> with me .
you aren't afraid of the water now , are you , <name> ? '
'not afraid of anything now . '
<name> reached for her hand .
'but get away from the water quick . '
'i 'm coming with you , ' midmore interrupted .
'you most certainly are not .
you 're drenched .
she threw you twice .
go home and change .
you may have to be out again all night .
it 's only half-past seven now .
i 'm perfectly safe . '
she flung herself lightly over a stile , and hurried uphill by the <unk> , out of reach of all but the boasts of the flood below .
<name> , dead silent , <unk> mrs. <name> to the house .
'you 'll find your things laid out on the bed , ' she said to midmore as he came up .
i 'll attend to  to this .
she's got nothing to cry for . '
midmore raced into dry <name> , and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight of the lantern just turning into the <unk> ' gate .
he came back by way of <name> 's farm , where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of shining water , for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping overhead , though the <name> was <unk> than ever .
now there was only that doubtful mill-pond to look after  that and his swirling world abandoned to himself alone .
'we shall have to sit up for it , ' said <name> after dinner .
and as the drawing-room commanded the best view of the rising flood , they watched it from there for a long time , while all the clocks of the house bore them company .
"tis n't the water , it 's the mud on the <unk> after it goes down that i mind , ' <name> whispered .
'the last time <unk> 's mill broke , i remember it came up to the second  no , third  step o ' mr. <name> 's stairs . '
'what did <name> do about it ? '
'he made a notch on the step .
'e said it was a record .
just like 'im . '
'it 's up to the drive now , ' said midmore after another long wait .
'and the rain stopped before eight , you know . '
'then <unk> 's dam 'as broke , and that 's the first of the <unk> . '
she stared out beside him .
the water was rising in sudden pulses  an inch or two at a time , with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden increase of the <name> 's proper thunder .
'you ca n't stand all the time .
take a chair , ' midmore said presently .
<name> looked back into the bare room .
'the carpet bein ' up does make a difference .
thank you , sir , i <name> 'ave a <unk> . '
<unk> over the drive now , ' said midmore .
he opened the window and leaned out .
'is that wind up the valley , <name> ? '
'no , that 's it !
but i 've seen it before . '
there was not so much a roar as the <unk> drive of a tide across a jagged reef , which put down every other sound for twenty minutes .
a wide sheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house stood , pushed round either corner , rose again and stretched , as it were , yawning beneath the moonlight , joined other sheets waiting for them in unsuspected hollows , and lay out all in one .
a puff of wind followed .
'it 's right up to the wall now .
i can touch it with my finger . '
midmore bent over the window-sill .
'i can 'ear it in the cellars , ' said <name> dolefully .
'well , we 've done what we can !
i think i 'll 'ave a look . '
she left the room and was absent half an hour or more , during which time he saw a full-grown tree hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots .
then a <unk> knocked against the wall , caught on an iron <unk> just outside , and made a <unk> ripple .
the cascade through the <unk> diminished .
'it 's dropping , ' <name> cried , as she returned .
'it 's only <unk> ' into my cellars now . '
'wait a minute .
i believe  i believe i can see the <unk> on the edge of the drive just showing ! '
in another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel again , tilting all its water towards the shrubbery .
'the pond 's gone past , ' <name> announced .
'we shall only 'ave the common flood to contend with now .
you 'd better go to bed . '
'i ought to go down and have another look at <name> before daylight . '
'no need .
you can see 'is light burnin ' from all the upstairs windows . '
'by the way .
i forgot about her .
where 've you put her ? '
'in my bed . '
<name> 's tone was ice .
'i was n't going to undo a room for that stuff . '
'but it  it could n't be helped , ' said midmore .
'she was half drowned .
one must n't be <unk> , <name> , even if her position isn't quite  er  regular . '
<unk> !
i was n't <unk> ' about that . '
she leaned forward to the window .
'there 's the edge of the lawn showin ' now .
it falls as fast as it rises .
<unk> '  the change of tone made midmore jump  'did n't you know that i was 'is first ?
that's what makes it so hard to bear . '
midmore looked at the long <unk> back and had no words .
she went on , still talking through the black <unk> : 'your pore dear auntie was very kind about it .
she said she 'd make all allowances for one , but no more .
never any more ... . then , you didn't know 'oo <name> was all this time ? '
'your nephew , i always thought . '
'well , well , ' she spoke <unk> .
<unk> 's business being <unk> business , i suppose no one thought to tell you .
but <name> made 'is own way for <unk> from the beginnin ' ! ...
but her upstairs , she never produced anything .
just an <unk> , as you might say .
<unk> over an ' went to sleep straight off .
she 'ad the impudence to ask me for 'ot <unk> . '
'did you give it to her , ' said midmore .
'me ?
your <name> ?
no ! '
the memory of <name> 's outrageous rhyme at the window , and <unk> long nose ( he thought it looked interested at the time ) as he passed the copies of mrs. <unk> 's last four wills , overcame midmore without warning .
'this damp is givin ' you a cold , ' said <name> , rising .
'there you go again !
<unk> 's a sure sign of it .
better go to bed .
you ca n't do any thin ' excep "  she stood rigid , with crossed arms  <unk> me . '
'well .
what about you ? '
midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his pocket .
'now you know about it , what are you goin ' to do  sir ? '
she had the answer on her <name> cheek before the sentence was finished .
'go and see if you can get us something to eat , <name> .
and beer . '
'i <unk> ' the larder 'll be in a swim , ' she replied , 'but old bottled stuff do n't take any harm from wet . '
she returned with a tray , all in order , and they ate and drank together , and took observations of the falling flood till <name> opened its <unk> eyes on the wreck of what had been a fair garden .
midmore , cold and annoyed , found himself humming : 'that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass , that ebb swept out the flocks to sea .
there is n't a rose left , <name> !
an <unk> ebb and flow it was to many more than mine and me .
but each <name> mourn his ...
it 'll cost me a hundred . '
'now we know the worst , ' said <name> , 'we can go to bed .
i 'll lay on the kitchen sofa .
his light 's burnin ' still . '
'and she ? '
<unk> old cat !
you ought to 'ear 'er snore ! '
at ten o'clock in the morning , after a maddening hour in his own garden on the edge of the retreating <name> , midmore went off to confront more damage at <name> 's .
the first thing that met him was the pig , snowy white , for the water had washed him out of his new sty , calling on high heaven for breakfast .
the front door had been forced open , and the flood had registered its own height in a brown <unk> on the walls .
midmore chased the pig out and called up the stairs .
'i be abed o ' course .
which step 'as she rose to ? '
<name> cried from above .
'the fourth ?
then it 's beat all records .
come up . '
'are you ill ? '
midmore asked as he entered the room .
the red eyelids blinked cheerfully .
mr. <name> , beneath a sumptuous <unk> quilt , was smoking .
<unk> !
i 'm only <unk> ' god i ai n't my own landlord .
take that cheer .
what 's she done ? '
'it has n't gone down enough for me to make sure . '
<unk> <unk> o ' yourn 'll be middlin ' far down the <name> by now ; an' your <unk> have gone after 'em .
i saved my chickens , though .
you'd better get mus ' sperrit to take the law o ' <unk> an ' 'is <unk> . '
'no , thanks .
i 've trouble enough without that . '
<unk> ye ? '
mr. <name> grinned .
'how did ye make out with those two women o ' mine last night ?
i lay they fought . '
'you infernal old scoundrel ! '
midmore laughed .
'i be  an ' then again i <unk> n't , ' was the placid answer .
'but , <name> , she would n't <name> ' left me last night .
fire or flood , she would n't . '
'why did n't you ever marry her ? '
midmore asked .
<unk> of good money .
she was willin ' without . '
there was a step on the gritty mud below , and a voice humming .
midmore rose quickly saying : 'well , i suppose you 're all right now . '
'i be .
i ai n't a landlord , nor i ai n't young  nor anxious .
oh , <unk> midmore !
would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin ' regular if i married her ?
<name> said maybe 'twould . '
'did he ? '
midmore turned at the door .
'and what did <name> say about it ? '
<unk> ? '
mr. <name> chuckled as the joke took him .
'oh , he's none o' mine .
he 's <name> 's look-out . '
midmore slammed the door and ran downstairs .
'well , this is a  sweet  mess , ' said miss sperrit in shortest skirts and heaviest <unk> .
'i had to come down and have a look at it .
" the old mayor climbed the belfry tower . "
<unk> up all night nursing your family ? '
<unk> that !
is n't it cheerful ? '
he pointed through the door to the stairs with small <unk> on the last three <unk> .
'it 's a record , though , ' said she , and hummed to herself : 'that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass , that ebb swept out the flocks to sea . '
'you 're always singing that , are n't you ? '
midmore said suddenly as she passed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at all angles .
'am i ?
now i come to think of it i believe i do .
they say i always hum when i ride .
have you noticed it ? '
'of course i have .
i notice every  ' 'oh , ' she went on hurriedly .
'we had it for the village <unk> last <name>  " the brides of enderby . " '
'no !
" high tide on the coast of <unk> . " '
for some reason midmore spoke sharply .
'just like that . '
she pointed to the <unk> walls .
'i say ... . let's get this furniture a little straight ... . you know it too ? '
'every word , since you sang it of course . '
'when ? '
'the first night i ever came down .
you rode past the drawing-room window in the dark singing it  " and sweeter woman  " ' 'i thought the house was empty then .
your aunt always let us use that short cut .
<unk> n't we better get this out into the passage ?
it 'll all have to come out anyhow .
you take the other side . '
they began to lift a <unk> table .
their words came <unk> between gasps and their faces were as white as  a newly washed and very hungry pig .
'look out ! '
midmore shouted .
his legs were whirled from under him , as the table , grunting madly , <unk> and knocked the girl out of sight .
the wild boar of <name> could not have cut down a couple more scientifically , but this little pig lacked his ancestor 's nerve and fled shrieking over their bodies .
'are you hurt , darling ? '
was midmore 's first word , and 'no  i 'm only winded  dear , ' was miss sperrit 's , as he lifted her out of her corner , her hat over one eye and her right cheek a <unk> of mud .
they fed him a little later on some <unk> that they found in <name> 's quiet barn , a pail of <unk> out of the dairy , and a quantity of onions from a shelf in the <unk> .
<unk> , most likely , ' said <name> .
'you 'll hear about this . '
'what does it matter ?
they ought to have been gilded .
we must buy him . '
'and keep him as long as he lives , ' she agreed .
'but i think i ought to go home now .
you see , when i came out i did n't expect ... did you ? '
'no !
yes ... .
it had to come ... .
but if any one had told me an hour ago ! ...
<name> 's unspeakable parlour  and the mud on the carpet . '
'oh , i say !
is my cheek clean now ? '
'not quite .
lend me your <unk> again a minute , darling ... . what a <unk> you came ! '
'you ca n't talk .
'remember when your <name> hit that table and you said " blast " !
i was just going to laugh . '
'you did n't laugh when i picked you up .
you were going " <unk> " like a little owl . '
'my dear child  ' 'say that again ! '
'my dear child .
( do you really like it ?
i keep it for my best friends . )
my <unk> child , i thought i was going to be sick there and then .
he knocked every ounce of wind out of me  the <name> !
but i must really go . '
they set off together , very careful not to join hands or take arms .
'not across the fields , ' said midmore at the stile .
'come round by  by your own place . '
she flushed indignantly .
'it <name> be yours in a little time , ' he went on , shaken with his own audacity .
'not so much of your little times , if you please ! '
she shied like a colt across the road ; then instantly , like a colt , her eyes lit with new curiosity as she came in sight of the <unk> .
'and not quite so much of your airs and graces , madam , ' midmore returned , 'or i wo n't let you use our drive as a short cut any more . '
'oh , i 'll be good .
i 'll be good . '
her voice changed suddenly .
'i swear i 'll try to be good , dear .
i 'm not much of a thing at the best .
what made you ... <unk> 'i 'm worse  worse !
miles and oceans worse .
but what does it matter now ? '
they halted beside the <unk> .
'i see ! '
she said , looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front door porch where <name> was slapping a wet mat to and fro .
'_i see ... . now , i really must go home .
no !
do n't you come .
i must speak to mother first all by myself . '
he watched her up the hill till she was out of sight .
the floods the rain it rains without a stay in the hills above us , in the hills ; and presently the floods break way whose strength is in the hills .
the trees they suck from every cloud , the valley <name> they roar aloud  <unk> for the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the first wood down is sere and small , from the hills , the <unk> off the hills ; and then come by the bats and all we cut last year in the hills ; and then the roots we tried to cleave but found too tough and had to leave  <unk> through the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the eye shall look , the ear shall hark to the hills , the doings in the hills , and rivers <unk> in the dark with tokens from the hills .
now what is weak <name> surely go , and what is strong must prove it so .
stand fast in the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the floods they shall not be afraid  nor the hills above 'em , nor the hills  of any fence which man has made betwixt him and the hills .
the waters shall not reckon twice for any work of man 's device , but bid it down to the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the floods shall sweep corruption clean  by the hills , the blessing of the hills  that more the meadows may be green <unk> from the hills .
the crops and cattle shall increase , nor little children shall not cease  go  plough the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the <unk> when all the world would have a matter hid , since truth is seldom friend to any crowd , men write in fable , as old <unk> did , jesting at that which none <name> name aloud .
and this they needs must do , or it <name> fall unless they please they are not heard at all .
when desperate folly daily <unk> to work confusion upon all we have , when diligent sloth <unk> freedom 's death , and banded fear <unk> honour 's grave  even in that certain hour before the fall unless men please they are not heard at all .
needs must all please , yet some not all for need needs must all toil , yet some not all for gain , but that men taking pleasure may take heed , whom present toil shall snatch from later pain .
thus some have toiled but their reward was small since , though they pleased , they were not heard at all .
this was the lock that lay upon our lips , this was the yoke that we have undergone , denying us all pleasant <unk> as in our time and generation .
our pleasures <unk> age past recall .
and for our pains  we are not heard at all .
what man hears aught except the groaning guns ?
what man <unk> aught save what each instant brings ?
when each man 's life all <unk> life <unk> , what man shall pleasure in imaginings ?
so it hath fallen , as it was bound to fall , we are not , nor we were not , heard at all .
the vortex ( <name> 1914 ) 'thy lord spoke by inspiration to the <name> . '
<name> koran .
i have , to my grief and loss , suppressed several notable stories of my friend , the hon .
a.m. penfentenyou [ 8 ] , once minister of woods and <unk> in de <unk> 's first administration ; later , premier in all but name of one of our great and growing dominions ; and now , as always , the idol of his own province , which is two and one-half the size of england .
[ footnote 8 : see 'the <unk> , ' actions and reactions . ]
for this reason i hold myself at <name> to deal with some portion of the truth concerning penfentenyou 's latest visit to our shores .
he arrived at my house by car , on a hot summer day , in a white waistcoat and <unk> , sweeping black frock-coat and glistening <unk>  a little rounded , perhaps , at the edges , but agile as ever in mind and body .
'what is the trouble now ? '
i asked , for the last time we had met , penfentenyou was floating a <unk> pound <name> for his beloved but unscrupulous province , and i did not wish to entertain any more of his financial friends .
'we , ' penfentenyou replied <unk> , 'have come to have a voice in your councils .
by the way , the voice is coming down on the evening train with my agent-general .
i thought you would n't mind if i invited 'em .
you know we 're going to share your burdens henceforward .
you'd better get into training . '
'certainly , ' i replied .
'what 's the voice like ? '
'he 's in <name> , ' said penfentenyou .
'he 's got it , and he 's got it bad .
he 'll give it to you , ' he said .
'what 's his name ? '
'we call him all sorts of names , but i think you 'd better call him mr. lingnam .
you wo n't have to do it more than once . '
'what 's he suffering from ? '
'the empire .
he 's pretty nearly cured us all of <unk> at home .
p'raps he 'll cure you . '
'very good .
what am i to do with him ? '
'do n't you worry , ' said penfentenyou .
'he 'll do it . '
and when mr. lingnam appeared half-an-hour later with the agent-general for penfentenyou 's dominion , he did just that .
he advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides .
he said he had been observing to the agent-general that it was both politically immoral and <unk> <unk> that forty-four million people should bear the entire weight of the defences of our mighty empire , but , as he had observed ( here the agent-general evaporated ) , we stood now upon the threshold of a new <name> in which the <unk> and self-respecting ( <unk> ) dominions would rightly and <unk> , as <unk> in <unk> , shoulder their share of any burden which the <unk> council of the future should <unk> .
the agent-general was already arranging for drinks with penfentenyou at the other end of the garden .
mr. lingnam swept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme .
we dined at eight .
at nine mr. lingnam was only drawing abreast of things imperial .
at ten the agent-general , who earns his salary , was shamelessly dozing on the sofa .
at eleven he and penfentenyou went to bed .
at midnight mr. lingnam brought down his <unk> despatch box with the newspaper clippings and set to <unk> the empire in <name> .
i remember that he had three alternative plans .
as a dealer in words , i <unk> for the <unk> third  <unk> <unk> senatorial <unk> '  which he then elaborated in detail for three-quarters of an hour .
at half-past one he urged me to have <name> and to remember that nothing mattered except the idea .
then he retired to his room , accompanied by one glass of cold water , and i went into the <unk> garden and prayed to any power that might be off duty for the blood of mr. lingnam , penfentenyou , and the agent-general .
to me , as i have often observed elsewhere , the hour of earliest <name> is fortunate , and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most comfortable counsellor .
'wait ! '
it said , all among the night 's expectant <unk> .
<unk> is also a day .
wait upon the event ! '
i went to bed so at peace with god and man and guest that when i waked i visited mr. lingnam in pyjamas , and he talked to me <unk> for half-an-hour before his bath .
later , the agent-general said he had letters to write , and penfentenyou invented a cabinet crisis in his adored dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the forenoon .
but i said firmly , 'mr .
lingnam wishes to see a little of the country round here .
you are coming with us in your own car . '
'it 's a hired one , ' penfentenyou objected .
'yes .
paid for by me as a <unk> , ' i replied .
'and yours has a top , and the weather looks <unk> , ' said the agent-general .
<unk> has n't a <unk> .
even our goggles were hired . '
'i 'll lend you goggles , ' i said .
'my car is under repairs . '
the hireling who had looked to be returned to london spat and growled on the drive .
she was an open car , capable of some eighteen miles on the flat , with <unk> <unk> and a perpetual <unk> .
'it wo n't make the least difference , ' sighed the agent-general .
<unk> only raise his voice .
he did it all the way coming down . '
'i say , ' said penfentenyou suspiciously , 'what are you doing all this for ? '
<unk> of the empire , ' i answered , as mr. lingnam tripped up in <unk> and <unk> .
'now , mr. lingnam <name> tell us exactly what he wants to see .
he probably knows more about england than the rest of us put together . '
'i read it up yesterday , ' said mr. lingnam simply .
while we stowed the <unk> ( one can never make too sure with a hired car ) he outlined a very pretty and instructive little day 's run .
'you 'll drive , of course ? '
said penfentenyou to him .
'it 's the only thing you know anything about . '
this astonished me , for your greater <unk> are rarely <unk> , but mr. lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the present and enjoy our conversation .
well settled on the back seat , he did not once lift his eyes to the mellow landscape around him , or throw a word at the life of the english road which to me is one renewed and <unk> orgy of delight .
the <unk> scouts of the automobile association ; their natural enemies , the unjust police ; our natural enemies , the deliberate <unk> cattle , <unk> at all corners , the <unk> <unk> a furlong behind ; <unk> that pulled <unk> , rifle galleries , and swings , and sucked <unk> from wayside ponds in defiance of the <unk> ; <unk> , their <unk> piled high with road metal ; uniformed village nurses , one per seven statute miles , flitting by on their wheels ; <unk> full of pink children <unk> unconcernedly past roaring , brazen <unk> ; the wayside rector with virgins in attendance , their faces screwed up against our dust ; <unk> of every shape charging down at every <name> ; red flags of <unk> ; detachments of <unk> <unk> ; <unk> of flagrant children playing in <unk> , and the wise , educated english dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his <unk> would but cease from trying to save him , passed and <unk> us in sunlit or shaded <unk> .
but mr. lingnam only talked .
he talked  we all sat together behind so that we could not escape him  and he talked above the worn <unk> and a certain maddening swish of one badly patched tire  and he talked of the <unk> of the empire against all conceivable dangers except himself .
yet i was neither brutally rude like penfentenyou , nor <unk> bored like the agent-general .
i remembered a certain <name> <unk> who delighted the <unk> arms on the borders of the new forest with nine '  it should have been ten  <unk> of a single income of two hundred <unk> placing the imaginary person in  but i could not recall the list of towns further than <unk> , <name> , bagdad , and <unk> . '
this last i must have murmured aloud , for the agent-general suddenly became human and went on : <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> islands  ' 'what ? '
growled penfentenyou .
'nothing , ' said the agent-general , squeezing my hand affectionately .
'only we have just found out that we are brothers . '
<unk> , ' said mr. lingnam .
'that 's what i 've been trying to lead up to .
we 're all brothers .
d'you realise that fifteen years ago such a conversation as we 're having would have been unthinkable ?
the empire would n't have been ripe for it .
to go back , even ten years  ' 'i 've got it , ' cried the agent-general .
' " brighton , cincinnati , and <unk> ! "
god bless r.l.s . !
go on , uncle <name> .
i can endure much now . '
mr. lingnam went on like our <unk> , slowly and loudly .
he admitted that a man <unk> with a central idea  and , after all , the only thing that mattered was the idea  might become a bore , but the world 's work , he pointed out , had been done by bores .
so he laid his bones down to that work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the <name> of allah , who alone closes the mouths of his prophets .
and we wasted more than fifty miles of summer 's vivid own england upon him the while .
about two o'clock we topped <unk> rising and looked down on the village of <unk> <name> , which lies just across a single railway line , spanned by a red brick bridge .
the thick , thunderous <name> airs brought us gusts of <name> from a <unk> <unk> in full blast near the pond on the village green .
drums , too , thumped and banners waved and <unk> flashed at the far end of the broad village street .
mr. lingnam asked why .
'nothing imperial , i 'm afraid .
it looks like a <unk> ' <unk>  one of our big mutual benefit societies , ' i explained .
'the idea only needs to be <unk> to imperial scale  ' he began .
'but it means that the pub .
<name> be crowded , ' i went on .
'what 's the matter with lunching by the roadside here ? '
said penfentenyou .
'we 've got the <unk> . '
'have n't you ever heard of <unk> <name> <unk> ? '
i demanded , and be became the administrator at once , saying , '_i see !
lingnam can drive us in and we 'll get some , while <unk> '  this was the hireling chauffeur , whose views on beer we knew not  <unk> out lunch here .
that 'll be better than eating at the pub .
we can take in the <unk> ' <unk> as well , and perhaps i can buy some newspapers at the station . '
'true , ' i answered .
'the railway station is just under that bridge , and we 'll come back and lunch here . '
i indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly <unk> at the head of <unk> rise .
as <unk> got out the <unk> , a detachment of regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road .
'ah ! '
said mr. lingnam , the <unk> roll in his voice .
'all europe is an armed camp , groaning , as i remember i once wrote , under the weight of its accoutrements . '
'oh , hop in and drive , ' cried penfentenyou .
'we want that beer ! '
it made no difference .
mr. lingnam could have <unk> the empire from a tight rope .
he continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled .
'the danger to the younger nations is of being drawn into this vortex of <unk> , ' he went on , dodging the rear of the soldiery .
<unk> past troops , ' i hinted .
'it saves 'em dust .
and we overtake on the right as a rule in england . '
<unk> ! '
mr. lingnam <unk> over .
'that 's another detail which needs to be <unk> throughout the empire .
but to go back to what i was saying .
my idea has always been that the component parts of the empire should take counsel among themselves on the approach of war , so that , after we have decided on the merits of the <unk> <unk> , we can <unk> what part each dominion shall play whenever war is , unfortunately , a possibility . '
we neared the <unk> railway bridge , and the hireling knocked piteously at the grade .
mr. lingnam changed <unk> , and she hoisted herself up to a joyous <unk> !  from the <unk> .
as we topped the arch we saw a <unk> ' band with banners marching down the street .
'that 's all very fine , ' said the agent-general , 'but in real life things have a knack of happening without approaching  ' * * * * * ( some schools of thought hold that time is not ; and that when we attain complete enlightenment we shall behold past , present , and future as one awful whole .
i myself have nearly achieved this . )
* * * * * we dipped over the bridge into the village .
a boy on a bicycle , loaded with four paper <unk> , <unk> towards us , out of an alley on our right .
he bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent , and naturally took his left .
mr. lingnam swerved frantically to the right .
penfentenyou shouted .
the boy looked up , saw the car was like to squeeze him against the bridge wall , flung himself off his machine and across the narrow pavement into the nearest house .
he slammed the door at the precise moment when the car , all brakes set , <unk> the abandoned bicycle , shattering three of the <unk> and jerking the fourth over the <unk> <unk> into mr. lingnam 's arms .
there was a dead stillness , then a hiss like that of escaping steam , and a man who had been running towards us ran the other way .
'why !
i think that those must be bees , ' said mr. lingnam .
they were  four full swarms  and the first living objects which he had remarked upon all day .
some one said , 'oh , god ! '
the agent-general went out over the back of the car , crying resolutely : 'stop the traffic !
stop the traffic , there ! '
penfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a door-bell , so i had both their rugs , which  for i am an <unk>  i threw over my head .
while i was <unk> my trousers into my socks  for i am an <unk> of experience  mr. lingnam picked up the <unk> <unk> and with a single magnificent gesture ( he told us afterwards he thought there was a river beneath ) hurled it over the parapet of the bridge , ere he ran across the road towards the village green .
now , the station platform immediately below was crowded with <unk> and their friends waiting to welcome a delegation from a sister court .
i saw the box burst on the flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward <unk> like shrapnel .
but the result was stimulating rather than <unk> .
all those well-dressed people below shouted like sodom and gomorrah .
then they moved as a unit into the <unk> , the <unk> , and other places , shut doors and windows and <unk> aloud , while the incoming train whistled far down the line .
i <unk> round cross-legged on the back seat , like a <unk> beauty beneath her veil , and saw penfentenyou , his <unk> over his ears , dancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a <unk> woman at an upper window , who only <unk> and shook her head .
a little child , carrying a kitten , came smiling round a corner .
suddenly ( but these things moved me no more than so many yards of <unk> <unk> ) the kitten leaped spitting from her arms , the child burst into tears , penfentenyou , still dancing , snatched her up and tucked her under his coat , the woman 's countenance blanched , the front door opened , penfentenyou and the child pressed through , and i was alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows and calling children home .
a voice cried : 'you 've <unk> 'em !
you 've <unk> 'em !
throw dust on 'em and they 'll settle ! '
i did not <name> to throw dust on any created thing .
i needed both hands for my draperies and two more for my stockings .
besides , the bees were doing me no hurt .
they recognised me as a member of the county <unk> ' association who had paid his annual subscription and was entitled to a free seat at all <unk> exhibitions .
the quiver and the <unk> of the hireling car , or it might have been the <unk> banners and the arrogant big drum , inclined many of them to go up street , and pay court to the advancing <unk> ' band .
so they went , such as had not followed mr. lingnam in his flight toward the green , and i looked out of two <unk> eyes instead of half a one at the approaching musicians , while i listened with both ears to the delayed train 's second whistle down the line beneath me .
the forester 's band no more knew what was coming than do troops under sudden fire .
indeed , there were the same extravagant gestures and <unk> as attend wounds and deaths in war ; the very same uncanny <unk> of speech  for the <unk> was cut off at <unk> , even as a man drops with a syllable on his tongue .
they clawed , they slapped , they fled , leaving behind them a trophy of banners and <unk> <unk> arranged round the big drum .
then that end of the street also shut its windows , and the village , stripped of life , lay round me like a reef at low tide .
though i am , as i have said , an <unk> in good standing , i never realised that there were so many bees in the world .
when they had woven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other , there remained reserves enough to form <unk> and <unk> on all <unk> and <unk> , without diminishing the multitudes in the three oozing <unk> , or drawing on the fourth ( railway ) battalion in charge of the station below .
the prisoners in the <unk> and other places there cried out a great deal ( i argued that they were dying of the heat ) , and at regular intervals the <unk> called and called to a <unk> who was not on duty , and the train whistled as it <name> nearer .
then penfentenyou , <unk> and <unk> politician of the type that <unk> at the price of all the higher emotions , appeared at the window of the house on my right , broken and <unk> with mirth , the woman beside him , and the child in his arms .
i saw his mouth open and shut , he hollowed his hands round it , but the <unk> of the motor and the bees drowned his words .
he pointed dramatically across the street many times and fell back , tears running down his face .
i turned like a hooded <unk> in a heavy <unk> ( not knowing when my trousers would come out of my socks again ) through one hundred and eighty degrees , and in due time bore on the village green .
there was a salmon in the pond , rising short at a cloud of <unk> to the tune of <unk> ; but there was none to <unk> him .
the <unk> were empty , <unk> sat still on their red sticks before white screens , and the <unk> horses of the <unk> revolved <unk> .
all was <name> , green turf , bright water , and this greedy <unk> fish .
when i had identified it by its grey gills and <unk> as lingnam , i prostrated myself before allah in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer .
then i turned to the purple penfentenyou at the window , and wiped my eyes on the rug edge .
he raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the crack : 'did you see him ?
have they got you ?
i can see lots of things from here .
it 's like a <unk> circus ! '
'can you see the station ? '
i replied , nodding toward the right rear <unk> .
he twisted and <unk> sideways , but could not command that beautiful view .
'no !
what 's it like ? '
he cried .
<unk> ! '
i shouted .
the <unk> woman frowned ; so did penfentenyou , and , i think , apologised to her for my language .
'you 're always so extreme , ' he fluted reproachfully .
'you forget that nothing matters except the idea .
besides , they are this <name> 's bees . '
he closed the window , and introduced us through it in dumb show ; but he contrived to give the impression that i was the specimen under glass .
a spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy .
the train had lost <name> at last , and was coming into the station directly beneath me to see what was the matter .
happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all along the compartments , but none answered their songs or greetings .
she halted , and the people began to get out .
then they began to get in again , as their friends in the <unk> advised .
all did not catch the warning , so there was <unk> at the doors , but those whom the bees caught got in first .
still the bees , more bent on their own business than wanton torture , kept to the south end of the platform by the <unk> , and that was why the completely exposed <unk> at the north end of the train did not at first understand the <unk> sealed <unk> when the latter shouted to him many times to 'get on out o ' this . '
'where are you ? '
was the reply .
'and what for ? '
'it do n't matter where i am , an ' you 'll get <unk> in a minute if you do n't shift , ' said the <unk> .
<unk> 'em at parson 's meadow and they can walk up over the fields . '
that <unk> , <unk> idiot , leaning out of the cab , took the <unk> 's orders as an insult to his dignity , and roared at the shut offices : 'you 'll give me <unk> , <name> you ?
look 'ere , i 'm not in the <unk> of  ' his outstretched hand flew to his neck ... . do you know that if you sting an <unk> it is the same as stinging his train ?
she starts with a jerk that nearly <unk> the <unk> , and runs , barking like a dog , till she is out of sight .
nor does she think about spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her .
i had to do all that .
there was a man called <name> , and his wife <name>  a cheery , <unk> couple  who interested me immensely before they battered their way into a small detached building , already densely occupied .
there was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a <unk> umbrella and twirled it dizzily , which was so new a game that i applauded aloud .
when they had thoroughly cleared the ground , the bees set about making comb for publication at the <unk> counter .
presently some bold hearts tiptoed out of the <unk> over the loud gravel with the consciously modest air of men leaving church , climbed the wooden staircase to the bridge , and so reached my level , where the inexhaustible <unk> were still vomiting squadrons and <unk> .
there was little need to bid them descend .
they had wrapped their heads in handkerchiefs , so that they looked like the disappointed dead <unk> back to purgatory .
only one old gentleman , <unk> draped in a banner embroidered <unk> and fortitude , ' ran the gauntlet <unk> , shouting as he passed me , 'it 's night or <unk> , mister . '
they let him in at the white <unk> , the pub .
where i should have bought the beer .
after this the day <unk> .
i fell to reckoning how long a man in a turkish bath , weakened by excessive laughter , could live without food , and specially drink ; and how long a <unk> <name> could hold out under the same conditions .
obviously , since her one practical joke costs her her life , the <name> can have but small sense of humour ; but her fundamentally dismal and <unk> outlook on life impressed me beyond words .
she had paralysed locomotion , wiped out trade , social intercourse , mutual trust , love , friendship , sport , music ( the lonely <unk> had run down at last ) , all that gives substance , colour or <unk> to life , and yet , in the barren desert she had created , was not one whit more near to the evolution of a <unk> order of things .
the heavens were darkened with the swarms ' divided counsels ; the street <unk> with their purposeless sallies .
they clotted on tiles and <unk> , and began <unk> to build a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their <name> was not with them ; then flung off to seek her , or whirled , dishevelled and insane , into another hissing <unk> on the false rumour that she was there .
i scowled upon them with <unk> , and a massy , blue <unk> rose majestically from behind the <unk> of <unk> <name> <unk> , arched over and scowled with me .
then i realised that it was not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies , but the <unk> of the malignant english thunderstorm  the one thing before which even <name> the <name> can not express her silly little self .
'aha !
now you 'll catch it , ' i said , as the herald gusts set the big drum rolling down the street like a <unk> .
up and up yearned the dark cloud , till the first lightning quivered and cut .
<name> cowered .
where she flew , there she fled ; where she was , there she sat still ; and the solid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is finished .
by the time it had soaked to my second rug , penfentenyou appeared at the window , wiping his false mouth on a napkin .
'are you all right ? '
he inquired .
'then that's all right !
mrs. <unk> says that her bees do n't sting in the wet .
you 'd better fetch lingnam over .
he 's got to pay for them and the bicycle . '
i had no words which the <unk> <name> could listen to , but paddled across the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green .
mr. lingnam , scarcely visible through the <unk> downpour , trotted round the edge .
he bore himself nobly , and lied at the mere sight of me .
'is n't this wet ? '
he cried .
'it has drenched me to the skin .
i shall need a change . '
'come along , ' i said .
'i do n't know what you 'll get , but you deserve more . '
penfentenyou , dry , fed , and in command , let us in .
'you , ' he whispered to me , 'are to wait in the <unk> .
mrs. <unk> did n't like the way you talked about her bees .
hsh !
hsh !
she 's a kind-hearted <name> .
she 's a widow , lingnam , but she 's kept his clothes , and as soon as you 've paid for the damage she 'll rent you a suit .
i 've arranged it all ! '
'then tell him he must n't undress in my hall , ' said a voice from the <unk> .
'tell her  ' lingnam began .
'come and look at the pretty suit i 've chosen , ' penfentenyou cooed , as one <unk> a maniac .
i staggered <unk> again , and fell into the car , whose <unk> machinery masked my <unk> and <unk> .
when i raised my forehead from the wheel , i saw that traffic through the village had been resumed , after , as my watch showed , one and one-half hour 's suspension .
there were two <unk> , one <unk> , one doctor 's car , three <unk> , one patent <unk> van , three <unk> , one <unk> , some <unk> , one with a <unk> , and one <unk> <unk> .
it was the allegory of my own imperturbable country , delayed for a short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her business , and i blessed her with tears in my eyes , even though i knew she looked upon me as drunk and incapable .
then troops came over the bridge behind me  a company of dripping wet regulars without any expression .
in their rear , carrying the <unk> , marched the agent-general and <unk> the hired chauffeur .
'i say , ' said the agent-general , nodding at the darkened khaki backs .
'if that's what we 've got to depend on in event of war they 're a broken <name> .
they ran like hares  ran like hares , i tell you . '
'and you ? '
i asked .
'oh , i just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that end .
then i had lunch .
<unk> about the beer , though .
i say  these cushions are <unk> wet ! '
'i 'm sorry , ' i said .
'i have n't had time to turn 'em . '
<unk> there was n't any need to 'ave kept the engine runnin ' all this time , ' said <unk> sternly .
'i 'll 'ave to account for the expenditure of <unk> .
it exceeds the <unk> indicated , you see . '
'i 'm sorry , ' i repeated .
after all , that is the way that <unk> regard most crises .
the <unk> opened and penfentenyou and another came out into the now thinning rain .
'ah !
there you both are !
here 's lingnam , ' he cried .
'he 's got a little wet .
he 's had to change . '
'we saw that .
i was too sore and weak to begin another laugh , but the agent-general crumpled up where he stood .
the late mr. <unk> must have been a man of tremendous personality , which he had impressed on every <name> of his garments .
i was told later that he had died in delirium <unk> , which at once explained the pattern , and the reason why mr. lingnam , writhing inside it , swore so <unk> .
of the deliberate and diffuse <unk> there remained no trace , save the <unk> and two damp whiskers .
we stood on the pavement , before elemental man calling on elemental powers to condemn and <unk> creation .
'well , had n't we better be getting back ? '
said the agent-general .
'look out ! '
i remarked casually .
'those <unk> are full of bees still ! '
'are they ? '
said the livid mr. lingnam , and tilted them over with the late mr. <unk> 's large boots .
<name> rolled out in drenched lumps into the <unk> gutter .
there was a muffled shriek at the window where mrs. <unk> <unk> .
'it 's all right .
i 've paid for them , ' said mr. lingnam .
he dumped out the last <unk> like mould from a <unk> flower-pot .
'what ?
are you going to take 'em home with you ? '
said the agent-general .
'no ! '
he passed a wet hand over his <unk> forehead .
'was n't there a bicycle that was the beginning of this trouble ? '
said he .
'it 's under the <unk> , sir , ' said <unk> promptly .
'i can fish it out from 'ere . '
'not till i 've done with it , please . '
before we could stop him , he had jumped into the car and taken charge .
the hireling leaped into her collar , surged , shrieked ( less loudly than mrs. <unk> at the window ) , and swept on .
that which came out behind her was , as <unk> truly observed , no <unk> .
mr. lingnam swung round the big drum in the market-place and thundered back , shouting : <unk> it alone .
it's my meat ! '
<unk> , 'e means , ' said <unk> after this second <unk> .
'you could n't say now it 'ad ever been one , could you ? '
mrs. <unk> opened the window and spoke .
it appears she had only charged for damage to the bicycle , not for the entire machine which mr. lingnam was ruthlessly <unk> , spoke by spoke , from the highway and <unk> into the slack of the hood .
at last he answered , and i have never seen a man foam at the mouth before .
'if you do n't stop , i shall come into your house  in this car  and drive upstairs and  kill you ! '
she stopped ; he stopped .
<unk> took the wheel , and we got away .
it was time , for the sun shone after the storm , and <name> beneath the tiles and the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her interrupted labours of <unk> .
we warned the village policeman at the far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again .
the proprietor of the <unk> , swings , and <unk> wanted to know from whom , in this world or another , he could recover damages .
mr. lingnam referred him most directly to mrs. <unk> ... . then we went home .
after dinner that evening mr. lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make a few remarks on the <unk> of the empire on the lines of <unk> , offensive operations , backed by the entire effective forces , moral , military , and <unk> , of permanently <unk> communities , the whole brought to bear , without any respect to the merits of any <unk> <unk> , instantaneously , automatically , and remorselessly at the first faint buzz of war .
'the trouble with us , ' said he , 'is that we take such an <unk> long time making sure that we are right that we do n't go ahead when things happen .
for instance , i ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up when i hit that bicycle . '
'but you were in the wrong , lingnam , when you turned to the right , ' i put in .
'i do n't want to hear any more of your damned , detached , <unk> excuses for the other fellow , ' he snapped .
'now you 're beginning to see things , ' said penfentenyou .
'i <name> you wo n't <unk> when the <unk> go down . '
the song of seven cities i was lord of cities very sumptuously builded .
seven roaring cities paid me tribute from afar .
<name> their outposts were  the <unk> of them gilded , and garrisoned with amazons invincible in war .
all the world went softly when it walked before my cities  neither king nor army vexed my peoples at their toil .
never horse nor chariot <unk> or <unk> my cities , never mob nor ruler questioned whence they <name> their spoil .
banded , mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset , singing while they sacked it , they possessed the land at large .
yet when men would <name> them , they resisted , they made onset and pierced the smoke of battle with a <unk> charge !
so they <unk> and <unk> only yesterday , my cities .
to-day there is no <name> or mound of where my cities stood .
for the river rose at midnight and it washed away my cities .
they are <unk> with <unk> and the towns before the flood .
rain on <unk> channels raised the <unk> round them , freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their world from sight , till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward drowned them  drowned my seven cities and their peoples in one night !
low among the alders lie their derelict foundations , the beams wherein they trusted and the <unk> whereon they built  my rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations , dead , destroyed , aborted , and defiled with mud and <unk> !
the daughters of the palace whom they cherished in my cities , my <unk> princesses , and the promise of their may  their <unk> of the <unk>  all have perished in my cities , with the harsh <unk> virgins that can neither love nor play .
i was lord of cities  i <name> build anew my cities , seven , set on rocks , above the wrath of any flood .
nor <name> i rest from search till i have filled anew my cities with peoples <unk> of the dark , enduring blood .
to the sound of trumpets shall their seed restore my cities .
wealthy and <unk> , that once more may i behold all the world go softly when it walks before my cities , and the horses and the chariots fleeing from them as of old !
<unk> and <unk> ( <name> <unk> ) when the first waves of feverish cold stole over frau ebermann she very wisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed .
he <unk> the attack as mild <unk> , prescribed the appropriate remedies , and left her to the care of her one servant in her comfortable berlin flat .
frau ebermann , beneath the thick <unk> , curled up with what <name> she could until the <unk> should begin to act , and <name> should come back from the chemist with the <unk> , the <unk> quinine , the <unk> , and the little tin <unk> .
meantime , every bone in her body ached ; her head throbbed ; her hot , dry hands would not stay the same size for a minute together ; and her body , tucked into the smallest possible compass , shrank from the chill of the <unk> sheets .
of a sudden she noticed that an <unk> cover which should have lain mathematically square with the <unk> top of the radiator behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner <name> over the <unk> steam pipes .
she recalled that she must have rested her poor head against the <unk> while she was taking off her boots .
she tried to get up and set the thing straight , but the radiator at once receded toward the horizon , which , unlike true horizons , slanted diagonally , exactly parallel with the dropped lace edge of the cover .
frau ebermann groaned through sticky lips and lay still .
'certainly , i have a temperature , ' she said .
'certainly , i have a grave temperature .
i should have been warned by that chill after dinner . '
she resolved to shut her <unk> eyes , but opened them in a little while to torture herself with the knowledge of that <unk> thing against the far wall .
then she saw a child  an untidy , <unk> little girl of about ten , who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat .
this proved  frau ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sick  proved that <name> had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist .
frau ebermann had had children of her own , but they were all grown up now , and she had never been a <unk> in any sense .
yet the intruder might be made to serve her scheme of things .
'make  put , ' she muttered thickly , 'that white thing straight on the top of that yellow thing . '
the child paid no attention , but moved about the room , investigating everything that came in her way  the yellow <unk> handles of the chest of drawers , the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy <unk> curtains , and the <unk> enamel , new <name> <unk> on the door .
frau ebermann watched indignantly .
<unk> !
that is bad and rude .
go away ! '
she cried , though it hurt her to raise her voice .
'go away by the road you came ! '
the child passed behind the <unk> , where she could not see her .
<unk> the door as you go .
i <name> speak to <name> , but  first , put that white thing straight . '
she closed her eyes in misery of body and soul .
the outer door clicked , and <name> entered , very penitent that she had stayed so long at the chemist 's .
but it had been difficult to find the proper type of <unk> , and  'where did the child go ? '
moaned frau ebermann  'the child that was here ? '
'there was no child , ' said startled <name> .
'how should any child come in when i shut the door behind me after i go out ?
all the keys of the flats are different . '
'no , no !
you forgot this time .
but my back is aching , and up my legs also .
besides , who knows what it may have fingered and upset ?
look and see . '
'nothing is fingered , nothing is upset , ' <name> replied , as she took the <unk> from its paper box .
'yes , there is .
now i remember all about it .
put  put that white thing , with the open edge  the lace , i mean  quite straight on that  ' she pointed .
<name> , accustomed to her ways , understood and went to it .
'now , is it quite straight ? '
frau ebermann demanded .
<unk> , ' said <name> .
'in fact , in the very centre of the radiator . '
<name> measured the equal margins with her knuckle , as she had been told to do when she first took service .
'and my tortoise-shell hair brushes ? '
frau ebermann could not command her <unk> from where she lay .
<unk> straight , side by side in the big tray , and the comb laid across them .
your watch also in the coralline <unk> .
everything '  she moved round the room to make sure  <unk> is as you have it when you are well . '
frau ebermann sighed with relief .
it seemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler .
'good ! '
said she .
'now warm my <unk> in the kitchen , so it <name> be ready when i have <unk> .
and the towels also .
make the <unk> steam , and put in the <unk> ; that is good for the larynx .
then sit you in the kitchen , and come when i ring .
but , first , my <unk> bottle . '
it was brought and scientifically tucked in .
'what news ? '
said frau ebermann drowsily .
she had not been out that day .
<unk> victory , ' said <name> .
<unk> more prisoners and guns . '
frau ebermann purred , one might almost say grunted , contentedly .
'that is good too , ' she said ; and <name> , after lighting the <unk> , went out .
frau ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the <unk> would begin to work , and all would be well .
to-morrow  no , the day after  she would take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee .
it was rare  every one knew it  that she should be overcome by any ailment .
yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest deviation from daily routine and ritual .
she would tell her friends  she ran over their names one by one  exactly what measures she had taken against the lace cover on the <unk> and in regard to her two tortoise-shell hair brushes and the comb at right angles .
how she had set everything in order  everything in order .
she <unk> further afield as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the <unk> bottle .
if it pleased our dear god to take her to himself , and she was not so young as she had been  there was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue <unk> , for instance  he should find all her belongings fit to meet his eye .
<unk> and garnished ' were the words that shaped themselves in her intent <name> .
<unk> and garnished for  ' no , it was certainly not for the dear lord that she had swept ; she would have her room swept out to-morrow or the day after , and garnished .
her hands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness .
then they shrank , and so did her head , to minute dots .
it occurred to her that she was waiting for some event , some tremendously important event , to come to pass .
she lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands should return to their proper size .
she opened her eyes with a jerk .
'how stupid of me , ' she said aloud , 'to set the room in order for a parcel of dirty little children ! '
they were there  five of them , two little boys and three girls  headed by the <unk> <unk> whom she had seen before .
they must have entered by the outer door , which <name> had neglected to shut behind her when she returned with the <unk> .
she counted them backward and forward as one counts scales  one , two , three , four , five .
they took no notice of her , but <name> about , first on one foot then on the other , like strayed chickens , the smaller ones holding by the larger .
they had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway waiting-room , and their clothes were <unk> dirty .
'go away ! '
cried frau ebermann at last , after she had struggled , it seemed to her , for years to shape the words .
'you called ? '
said <name> at the living-room door .
'no , ' said her mistress .
'did you shut the flat door when you came in ? '
<unk> , ' said <name> .
<unk> , it is made to catch shut of itself . '
'then go away , ' said she , very little above a whisper .
if <name> pretended not to see the children , she would speak to <name> later on .
'and now , ' she said , turning toward them as soon as the door closed .
the smallest of the crowd smiled at her , and shook his head before he buried it in his sister 's skirts .
'why  do n't  you  go  away ? '
she whispered earnestly .
again they took no notice , but , guided by the elder girl , set themselves to climb , boots and all , on to the green plush sofa in front of the radiator .
the little boys had to be pushed , as they could not compass the stretch unaided .
they settled themselves in a row , with small gasps of relief , and pawed the plush approvingly .
'i ask you  i ask you why do you not go away  why do you not go away ? '
frau ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times .
it seemed to her that everything in the world <name> on the answer .
'you know you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited .
not houses and bedrooms , you know . '
'no , ' a solemn little <unk> repeated , 'not houses nor bedrooms , nor <unk> , nor churches , nor all those places .
should n't come in .
it 's rude . '
'yes , he said so , ' the younger girl put in proudly .
'he said it .
he told them only pigs would do that . '
the line nodded and dimpled one to another with little explosive <unk> , such as children use when they tell deeds of great daring against their elders .
'if you know it is wrong , that makes it much worse , ' said frau ebermann .
'oh yes ; much worse , ' they assented cheerfully , till the smallest boy changed his smile to a baby wail of weariness .
'when <name> they come for us ? '
he asked , and the girl at the head of the row hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap .
'he 's tired , ' she explained .
'he is only four .
he only had his first breeches this spring . '
they came almost under his armpits , and were held up by broad linen braces , which , his sorrow diverted for the moment , he patted proudly .
'yes , beautiful , dear , ' said both girls .
'go away ! '
said frau ebermann .
'go home to your father and mother ! '
their faces grew grave at once .
<unk> !
we can't , ' whispered the eldest .
'there is n't anything left . '
'all gone , ' a boy echoed , and he puffed through pursed lips .
'like that , uncle told me .
both cows too . '
'and my own three ducks , ' the boy on the girl 's lap said sleepily .
'so , you see , we came here . '
the elder girl leaned forward a little , caressing the child she rocked .
'i  i do n't understand , ' said frau ebermann 'are you lost , then ?
you must tell our police . '
'oh no ; we are only waiting . '
'but what are you waiting for ? ' 'we are waiting for our people to come for us .
they told us to come here and wait for them .
so we are waiting till they come , ' the eldest girl replied .
'yes .
we are waiting till our people come for us , ' said all the others in chorus .
'but , ' said frau ebermann very patiently  'but now tell me , for i tell you that i am not in the least angry , where do you come from ?
where do you come from ? '
the five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the papers , 'that is silly , ' said frau ebermann .
'the people fired on us , and they were punished .
those places are wiped out , stamped flat . '
'yes , yes , wiped out , stamped flat .
that is why and  i have lost the ribbon off my <unk> , ' said the younger girl .
she looked behind her over the <unk> .
'it is not here , ' said the elder .
'it was lost before .
do n't you remember ? '
'now , if you are lost , you must go and tell our police .
they <name> take care of you and give you food , ' said frau ebermann .
<unk> <name> show you the way there . '
'no , '  this was the <unk> with the smile ,  'we must wait here till our people come for us .
must n't we , sister ? '
'of course .
we wait here till our people come for us .
all the world knows that , ' said the eldest girl .
'yes . '
the boy in her lap had waked again .
'little children , too  as little as henri , and he does n't wear trousers yet .
as little as all that . '
'i do n't understand , ' said frau ebermann , shivering .
in spite of the heat of the room and the damp breath of the <unk> , the <unk> was not doing its duty .
the girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant .
'you see , ' she said , <unk> her statements with her <unk> , <unk> told us to wait here till our people came for us .
so we came .
we wait till our people come for us . '
'that is silly again , ' said frau ebermann .
'it is no good for you to wait here .
do you know what this place is ?
you have been to school ?
it is berlin , the capital of germany . '
'yes , yes , ' they all cried ; <unk> , capital of germany .
we know that .
that is why we came . '
'so , you see , it is no good , ' she said triumphantly , 'because your people can never come for you here . '
'they told us to come here and wait till our people came for us . '
they delivered this as if it were a lesson in school .
then they sat still , their hands orderly folded on their laps , smiling as sweetly as ever .
'go away !
go away ! '
frau ebermann shrieked .
'you called ? '
said <name> , entering .
'no .
go away !
go away ! '
'very good , old cat , ' said the maid under her breath .
'next time you may call , ' and she returned to her friend in the kitchen .
'i ask you  ask you , please to go away , ' frau ebermann pleaded .
'go to my <name> through that door , and she <name> give you cakes and <unk> .
it is not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly . '
'where else shall we go now ? '
the elder girl demanded , turning to her little company .
they fell into discussion .
one preferred the broad street with trees , another the railway station ; but when she suggested an emperor 's palace , they agreed with her .
'we <name> go then , ' she said , and added half apologetically to frau ebermann , 'you see , they are so little they like to meet all the others . '
'what others ? '
said frau ebermann .
'the others  hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the others . '
'that is a lie .
there can not be a hundred even , much less a thousand , ' cried frau ebermann .
'so ? '
said the girl politely .
'yes .
i tell you ; and i have very good information .
i know how it happened .
you should have been more careful .
you should not have run out to see the horses and guns passing .
that is how it is done when our troops pass through .
my son has written me so . '
they had clambered down from the sofa , and gathered round the bed with eager , interested eyes .
<unk> and guns going by  how fine ! '
some one whispered .
'yes , yes ; believe me , that is how the accidents to the children happen .
you must know yourself that it is true .
one runs out to look  ' 'but i never saw any at all , ' a boy cried sorrowfully .
'only one noise i heard .
that was when aunt <unk> 's house fell down . '
'but listen to me .
i am telling you !
one runs out to look , because one is little and can not see well .
so one <unk> between the man 's legs , and then  you know how close those big horses and guns turn the corners  then one 's foot slips and one gets run over .
that 's how it happens .
several times it had happened , but not many times ; certainly not a hundred , perhaps not twenty .
so , you see , you must be all .
tell me now that you are all that there are , and <name> shall give you the cakes . '
<unk> , ' a boy repeated monotonously .
'then we all come here to wait till our people come for us . '
'but now we <name> go away from here .
the poor <name> is tired , ' said the elder girl , plucking his sleeve .
'oh , you hurt , you hurt ! '
he cried , and burst into tears .
'what is that for ? '
said frau ebermann .
'to cry in a room where a poor <name> is sick is very inconsiderate . '
'oh , but look , <name> ! '
said the elder girl .
frau ebermann looked and saw .
<unk> revoir , <name> . '
they made their little smiling bows and <unk> undisturbed by her loud cries .
<unk> revoir ,  <name> .
we <name> wait till our people come for us . '
when <name> at last ran in , she found her mistress on her knees , busily cleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator , because , she explained , it was all spotted with the blood of five children  she was perfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole world  who had gone away for the moment , but were now waiting round the corner , and <name> was to find them and give them cakes to stop the bleeding , while her mistress swept and garnished that our dear lord when he came might find everything as it should be .
<name> <unk> ( <unk> ) of miss <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> wrote that she was <unk> conscientious , tidy , companionable , and <unk> .
i am very sorry to part with her , and shall always be interested in her welfare . '
miss fowler engaged her on this recommendation , and to her surprise , for she had had experience of companions , found that it was true .
miss fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time , but though she needed care she did not exhaust her attendant 's vitality .
on the contrary , she gave out , <unk> and with reminiscences .
her father had been a minor court official in the days when the great exhibition of 1851 had just set its seal on civilisation made perfect .
some of miss <unk> tales , none the less , were not always for the young .
<name> was not young , and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair , she was never shocked .
she listened <unk> to every one ; said at the end , 'how interesting ! '
or 'how shocking ! '
as the case might be , and never again referred to it , for she prided herself on a trained mind , which 'did not dwell on these things . '
she was , too , a treasure at domestic accounts , for which the village tradesmen , with their weekly books , loved her not .
otherwise she had no enemies ; provoked no jealousy even among the plainest ; neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to her ; she supplied the odd place at the rector 's or the doctor 's table at half an hour 's notice ; she was a sort of public aunt to very many small children of the village street , whose parents , while accepting everything , would have been swift to resent what they called <unk> ' ; she served on the village nursing committee as miss fowler 's <unk> when miss fowler was crippled by <unk> <unk> , and came out of six months ' <unk> meetings equally respected by all the <unk> .
and when fate threw miss fowler 's nephew , an unlovely orphan of eleven , on miss fowler 's hands , <name> <unk> stood to her share of the business of education as practised in private and public schools .
she checked printed <unk> , and <unk> bills of extras ; wrote to head and house masters , matrons , nurses and doctors , and grieved or rejoiced over <unk> reports .
young <unk> fowler repaid her in his holidays by calling her <unk> , ' <unk> , ' or <unk> , ' by thumping her between her narrow shoulders , or by chasing her <unk> , round the garden , her large mouth open , her large nose high in air , at a <unk> <unk> very like a camel 's .
later on he filled the house with clamour , argument , and <unk> as to his personal needs , likes and dislikes , and the limitations of 'you women , ' reducing <name> to tears of physical fatigue , or , when he chose to be humorous , of helpless laughter .
at crises , which multiplied as he grew older , she was his <unk> and his <unk> to miss fowler , who had no large sympathy with the young ; a vote in his interest at the councils on his future ; his <unk> , strictly accountable for mislaid boots and garments ; always his butt and his slave .
and when he decided to become a solicitor , and had entered an office in london ; when his greeting had changed from <unk> , <unk> , you old beast , ' to mornin ' , <unk> , ' there came a war which , unlike all wars that <name> could remember , did not stay decently outside england and in the newspapers , but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew .
as she said to miss fowler , it was 'most vexatious . '
it took the <unk> son who was going into business with his elder brother ; it took the colonel 's nephew on the <name> of <unk> in canada ; it took mrs. <name> 's son who , his mother said , was devoted to the ministry ; and , very early indeed , it took wynn fowler , who announced on a <unk> that he had joined the flying corps and wanted a <unk> waistcoat .
'he must go , and he must have the waistcoat , ' said miss fowler .
so <name> got the <unk> needles and wool , while miss fowler told the men of her establishment  two gardeners and an odd man , aged sixty  that those who could join the army had better do so .
the gardeners left .
<unk> , the odd man , stayed on , and was promoted to the gardener 's cottage .
the cook , <unk> to be limited in luxuries , also left , after a spirited scene with miss fowler , and took the housemaid with her .
miss fowler <unk> <name> , <unk> 's <unk> daughter , to the vacant post ; mrs. <unk> to the rank of cook , with occasional cleaning <unk> ; and the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly .
wynn demanded an increase in his allowance .
miss fowler , who always looked facts in the face , said , 'he must have it .
the chances are he wo n't live long to draw it , and if three hundred makes him happy  ' wynn was grateful , and came over , in his <unk> uniform , to say so .
his training centre was not thirty miles away , and his talk was so technical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of machines .
he gave <name> such a chart .
'and you 'd better study it , <unk> , ' he said .
'you 'll be seeing a lot of 'em soon . '
so <name> studied the chart , but when wynn next arrived to swell and exalt himself before his womenfolk , she failed badly in <unk> , and he <unk> her as in the old days .
'you look more or less like a human being , ' he said in his new service voice .
'you must have had a <name> at some time in your past .
what have you done with it ?
where d'you keep it ?
a sheep would know more than you do , <unk> .
you 're lamentable .
you are less use than an empty tin can , you <unk> old <unk> . '
'i suppose that 's how your superior officer talks to you ? '
said miss fowler from her chair .
'but <unk> does n't mind , ' wynn replied .
'do you , <unk> ? '
'why ?
was wynn saying anything ?
i shall get this right next time you come , ' she muttered , and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
in a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to miss fowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath .
her heart and her interest were high in the air with wynn , who had finished <unk> ( whatever that might be ) and had gone on from a <unk> ' to a machine more or less his own .
one morning it circled over their very chimneys , alighted on <unk> 's <name> , almost outside the garden gate , and wynn came in , blue with cold , shouting for food .
he and she <name> miss <unk> <unk> , as they had often done , along the <name> <unk> to look at the <unk> .
<name> observed that 'it smelt very badly . '
<unk> , i believe you think with your nose , ' said wynn .
'i know you do n't with your mind .
now , what type 's that ? '
'i 'll go and get the chart , ' said <name> .
'you 're hopeless !
you have n't the mental capacity of a white mouse , ' he cried , and explained the <unk> and the sockets for <unk> till it was time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more .
'ah ! '
said <name> , as the <unk> thing flared upward .
'wait till our flying corps gets to work !
wynn says it 's much safer than in the trenches . '
'i wonder , ' said miss fowler .
'tell <unk> to come and tow me home again . '
'it 's all downhill .
i can do it , ' said <name> , 'if you put the brake on . '
she laid her <name> self against the <unk> and home they trundled .
'now , be careful you are n't heated and catch a chill , ' said <unk> miss fowler .
'nothing makes me perspire , ' said <name> .
as she bumped the chair under the porch she straightened her long back .
the exertion had given her a colour , and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead .
miss fowler glanced at her .
'what do you ever think of , <name> ? '
she demanded suddenly .
'oh , wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockings  as thick as we can make them . '
'yes .
but i mean the things that women think about .
here you are , more than forty  ' <unk> , ' said truthful <name> .
'well ? '
'well ? '
<name> offered miss fowler her shoulder as usual .
'and you 've been with me ten years now . '
'let 's see , ' said <name> .
<unk> was eleven when he came .
he 's twenty now , and i came two years before that .
it must be eleven . '
<unk> !
and you 've never told me anything that matters in all that while .
looking back , it seems to me that i 've done all the talking . '
'i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a <unk> .
as wynn says , i haven't the mind .
let me take your hat . '
miss fowler , moving stiffly from the hip , stamped her <unk> stick on the tiled hall floor .
<unk> , are n't you anything except a companion ?
would you ever have been anything except a companion ? '
<name> <name> up the garden hat on its proper <name> .
'no , ' she said after consideration .
'i do n't imagine i ever should .
but i 've no imagination , i 'm afraid . '
she fetched miss fowler her <unk> glass of <unk> .
that was the wet december when it rained six inches to the month , and the women went abroad as little as might be .
wynn 's flying chariot visited them several times , and for two mornings ( he had warned her by <unk> ) <name> heard the <unk> of his propellers at <name> .
the second time she ran to the window , and stared at the <unk> sky .
a little blur passed overhead .
she lifted her <name> arms towards it .
that evening at six o'clock there came an announcement in an official envelope that second lieutenant w. fowler had been killed during a trial flight .
death was instantaneous .
she read it and carried it to miss fowler .
'i never expected anything else , ' said miss fowler ; 'but i 'm sorry it happened before he had done anything . '
the room was whirling round <name> <unk> , but she found herself quite steady in the midst of it .
'yes , ' she said .
'it 's a great pity he did n't die in action after he had killed somebody . '
'he was killed instantly .
that 's one comfort , ' miss fowler went on .
'but wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at once  whatever happens to the tanks , ' quoted <name> .
the room was coming to rest now .
she heard miss fowler say impatiently , 'but why ca n't we cry , <name> ? '
and herself replying , 'there 's nothing to cry for .
he has done his duty as much as mrs. <name> 's son did . '
'and when he died , she came and cried all the morning , ' said miss fowler .
'this only makes me feel tired  terribly tired .
<name> you help me to bed , please , <name> ?  and i think i 'd like the <unk> bottle . '
so <name> helped her and sat beside , talking of wynn in his riotous youth .
'i believe , ' said miss fowler suddenly , 'that old people and young people slip from under a stroke like this .
the middle-aged feel it most . '
'i expect that 's true , ' said <name> , rising .
'i 'm going to put away the things in his room now .
shall we wear mourning ? '
'certainly not , ' said miss fowler .
<unk> , of course , at the funeral .
i ca n't go .
you <name> .
i want you to arrange about his being buried here .
what a blessing it did n't happen at salisbury ! '
every one , from the authorities of the flying corps to the rector , was most kind and sympathetic .
<name> found herself for the moment in a world where bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of conveyances to all sorts of places .
and at the funeral two young men in <unk> uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards .
'you 're miss <unk> , are n't you ? '
said one .
<unk> told me about you .
he was a good chap  a first-class fellow  a great loss . '
'great loss ! '
growled his companion .
'we 're all awfully sorry . '
'how high did he fall from ? '
<name> whispered .
<unk> nearly four thousand feet , i should think , did n't he ?
you were up that day , monkey ? '
'all of that , ' the other child replied .
'my bar made three thousand , and i was n't as high as him by a lot . '
'then that's all right , ' said <name> .
'thank you very much . '
they moved away as mrs. <name> flung herself weeping on <name> 's flat chest , under the <unk> , and cried , '_i know how it feels !
i know how it feels ! '
'but both his parents are dead , ' <name> returned , as she <unk> her off .
'perhaps they 've all met by now , ' she added vaguely as she escaped towards the coach .
'i 've thought of that too , ' wailed mrs. <name> ; 'but then he 'll be practically a stranger to them .
quite embarrassing ! '
<name> faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to miss fowler , who , when she described mrs. <name> 's outburst , laughed aloud .
'oh , how wynn would have enjoyed it !
he was always utterly unreliable at funerals .
d'you remember  ' and they talked of him again , each <unk> out the other 's gaps .
'and now , ' said miss fowler , 'we 'll pull up the blinds and we 'll have a general tidy .
that always does us good .
have you seen to wynn 's things ? '
<unk>  since he first came , ' said <name> .
'he was never destructive  even with his toys . '
they faced that neat room .
'it ca n't be natural not to cry , ' <name> said at last .
'i 'm so afraid you 'll have a reaction . '
'as i told you , we old people slip from under the stroke .
it 's you i'm afraid for .
have you cried yet ? '
'i ca n't .
it only makes me angry with the germans . '
'that 's sheer waste of vitality , ' said miss fowler .
'we must live till the war 's finished . '
she opened a full wardrobe .
'now , i 've been thinking things over .
this is my plan .
all his civilian clothes can be given away  belgian refugees , and so on . '
<name> nodded .
<unk> , collars , and gloves ? '
'yes .
we do n't need to keep anything except his cap and belt . '
'they came back yesterday with his flying corps clothes '  <name> pointed to a roll on the little iron bed .
'ah , but keep his service things .
some one may be glad of them later .
do you remember his sizes ? '
'five feet eight and a half ; thirty-six inches round the chest .
but he told me he 's just put on an inch and a half .
i 'll <name> it on a label and tie it on his <unk> . '
'so that disposes of that , ' said miss fowler , tapping the palm of one hand with the ringed third finger of the other .
'what waste it all is !
we 'll get his old school trunk to-morrow and pack his civilian clothes . '
'and the rest ? '
said <name> .
'his books and pictures and the games and the toys  and  and the rest ? '
'my plan is to burn every single thing , ' said miss fowler .
'then we shall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards .
what do you think ? '
'i think that would be much the best , ' said <name> .
'but there 's such a lot of them . '
'we 'll burn them in the <unk> , ' said miss fowler .
this was an <unk> furnace for the consumption of refuse ; a little circular <unk> tower of pierced brick over an iron grating .
miss fowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago , and had had it built at the bottom of the garden .
it suited her tidy soul , for it saved unsightly <unk> , and the ashes lightened the stiff <name> soil .
<name> considered for a moment , saw her way clear , and nodded again .
they spent the evening putting away well-remembered civilian suits , <unk> that <name> had marked , and the regiments of very gaudy socks and ties .
a second trunk was needed , and , after that , a little packing-case , and it was late next day when <unk> and the local carrier lifted them to the cart .
the rector luckily knew of a friend 's son , about five feet eight and a half inches high , to whom a complete flying corps outfit would be most acceptable , and sent his gardener 's son down with a barrow to take delivery of it .
the cap was <name> up in miss fowler 's bedroom , the belt in miss <unk> 's ; for , as miss fowler said , they had no <name> to make <unk> talk of them .
'that disposes of that , ' said miss fowler .
'i 'll leave the rest to you , <name> .
i ca n't run up and down the garden .
you 'd better take the big <unk> and get <name> to help you . '
'i shall take the <unk> and do it myself , ' said <name> , and for once in her life closed her mouth .
miss fowler , in moments of irritation , had called <name> deadly methodical .
she put on her oldest waterproof and <unk> and her <unk> <unk> , for the weather was on the edge of more rain .
she gathered <unk> from the kitchen , a <unk> of coals , and a <unk> of brushwood .
these she wheeled in the barrow down the <unk> paths to the dank little <name> shrubbery where the <unk> stood under the drip of three oaks .
she climbed the wire fence into the rector 's <unk> just behind , and from his tenant 's <name> pulled two large <unk> of good hay , which she spread neatly on the <unk> .
next , journey by journey , passing miss fowler 's white face at the <unk> window each time , she brought down in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> and used <unk> , <unk> , levers , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , unrelated piles of the motor <unk> , the light car , and <unk> of <name> exhibitions ; the remnants of a fleet of <unk> from <unk> <unk> to a <unk> yacht ; a <unk> dressing-gown ; bats from <unk> to twenty-four shillings ; cricket and tennis balls ; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their twisted rails ; a grey and red tin model of a submarine ; a dumb <unk> and cracked records ; <unk> that had to be broken across the knee , like his <unk> , and an <unk> ; photographs of private and public school cricket and football <unk> , and his <unk> .
on the line of march ; <unk> , and <unk> ; some <unk> , and one real silver cup , for boxing <unk> and <name> <unk> ; sheaves of school photographs ; miss fowler 's photograph ; her own which he had borne off in fun and ( good care she took not to ask ! )
had never returned ; a <unk> with a secret drawer ; a load of <unk> , belts , and <unk> , and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic ; a packet of all the letters that miss fowler and she had ever written to him , kept for some absurd reason through all these years ; a <unk> attempt at a diary ; framed pictures of racing motors in full <unk> career , and load upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of <unk> , <unk> , electric batteries , tin soldiers , <unk> outfits , and <unk> puzzles .
miss fowler at the window watched her come and go , and said to herself , <unk> 's an old woman .
i never realised it before . '
after lunch she recommended her to rest .
'i 'm not in the least tired , ' said <name> .
'i 've got it all arranged .
i'm going to the village at two o'clock for some paraffin .
<name> hasn't enough , and the walk <name> do me good . '
she made one last quest round the house before she started , and found that she had overlooked nothing .
it began to mist as soon as she had skirted <unk> 's <name> , where wynn used to descend  it seemed to her that she could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead , but there was nothing to see .
she hoisted her umbrella and <unk> into the blind wet till she had reached the shelter of the empty village .
as she came out of mr. kidd 's shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string <unk> , she met nurse <name> , the village nurse , and fell into talk with her , as usual , about the village children .
they were just parting opposite the <unk> oak , ' when a gun , they fancied , was fired immediately behind the house .
it was followed by a child 's shriek dying into a wail .
<unk> ! '
said nurse <name> promptly , and dashed through the empty bar , followed by <name> .
they found mrs. <unk> , the publican 's wife , who could only gasp and point to the yard , where a little <unk> was sliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles .
nurse <name> snatched up a sheet drying before the fire , ran out , lifted something from the ground , and flung the sheet round it .
the sheet turned <name> and half her uniform too , as she bore the load into the kitchen .
it was little <name> <unk> , aged nine , whom <name> had known since her <unk> days .
'am i hurted bad ? '
<name> asked , and died between nurse <name> 's dripping hands .
the sheet fell aside and for an instant , before she could shut her eyes , <name> saw the ripped and <unk> body .
'it 's a wonder she spoke at all , ' said nurse <name> .
'what in god 's name was it ? '
'a bomb , ' said <name> .
'one o ' the <unk> ? '
'no .
an <unk> .
i thought i heard it on the <name> , but i fancied it was one of ours .
it must have shut off its engines as it came down .
that 's why we did n't notice it . '
'the filthy pigs ! '
said nurse <name> , all white and shaken .
'see the pickle i 'm in !
go and tell dr. <unk> , miss <unk> . '
nurse looked at the mother , who had dropped face down on the floor .
'she 's only in a fit .
turn her over . '
<name> heaved mrs. <unk> right side up , and hurried off for the doctor .
when she told her tale , he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he got her something .
'but i do n't need it , i assure you , ' said she .
'i do n't think it would be wise to tell miss fowler about it , do you ?
her heart is so irritable in this weather . '
dr. <unk> looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag .
'no .
do n't tell anybody till we 're sure , ' he said , and hastened to the <unk> oak , ' while <name> went on with the paraffin .
the village behind her was as quiet as usual , for the news had not yet spread .
she frowned a little to herself , her large nostrils expanded <unk> , and from time to time she muttered a phrase which wynn , who never restrained himself before his womenfolk , had applied to the enemy .
<unk> pagans !
they are bloody pagans .
but , ' she continued , falling back on the teaching that had made her what she was , 'one must n't let one 's mind dwell on these things . '
before she reached the house dr. <unk> , who was also a special constable , overtook her in his car .
'oh , miss <unk> , ' he said , 'i wanted to tell you that that accident at the " <name> oak " was due to <unk> 's stable tumbling down .
it 's been dangerous for a long time .
it ought to have been condemned . '
'i thought i heard an explosion too , ' said <name> .
'you might have been misled by the beams snapping .
i 've been looking at 'em .
they were <unk> through and through .
of course , as they broke , they would make a noise just like a gun . '
'yes ? '
said <name> politely .
'poor little <name> was playing underneath it , ' he went on , still holding her with his eyes , 'and that and the tiles cut her to pieces , you see ? '
'i saw it , ' said <name> , shaking her head .
'i heard it too . '
'well , we can not be sure . '
dr. <unk> changed his tone completely .
'i know both you and nurse <name> ( i 've been speaking to her ) are perfectly trustworthy , and i can rely on you not to say anything  yet at least .
it is no good to stir up people unless  ' 'oh , i never do  anyhow , ' said <name> , and dr. <unk> went on to the county town .
after all , she told herself , it might , just possibly , have been the collapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little <name> .
she was sorry she had even hinted at other things , but nurse <name> was discretion itself .
by the time she reached home the affair seemed increasingly remote by its very monstrosity .
as she came in , miss fowler told her that a couple of <unk> had passed half an hour ago .
'i thought i heard them , ' she replied , 'i 'm going down to the garden now .
i 've got the paraffin . '
'yes , but  what have you got on your boots ?
they 're soaking wet .
change them at once . '
not only did <name> obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper , and put them into the string bag with the bottle .
so , armed with the longest kitchen poker , she left .
'it 's raining again , ' was miss fowler 's last word , 'but  i know you wo n't be happy till that 's disposed of . '
'it wo n't take long .
i 've got everything down there , and i 've put the lid on the <unk> to keep the wet out . '
the shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed her arrangements and sprinkled the <unk> oil .
as she lit the match that would burn her heart to ashes , she heard a groan or a grunt behind the dense portugal laurels .
<unk> ? '
she called impatiently , but <unk> , with his ancient <unk> , in his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the sanctuary .
<unk> , ' she concluded , and threw in the <unk> .
the pyre went up in a roar , and the immediate flame hastened night around her .
'how wynn would have loved this ! '
she thought , stepping back from the blaze .
by its light she saw , half hidden behind a <name> not five paces away , a bareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks .
a broken branch lay across his lap  one booted leg protruding from beneath it .
his head moved ceaselessly from side to side , but his body was as still as the tree 's trunk .
he was dressed  she moved sideways to look more closely  in a uniform something like wynn 's , with a flap buttoned across the chest .
for an instant , she had some idea that it might be one of the young flying men she had met at the funeral .
but their heads were dark and glossy .
this man 's was as pale as a baby 's , and so closely cropped that she could see the disgusting <unk> skin beneath .
his lips moved .
'what do you say ? '
<name> moved towards him and stooped .
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> ! '
he muttered , while his hands picked at the dead wet leaves .
there was no doubt as to his nationality .
it made her so angry that she strode back to the <unk> , though it was still too hot to use the poker there .
wynn 's books seemed to be catching well .
she looked up at the oak behind the man ; several of the light upper and two or three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on the shrubbery path .
on the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings , showed like a <unk> in the light of a <unk> flame .
evidently this person had fallen through the tree .
wynn had told her that it was quite possible for people to fall out of <unk> .
wynn told her too , that trees were useful things to break an aviator 's fall , but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have moved from his queer position .
he seemed helpless except for his horrible rolling head .
on the other hand , she could see a pistol case at his belt  and <name> loathed pistols .
months ago , after reading certain belgian reports together , she and miss fowler had had dealings with one  a huge revolver with <unk> bullets , which latter , wynn said , were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised enemies .
'they 're good enough for us , ' miss fowler had replied .
<unk> <name> how it works . '
and wynn , laughing at the mere possibility of any such need , had led the craven winking <name> into the rector 's disused quarry , and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine .
it lay now in the <unk> drawer of her <unk>  a memento not included in the burning .
wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid .
she slipped up to the house to get it .
when she came through the rain , the eyes in the head were alive with expectation .
the mouth even tried to smile .
but at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like <name> <unk> 's .
a tear trickled from one eye , and the head rolled from shoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something .
<unk> .
tout <unk> , ' it whimpered .
'what do you say ? '
said <name> <unk> , keeping well to one side , though only the head moved .
<unk> , ' it repeated .
<unk> me <unk> .
<name> <unk> !
<unk> ! '
<unk> ! '
said she , bringing all her small <name> to bear with the big pistol .
<unk> haben der <unk> kinder <unk> . '
the head was still .
<name> 's hand dropped .
she had been careful to keep her finger off the trigger for fear of accidents .
after a few <unk> waiting , she returned to the <unk> , where the flames were falling , and <unk> up wynn 's <unk> books with the poker .
again the head groaned for the doctor .
'stop that ! '
said <name> , and stamped her foot .
'stop that , you bloody pagan ! '
the words came quite smoothly and naturally .
they were wynn 's own words , and wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have torn little <name> into those vividly coloured strips and strings .
but this thing <unk> under the <unk> had done that thing .
it was no question of reading horrors out of newspapers to miss fowler .
<name> had seen it with her own eyes on the <unk> oak ' kitchen table .
she must not allow her mind to dwell upon it .
now wynn was dead , and everything connected with him was <unk> and rustling and tinkling under her busy poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash .
the thing beneath the oak would die too .
<name> had seen death more than once .
she came of a family that had a knack of dying under , as she told miss fowler , 'most distressing circumstances . '
she would stay where she was till she was entirely satisfied that it was dead  dead as dear papa in the late <unk> ; aunt <name> in <unk> ; mamma in <unk> ; cousin <name> in ninety-five ; <name> <unk> 's housemaid in <unk> ; <name> <unk> 's sister in nineteen hundred and one ; wynn buried five days ago ; and <name> <unk> still waiting for decent earth to hide her .
as she thought  her <unk> caught up by one faded canine , brows knit and nostrils wide  she wielded the poker with <unk> that <name> the grating at the bottom , and careful <unk> round the <unk> above .
she looked at her <unk> .
it was getting on to half-past four , and the rain was coming down in <name> .
tea would be at five .
if it did not die before that time , she would be soaked and would have to change .
meantime , and this occupied her , wynn 's things were burning well in spite of the hissing wet , though now and again a <unk> with a quite distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass .
the exercise of <unk> had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of her bones .
she hummed  <name> never had a voice  to herself .
she had never believed in all those advanced views  though miss fowler herself leaned a little that way  of woman 's work in the world ; but now she saw there was much to be said for them .
this , for instance , was her work  work which no man , least of all dr. <unk> , would ever have done .
a man , at such a crisis , would be what wynn called a <unk> ' ; would leave everything to fetch help , and would certainly bring it into the house .
now a woman 's business was to make a happy home for  for a husband and children .
failing these  it was not a thing one should allow one 's mind to dwell upon  but  'stop it ! '
<name> cried once more across the shadows .
<unk> , i tell you !
ich haben der <unk> kinder <unk> . '
but it was a fact .
a woman who had missed these things could still be useful  more useful than a man in certain respects .
she thumped like a <unk> through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it .
the rain was <unk> the fire , but she could feel  it was too dark to see  that her work was done .
there was a dull red glow at the bottom of the <unk> , not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half over against the driving wet .
this arranged , she leaned on the poker and waited , while an increasing rapture laid hold on her .
she ceased to think .
she gave herself up to feel .
her long pleasure was broken by a sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life .
she leaned forward and listened , smiling .
there could be no mistake .
she closed her eyes and drank it in .
once it ceased abruptly .
'go on , ' she murmured , half aloud .
'that is n't the end . '
then the end came very distinctly in a lull between two <unk> .
<name> <unk> <name> her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head to foot .
<unk> all right , ' said she contentedly , and went up to the house , where she <unk> the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot bath before tea , and came down looking , as miss fowler said when she saw her lying all relaxed on the other sofa , <unk> handsome ! '
the beginnings it was not part of their blood , it came to them very late with long arrears to make good , when the english began to hate .
they were not easily moved , they were icy willing to wait till every count should be proved , ere the english began to hate .
their voices were even and low , their eyes were level and straight .
there was neither sign nor show , when the english began to hate .
it was not preached to the crowd , it was not taught by the state .
no man spoke it aloud , when the english began to hate .
it was not suddenly bred , it <name> not swiftly abate , through the chill years ahead , when time shall count from the date that the english began to hate .

 <name> <unk> .
it came without warning , at the very hour his hand was outstretched to crumple the <unk> and <unk> combine .
the new york doctors called it overwork , and he lay in a darkened room , one ankle crossed above the other , tongue pressed into palate , wondering whether the next <unk> of prickly fires would drive his soul from all <unk> .
at last they gave judgment .
with care he might in two years return to the arena , but for the present he must go across the water and do no work whatever .
he accepted the terms .
it was <unk> ; but the combine that had shivered beneath his knife gave him all the honours of war : <unk> himself , full of <unk> , came to the steamer and filled the <unk> ' suite of cabins with overwhelming <unk> .
" <unk> , " said <name> <unk> when he saw them .
" fitz is right .
i 'm dead ; only i do n't see why he left out the 'in <unk> ' on the ribbons ! "
" nonsense ! "
his wife answered , and poured him his <unk> .
" you 'll be back before you can think . "
he looked at himself in the mirror , surprised that his face had not been branded by the hells of the past three months .
the noise of the decks worried him , and he lay down , his tongue only a little pressed against his palate .
an hour later he said : " <name> , i feel sorry about taking you away from everything like this .
i  i suppose we 're the two <unk> people on god 's earth to-night . "
said <name> his wife , and kissed him : " is n't it something to you that we 're going together ? "
they drifted about europe for months  sometimes alone , sometimes with chance met gipsies of their own land .
from the north cape to the blue grotto at <unk> they wandered , because the next steamer headed that way , or because some one had set them on the road .
the doctors had warned <name> that <unk> was not to take interest even in other men's interests ; but a familiar sensation at the back of the neck after one hour 's keen talk with a <unk> railway <unk> saved her any trouble .
he nearly wept .
" and i 'm over thirty , " he cried .
" with all i meant to do ! "
" let 's call it a honeymoon , " said <name> .
" d ' you know , in all the six years we 've been married , you 've never told me what you meant to do with your life ? "
" with my life ?
what 's the use ?
it 's finished now . "
<name> looked up quickly from the bay of naples .
" as far as my business goes , i shall have to live on my rents like that architect at san <unk> . "
" you 'll get better if you do n't worry ; and even if it <unk> time , there are worse things than  how much have you ? "
" between four and five million .
but it is n't the money .
you know it is n't .
it 's the principle .
how could you respect me ?
you never did , the first year after we married , till i went to work like the others .
our tradition and <unk> are against it .
we ca n't accept those ideals . "
" well , i suppose i married you for some sort of ideal , " she answered , and they returned to their <unk> hotel .
in england they missed the alien tongues of continental streets that reminded them of their own <unk> cities .
in england all men spoke one tongue , <unk> like american to the ear , but on <unk> unintelligible .
" ah , but you have not seen england , " said a <name> with <unk> hair .
they had met her in vienna , bayreuth , and <name> , and were grateful to find her again at <unk> 's , for she commanded situations , and knew where <unk> are most carefully made up .
" you ought to take an interest in the home of our ancestors as i do . "
" i 've tried for a week , mrs. <unk> , " said <name> , " but i never get any further than <unk> <name> waiters . "
" these men are not the true type , " mrs. shouts went on .
" i know where you should go . "
<unk> pricked up his ears , anxious to run anywhere from the streets on which quick men , something of his kidney , did the business denied to him .
" we hear and we obey , mrs. <unk> , " said <name> , feeling his unrest as he drank the loathed british tea .
mrs. <unk> smiled , and took them in hand .
she wrote widely and telegraphed far on their behalf till , armed with her letter of introduction , she drove them into that wilderness which is reached from an <unk> of a station called charing cross .
they were to go to <unk> 's  the farm of one cloke , in the southern counties  where , she assured them , they would meet the genuine england of <unk> and song .
<unk> they found after some hours , four miles from a station , and , so far as they could , judge in the <unk> darkness , twice as many from a road .
trees , kine , and the outlines of barns showed shadowy about them when they alighted , and mr. and mrs. cloke , at the open door of a deep <unk> kitchen , made them shyly welcome .
they lay in an attic beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling , and , because it rained , a wood fire was made in an iron basket on a brick hearth , and they fell asleep to the chirping of mice and the whimper of flames .
when they woke it was a fair day , full of the noises , of birds , the smell of box lavender , and fried bacon , mixed with an elemental smell they had never met before .
" this , " said <name> , nearly pushing out the thin casement in an attempt to see round the corner , " is  what did the <unk> say to the railway <name> about my trunk  <unk> on the top ? ' "
" no ; 'a little bit of all right . '
i feel farther away from anywhere than i 've ever felt in my life .
we must find out where the telegraph office is . "
" who cares ? "
said <name> , wandering about , <unk> in hand , to admire the illustrated weekly pictures pasted on door and cupboard .
but there was no rest for the alien soul till he had made sure of the telegraph office .
he asked the <unk> ' daughter , laying breakfast , while <name> plunged her face in the lavender bush outside the low window .
" go to the stile <unk> o ' the barn field , " said <name> , " and look across pardons to the next spire .
it 's directly under .
you ca n't miss it  not if you keep to the footpath .
my sister 's the <unk> there .
but you 're in the <unk> radius , sir .
the boy delivers telegrams directly to this door from pardons village . "
" one has to take a good deal on trust in this country , " he murmured .
<name> looked at the close turf , scarred only with last night 's wheels , at two ruts which wound round a <unk> , and at the circle of still orchard about the <unk> house .
" what 's the matter with it ? "
she said .
" telegrams delivered to the vale of <unk> , of course , " and she beckoned in an <unk> hound of engaging manners and no engagements , who answered , at times , to the name of <unk> .
he led them , after breakfast , to the rise behind the house where the stile stood against the <unk> , and , " i wonder what we shall find now , " said <name> , frankly prancing with <name> on the grass .
it was a slope of <unk> fields possessed to their centres by clumps of brambles .
gates were not , and the <unk> , <unk> posts leaned out and in .
a narrow path doubled among the bushes , scores of white tails twinkled before the racing hound , and a hawk rose , whistling shrilly .
" no roads , no nothing ! "
said <name> , her short skirt hooked by briers .
" i thought all england was a garden .
there 's your spire , <name> , across the valley .
how curious ! "
they walked toward it through an all abandoned land .
here they found the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die : there a harsh <unk> surrendered to <unk> thistles ; and here a breadth of rampant <unk> <unk> to be lawful crop .
in the <unk> pastures <unk> of dead stuff caught their feet , and the ground beneath glistened with sweat .
at the bottom of the valley a little <name> had undermined its <unk> , and <unk> in the wreckage .
but there stood great woods on the slopes beyond  old , tall , and brilliant , like <unk> tapestries against the walls of a ruined house .
" all this within a hundred miles of london , " he said .
" looks as if it had had nervous prostration , too . "
the footpath turned the shoulder of a slope , through a thicket of rank rhododendrons , and crossed what had once been a carriage drive , which ended in the shadow of two gigantic <unk> .
" a house ! "
said <name> , in a whisper .
" a colonial house ! "
behind the blue-green of the twin trees rose a <unk> brick georgian pile , with a <unk> <unk> over its pillared door .
the hound had gone off on his own foolish <unk> .
except for some stir it the branches and the flight of four startled magpies ; there was neither life nor sound about the square house , but it looked out of its long windows most <unk> .
" <unk> to meet you , i 'm sure , " said <name> , and <unk> to the ground .
" <name> , this is history i can understand .
we began here . "
she <unk> again .
the <name> <name> twinkled on all the lights .
it was as though an old <name> , wise in three generations ' experience , but for the present sitting out , bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild .
" i must look ! "
<name> tiptoed to a window , and shaded her eyes with her hand .
" oh , this room 's <unk> of <unk>  wool , i suppose !
but i can see a bit of the mantelpiece .
<name> , do come !
is n't that some one ? "
she fell back behind her husband .
the front door opened slowly , to show the hound , his nose white with milk , in charge of an ancient of days clad in a blue linen <unk> curiously gathered on breast and shoulders .
" certainly , " said <name> , half aloud .
" father time himself .
this is where he lives , <name> . "
" we came , " said <name> weakly .
" can we see the house ?
i 'm afraid that's our dog . "
" no , 't is <unk> , " said the old man .
" he 's been , at my <unk> again .
staying at <unk> , be ye ?
come in .
ah !
you <unk> ! "
the hound broke from him , and he tottered after him down the drive .
they entered the hall  just such a high light hall as such a house should own .
a <unk> staircase , wide and shallow and once <unk> , climbed out of it under a long oval window .
on either side delicately moulded doors gave on to <unk> rooms , whose <unk> <unk> were adorned with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in low relief .
" what 's the firm that makes these things ? "
cried <name> , <unk> .
" oh , i forgot !
these must be the originals .
adams , is it ?
i never dreamed of anything like that <unk> fender .
does he mean us to go everywhere ? "
" he 's catching the dog , " said <name> , looking out .
" we do n't count . "
they explored the first or ground floor , delighted as children playing burglars .
" this is like all england , " she said at last .
" wonderful , but no explanation .
you 're expected to know it beforehand .
now , let 's try upstairs . "
the stairs never creaked beneath their feet .
from the broad landing they entered a long , <unk> room lighted by three <unk> windows , which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden , and wooded slopes beyond .
" the drawing-room , of course . "
<name> swam up and down it .
" that mantelpiece  <unk> and eurydice  is the best of them all .
is n't it marvellous ?
why , the room seems furnished with nothing in it !
<unk> that , <name> ? "
" it 's the proportions .
i 've noticed it . "
" i saw a <unk> couch once "  <name> laid her finger to her flushed cheek and considered .
" with , two of them  one on each side  you wouldn't need anything else .
except  there must be one perfect mirror over that mantelpiece . "
" look at that view .
it 's a framed constable , " her husband cried .
" no ; it 's a <unk>  a parody of a <unk> .
but about that couch , <name> .
do n't you think empire might be better than <unk> ?
dull gold against that pale green ?
it 's a pity they do n't make <unk> nowadays . "
" i believe you can get them .
look at that oak wood behind the pines . "
" <unk> you sat and played <unk> stately , at the <unk> , " ' <name> hummed , and , head on one ; side , nodded to where the perfect mirror should <name> : then they found bedrooms with <unk> and <unk> , and steps leading up and down  boxes of rooms , round , square , and octagonal , with enriched ceilings and chased <unk> .
" now about servants .
oh ! "
she had darted up the last stairs to the chequered darkness of the top floor , where loose tiles lay among broken <unk> , and the walls were scrawled with names , sentiments , and hop records .
" they 've been keeping pigeons here , " she cried .
" and you could drive a buggy through the roof anywhere , " said <name> .
" that 's what i say , " the old man cried below them on the stairs .
" not a dry place for my pigeons at all . "
" but why was it allowed to get like this ? "
said <name> .
" tis with housen as teeth , " he replied .
" let 'em go too far , and there's nothing to be done .
time was they was minded to sell her , but none would buy .
she was too far away along from any place .
time was they 'd ha' lived here <unk> , but they took and died . "
" here ? "
<name> moved beneath the light of a hole in the roof .
" <unk>  none dies here excep ' falling off ricks and such .
in london they died . "
he plucked a lock of wool from his blue <unk> .
" they was no staple  neither the <unk> nor the <unk> .
<unk> and brittle all of 'em .
dead they be seventeen year , for i 've been here <unk> twenty-five . "
" who does all the wool belong to downstairs ? "
<name> asked .
" to the estate .
i 'll show you the back parts if ye like .
you 're from <name> , ai n't ye ?
i 've had a son there once myself . "
they followed him down the main stairway .
he paused at the turn and swept one hand toward the wall .
" plenty room , here for your coffin to come down .
seven foot and three men at each end would n't <unk> the paint .
if i die in my bed they 'll 'ave to <unk> me like a <unk> .
't is all luck , dye see ? "
he led them on and on , through a maze of back kitchens , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that melted along covered ways into a farm-house , visibly older than the main building , which again rambled out among barns , <unk> , <unk> , stalls and stables to the dead fields behind .
" somehow , " said <name> , sitting exhausted on an ancient <unk>  " somehow one would n't insult these lovely old things by filling them with hay . "
<name> looked at long stone walls <unk> reaches of <unk> <unk> ; buttresses of mixed flint and bricks ; outside stairs , stone upon arched stone ; curves of thatch where grass <unk> ; <unk> of <unk> tiles , and a huge paved yard populated by two cows and the repentant <unk> .
he had not thought of himself or of the telegraph office for two and a half hours .
" but why , " said <name> , as they went back through the crater of stricken fields ,  " why is one expected to know everything in england ?
why do they never tell ? "
" you mean about the <unk> and the <unk> ? "
he answered .
" yes  and the lawyers and the estate .
who are they ?
i wonder whether those painted floors in the green room were real oak .
do n't you like us exploring things together  better than pompeii ? "
<name> turned once more to look at the view .
" eight hundred acres go with the house  the old man told me .
five farms altogether .
<unk> is one of 'em . "
" i like mrs. cloke .
but what is the old house called ? "
<name> laughed .
" that 's one of the things you 're expected to know .
he never told me . "
the <unk> were more communicative .
that evening and thereafter for a week they gave the <unk> the official history , as one gives it to lodgers , of friars pardon the house and its five farms .
but <name> asked so many questions , and <name> was so humanly interested , that , as confidence in the strangers grew , they launched , with observed and acquired detail , into the lives and deaths and doings of the <unk> and the <unk> and their <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
it was a tale told <unk> by cloke in the barn , or his wife in the dairy , the last chapters reserved for the kitchen o ' nights by the big fire , when the two had been half the day exploring about the house , where old iggulden , of the blue <unk> , <unk> and chuckled to see them .
the motives that swayed the characters were beyond their comprehension ; the fates that shifted them were gods they had never met ; the <unk> mrs. cloke threw on act and incident were more amazing than anything in the record .
therefore the <unk> listened delightedly , and blessed mrs. <unk> .
" but why  why  why  did so-and-so do so-and-so ? "
<name> would demand from her seat by the <unk> ; and mrs. cloke would answer , smoothing her knees , " for the sake of the place . "
" i give it up , " said <name> one night in their own room .
" people don't seem to matter in this country compared to the places they live in .
the way she tells it , friars pardon was a sort of <unk> . "
" poor old thing ! "
they had been walking round the farms as usual before tea .
" no wonder they loved it .
think of the sacrifices they made for it .
<name> <unk> married the younger <unk> to keep it in the family .
the octagonal room with the moulded ceiling next to the big bedroom was hers .
now what did he tell you while he was feeding the pigs ? "
said <name> .
" about the <unk> cousins and the uncle who died in java .
they lived at burnt house  behind high pardons , where that <name> is all blocked up . "
" no ; burnt house is under high pardons wood , before you come to <name> <unk> , " <name> corrected .
" well , old man cloke said  " <name> threw open the door and called down into the kitchen , where the <unk> were covering the fire " mrs. cloke , is n't burnt house under high pardons ? "
" yes , my dear , of course , " the soft voice answered absently .
a cough .
" i beg your pardon , madam .
what was it you said ? "
" never mind .
i prefer it the other way , " <name> laughed , and <name> <unk> the missing chapter as she sat on the bed .
" here to-day an ' gone to-morrow , " said cloke warningly .
" they've paid their first month , but we 've only that mrs. <unk> 's letter for guarantee . "
" none she sent never cheated us yet .
it slipped out before i thought .
she 's a most humane young <name> .
they 'll be going away in a little .
an' you 've talked a lot too , <name> . "
" yes , but the <unk> are all dead .
no one can bring my loose talking home to me .
but why do they stay on and stay on so ? "
in due time <name> and <name> asked each other that question , and put it aside .
they argued that the climate  a <name> blend , unlike the hot and cold <unk> of their native land  suited them , as the thick stillness of the nights certainly suited <name> .
he was saved even the sight of a <unk> road , which , as presumably leading to business , wakes <name> in a man ; and the telegraph office at the village of friars pardon , where they sold picture <unk> and <unk> , was two walking miles across the fields and woods .
for all that touched his past among his fellows , or their remembrance of him , he might have been in another planet ; and <name> , whose life had been very largely spent among <unk> wives of lofty ideals , had no wish to leave this present of god .
the <unk> meals , the <unk> of deliciously empty hours to follow , the <unk> of soft sky under which they walked together and reckoned time only by their hunger or thirst ; the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the miles ; their discoveries , always together , amid the farms  <unk> , <unk> , burnt house , <name> <unk> , and the home farm , where iggulden of the blue <unk> would <unk> them , and they would ransack the old house once more ; the long wet afternoons when , they tucked up their feet on the bedroom 's deep window-sill over against the <unk> , and talked together as never till then had they found time to talk  these things contented her soul , and her body throve .
" have you realized , " she asked one morning , " that we 've been here absolutely alone for the last thirty-four days ? "
" have you counted them ? "
he asked .
" did you like them ? "
she replied .
" i must have .
i did n't think about them .
yes , i have .
six months ago i should have fretted myself sick .
remember at cairo ?
i 've only had two or three bad times .
am i getting better , or is it <unk> decay ? "
" climate , all climate . "
<name> swung her <unk> english boots , as she sat on the stile overlooking friars pardon , behind the <unk> barn .
" one must take hold of things though , " he said , " if it 's only to keep one 's hand in . "
his eyes did not flicker now as they swept the empty fields .
" must n't one ? "
" lay out a <unk> links over <name> <unk> .
i dare say you could hire it . "
" no , i 'm not as english as that  nor as <unk> .
cloke says all the farms here could be made to pay . "
" well , i 'm <name> in the <unk> of franchard . '
i 'm content to be alive and purr .
there 's no hurry . "
" no . "
he smiled .
" all the same , i 'm going to see after my mail . "
" you promised you would n't have any . "
" there 's some business coming through that 's amusing me .
honest .
it does n't get on my nerves at all . "
" want a secretary ? "
" no , thanks , old thing !
is n't that quite english ? "
" too english !
go away . "
but none the less in broad daylight she returned the kiss .
" i 'm off to pardons .
i have n't been to the house for nearly a week . "
" how 've you decided to furnish <name> <unk> 's bedroom ? "
he laughed , for it had come to be a permanent castle in spain between them .
" black chinese furniture and yellow silk <unk> , " she answered , and ran downhill .
she scattered a few cows at a gap with a flourish of a <unk> that iggulden had cut for her a week ago , and singing as she passed under the <unk> , sought the farm-house at the back of friars pardon .
the old man was not to be found , and she knocked at his <unk> door , for she needed him to fill her idle forenoon .
a blue-eyed <unk> , a new friend , and <unk> 's old enemy , crawled out and besought her to enter .
iggulden sat in his chair by the fire , a <unk> between his knees , his head drooped .
though she had never seen death before , her heart , that missed a beat , told her that he was dead .
she did not speak or cry , but stood outside the door , and the dog licked her hand .
when he threw up his nose , she heard herself saying : " do n't howl !
please do n't begin to howl , <name> , or i shall run away ! "
she held her ground while the shadows in the <unk> moved toward noon ; sat after a while on the steps by the door , her arms round the <unk> neck , waiting till some one should come .
she watched the <unk> chimneys of friars pardon slash its roofs with shadow , and the smoke of iggulden 's last lighted fire gradually thin and cease .
against her <name> she fell to wondering how many <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> had been swung round the turn of the broad mall stairs .
then she remembered the old man 's talk of being " <unk> like a <unk> , " and buried her face on <name> 's neck .
at last a horse 's feet <unk> upon flags , rustled in the old grey straw of the <unk> , and she found herself facing the vicar  a figure she had seen at church <unk> impossibilities ( <name> was a <unk> ) in an unnatural voice .
" he 's dead , " she said , without preface .
" old iggulden ?
i was coming for a talk with him . "
the vicar passed in uncovered .
" ah ! "
she heard him say .
" <unk> !
how long have you been here ? "
" since a quarter to eleven . "
she looked at her watch earnestly and saw that her hand did not shake .
" i 'll sit with him now till the doctor comes .
d'you think you could tell him , and  yes , mrs. <unk> in the cottage with the <unk> next the blacksmith 's ?
i 'm afraid this has been rather a shock to you . "
<name> nodded , and fled toward the village .
her body failed her for a moment ; she dropped beneath a hedge , and looked back at the great house .
in some fashion its silence and <unk> steadied her for her errand .
mrs. <unk> , small , <unk> , and dark , was almost as unconcerned as friars pardon .
" yiss , yiss , of course .
dear me !
well , iggulden he had had his day in my father 's time .
<name> , get me my little blue bag , please .
yiss , ma'am .
they come down like <unk> in still weather .
no warnin ' at all .
<name> , my bicycle 's be'ind the <unk> .
i 'll tell dr. <name> , ma'am . "
she trundled off on her wheel like a brown <name> , while <name>  heaven above and earth beneath changed  walked stiffly home , to fall over <name> at his letters , in a muddle of laughter and tears .
" it 's all quite natural for them , " she gasped .
" they come down like <unk> in still weather .
yiss , ma'am . '
no , there was n't anything in the least horrible , only  only  oh , <name> , that poor shiny stick of his between his poor , thin knees !
i could n't have borne it if <name> had howled .
i did n't know the vicar was so  so sensitive .
he said he was afraid it was <unk>  rather a shock .
mrs. <unk> told me to go home , and i wanted to collapse on her floor .
but i did n't disgrace myself .
i  i could n't have left him  could i ? "
" you 're sure you 've took no 'arm ? "
cried mrs. cloke , who had heard the news by <unk> , which is older but swifter than <unk> 's .
" no .
i 'm perfectly well , " <name> protested .
" you lay down till tea-time . "
mrs. cloke patted her shoulder .
" they'll be very pleased , though she 'as 'ad no proper <unk> ' for twenty years . "
" they " came before twilight  a <unk> man in <unk> , and a little <unk> old woman , who <unk> like a wren .
" i 'm his son , " said the man to <name> , among the lavender bushes .
" we 'ad a difference  twenty year back , and did n't speak since .
but i 'm his son all the <unk> , and we thank you for the watching . "
" i 'm only glad i happened to be there , " she answered , and from the bottom of her heart she meant it .
" we heard he spoke a lot o ' you  one time an ' another since you came .
we thank you kindly , " the man added .
" are you the son that was in <name> ? "
she asked .
" yes , ma'am .
on my uncle 's farm , in connecticut .
he was what they call <unk> there . "
" whereabouts in connecticut ? "
asked <name> over her shoulder .
" <unk> holler was the name .
i was there six year with my uncle . "
" how small the world is ! "
<name> cried .
" why , all my mother 's people come from <unk> hollow .
there must be some there still  the <unk> .
did you ever hear of them ? "
" i remember hearing that name , seems to me , " he answered , but his face was blank as the back of a spade .
a little before dusk a woman in grey , striding like a <unk> , and bearing on her arm a long pole , crashed through the orchard calling for food .
<name> , upon whom the <unk> english worked mysteriously , fled to the parlour ; but mrs. cloke came forward beaming .
<name> could not escape .
" we 've only just heard of it ; " said the stranger , turning on her .
" i've been out with the <unk> all day .
it was a splendidly <unk> thing  " " did you  er  kill ? "
said <name> .
she knew from books she could not go far wrong here .
" yes , a dry bitch  seventeen pounds , " was the answer .
" a splendidly <unk> ' thing of you to do .
poor old iggulden  " " oh  that ! "
said <name> , enlightened .
" if there had been any people at pardons it would never have happened .
he 'd have been looked after .
but what can you expect from a parcel of london <unk> ? "
mrs. cloke murmured something .
" no .
i 'm soaked from the knees down .
if i <name> about i shall get chilled .
a cup of tea , mrs. cloke , and i can eat one of your sandwiches as i go . "
she wiped her <unk> face with a green and yellow silk handkerchief .
" yes , my <name> ! "
mrs. cloke ran and returned swiftly .
" our land marches with pardons for a mile on the south , " she explained , waving the full cup , " but one has quite enough to do with one 's own people without <unk> ' .
still , if i 'd known , i 'd have sent <name> , of course .
have you seen her this afternoon , mrs. cloke ?
no ?
i wonder whether that girl did sprain her ankle .
thank you . "
it was a formidable hunk of bread and bacon that mrs. cloke presented .
" as i was sayin ' , pardons is a scandal !
<unk> ' people die like dogs .
there ought to be people there who do their duty .
you 've done yours , though there wasn't the faintest call upon you .
good night .
tell <name> , if she comes , i've gone on . "
she strode away , munching her crust , and <name> reeled breathless into the parlour , to shake the shaking <name> .
" why did you keep catching my eye behind the blind ?
why did n't you come out and do your duty ? "
" because i should have burst .
did you see the mud on its cheek ? "
he said .
" once .
i dare n't look again .
who is she ? "
" god  a local deity then .
anyway , she 's another of the things you're expected to know by instinct . "
mrs. cloke , shocked at their levity , told them that it was <name> conant , wife of sir <name> conant , <unk> , a large landholder in the neighbourhood ; and if not god ; at least his visible providence .
<name> made her talk of that family for an hour .
" laughter , " said <name> afterward in their own room , " is the <name> of the savage .
why could n't you control your emotions ?
it 's all real to her . "
" it 's all real to me .
that 's my trouble , " he answered in an altered tone .
" anyway , it 's real enough to <name> time with .
do n't you think so ? "
" what d'you mean ? "
she asked quickly , though she knew his voice .
" that i 'm better .
i 'm well enough to kick . "
" what at ? "
" this ! "
he waved his hand round the one room .
" i must have something to play with till i 'm fit for work again . "
" ah ! "
she sat on the bed and leaned forward , her hands clasped .
" i wonder if it 's good for you . "
" we 've been better here than anywhere , " he went on slowly .
" one could always sell it again . "
she nodded gravely , but her eyes sparkled .
" the only thing that worries me is what happened this morning .
i want to know how you feel about it .
if it 's on your nerves in the least we can have the old farm at the back of the house pulled down , or perhaps it has spoiled the notion for you ? "
" pull it down ? "
she cried .
" you 've no business faculty .
why , that's where we could live while we 're putting the big house in order .
it's almost under the same roof .
no !
what happened this morning seemed to be more of a  of a leading than anything else .
there ought to be people at pardons .
<name> conant 's quite right . "
" i was thinking more of the woods and the roads .
i could double the value of the place in six months . "
" what do they want for it ? "
she shook her head , and her loosened hair fell <unk> about her cheeks .
" seventy-five thousand dollars .
they 'll take sixty-eight . "
" less than half what we paid for our old yacht when we married .
and we did n't have a good time in her .
you were  " " well , i discovered i was too much of an american to be content to be a <name> man 's son .
you are n't blaming me for that ? "
" oh , no .
only it was a very businesslike honeymoon .
how far are you along with the deal , <name> ? "
" i can mail the deposit on the purchase money to-morrow morning , and we can have the thing completed in a fortnight or three weeks  if you say so . "
" friars pardon  friars pardon ! "
<name> chanted rapturously , her dark gray eyes big with delight .
" all the farms ?
<name> <unk> , burnt house , <unk> , the home farm , and <unk> ?
sure you 've got 'em all ? "
" sure . "
he smiled .
" and the woods ?
high pardons wood , lower pardons , <unk> , <unk> shaw , <name> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and both the oak <unk> ?
sure you 've got 'em all ? "
" every last stick .
why , you know them as well as i do . "
he laughed .
" they say there 's five thousand  a thousand pounds ' worth of lumber  timber they call it  in the <unk> alone . "
" mrs. cloke 's oven must be mended first thing , and the kitchen roof .
i think i 'll have all this whitewashed , " <name> broke in , pointing to the ceiling .
" the whole place is a scandal .
<name> conant is quite right .
<name> , when did you begin to fall in love with the house ?
in the <unk> that first day ?
i did . "
" i 'm not in love with it .
one must do something to <name> time till one's fit for work . "
" or when we stood under the oaks , and the door opened ?
oh !
ought i to go to poor iggulden 's funeral ? "
she sighed with utter happiness .
" would n't they call it a <name> now ? "
said he .
" but i liked him . "
" but you did n't own him at the date of his death . "
" that would n't keep me away .
only , they made such a fuss about the watching "  she caught her breath  " it might be ostentatious from that point of view , too .
oh , <name> "  she reached for his hand  " we 're two little orphans moving in worlds not realized , and we shall make some bad breaks .
but we 're going to have the time of our lives . "
" we 'll run up to london to-morrow , and see if we can hurry those english law <unk> .
i want to get to work . "
they went .
they suffered many things ere they returned across the fields in a fly one saturday night , nursing a two by <unk> box of deeds and maps  lawful owners of friars pardon and the five decayed farms therewith .
" i do most sincerely 'ope and trust you 'll be 'appy , madam , " mrs. cloke gasped , when she was told the news by the kitchen fire .
" goodness !
it is n't a marriage ! "
<name> exclaimed , a little awed ; for to them the joke , which to an american means work , was only just beginning .
" if it 's took in a proper spirit "  mrs. cloke 's eye turned toward her oven .
" send and have that mended to-morrow , " <name> whispered .
" we could n't 'elp noticing , " said cloke slowly , " from the times you walked there , that you an ' your <name> was drawn to it , but  but i don't know as we ever precisely thought  " his wife 's glance checked him .
" that we were that sort of people , " said <name> .
" we are n't sure of it ourselves yet . "
" perhaps , " said cloke , rubbing his knees , " just for the sake of saying something , perhaps you 'll park it ? "
" what 's that ? "
said <name> .
" turn it all into a fine park like <name> hill "  he jerked a thumb to westward  " that mr. <unk> bought .
it was four farms , and mr. <unk> made a fine park of them , with a herd of <unk> deer . "
" then it would n't be friars pardon , " said <name> .
" would it ? "
" i do n't know as i 've ever heard pardons was ever anything but wheat an' wool .
only some gentlemen say that parks are less trouble than tenants . "
he laughed nervously .
" but the gentry , o ' course , they keep on pretty much as they was used to . "
" i see , " said <name> .
" how did mr. <unk> make his money ? "
" i never rightly heard .
it was pepper an ' spices , or it may <name> ' been gloves .
no .
gloves was sir <name> <unk> at marley end .
spices was mr. <unk> .
he 's a brazilian gentleman  very <unk> like . "
" be sure o ' one thing .
you wo n't 'ave any trouble , " said mrs. cloke , just before they went to bed .
now the news of the purchase was told to mr. and mrs. cloke alone at 8 p.m. of a saturday .
none left the farm till they set out for church next morning .
yet when they reached the church and were about to slip aside into their usual seats , a little beyond the font , where they could see the <unk> tails of the <unk> <unk> and twist at ringing time , they were swept forward irresistibly , a cloke on either flank ( and yet they had not walked with the <unk> ) , upon the <unk> bosom of a <unk> <unk> , who ushered them into a room of a pew at the head of the left aisle , under the pulpit .
" this , " he sighed reproachfully , " is the pardons ' pew , " and shut them in .
they could see little more than the choir boys in the chancel , but to the roots of the hair of their necks they felt the congregation behind mercilessly devouring them by look .
" when the wicked man <unk> away . "
the strong , alien voice of the priest vibrated under the <unk> roof , and a loneliness <unk> before swamped their hearts , as they searched for places in the unfamiliar church of england service .
the lord 's prayer " our father , which <name> "  set the seal on that desolation .
<name> found herself thinking how in other lands their purchase would long ere this have been discussed from every point of view in a dozen prints , forgetting that <name> for months had not been allowed to glance at those black and bellowing <unk> .
here was nothing but silence  not even hostility !
the game was up to them ; the other players hid their cards and waited .
suspense , she felt , was in the air , and when her sight cleared , saw , indeed , a <unk> tablet of a <unk> bird brooding upon the <unk> motto , " <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . "
at the litany <name> had trouble with an unstable <unk> , and <name> the slip of carpet under the <unk> .
<name> pushed her end back also , and shut her eyes against a burning that felt like tears .
when she opened them she was looking at her mother 's maiden name , fairly carved on a blue <unk> on the pew floor : <name> <unk> .
ob .
<unk> <unk> 27 .
she nudged <name> and pointed .
sheltered , as they kneeled , they looked for more knowledge , but the rest of the slab was blank .
" ever hear of her ? "
he whispered .
" never knew any of us came from here . "
" coincidence ? "
" perhaps .
but it makes me feel better , " and she smiled and winked away a tear on her lashes , and took his hand while they prayed for " all women labouring of child "  not " in the perils of <unk> " ; and the sparrows who had found their way through the guards behind the glass windows <unk> above the faded gilt and <unk> family tree of the <unk> .
the <unk> 's pew was on the right of the aisle .
after service its inhabitants moved forth without haste , but so as to block effectively a dusky person with a large family who <unk> in their rear .
" spices , i think , " said <name> , deeply delighted as the <unk> closed up after the <unk> .
" let 'em get away , <name> . "
but when they came out many folk whose eyes were one still lingered by the <unk> .
" i want to see if any more <unk> are buried here , " said <name> .
" not now .
this seems to be show day .
come home quickly , " he replied .
a group of families , the <unk> a little apart , opened to let them through .
the men saluted with <unk> nods , the women with remnants of a curtsey .
only iggulden 's son , his mother on his arm , lifted his hat as <name> passed .
" your people , " said the clear voice of <name> conant in her ear .
" i suppose so , " said <name> , blushing , for they were within two yards of her ; but it was not a question .
" then that child looks as if it were coming down with mumps .
you ought to tell the mother she should n't have brought it to church . "
" i ca n't leave 'er behind , my <name> , " the woman said .
" she 'd set the 'ouse afire in a minute , she 's that forward with the matches .
ai n't you , <name> dear ? "
" has dr. <name> seen her ? "
" not yet , my <name> . "
" he must .
you ca n't get away , of course .
<unk> !
my idiotic maid is coming in for her teeth to-morrow at twelve .
she shall pick her up  at <name> <unk> , is n't it ?  at eleven . "
" yes .
thank you very much , my <name> . "
" i ought n't to have done it , " said <name> conant apologetically , " but there has been no one at pardons for so long that you 'll forgive my <unk> .
now , ca n't you lunch with us ?
the vicar usually comes too .
i do n't use the horses on a <name> "  she glanced at the <unk> <unk> chariot .
" it 's only a mile across the fields . "
" you  you 're very kind , " said <name> , hating herself because her lip trembled .
" my dear , " the compelling tone dropped to a soothing <unk> , " d'you suppose i do n't know how it feels to come to a strange county  country i should say  away from one 's own people ?
when i first left the <unk>  i 'm shropshire , you know  i cried for a day and a night .
but fretting does n't make loneliness any better .
oh , here 's <name> .
she did sprain her leg that day . "
" i 'm as lame as a tree still , " said the tall maiden frankly .
" you ought to go out with the <unk> , mrs. <unk> .
i believe they 're drawing your water next week . "
sir <name> had already led off <name> , and the vicar came up on the other side of <name> .
there was no escaping the swift procession or the leisurely lunch , where talk came and went in <unk> eddies that had the village for their centre .
<name> heard the vicar and sir <name> address her husband lightly as <unk> !
( she also remembered many women known in a previous life who habitually addressed their husbands as mr .
<unk> . )
after lunch <name> conant talked to her <unk> of <unk> as that is achieved in cottages and farm-houses remote from aid , and of the duty thereto of the mistress of pardons .
a gate in a beech hedge , reached across triple lawns , let them out before tea-time into the unkempt south side of their land .
" i want your hand , please , " said <name> as soon as they were safe among the beech <unk> and the lawless <unk> .
" d'you remember the old maid in <unk> and the guitar ' who heard the <unk> swear , and hardly reckoned herself a maiden <name> afterward ?
because i 'm a relative of hers .
<name> conant is  " " did you find out anything about the <unk> ? "
he interrupted .
" i did n't ask .
i 'm going to write to aunt <name> about it first .
oh , <name> conant said something at lunch about their having bought some land from some <unk> a few years ago .
i found it was at the beginning of last century . "
" what did you say ? "
" i said , <unk> , how interesting ! '
like that .
i 'm not going to push myself forward .
i 've been hearing about mr. <unk> 's efforts in that direction .
and you ?
i could n't see you behind the flowers .
was it very deep water , dear ? "
<name> mopped a brow already browned by outdoor exposures .
" oh no  dead easy , " he answered .
" i 've bought friars pardon to prevent sir <name> 's birds <unk> . "
a cock pheasant <unk> through the dry leaves and exploded almost under their feet .
<name> jumped .
" that 's one of 'em , " said <name> calmly .
" well , your nerves are better , at any rate , " said she .
" did you tell 'em you 'd bought the thing to play with ? "
" no .
that was where my nerve broke down .
i only made one bad break  i think .
i said i could n't see why hiring land to men to farm was n't as much a business proposition as anything else . "
" and what did they say ? "
" they smiled .
i shall know what that smile means some day .
they don't waste their smiles .
d'you see that track by <name> <unk> ? "
they looked down from the edge of the <unk> over a <unk> hollow .
people by twos and threes in their <name> best filed slowly along the paths that connected farm to farm .
" i 've never seen so many on our land before , " said <name> .
" why is it ? "
" to show us we must n't shut up their rights of way . "
" those <unk> we 've been using cross lots ? "
said <name> forcibly .
" yes .
any one of 'em would cost us two thousand pounds each in legal expenses to close . "
" but we do n't want to , " she said .
" the whole community would fight if we did . "
" but it 's our land .
we can do what we like . "
" it 's not our land .
we 've only paid for it .
we belong to it , and it belongs to the people  our people they call 'em .
i 've been to lunch with the english too . "
they passed slowly from one <unk> field to the next  flushed with pride of ownership , plotting alterations and <unk> at each turn ; halting in their tracks to argue , spreading apart to embrace two views at once , or closing in to consider one .
couples moved out of their way , but smiling covertly .
" we shall make some bad breaks , " he said at last .
" together , though .
you wo n't let anyone else in , <name> you ? "
" except the contractors .
this syndicate handles , this proposition by its little lone . "
" but you might feel the want of some one , " she insisted .
" i shall  but it <name> be you .
it 's business , <name> , but it 's going to be good fun . "
" please god , " she answered flushing , and cried to herself as they went back to tea .
" it 's worth it .
oh , it 's worth it . "
the repairing and moving into friars pardon was business of the most varied and searching , but all done english fashion , without friction .
time and money alone were asked .
the rest lay in the hands of beneficent advisers from london , or spirits , male and female , called up by mr. and mrs. cloke from the wastes of the farms .
in the centre stood <name> and <name> , a little aghast , their interests reaching out on every side .
" i ai n't sayin ' anything against <unk> , " said cloke , <unk> clerk of the outer works , consulting engineer , head of the immigration bureau , and superintendent of woods and forests ; " but your own people wo n't go about to make more than a fair profit out of you . "
" how is one to know ? "
said <name> .
" five years from now , or so on , maybe , you 'll be lookin ' over your first year 's accounts , and , knowin ' what you 'll know then , you 'll say : 'well , <name> <unk> '  or old cloke as it might be  'did me proper when i was new . '
no man likes to have that sort of thing laid up against him . "
" i think i see , " said <name> .
" but five years is a long time to look ahead . "
" i doubt if that oak <name> <unk> throwed in <name> 's <unk> <name> be fit for her <unk> floor in less than seven , " cloke drawled .
" yes , that 's my work , " said <name> .
( <name> <unk> of <unk> , a woodman by training and birth , a tenant farmer by misfortune of marriage , had laid his broad axe at her feet a month before . )
" sorry if i 've committed you to another eternity . "
" and we <name> n't even know where we 've gone wrong with your new carriage drive before that time either , " said cloke , ever anxious to keep the balance true with an ounce or two in <name> 's favour .
the past four months had taught <name> better than to reply .
the carriage road winding up the hill was his present keen interest .
they set off to look at it , and the imported american <unk> which had blighted the none too <name> soul of " skim " <unk> , the <name> .
but young iggulden was in charge now , and under his guidance , <unk> and roberts , the great horses , moved mountains .
" you <unk> ' her like that , an ' you tip her like that , " he explained to the gang .
" my uncle he was <unk> in connecticut . "
" are they roads yonder ? "
said skim , sitting under the laurels .
" no better than accommodation roads .
dirt , they call 'em .
they 'd suit you , skim . "
" why ? "
said the <unk> skim .
" cause you 'd take no hurt when you fall out of your cart drunk on a saturday , " was the answer .
" i did n't last time neither , " skim roared .
after the loud laugh , old <unk> of <name> <unk> piped feebly , " well , dirt or no dirt , there 's no <unk> ' <unk> knows a good job when he sees it .
'e do n't build one day and <unk> the next , like that nigger <unk> . "
" she 's the one that knows her own mind , " said <unk> , brother to skim <unk> , and a <name> among <unk> who had helped to bring the grand piano across the fields in the autumn rains .
" she had ought to , " said iggulden .
" whoa , <unk> !
she 's a <unk> .
they never was <unk> . "
" oh , you found that ?
has the answer come from your uncle ? "
said skim , doubtful whether so remote a land as <name> had posts .
the others looked at him scornfully .
skim was always a day behind the fair .
iggulden rested from his labours .
" she 's a <unk> right enough .
i started up to write to my uncle  at once  the month after she said her folks came from <unk> holler . "
" where there ai n't any roads ? "
skim interrupted , but none laughed .
" my uncle he married an american woman for his second , and she took it up like a like the coroner .
she 's a <unk> out of the old <unk> place , 'fore they sold to <unk> .
she ai n't no toot hill <unk> , nor any o ' the <unk> lot .
her folk come out of the ground here , neither chalk nor forest , but <unk> .
they sailed over to <name>  i 've got it all writ down by my uncle 's woman  in eighteen hundred an ' nothing .
my uncle says they 're all slow <unk> like . "
" would they be gentry yonder now ? "
skim asked .
" <unk>  there 's no gentry in <name> , no matter how long you 're there .
it 's against their law .
there 's only <name> and poor allowed .
they've been lawyers and such like over yonder for a hundred years but she 's a <unk> for all that . "
" lord !
what 's a hundred years ? "
said <unk> , who had seen <unk> of them .
" an ' they write too , from yonder  my uncle 's woman writes  that you can still tell 'em by <unk> .
their hair 's <unk> still  an ' they throw out when they walk .
he 's <unk> like a gipsy ; but you watch , an' you 'll see 'er throw , out  like a colt . "
" your trace wants taking up . "
<unk> 's large ears had caught the sound of voices , and as the two broke through the laurels the men were hard at work , their eyes on <name> 's feet .
she had been less fortunate in her inquiries than iggulden , for her aunt <name> of <unk> ( a <unk> and <unk> daughter of the revolution to boot ) answered her inquiries with a <unk> discourse on patriotism , the leaflets of a village improvement society , of which she was president , and a demand for an <unk> subscription to a factory girls ' reading circle .
<name> burned it all in the <unk> and eurydice grate , and kept her own counsel .
" what i want to know , " said <name> , when spring was coming , and the gardens needed thought , " is who <name> ever pay me for my labour ?
i 've put in at least half a million dollars ' worth already . "
" sure you 're not taking too much out of yourself ? "
his wife asked .
" oh , no ; i have n't been conscious of myself all <name> . "
he looked at his brown english gaiters and smiled .
" it 's all behind me now .
i believe i could sit down and think of all that  those months before we sailed . "
" do n't  ah , do n't ! "
she cried .
" but i must go back one day .
you do n't want to keep me out of business always  or do you ? "
he ended with a nervous laugh .
<name> sighed as she <name> her own <unk> ( of old iggulden 's cutting ) from the hall rack .
" are n't you <unk> it too ?
you look a little tired , " he said .
" you make me tired .
i 'm going to <unk> to see mrs. cloke about <name> . "
( this was the sister of the <unk> , promoted to be <unk> at pardons . )
" coming ? "
" i 'm due at burnt house to see about the new well .
by the way , there 's a sore throat at <name> <unk>  " " that 's my province .
do n't interfere .
the <unk> children always have sore throats .
they do it for <unk> . "
" keep away from <name> <unk> till i make sure , <name> .
cloke ought to have told me . "
" these people do n't tell .
have n't you learnt that yet ?
but i 'll obey , me lord .
see you later ! "
she set off afoot , for within the three main roads that bounded the blunt triangle of the estate ( even by night one could scarcely hear the carts on them ) , wheels were not used except for farm work .
the <unk> served all other purposes .
and though at first they had planned improvements , they had soon fallen in with the customs of their hidden kingdom , and moved about the <unk> ways by woodland , <unk> , and shaw as freely as the rabbits .
indeed , for the most part <name> walked bareheaded beneath her helmet of chestnut hair ; but she had been plagued of late by vague <unk> , which she explained to mrs. cloke , who asked some questions .
how it came about <name> never knew , but after a while behold mrs. cloke 's arm was about her waist , and her head was on that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door .
" my dear !
my dear ! "
the elder woman almost sobbed .
" an ' d'you mean to tell me you never suspicioned ?
why  why  where was you ever taught anything at all ?
of course it is .
it 's what we 've been only waitin ' for , all of us .
time and again i 've said to <name>  " she checked herself .
" an' now we shall be as we should be . "
" but  but  but  " <name> whimpered .
" an ' to see you <unk> ' your nest so busy  <unk> and books  an ' never thinkin ' of a nursery ! "
" no more i did . "
<name> sat bolt upright , and began to laugh .
" time enough yet . "
the fingers tapped thoughtfully on the broad knee .
" but  they must be <unk> folk over yonder with you !
have you thought to send for your mother ?
she dead ?
my dear , my dear !
never mind !
she 'll be happy where she knows .
't is god 's work .
an ' we was only waitin ' for it , for you 've never failed in your duty yet .
it ain't your way .
what did you say about my <name> 's doings ? "
mrs. cloke 's face hardened as she pressed her <name> on <name> 's forehead .
" if any of your girls thinks to <unk> arbitrary now , i 'll  but they wo n't , my dear .
i 'll see they do their duty too .
be sure you 'll 'ave no trouble . "
when <name> walked back across the fields heaven and earth changed about her as on the day of old iggulden 's death .
for an instant she thought of the wide turn of the staircase , and the new <unk> paint that no coffin corner could scar , but presently , the shadow passed in a pure wonder and bewilderment that made her reel .
she leaned against one of their new gates and looked over their lands for some other stay .
" well , " she said resignedly , half aloud , " we must try to make him feel that he is n't a third in our party , " and turned the corner that looked over friars pardon , giddy , sick , and faint .
of a sudden the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had never seen it before , <unk> , <unk> , ample , prepared by course of generations for all such things .
as it had steadied her when it lay desolate , so now that it had meaning from their few months of life within , it soothed and promised good .
she went alone and quickly into the hall , and kissed either door-post , whispering : " be good to me .
you know !
you 've never failed in your duty yet . "
when the matter was explained to <name> , he would have sailed at once to their own land , but this <name> forbade .
" i do n't want science , " she said .
" i just want to be loved , and there is n't time for that at home .
besides , " she added , looking out of the window , " it would be desertion . "
<name> was forced to soothe himself with linking friars pardon to the telegraph system of great britain by telephone  three-quarters of a mile of poles , put in by <unk> and a few friends .
one of these was a foreigner from the next parish .
said he when the line was being run : " there 's an old <unk> right in our road .
shall us throw her ? "
" toot hill parish folk , neither <name> nor good luck , god help 'em . "
old <unk> shouted the local proverb from three poles down the line .
" we ai n't goin ' to lay any <unk> to <unk> here not till we know where we are yet awhile .
swing round 'er , swing round ! "
to this day , then , that sudden <unk> in the straight line across the upper pasture remains a mystery to <name> and <name> .
nor can they tell why skim <unk> , who came to his cottage under <unk> shaw most musically drunk at <unk> <unk> of every saturday night , as his father had done before him , sang no more at the bottom of the garden steps , where <name> always feared he would break his neck .
the path was undoubtedly an ancient right of way , and at <unk> p.m. on saturdays skim remembered it was his duty to posterity to keep it open  till mrs. cloke spoke to him once .
she spoke likewise to her daughter <name> , sewing maid at pardons , and to <name> 's best new friend , the <unk> imported london <unk> , who taught <name> to trim hats , and found the country <unk> .
but there was no noise  at no time was there any noise  and when <name> walked abroad she met no one in her path unless she had signified a wish that way .
then they appeared to protest that all was well with them and their children , their chickens , their roofs , their water-supply , and their sons in the police or the railway service .
" but do n't you find it dull , dear ? "
said <name> , loyally doing his best not to worry as the months went by .
" i 've been so busy putting my house in order i have n't had time to think , " said she .
" do you ? "
" no  no .
if i could only be sure of you . "
she turned on the green drawing-room 's couch ( it was empire , not <unk> after all ) , and laid aside a list of linen and blankets .
" it has changed everything , has n't it ? "
she whispered .
" oh , lord , yes .
but i still think if we went back to baltimore  " " and missed our first real summer together .
no thank you , me lord . "
" but we 're absolutely alone . "
" is n't that what i 'm doing my best to remedy ?
do n't you worry .
i like it  like it to the marrow of my little bones .
you do n't realize what her house means to a woman .
we thought we were living in it last year , but we had n't begun to .
do n't you rejoice in your study , <name> ? "
" i prefer being here with you . "
he sat down on the floor by the couch and took her hand .
" seven , " she said , as the french clock struck .
" year before last you'd just be coming back from business . "
he winced at the recollection , then laughed .
" business !
i 've been at work ten solid hours to-day . "
" where did you lunch ?
with the <unk> ? "
" no ; at <unk> shaw , sitting on a log , with my feet in a swamp .
but we 've found out where the old spring is , and we 're going to pipe it down to <name> <unk> next year . "
" i 'll come and see to-morrow .
oh , please open the door , dear .
i want to look down the passage .
is n't that corner by the <unk> lovely where the sun strikes in ? "
she looked through <unk> eyes at the vista of <unk> and pale green all steeped in liquid gold .
" there 's a step out of <name> <unk> 's bedroom , " she went on  " and his first step in the world ought to be up .
i should n't wonder if those people had n't put it there on purpose .
<name> , <name> it make any odds to you if he 's a girl ? "
he answered , as he had many times before , that his interest was his wife , not the child .
" then you 're the only person who thinks so . "
she laughed .
" do n't be silly , dear .
it 's expected .
i know .
it 's my duty .
i <name> n't be able to look our people in the face if i fail . "
" what concern is it of theirs , confound 'em ! "
" you 'll see .
luckily the tradition of the house is boys , mrs. cloke says , so i 'm provided for .
shall you ever begin to understand these people ?
i <name> n't . "
" and we bought it for fun  for fun ! "
he groaned .
" and here we are held up for goodness knows how long ! "
" why ?
were you thinking of selling it ? "
he did not answer .
" do you remember the second mrs .
<unk> ? "
she demanded .
this was a bold , brazen little <unk> woman  a widow for choice  who on <name> 's death was <unk> to marry <name> for his wealth and ruin him in a year .
<name> being busy , <name> had invented her some two years after her marriage , and conceived she was alone among wives in so doing .
" you are n't going to bring her up again ? "
he asked anxiously .
" i only want to say that i should hate any one who bought pardons ten times worse than i used to hate the second mrs. <unk> .
think what we've put into it of our two selves . "
" at least a couple of million dollars .
i know i could have made  " he broke off .
" the beasts ! "
she went on .
" they 'd be sure to build a <unk> lodge at the gates , and cut the lawn up for bedding out .
you must leave instructions in your <name> that he 's never to do that , <name> , won't you ? "
he laughed and took her hand again but said nothing till it was time to dress .
then he muttered " what the devil use is a man 's country to him when he ca n't do business in it ? "
friars pardon stood faithful to its tradition .
at the appointed time was born , not that third in their party to whom <name> meant to be so kind , but a <unk> ; in beauty , it was manifest , <unk> eros , as in wisdom <unk> ; an <unk> of delights , a <unk> of <unk> and an interpreter of <name> .
this last <name> did not realise till he met <name> conant striding through <unk> shaw a few days after the event .
" my dear fellow , " she cried , and slapped him heartily on the back , " i ca n't tell you how glad we all are .
oh , she 'll be all right .
( there's never been any trouble over the birth of an heir at pardons . )
now where the <unk> is it ? "
she felt largely in her <unk> and <name> out a small silver mug .
" i sent a note to your wife about it , but my silly ass of a groom forgot to take this .
you can save me a tramp .
give her my love . "
she marched off amid her guard of grave <unk> .
the mug was worn and <unk> : above the twined initials , <unk> , was the crest of a <unk> bird and the motto : " <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . "
" that 's the other end of the riddle , " <name> whispered , when he saw her that evening .
" read her note .
the english write beautiful notes . "
the warmest of <unk> to your little man .
i <name> he <name> appreciate his native land now he has come to it .
though you have said nothing we can not , of course , look on him as a little stranger , and so i am sending him the old <unk> christening mug .
it has been with us since <name> <unk> , your <unk> 's brother  <name> stared at his wife .
" go on , " she twinkled , from the pillows .
 mother 's brother , sold his place to <name> 's family .
we seem to have acquired some of your household gods at that time , but nothing <unk> except the mug and the old cradle , which i found in the <unk> and am having put in order for you .
i <name> little <name>  <unk> , he <name> be too , wo n't he ?  <name> live to see his grandchildren cut their teeth on his mug .
affectionately yours , <name> conant .
<unk>  how quiet you 've kept about it all !
" well , i 'm  " " do n't swear , " said <name> .
" bad for the infant mind . "
" but how in the world did she get at it ?
have you ever said a word about the <unk> ? "
" you know the only time  to young iggulden at <unk>  when iggulden died . "
" your <unk> 's brother !
she 's traced the whole connection  more than your aunt <name> could do .
what does she mean about our keeping quiet ? "
<name> 's eyes sparkled .
" i 've thought that out too .
we 've got back at the english at last .
ca n't you see that she thought that we thought my mother 's being a <unk> was one of those things we 'd expect the english to find out for themselves , and that 's impressed her ? "
she turned the mug in her white hands , and sighed happily .
" <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . '
that 's not a bad motto , <name> .
it 's been worth it . "
" but still i do n't quite see  " " i should n't wonder if they do n't think our coming here was part of a <unk> scheme to be near our ancestors .
they 'd understand that .
and look how they 've accepted us , all of them . "
" are we so undesirable in ourselves ? "
<name> grunted .
" be just , me lord .
that wretched <unk> man has twice our money .
can you see <unk> conant slapping him between the shoulders ?
not by a <unk> !
the poor beast does n't exist ! "
" do you think it 's that then ? "
he looked toward the cot by the fire where the <unk> snorted .
" the minute i get well i shall find out from mrs. cloke what every <unk> gives in <unk> ( that 's nicer than tips ) every time a <unk> is born .
i 've done my duty thus far , but there 's much expected of me . "
entered here mrs. cloke , and <name> <unk> over the cot .
they showed her the mug and her face shone .
" oh , now <name> conant 's sent it , <unk> be all proper , ma'am , wo n't it ?
<unk> ' of course he 'd have to be , but seein ' what he is we was <unk> '  all your people was <unk> '  it 'ud be <unk> ' too , and <unk> just round it out .
a very <unk> mug quite unique , i should imagine .
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . '
that 's true with the <unk> , i 've heard .
very slow to fill their houses , they are .
most like master <name> wo n't open 'is nursery till he 's thirty . "
" poor lamb ! "
cried <name> .
" but how did you know my folk were <unk> ? "
mrs. cloke thought deeply .
" i 'm sure i ca n't quite say , ma'am , but i've a belief likely that it was something you may have let drop to young iggulden when you was at <unk> .
that may have been what give us an inkling .
an ' so it came out , one thing in the way o ' talk leading to another , and those american people at <unk> holler was very <unk> with news , i 'm told , ma'am . "
" great <name> ! "
said <name> , under his breath .
" and this is the simple peasant ! "
" yiss , " mrs. cloke went on .
" an ' cloke was only <unk> ' this afternoon  your pillow 's slipped my dear , you must n't lie that <unk>  just for the sake o ' sayin ' something , whether you would n't think well now of getting the <unk> farms back , sir .
they do n't rightly round off sir <name> 's estate .
they come <unk> ' across us more .
cloke , 'e 'ud be glad to show you over any day . "
" but sir <name> does n't want to sell , does he ? "
" we can find out from his bailiff , sir , but "  with cold contempt  " i think that trained nurse is just comin ' up from her dinner , so 'm afraid we 'll 'ave to ask you , sir ... now , master <name>  <unk> !
wake a <unk> minute , <unk> ! "
a few months later the three of them were down at the <name> in the <name> <unk> woods to consider the <unk> of a <unk> carried away by spring floods .
<name> <unk> <unk> wanted all the <unk> on god's earth that day to eat , and  <name> adored him in a voice like to the cooing of a dove ; so business was delayed .
" here 's the place , " said his father at last among the water <unk> .
" but where the deuce are the <unk> , cloke ?
i told you to have them down here ready . "
" we 'll get 'em down if f you say so , " cloke answered , with a thrust of the <unk> they both knew .
" but i did say so .
what on earth have you brought that <unk> here for ?
we are n't building a railway bridge .
why , in <name> , half-a-dozen <unk> bits would be ample . "
" i do n't know nothin ' about that , " said cloke .
" an ' i 've nothin ' to say against <unk>  if you want to make a <unk> job of it .
i ai n't 'ere to tell you what is n't so , sir ; an ' you can't say i ever come <unk> ' up on you , or tryin ' to lead you further in than you set out  " a year ago <name> would have danced with impatience .
now he scraped a little mud off his old gaiters with his spud , and waited .
" all i say is that you can put up <unk> and make a <unk> job of it ; and by the time the young master 's married it 'll have to be done again .
now , i 've brought down a couple of as sweet <unk> oak timbers as we 've ever <unk> .
you put 'em in an ' it 's off your mind or good an' all .
t'other way  i do n't say it ai n't right , i 'm only just sayin ' what i think  but t'other way , he 'll no sooner be married than we 'll lave it all to do again .
you 've no call to regard my words , but you ca n't get out of that . "
" no , " said <name> after a pause ; " i 've been <unk> that for some time .
make it oak then ; we ca n't get out of it . "
the recall i am the land of their fathers , in me the virtue stays ; i <name> bring back my children , after certain days .
under their feet in the grasses my clinging magic runs .
they shall return as strangers , they shall remain as sons .
over their heads in the branches of their <unk> , ancient trees , i weave an <unk> , and draw them to my knees .
scent of smoke in the evening , smell of rain in the night , the hours , the days and the seasons order their souls aright ; till i make plain the meaning of all my thousand years till i fill their hearts with knowledge , while i fill their eyes with tears .
garm  a hostage one night , a very long time ago , i drove to an indian military cantonment called mian mir to see amateur theatricals .
at the back of the infantry barracks a soldier , his cap over one eye , rushed in front of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber .
as a matter of fact , he was a friend of mine , so i told him to go home before any one caught him ; but he fell under the pole , and i heard voices of a military guard in search of some one .
the driver and i coaxed him into the carriage , drove home swiftly , undressed him and put him to bed , where he waked next morning with a sore headache , very much ashamed .
when his uniform was cleaned and dried , and he had been shaved and washed and made neat , i drove him back to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling , and reported that i had accidentally run over him .
i did not tell this story to my friend 's sergeant , who was a hostile and <unk> person , but to his lieutenant , who did not know us quite so well .
three days later my friend came to call , and at his heels <unk> and fawned one of the finest <unk>  of the old-fashioned breed , two parts bull and one terrier  that i had ever set eyes on .
he was pure white , with a <unk> saddle just behind his neck , and a <name> <name> at the root of his thin <unk> tail .
i had admired him distantly for more than a year ; and vixen , my own <unk> , knew him too , but did not approve .
" 'e 's for you , " said my friend ; but he did not look as though he liked parting with him .
" nonsense !
that dog 's worth more than most men , <name> , " i said .
" 'e 's that and more .
<unk> ! "
the dog rose on his hind legs , and stood upright for a full minute .
" eyes right ! "
he sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right .
at a sign he rose and barked thrice .
then he shook hands with his right paw and bounded lightly to my shoulder .
here he made himself into a necktie , limp and lifeless , hanging down on either side of my neck .
i was told to pick him up and throw him in the air .
he fell with a howl , and held up one leg .
" part o ' the trick , " said his owner .
" you 're going to die now .
dig yourself your little grave an ' shut your little eye . "
still limping , the dog hobbled to the <unk> , dug a hole and lay down in it .
when told that he was cured , he jumped out , wagging his tail , and whining for applause .
he was put through half-a-dozen other tricks , such as showing how he would hold a man safe ( i was that man , and he sat down before me , his teeth bared , ready to spring ) , and how he would stop eating at the word of command .
i had no more than finished praising him when my friend made a gesture that stopped the dog as though he had been shot , took a piece of <unk> <unk> from his helmet , handed it to me and ran away , while the dog looked after him and howled .
i read : sir  i give you the dog because of what you got me out of .
he is the best i know , for i made him myself , and he is as good as a man .
please do not give him too much to eat , and please do not give him back to me , for i 'm not going to take him , if you <name> keep him .
so please do not try to give him back any more .
i have kept his name back , so you can call him anything and he <name> answer , but please do not give him back .
he can kill a man as easy as anything , but please do not give him too much meat .
he knows more than a man .
vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little <unk> to the <unk> despairing cry , and i was annoyed , for i knew that a man who cares for dogs is one thing , but a man who loves one dog is quite another .
dogs are at the best no more than <unk> <unk> , <unk> , foul <unk> , and unclean by the law of <name> and <name> ; but a dog with whom one lives alone for at least six months in the year ; a free thing , tied to you so strictly by love that without you he <name> not stir or exercise ; a patient , temperate , humorous , wise soul , who knows your moods before you know them yourself , is not a dog under any ruling .
i had vixen , who was all my dog to me ; and i felt what my friend must have felt , at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving it in my garden .
however , the dog understood clearly enough that i was his master , and did not follow the soldier .
as soon as he <name> breath i made much of him , and vixen , yelling with jealousy , flew at him .
had she been of his own sex , he might have cheered himself with a fight , but he only looked <unk> when she nipped his deep iron sides , laid his heavy head on my knee , and howled anew .
i meant to dine at the club that night ; but as darkness <name> in , and the dog snuffed through the empty house like a child trying to recover from a fit of sobbing , i felt that i could not leave him to suffer his first evening alone .
so we fed at home , vixen on one side , and the <unk> on the other ; she watching his every mouthful , and saying <unk> what she thought of his table manners , which were much better than hers .
it was vixen 's custom , till the weather grew hot , to sleep in my bed , her head on the pillow like a <name> ; and when morning came i would always find that the little thing had braced her feet against the wall and pushed me to the very edge of the cot .
this night she hurried to bed <unk> , every hair up , one eye on the stranger , who had dropped on a mat in a helpless , hopeless sort of way , all four feet spread out , sighing heavily .
she settled her head on the pillow several times , to show her little airs and graces , and struck up her usual <unk> sing-song before slumber .
the <unk> softly edged toward me .
i put out my hand and he licked it .
instantly my wrist was between <unk> teeth , and her warning <unk> !
said as plainly as speech , that if i took any further notice of the stranger she would bite .
i caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand , shook her severely , and said : " vixen , if you do that again you 'll be put into the verandah .
now , remember ! "
she understood perfectly , but the minute i released her she <unk> my right wrist once more , and waited with her ears back and all her body flattened , ready to bite .
the big dog 's tail thumped the floor in a humble and <unk> way .
i grabbed vixen a second time , lifted her out of bed like a rabbit ( she hated that and yelled ) , and , as i had promised , set her out in the verandah with the bats and the moonlight .
at this she howled .
then she used coarse language  not to me , but to the <unk>  till she coughed with exhaustion .
then she ran round the house trying every door .
then she went off to the stables and barked as though some one were stealing the horses , which was an old trick of hers .
last she returned , and her snuffing yelp said , " i 'll be good !
let me in and i 'll ' be good ! "
she was admitted and flew to her pillow .
when she was quieted i whispered to the other dog , " you can lie on the foot of the bed . "
the bull jumped up at once , and though i felt vixen quiver with rage , she knew better than to protest .
so we slept till the morning , and they had early breakfast with me , bite for bite , till the horse came round and we went for a ride .
i do n't think the bull had ever followed a horse before .
he was wild with excitement , and vixen , as usual , squealed and <unk> and <unk> , and took charge of the procession .
there was one corner of a village near by , which we generally passed with caution , because all the yellow <unk> of the place gathered about it .
they were half-wild , starving beasts , and though utter cowards , yet where nine or ten of them get together they <name> mob and kill and eat an english dog .
i kept a whip with a long lash for them .
that morning they attacked vixen , who , perhaps of design , had moved from beyond my horse 's shadow .
the bull was ploughing along in the dust , fifty yards behind , rolling in his run , and smiling as <unk> <name> .
i heard vixen squeal ; half a dozen of the curs closed in on her ; a white streak came up behind me ; a cloud of dust rose near vixen , and , when it cleared , i saw one tall pariah with his back broken , and the bull <unk> another to earth .
vixen retreated to the protection of my whip , and the bull paddled back smiling more than ever , covered with the blood of his enemies .
that decided me to call him " garin of the bloody breast , " who was a great person in his time , or " garm " for short ; so , leaning forward , i told him what his temporary name would be .
he looked up while i repeated it , and then raced away .
i shouted " garin ! "
he stopped , raced back , and came up to ask my <name> .
then i saw that my soldier friend was right , and that that dog knew and was worth more than a man .
at the end of the ride i gave an order which vixen knew and hated : " go away and get washed ! "
i said .
garin understood some part of it , and vixen interpreted the rest , and the two trotted off together soberly .
when i went to the back verandah vixen had been washed <unk> , and was very proud of herself , but the <unk> would not touch garm on any account unless i stood by .
so i waited while he was being scrubbed , and garm , with the soap <unk> on the top of his broad head , looked at me to make sure that this was what i expected him to endure .
he knew perfectly that the <unk> was only obeying orders .
" another time , " i said to the <unk> , " you <name> wash the great dog with vixen when i send them home . "
" does he know ? "
said the <unk> , who understood the ways of dogs .
" garm , " i said , " another time you <name> be washed with vixen . "
i knew that garm understood .
indeed , next <unk> , when vixen as usual fled under my bed , garm stared at the doubtful <unk> in the verandah , stalked to the place where he had been washed last time , and stood rigid in the tub .
but the long days in my office tried him sorely .
we three would drive off in the morning at half-past eight and come home at six or later .
vixen knowing the routine of it , went to sleep under my table ; but the confinement ate into garm 's soul .
he generally sat on the verandah looking out on the mall ; and well i knew what he expected .
sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to the fort , and garm rolled forth to inspect them ; or an officer in uniform entered into the office , and it was pitiful to see poor garm 's welcome to the cloth  not the man .
he would leap at him , and sniff and bark joyously , then run to the door and back again .
one afternoon i heard him bay with a full throat  a thing i had never heard before  and he disappeared .
when i drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier in white uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end , and the garm that met me was a joyous dog .
this happened twice or thrice a week for a month .
i pretended not to notice , but garm knew and vixen knew .
he would glide <unk> from the office about four o'clock , as though he were only going to look at the scenery , and this he did so quietly that but for vixen i should not have noticed him .
the jealous little dog under the table would give a sniff and a snort , just loud enough to call my attention to the flight .
garm might go out forty times in the day and vixen would never stir , but when he slunk off to see his true master in my garden she told me in her own tongue .
that was the one sign she made to prove that garm did not altogether belong to the family .
they were the best of friends at all times , but , vixen explained that i was never to forget garm did not love me as she loved me .
i never expected it .
the dog was not my dog could never be my dog  and i knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped eight miles a day to see him .
so it seemed to me that the sooner the two were <unk> the better for all .
one afternoon i sent vixen home alone in the dog-cart ( garm had gone before ) , and rode over to cantonments to find another friend of mine , who was an <name> soldier and a great friend of the <unk> master .
i explained the whole case , and wound up with : " and now <name> 's in my garden crying over his dog .
why does n't he take him back ?
they 're both unhappy . "
" unhappy !
there 's no sense in the little man any more .
but 't is his fit . "
" what is his fit ?
he travels fifty miles a week to see the brute , and he pretends not to notice me when he sees me on the road ; and i 'm as unhappy as he is .
make him take the dog back . "
" it 's his penance he 's set himself .
i told him by way of a joke , afther you 'd run over him so convenient that night , whin he was drunk  i said if he was a catholic he 'd do penance .
off he went wid that fit in his little head an ' a dose of fever , an nothin ' would suit but givin ' you the dog as a hostage . "
" hostage for what ?
i do n't want hostages from <name> . "
" for his good behaviour .
he 's keepin ' straight now , the way it 's no pleasure to associate wid him . "
" has he taken the pledge ? "
" if 't was only that i need not care .
ye can take the pledge for three months on an ' off .
he sez he 'll never see the dog again , an ' so <name> you , he 'll keep straight for evermore .
ye know his fits ?
well , this is <name> of them .
how 's the dog takin ' it ? "
" like a man .
he 's the best dog in <name> .
ca n't you make <name> take him back ? "
" i can do no more than i have done .
but ye know his fits .
he 's just doin ' his penance .
what <name> he do when he goes to the hills ?
the doctor 's put him on the list . "
it is the custom in <name> to send a certain number of invalids from each regiment up to stations in the himalayas for the hot weather ; and though the men ought to enjoy the cool and the comfort , they miss the society of the barracks down below , and do their best to come back or to avoid going .
i felt that this move would bring matters to a head , so i left <name> hopefully , though he called after me " he wo n't take the dog , sorr .
you can lay your month 's pay on that .
ye know his fits . "
i never pretended to understand private ortheris ; and so i did the next best thing i left him alone .
that summer the invalids of the regiment to which my friend belonged were ordered off to the hills early , because the doctors thought marching in the cool of the day would do them good .
their route lay south to a place called umballa , a hundred and twenty miles or more .
then they would turn east and march up into the hills to <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
i dined with the officers the night before they left  they were marching at five in the morning .
it was midnight when i drove into my garden , and surprised a white figure flying over the wall .
" that man , " said my butler , " has been here since nine , making talk to that dog .
he is quite mad . "
" i did not tell him to go away because he has been here many times before , and because the <unk> told me that if i told him to go away , that great dog would immediately slay me .
he did not wish to speak to the protector of the poor , and he did not ask for anything to eat or drink . "
" kadir <unk> , " said i , " that was well done , for the dog would surely have killed thee .
but i do not think the white soldier <name> come any more . "
garm slept ill that night and whimpered in his dreams .
once he sprang up with a clear , ringing bark , and i heard him wag his tail till it waked him and the bark died out in a howl .
he had dreamed he was with his master again , and i nearly cried .
it was all <name> 's silly fault .
the first halt which the detachment of invalids made was some miles from their barracks , on the amritsar road , and ten miles distant from my house .
by a mere chance one of the officers drove back for another good dinner at the club ( cooking on the line of march is always bad ) , and there i met him .
he was a particular friend of mine , and i knew that he knew how to love a dog properly .
his pet was a big fat retriever who was going up to the hills for his health , and , though it was still <name> , the round , brown brute puffed and panted in the club verandah as though he would burst .
" it 's amazing , " said the officer , " what excuses these invalids of mine make to get back to barracks .
there 's a man in my company now asked me for leave to go back to cantonments to pay a debt he 'd forgotten .
i was so taken by the idea i let him go , and he jingled off in an ekka as pleased as punch .
ten miles to pay a debt !
wonder what it was really ? "
" if you 'll drive me home i think i can show you , " i said .
so he went over to my house in his dog-cart with the retriever ; and on the way i told him the story of garm .
" i was wondering where that brute had gone to .
he 's the best dog in the regiment , " said my friend .
" i offered the little fellow twenty rupees for him a month ago .
but he 's a hostage , you say , for <name> 's good conduct .
<name> 's one of the best men i have when he chooses . "
" that 's the reason why , " i said .
" a second-rate man would n't have taken things to heart as he has done . "
we drove in quietly at the far end of the garden , and crept round the house .
there was a place close to the wall all grown about with <unk> trees , where i knew garm kept his bones .
even vixen was not allowed to sit near it .
in the full indian moonlight i could see a white uniform bending over the dog .
" good-bye , old man , " we could not help hearing <name> 's voice .
" for <unk> 's sake do n't get bit and go mad by any measly <unk> .
but you can look after yourself , old man .
you do n't get drunk an ' run about <unk> your friends .
you takes your bones an ' you eats your biscuit , an ' you kills your enemy like a gentleman .
i 'm goin ' away  do n't <unk>  i 'm goin' off to <unk> , where i wo n't see you no more . "
i could hear him holding garm 's nose as the dog threw it up to the stars .
" you 'll stay here an ' <unk> , an '  an ' i 'll go away an ' try to <unk> , an ' i do n't know 'ow to leave you .
i do n't know  " " i think this is damn silly , " said the officer , patting his foolish <unk> old retriever .
he called to the private , who leaped to his feet , marched forward , and saluted .
" you here ? "
said the officer , turning away his head .
" yes , sir , but i 'm just goin ' back . "
" i shall be leaving here at eleven in my cart .
you come with me .
i can't have sick men running about fall over the place .
report yourself at eleven , here . "
we did not say much when we went indoors , but the officer muttered and pulled his retriever 's ears .
he was a disgraceful , <unk> <unk> of a dog ; and when he <unk> off to my <unk> to be fed , i had a brilliant idea .
at eleven o'clock that officer 's dog was nowhere to be found , and you never heard such a fuss as his owner made .
he called and shouted and grew angry , and hunted through my garden for half an hour .
then i said : " he 's sure to turn up in the morning .
send a man in by rail , and i'll find the beast and return him . "
" beast ? "
said the officer .
" i value that dog considerably more than i value any man i know .
it 's all very fine for you to talk  your <unk> here . "
so she was  under my feet  and , had she been missing , food and wages would have stopped in my house till her return .
but some people grow fond of dogs not worth a cut of the whip .
my friend had to drive away at last with <name> in the back seat ; and then the <unk> said to me : " what kind of animal is <unk> sahib 's dog ?
look at him ! "
i went to the boy 's hut , and the fat old <unk> was lying on a mat carefully chained up .
he must have heard his master calling for twenty minutes , but had not even attempted to join him .
" he has no face , " said the <unk> scornfully .
" he is a <unk> ( a spaniel ) .
he never tried to get that cloth off his jaws when his master called .
now <unk> would have jumped through the window , and that great dog would have slain me with his <unk> mouth .
it is true that there are many kinds of dogs . "
next evening who should turn up but <name> .
the officer had sent him back fourteen miles by rail with a note begging me to return the retriever if i had found him , and , if i had not , to offer huge rewards .
the last train to camp left at half-past ten , and <name> , stayed till ten talking to garm .
i argued and entreated , and even threatened to shoot the <unk> , but the little man was as firm as a rock , though i gave him a good dinner and talked to him most severely .
garm knew as well as i that this was the last time he could <name> to see his man , and followed <name> like a shadow .
the retriever said nothing , but licked his lips after his meal and <unk> off without so much as saying " thank you " to the disgusted <unk> .
so that last meeting was over , and i felt as wretched as garm , who moaned in his sleep all night .
when we went to the office he found a place under the table close to vixen , and dropped flat till it was time to go home .
there was no more running out into the verandahs , no <unk> away for stolen talks with <name> .
as the weather grew warmer the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart , but sat at my side on the seat , vixen with her head under the crook of my left elbow , and garm hugging the left <unk> .
here vixen was ever in great form .
she had to attend to all the moving traffic , such as <unk> that blocked the way , and camels , and led ponies ; as well as to keep up her dignity when she passed low friends running in the dust .
she never <unk> for <unk> 's sake , but her shrill , high bark was known all along the mall , and other men 's terriers <unk> in reply , and <unk> looked over their shoulders and gave us the road with a grin .
but garm cared for none of these things .
his big eyes were on the horizon and his terrible mouth was shut .
there was another dog in the office who belonged to my chief .
we called him " <name> the librarian , " because he always imagined vain rats behind the <unk> , and in hunting for them would drag out half the old <unk> .
<name> was a well-meaning idiot , but garm did not encourage him .
he would slide his head round the door panting , " rats !
come along garm ! "
and garm would shift one <unk> over the other , and curl himself round , leaving <name> to whine at a most <unk> back .
the office was nearly as cheerful as a tomb in those days .
once , and only once , did i see garm at all contented with his surroundings .
he had gone for an <unk> walk with vixen early one <name> morning , and a very young and foolish <unk> ( his battery had just moved to that part of the world ) tried to steal them both .
vixen , of course , knew better than to take food from soldiers , and , besides , she had just finished her breakfast .
so she trotted back with a large piece of the mutton that they issue to our troops , laid it down on my verandah , and looked up to see what i thought .
i asked her where garin was , and she ran in front of the horse to show me the way .
about a mile up the road we came across our <unk> sitting very stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on his knees .
garin was in front of him , looking rather pleased .
when the man moved leg or hand , garin bared his teeth in silence .
a broken string <name> from his collar , and the other half of , it lay , all warm , in the <unk> 's still hand .
he explained to me , keeping his eyes straight in front of him , that he had met this dog ( he called him awful names ) walking alone , and was going to take him to the fort to be killed for a <unk> pariah .
i said that garin did not seem to me much of a pariah , but that he had better take him to the fort if he thought best .
he said he did not care to do so .
i told him to go to the fort alone .
he said he did not want to go at that hour , but would follow my advice as soon as i had called off the dog .
i instructed garin to take him to the fort , and garm marched him solemnly up to the gate , one mile and a half under a hot sun , and i told the <unk> what had happened ; but the young <unk> was more angry than was at all necessary when they began to laugh .
several regiments , he was told , had tried to steal garm in their time .
that month the hot weather shut down in <name> , and the dogs slept in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is placed .
every morning , as soon as the man filled my bath the two jumped in , and every morning the man filled the bath a second time .
i said to him that he might as well fill a small tub specially for the dogs .
" nay , " said he smiling , " it is not their custom .
they would not understand .
besides , the big bath gives them more space . "
the <unk> who pull the <unk> day and night came to know garin intimately .
he noticed that when the swaying fan stopped i would call out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke .
if the man still slept i would wake him up .
he discovered , too , that it was a good thing to lie in the wave of air under the punkah .
maybe <name> had taught him all about this in barracks .
at any rate , when the punkah stopped , garin would first growl and cock his eye at the rope , and if that did not wake the man it nearly always did  he would tiptoe forth and talk in the sleeper 's ear .
vixen was a clever little dog , but she could never connect the punkah and the coolie ; so garin gave me grateful hours of cool sleep .
but  he was utterly wretched  as miserable as a human being ; and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it , and were envious .
if i moved from one room to another garin followed ; if my pen stopped scratching , garm 's head was thrust into my hand ; if i turned , half awake , on the pillow , garm was up and at my side , for he knew that i was his only link with his master , and day and night , and night and day , his eyes asked one question  " when is this going to end ? "
living with the dog as i did , i never noticed that he was more than ordinarily upset by the hot weather , till one day at the club a man said : " that dog of yours <name> die in a week or two .
he 's a shadow . "
then i dosed garin with iron and quinine , which he hated ; and i felt very anxious .
he lost his appetite , and vixen was allowed to eat his dinner under his eyes .
even that did not make him swallow , and we held a consultation on him , of the best <unk> in the place ; a <unk> , who cured the sick wives of kings ; and the deputy <unk> of the veterinary service of all <name> .
they pronounced upon his symptoms , and i told them his story , and garm lay on a sofa licking my hand .
" he 's dying of a broken heart , " said the <unk> suddenly .
" 'pon my word , " said the deputy inspector general , " i believe mrs. <unk> is perfectly right as usual . "
the best <unk> in the place wrote a prescription , and the veterinary deputy <unk> went over it afterwards to be sure that the drugs were in the proper <unk> ; and that was the first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his <unk> to be edited .
it was a strong tonic , and it put the dear boy on his feet for a week or two ; then he lost flesh again .
i asked a man i knew to take him up to the hills with him when he went , and the man came to the door with his <name> packed on the top of the carriage .
garin took in the situation at one red glance .
the hair rose along his back ; he sat down in front of me and delivered the most awful growl i have ever heard in the jaws of a dog .
i shouted to my friend to get away at once , and as soon as the carriage was out of the garden garin laid his head on my knee and whined .
so i knew his answer , and devoted myself to getting <name> 's address in the hills .
my turn to go to the cool came late in <name> .
we were allowed thirty days ' holiday in a year , if no one fell sick , and we took it as we could be spared .
my chief and <name> the librarian had their holiday first , and when they were gone i made a calendar , as i always did , and <name> it up at the head of my cot , tearing off one day at a time till they returned .
vixen had gone up to the hills with me five times before ; and she appreciated the cold and the damp and the beautiful wood fires there as much as i did .
" garm , " i said , " we are going back to <name> at <unk> .
<unk>  <name> ; <name> <unk> . "
and i repeated it twenty times .
it was not <unk> really , but another place .
still i remembered what <name> had said in my garden on the last night , and i dared not change the name .
then garm began to tremble ; then he barked ; and then he leaped up at me , <unk> and wagging his tail .
" not now , " i said , holding up my hand .
" when i say 'go , ' we 'll go , garm . "
i pulled out the little blanket coat and spiked collar that vixen always wore up in the hills to protect her against sudden chills and <unk> <unk> , and i let the two smell them and talk it over .
what they said of course i do not know ; but it made a new dog of garm .
his eyes were bright ; and he barked joyfully when i spoke to him .
he ate his food , and he killed his rats for the next three weeks , and when he began to whine i had only to say " <name>  <unk> ; <unk>  <name> , " to wake him up .
i wish i had thought of it before .
my chief came back , all brown with living in the open air , and very angry at finding it so hot in the plains .
that same afternoon we three and kadir <unk> began to pack for our month 's holiday , vixen rolling in and out of the <unk> twenty times a minute , and garm grinning all over and thumping on the floor with his tail .
vixen knew the routine of travelling as well as she knew my office-work .
she went to the station , singing songs , on the front seat of the carriage , while garin sat with me .
she hurried into the railway carriage , saw kadir <unk> make up my bed for the night , got her drink of water , and curled up with her <unk> eye on the tumult of the platform .
garin followed her ( the crowd gave him a <name> all to himself ) and sat down on the pillows with his eyes blazing , and his tail a haze behind him .
we came to umballa in the hot <name> <name> , four or five men , who had been working hard fox eleven months , shouting for our <unk>  the <unk> travelling carriages that were to take us up to kalka at the foot of the hills .
it was all new to garm .
he did not understand carriages where you lay at full length on your bedding , but vixen knew and hopped into her place at once ; garin following .
the kalka road , before the railway was built , was about forty-seven miles long , and the horses were changed every eight miles .
most of them <unk> , and kicked , and plunged , but they had to go , and they went rather better than usual for garm 's deep bay in their rear .
there was a river to be forded , and four bullocks pulled the carriage , and vixen stuck her head out of the <unk> and nearly fell into the water while she gave directions .
garin was silent and curious , and rather needed reassuring about <name> and <unk> .
so we rolled , barking and yelping , into kalka for lunch , and garm ate enough for two .
after kalka the road wound among the hills , and we took a <unk> with <unk> ponies , which were changed every six miles .
no one dreamed of a railroad to simla in those days , for it was seven thousand feet up in the air .
the road was more than fifty miles long , and the regulation pace was just as fast as the ponies could go .
here , again , vixen led garm from one carriage to the other ; jumped into the back seat , and shouted .
a cool breath from the snows met us about five miles out of kalka , and she whined for her coat , wisely fearing a chill on the liver .
i had had one made for garm too , and , as we climbed to the fresh breezes , i put it on , and arm chewed it <unk> , but i think he was grateful .
" <unk> ! "
sang vixen as we shot round the curves ; " <unk> ! "
went the driver 's bugle at the dangerous places , and " yow !
yow ! "
<unk> garm .
kadir <unk> sat on the front seat and smiled .
even he was glad to get away from the heat of the plains that <unk> in the haze behind us .
now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work again , and he would say : " what 's it like below ? "
and i would shout : " hotter than cinders .
what 's it like up above ? "
and he would shout back : " just perfect ! "
and away we would go .
suddenly kadir <unk> said , over his shoulder : " here is solon " ; and garm snored where he lay with his head on my knee .
solon is an unpleasant little cantonment , but it has the advantage of being cool and healthy .
it is all bare and <name> , and one generally stops at a <unk> nearby for something to eat .
i got out and took both dogs with me , while kadir <unk> made tea .
a soldier told , us we should find <name> " out there , " nodding his head towards a bare , bleak hill .
when we climbed to the top we spied that very <name> , who had given me all this trouble , sitting on a rock with his face in his hands , and his overcoat hanging loose about him .
i never saw anything so lonely and dejected in my life as this one little man , crumpled up and thinking , on the great gray hillside .
here garm left me .
he departed without a word , and , so far as i could see , without moving his legs .
he flew through the air bodily , and i heard the whack of him as he flung himself at <name> , knocking the little man clean over .
they rolled on the ground together , shouting , and yelping , and hugging .
i could not see which was dog and which was man , till <name> got up and whimpered .
he told me that he had been suffering from fever at intervals , and was very weak .
he looked all he said , but even while i watched , both man and dog <unk> out to their natural sizes , precisely as dried apples swell in water .
garin was on his shoulder , and his breast and feet all at the same time , so that <name> spoke all through a cloud of garin  <unk> , sobbing , <unk> garm .
he did not say anything that i could understand , except that he had fancied he was going to die , but that now he was quite well , and that he was not going to give up garin any more to anybody under the rank of <unk> .
then he said he felt hungry , and thirsty , and happy .
we went down to tea at the <unk> , where <name> stuffed himself with sardines and raspberry jam , and beer , and cold mutton and pickles , when garm was n't climbing over him ; and then vixen and i went on .
garm saw how it was at once .
he said good-bye to me three times , giving me both paws one after another , and leaping on to my shoulder .
he further escorted us , singing <unk> at the top of his voice , a mile down the road .
then he raced back to his own master .
vixen never opened her mouth , but when the cold twilight came , and we could see the lights of simla across the hills , she <unk> with her nose at the breast of my ulster .
i <unk> it , and tucked her inside .
then she gave a contented little sniff , and fell fast asleep , her head on my breast , till we bundled out at simla , two of the four happiest people in all the world that night .
the power of the dog there is sorrow enough in the natural way from men and women to fill our day ; but when we are certain of sorrow in store , why do we always arrange for more ?
brothers and sisters , i bid you beware of giving your heart to a dog to tear .
buy a pup and your money <name> buy love unflinching that can not lie  perfect passion and worship fed by a kick in the ribs or a <name> on the head .
